<p>In some experimental models, phloridzin exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity. Sowa et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] observed that extracts of 
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic> leaves (containing a large amount of phloridzin) had antibacterial and antifungal activity by the inhibition of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and the fungus 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>. Lopes et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] found that phloridzin was effective in inhibiting biofilm formation in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains, which increased efflux protein genes. Oleszek et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] reported that extracts of apple pomace (fraction containing phloridzin) had antifungal activity by the inhibition of mycotoxigenic fungal growth.
