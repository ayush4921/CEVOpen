<p>Phloridzin improved hyperglycemia without altering insulin secretion in diabetic rats [

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], because it could inhibit intestinal glucose uptake via sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs) and similarly control renal glucose reabsorption [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Malatiali et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] reported that phloridzin induced normalization of blood glucose and prevented proteinuria, hyperfiltration and kidney hypertrophy, but not glomerular hypertrophy, in diabetic rats. Masumoto et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found that dietary phloridzin decreased the overexpression of SGLT1, cytochrome P450 2b10 (Cyp2b10) and epoxide hydrolase 1 (Ephx1) in the small intestine of diabetic mice and, accordingly, improved abnormal elevations in blood glucose levels. Osorio et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported that phloridzin treatment reduced hyperglycemia, normalized hypertension and inhibited SGLT2 activity but did not modify SGLT2 expression in brush border membrane vesicles. Kobori et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] revealed that dietary phloridzin significantly suppressed blood glucose levels, however, high continuous intakes of phloridzin reduced hepatic gene expressions related to metabolism, such as the citrate cycle, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism and branched chain amino acid metabolism in healthy mice. Najafian et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] reported that phloridzin not only reduced blood glucose levels, but also improved lipid metabolism in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Makarova et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] demonstrated that unripe apple preparation containing phloridzin reduced postprandial glycemia and improved the health of diabetic patients. Mei et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] found that phloridzin normalized the hyperglycemia of type 2 diabetes (db/db) mice by a decrease in serum lipopolysaccharides and gut microbiota changes. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] reported that phloridzin accelerated liver glycogen synthesis, decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and had hypoglycemic effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus mice. Lv et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported that phloridzin from tea crabapple (
 <italic>Malus hupehensis</italic>) had a significant concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on Î±-glucosidase in vitro.
