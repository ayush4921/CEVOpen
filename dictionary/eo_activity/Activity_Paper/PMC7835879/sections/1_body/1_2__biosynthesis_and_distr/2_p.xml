<p>Phloridzin is a member of the chalcone class of organic compounds and is mainly distributed in the plants of the 
 <italic>Malus</italic> genus, although other plant species are described as containing phloridzin (
 <xref rid="ijms-22-00962-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In humans, phloridzin is involved in lactose degradation. In addition, phloridzin is usually detected in higher concentrations in some foods, such as Mexican oregano, European plums and apples, while in pomegranates and apricots, it is found in lower concentrations. Phloridzin has also been found in several other foods such as epazotes, durians, Chinese broccoli, sesame and sweet potatoes. This could make phloridzin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods.
