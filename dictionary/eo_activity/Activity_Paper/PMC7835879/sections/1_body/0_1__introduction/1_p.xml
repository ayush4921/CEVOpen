<p>Natural products, especially from medicinal plants or herbs, have played a key role in human health and welfare. According to their chemical structures, they are usually classified as polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids, lignans, stilbenes, phenolic acids), alkaloids, sterols, terpenoids, polysaccharides and so on. These diverse phytochemical groups exhibit an extensive range of human health benefits, and are important sources of useful bioactive compounds. In fact, some of them have been taken as lead compounds for structural modifications or developed as modern clinical drugs. In addition, plant-based foods provide us with essential nutrients and contribute to a remarkable portion of our daily diets, including fruits, vegetables, beans, grains and nuts. Extensive studies have demonstrated that these diets are rich in dietary phytochemicals, which are recognized for their health benefits or medicinal properties as nutraceuticals. Recently, more and more people wish to consume the foods containing nutraceuticals for the improvement of the quality of human life and with the desired health potentials rather than to take medicine for illness prevention.</p>
