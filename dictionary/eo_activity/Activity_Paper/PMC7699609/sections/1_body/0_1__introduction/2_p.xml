<p>Undoubtedly, whenever new antimicrobial compounds would be discovered, their use will result in selective pressures, probably leading targeted bacteria to develop a resistance to these agents. This likely outcome stirs researchers to consider other strategies, notably based on the search for original compounds that impair virulence expression mechanisms and/or biofilm formation without affecting bacterial viability [

 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Striking such targets will likely impact invasion capabilities and aggressiveness of bacteria, as well as their ability to build protective barriers against host immune defenses or antibiotics; all the while, selective pressure would be minimized [
