<p>From an estimated African biodiversity of ~45,000 plant species, only 5000 have documented medicinal use [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The list of drugs provided by the African flora appears quite short (less than 100 active compounds) [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] compared with those from other traditional medical systems such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (more than 2000 active compounds from Chinese herbal) [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting an unrivalled opportunity for the discovery of new drugs. The present review aims to report on African plants raw extracts and isolated natural compounds with antivirulence properties against particular pathogenic bacteria. As a prerequisite, and to better document these potential antivirulence activities, the first sections of this paper provide an overview of bacterial virulence mechanisms, biofilm formation processes, and their regulation via QS mechanisms. The possible contribution of such antivirulence agents for an efficient control of infective bacteria is also discussed. The literature has been collected from electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect until August 2020, using relevant keywords including “african medicinal plants, extracts, natural products, virulence, quorum quenching, quorum sensing, biofilm”, and their combination.
