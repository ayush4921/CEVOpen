<p>The flavonol epicatechin isolated from 
 <italic>Ficus sansibarica</italic> Warb. (Moraceae), collected in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, reduces the adhesion to polystyrene surfaces of Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 up to 15% at 3.4 mM [
 <xref rid="B67-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Several active fractions containing flavonoid-like compounds, obtained from the bark of 
 <italic>Combretum albiflorum</italic> (Tul.) Jongkind, (Combretaceae), a Madagascar endemic plant [
 <xref rid="B73-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], were found to inhibit the production of QS-regulated extracellular virulence factors (violacein in 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> CV026 and pyocyanin in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1) [
 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Among these flavonoids, the flavan-3-ol catechin, at 4 mM in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, had a negative impact on the production of violacein (75% inhibition), pyocyanin (50% inhibition), elastase (30% of inhibition), on biofilm formation (30% inhibition), and on the transcription of several QS-related genes (i.e., 
 <italic>lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, lasB,</italic> and 
 <italic>rhlA</italic>). Intriguingly, synthetic epicatechin reduces the 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> production of pyocyanin (50% inhibition) and elastase (30% inhibition) without effect on biofilm formation.
