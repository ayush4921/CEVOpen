<p>So far, however, it should be acknowledged that the discovery of QS modulators has not yet led to major therapeutic breakthroughs; also, QS systems do not control the totality of virulence factors expression and the development of anti-QS bacterial resistance cannot be excluded [

Indeed, according to in vitro experiments, the combination of antibiotics and antivirulence (e.g., cassipourol) agents has already demonstrated its potential and about 33 compounds or agents, mainly from synthetic origin, that target virulence factors are under way for preclinical investigations, most of them focusing on
