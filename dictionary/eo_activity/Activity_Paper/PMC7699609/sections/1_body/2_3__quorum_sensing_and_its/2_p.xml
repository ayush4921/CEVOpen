<p>For a better understanding, the QS circuitries of the well-studied systems of human pathogen bacteria (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) and phytopathogen 
 <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> are succinctly developed in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-09-00830">supplementary materials (Text S1)</xref>. Overall, the tight modulation of QS systems controlling the production of virulence factor and the attachment process/biofilm formation is a key component of invasion process and bacterial infection success (
