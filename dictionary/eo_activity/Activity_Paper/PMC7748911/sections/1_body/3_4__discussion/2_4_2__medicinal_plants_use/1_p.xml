<p>Most of the respondents in the present ethnobotanical survey mentioned medicinal plants belonging to the Fabaceae, Celastraceae, and Rubiaceae families. In other reports on the medicinal plants used for the treatment of hypertension, members of these families are often reported alongside with the Asteraceae and Rutaceae for use in the phytotherapy of various diseases including hypertension [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>–
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In this study, the regular mention of the Fabaceae family is in agreement with previous reports on the plants used to manage hypertension [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>–
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. This study also confirmed that the Fabaceae family is one of the plant families that is highly represented in the study area. The higher percentage usage of the roots and leaves is not uncommon and has been reported to be the preparation of herbal recipes in many other traditional medicines [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The reported findings in this study on the high frequency of leaves' use could be related to their visibility and ease of collection. The preparation of the leaves and roots in ground form for drinking is in agreement with surveys carried out in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], Cameroon [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], and South Africa [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] suggesting that this is a common practice in traditional medicine. Most traditional healers may consider medicines that are milled in a mortar to a powder to be more efficient, as the powdered form of the plant material enhances the extraction of the active ingredients. Improved extraction efficiency from a powder may be due to a specific increase in the surface area of powdered particles that improves extraction of the medicinally important plant compounds. The predominance of trees to shrubs and herbs is similar to the survey in Botswana [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] and contrasts with the results of a survey in parts of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa where the commonly used plant is a herb [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, 
 <italic>Elaeodendron transvaalense</italic> and 
 <italic>Tabernaemontana elegans</italic> frequently used in this study have never been reported in an ethnobotanical survey or investigated for the treatment of hypertension. However, 
 <italic>Elephantorrhiza elephantina</italic> is part of the treatment regimen used by the Bapedi people for treating hypertension [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. 
 <italic>Elaeodendron transvaalense</italic> is also used in traditional medicine by the Vhavenda people of South Africa in the treatment of stomach ailments, cancer, diarrhoea, coughs, herpes, skin infections, inflammations, rashes, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases. A report has indicated the extraction from 
 <italic>E. transvaalense</italic> of three triterpenoids lup-20(30)-ene-3
 <italic>α</italic>,29-diol, lup-20(29)-ene-30-hydroxy-3-one, and 
 <italic>Ψ</italic>–taraxastanonol together with some polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Extracts of the plant 
 <italic>Tabernaemontana elegans</italic> are used as to wash wounds, treat heart and pulmonary diseases, chest pains, and cancer, and have been reported to contain monoterpene bisindole alkaloids, such as tabernaemontanine, dregamine, 16-epidregamine, tabernaelegantine C, tabernaelegantinine B, voacangine, and vobasine. In addition, the alkaloids from 
 <italic>T. elegans</italic> have been reported to induce apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells and show antimicrobial activity [
