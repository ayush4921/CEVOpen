<p>Traditional knowledge is sacred and is jealously guided. As a result, the Vhavenda people of South Africa have developed their own traditional way of treating hypertension. The present survey documented medicinal plants belonging to 30 families that are used for the treatment of hypertension and other diseases. Since the traditional healers in the study area use combinations of plants to treat hypertension, the efficacy of the treatment may be due to an ability to treat a broad spectrum of conditions such as bacterial infection, malaria, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This efficacy, together with the beneficial interaction between the healer and patient, may result in a psychosomatic improvement in the patient that combines to reduce blood pressure. However, according to the literature review, most of these plants have not been reported or investigated for their antihypertensive activity. This study will assist in the identification of useful plants. Also, these plants need to be investigated and their bioactive compounds isolated, to contribute to the discovery of new, effective, and affordable antihypertensive drugs.</p>
