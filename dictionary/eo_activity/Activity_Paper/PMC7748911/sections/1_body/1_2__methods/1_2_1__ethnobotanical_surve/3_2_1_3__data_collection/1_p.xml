<p>Since high blood pressure is a common health problem in the study area, the traditional healers were not asked for information on their diagnostic criteria. The survey was conducted during January and October 2019 and involved conducting face-to-face interviews with each respondentâ€”in the local dialect where the respondent answered 12 open-end questions so that the researcher could collate demographic details of the traditional healers as well as the plants that they used to manage hypertension. The demographic information about each respondent included their age, gender, educational background, and locality. The information about the plants includes the vernacular names of the plants, parts used, methods of preparation of the recipes, route of administration, dosage, duration of treatment, and the management of other diseases for which the plants are used. The study relied on the recommendations of the headman, who identified the traditional healers and other qualified respondents.</p>
