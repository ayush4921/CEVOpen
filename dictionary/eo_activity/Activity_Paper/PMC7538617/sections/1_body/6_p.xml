<p>Many medicinal plants do not enter the blood after they are taken orally, growing evidence suggest the role of the gut microbiota as targets for the multifunctional role of medicinal plants for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). There are three research articles focused on the changing characteristics of gut microbiota to elucidate the mechanisms of medicinal plants in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

 <italic>Naoxintong</italic> capsule, a Chinese medicine, increased the diversity of gut microbiota, influenced the microbiome structure and composition stably, and revered the increase of the ratio of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in relative abundance, inhibited the development of cardiovascular diseases by ameliorating high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders and partly through improving gut microbiota.
