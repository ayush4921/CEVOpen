 <sub>2</sub> is structurally identical to realgar (
 <italic>Manashila</italic>) among the three distinct As
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> polymorphs [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and identified as a promising drug for cancer treatments [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Realgar has been used as an ingredient in Chinese Traditional Medicine for many centuries and some of the Realgar contained in

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Other two polymorphs are orpiment (haritala) and white arsenic (gouripasana) with chemical structures of As
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub> and As
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Some of the therapeutic uses of three As
