<p>Sri Lanka has its own indigenous scheme of healing systems including Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and traditional medicine. Sri Lankan traditional medical system is based on a series of prescriptions handed from generation to generation over 3000 years [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Herbo-mineral therapies are very popular in traditional medical systems of Sri Lanka specially for diseases which are related to neuromuscular disorders, malnutrition, different types of fever, and worm and digestive tract disorders, and herbo-mineral formulations consist of specific minerals (e.g., mica, realgar (As
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>), orpiment (As
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub>), chalk (CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>), salts (NaCl or KCl), magnetite (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>), pyrite (FeS
 <sub>2</sub>), etc.) [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], copper [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and iron [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] exhibit many therapeutic benefits in humans. However, excess amounts of these metals may exhibit toxic effects. Therefore, metals/minerals present in herbo-mineral formulations should be subjected to purification/detoxification and/or incineration procedures.
