<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03781-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the crude extract, fractions F
 <sub>1</sub> and F
 <sub>3</sub> displayed the highest antiparasitic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 14.2 μg/mL, 18.5 μg/mL, and 15.6 μg/mL, respectively. The pentamidine used as reference had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.003 μM. The antiprotozoal potential of lupeol (
