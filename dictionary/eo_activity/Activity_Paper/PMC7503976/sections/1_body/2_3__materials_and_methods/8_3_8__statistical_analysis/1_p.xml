<p>The collected data were entered on an Excel spreadsheet and statistical analysis was undertaken using the SPSS package (Chicago, IL, USA). The absorbance and reduced concentrations were used to calculate the linear regression. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare mean values of the crude extract, fractions F
 <sub>1</sub>, F
 <sub>2</sub>, F
 <sub>3</sub>, F
 <sub>4</sub> and F
 <sub>5</sub>, and spegatrine (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For dose-response experiments, parasites were cultured in the presence of 3-fold serial dilutions of the test samples and % viability plotted against log (compound concentration) to obtain IC
 <sub>50</sub> values by non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism v.5.02). Pentamidine (an existing drug for treatment of trypanosomiasis) was used as the positive control.
