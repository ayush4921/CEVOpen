 <sub>5</sub> was determined according to the spectrophotometric method of Anokwuru et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03781" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A 125 mM DPPH/methanol solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg DPPH in 200 mL methanol. The 96-well plates were filled with 100 µL distilled water per well. One hundred µL of the crude extract, fractions F

 <bold>4</bold> and 100 µL methanol were added in triplicate into the first three wells followed by serial dilution. Two hundred μL 0.3 M DPPH/methanol was added to each well containing the mixtures. The 96-well plate was kept in the dark for 30 min and the absorbance was measured using a VersaMax
 <sup>TM</sup> tuneable microplate reader at 517 nm.
