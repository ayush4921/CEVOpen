<p>The main objective of this study was to determine the in vitro antioxidant, antitrypanosomal and anti-proliferation activities of 
 <italic>R. caffra.</italic> The proven antioxidant and antiparasitic activities of the plant extract and its fractions, and their non-cytotoxicity, support the traditional medicinal use of 
 <italic>R. caffra</italic> and also shows that traditional medicine is a reliable source of knowledge for the development of new drugs. The study also shows that the major constituent raucaffricine (
 <bold>2</bold>) does not contribute to the biological activities evaluated. Further research should be carried out to isolate, identify, characterize and elucidate the structures of more of the bioactive compounds present so as to have a complete picture in terms of its in vitro antioxidant and antitrypanosomal activities.
