<p>The Journal of Xenobiotics (JoX), which was initially launched in January 2011 under PAGEPress (Italy) and recently with MDPI in September 2020, is devoted to the publication of novel and scientifically sound studies in the field of xenobiotics. Xenobiotics are broadly defined as chemicals foreign (strange) to life, i.e., are not produced in natural conditions. However, compounds of biological origins that are produced at scales not usually seen in nature could be considered as well. Hence, compounds observed at levels not usually found in natural conditions are considered as a special case of xenobiotics in the sense that abnormal levels of compounds even from biological origin could be considered unusual in organisms at high concentrations.</p>
