<p>Further increasing the level of confidence for the assignment of single- vs. multi-target activity for promiscuity analysis via diagnostic ML has been a prime motivation for our current study. Therefore, we have devised a data curation protocol focusing the analysis on compounds from different types of assays that were extensively tested in comparably large numbers of assays. Furthermore, by equally taking positive and negative assay readouts into account, groups of MT- and corresponding ST-CPDs were assembled ensuring data completeness in each case. Moreover, care was taken to remove all screening compounds with potential assay liabilities from further consideration, hence reducing the likelihood of including false positive active compounds in the analysis as much as possible. Datasets from biochemical and mixed assays were assembled under stringent selection criteria and then further modified on the basis of NN analysis to assess the influence of NN relationships between active compounds on predictions. The influence of dataset size reduction was determined by generating equally sized reduced datasets through random compound or NN removal, lending further credence to the analysis.</p>
