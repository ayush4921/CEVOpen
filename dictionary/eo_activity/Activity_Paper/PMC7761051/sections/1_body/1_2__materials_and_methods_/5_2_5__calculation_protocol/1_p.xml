<p>A standard double cross validation procedure was applied for each prediction task. In each of the 10 independent external cross validation trials, ST-CPDs of an individual MT-/ST-CPD group were first randomly sampled to balance the dataset and the resulting MT-/ST-CPD pairs were then randomly divided into 80% training and 20% test (sub)sets. For hyper-parameter optimization, MT-/ST-CPD pairs from training sets were randomly divided into 80% and 20% subsets for 10 independent internal cross validation trials. The best performing model was then used to predict test set compounds for the respective external cross validation trial. In addition, the same cross validation procedure was carried out with 50% training and 50% test set data splits, which produced very similar results, with deviations mostly within one standard deviation and consistently low variability of individual trials. Thus, the results were stable for these different test set sizes. </p>
