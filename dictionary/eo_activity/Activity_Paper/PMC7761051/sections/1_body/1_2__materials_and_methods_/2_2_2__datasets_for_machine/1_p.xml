<p>For both mixed and biochemical assays, compound promiscuity degrees (PDs) were calculated, which were defined as the number of targets a compound was active against. Two different PD thresholds were applied for defining multi-target compounds (MT-CPDs) including PD ≥ 5 (mixed and biochemical assays) and PD ≥ 3 (biochemical assays). For each MT-CPD, a group of corresponding single-target compounds (ST-CPDs) was collected from the initial pool of all compounds (for an ST-CPD, PD = 1). For each target of an MT-CPD, a ST-CPD active against this target, but reported to be inactive against the other targets of the MT-CPD, was randomly selected, if available. Following this procedure, the maximal number of ST-CPDs corresponding to each MT-CPD was determined. For only very few MT-CPDs no corresponding ST-CPDs were identified (and these MT-CPDs were thus omitted). For most MT-CPDs, experimentally confirmed ST-CPDs were not sampled for all targets. Importantly, for each assembled MT-/ST-CPD group, all compounds were tested against all targets, thus ensuring data completeness.
