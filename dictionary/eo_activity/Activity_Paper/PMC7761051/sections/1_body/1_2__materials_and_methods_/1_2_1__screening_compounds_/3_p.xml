<p>The initially obtained set of PubChem assays contained both biochemical and cell-based assay formats and was therefore termed the “mixed” set. From this set, a subset exclusively comprising biochemical single-protein assays was extracted and (termed “biochemical”). Assay set statistics are provided in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Mixed assays and the biochemical assay subset yielded a total of more than 82 and 28 million compound-target interactions, respectively.
