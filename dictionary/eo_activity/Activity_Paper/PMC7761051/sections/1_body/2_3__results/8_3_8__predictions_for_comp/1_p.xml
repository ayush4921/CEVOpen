<p>ML models were first generated for MT- and ST-CPDs from biochemical assays, which represented single-target assays probing direct compound-target interactions. Initially, datasets obtained for the PD â‰¥ 5 threshold were used. Results of the predictions are reported in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01605-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. The models were generally found to be predictive, reaching an accuracy of up to 80%, as assessed on the basis of alternative performance measures. Furthermore, model performance was generally stable across different cross validation trials, as indicated by narrow value distributions captured in box plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). For the full datasets, only relatively minor differences in performance were observed for RF and SVM models. KNN models were less predictive but still yielded a median accuracy above 70%, thus indicating an important role of NN effects for predictions. The largest differences between RF/SVM and KNN models were observed on the basis of MCC values (0.41 for KNN, 0.52 for RF, 0.53 for SVM) and precision (0.68 for KNN, 0.77 for RF and SVM). Random removal of MT- and ST-CPDs consistently decreased the performance for all three model types on the basis of all measures, albeit by only small margins (within a range of 0.01 to 0.08, depending on the measure). This small decrease in performance was attributable to the reduction in available training data. However, NN-based compound removal of the same magnitude as random removal consistently resulted in a larger decrease in model performance, especially for KNN classifiers. While the ML models remained predictive, accuracy was generally lower than 70%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f006">Figure 6</xref>a compares ROC curves for predictions of reduced datasets. After random compound removal, SVM and RF models still yielded AUC values of 0.86 and 0.84, respectively, whereas NN removal reduced these values to 0.77 (SVM) and 0.76 (RF). Taken together, predictions on reduced datasets confirmed a strong influence of NN effects on model accuracy.
