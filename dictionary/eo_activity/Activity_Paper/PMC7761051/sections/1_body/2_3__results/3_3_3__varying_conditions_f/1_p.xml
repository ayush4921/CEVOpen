<p>ML calculations were carried out under three different conditions. First, compounds from original (“full”) datasets were used. Second, 50% of MT-/ST-CPD groups were randomly removed (“random removal”). These calculations were carried out to examine the influence of dataset size reduction on prediction accuracy and served as a control for the third condition. In the third case, 25% of MT-/ST-CPD groups with ST-CPDs most similar to other ST-CPDs and 25% of groups with MT-CPDs most similar to other MT-CPDs were discarded (“NN removal”), which also resulted in a 50% net reduction in dataset size. Hence, NN relationships of both MT- and ST-CPDs were detected using calculated Tanimoto similarity values and systematically reduced.</p>
