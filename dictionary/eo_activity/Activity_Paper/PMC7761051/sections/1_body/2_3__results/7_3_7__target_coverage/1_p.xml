<p>We also determined the target coverage of MT-CPDs extracted from biochemical and mixed assays. Therefore, target annotations of MT-CPDs were recorded and compound-based target networks were generated. In these networks, targets were represented as nodes, which were connected by an edge if they shared a pre-defined number of MT-CPDs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01605-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b show target network representations for MT-CPDs from biochemical and mixed assays, respectively. In these cases, targets were connected if they shared at least 50 MT-CPDs. In both instances, the major network component was a densely connected cluster of nearly the same target composition. This central network component remained stable when different MT-CPD thresholds were evaluated. Accordingly, mixed assays and their biochemical assay subset defined essentially the same target space predominantly (but not exclusively) consisting of DNA binding proteins including transcription regulators, peptidase and ester hydrolase enzymes, phospho-transferases, and small numbers of unclassified targets. Hence, compared to MT-CPDs compounds from medicinal chemistry sources [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], target space covered by MT-CPDs and corresponding ST-CPDs from biological screens was more confined. While MT-CPDs from biochemical and mixed assays defined a very similar target space, target coverage further increased for the larger set of mixed assays, as also illustrated by increasing network density for MT-CPDs from mixed compared to biochemical assays (
