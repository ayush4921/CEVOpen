<p>Different types of computational predictions have focused on systematically distinguishing between promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds using machine learning (ML) [

 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These studies have shown that promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds from medicinal chemistry sources were predictable with reasonable accuracy on the basis of chemical structure, indicating the presence of structural patterns that differentiate compounds with single- and multi-target activity. Successful predictions were obtained for promiscuous compounds active against related or unrelated targets, including proteins from functionally distinct classes [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These studies revealed that nearest neighbor (NN) relationships between promiscuous or non-promiscuous compounds strongly contributed to the predictions. These relationships resulted from the preferential formation of series of structural analogs by many promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds, respectively. The presence of distinct analog series comprising promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds rationalized the predictions including the strong influence of NN effects [
