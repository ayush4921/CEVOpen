 <caption>
  <p>Test frequency of selected compounds. Box plots report the distributions of target-based compound test frequencies for single-target (ST, blue) and multi-target (MT, red) compounds from different datasets. Box plots show the smallest value (lower whisker), lower quartile (lower boundary of the box), median (horizontal line in box), upper quartile (upper boundary of the box), and the maximum value (upper whisker). Values classified as statistical outliers are represented as diamonds.</p>
