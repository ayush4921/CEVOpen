  <p>Nearest neighbor relationships for single- and multi-target compounds from biochemical assays. KDE plots report the distribution of closest similarity relationships. For each MT- and ST-CPD, all pairwise Tanimoto similarities were calculated. Similarity values for the NNs of all MT- (x-axis) and ST-CPDs (y-axis) are reported. The joint distribution is displayed as a KDE plot for MT-CPDs (red, left) and ST-CPDs (blue, right). In KDE plots, color intensity corresponds to different regions of data density, as delineated with contour lines. In addition, the underlying similarity value distributions are plotted on the top and right scale, respectively. Compounds falling onto the diagonal have the same closest similarity value to ST- and MT-CPDs. In (
   <bold>a</bold>), the similarity value distributions are reported for the original data set. In (
   <bold>b</bold>) and (
   <bold>c</bold>), NN calculations according to (
   <bold>a</bold>) were carried out after random removal of 50% of the MT- and ST-CPDs and removal of 50% of the NNs from MT- and ST-CPDs, respectively.
