<p>Daswani et al. [
 <xref rid="B115-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] tested the effect of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> root bark aqueous extract on 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. It was observed that this plant significantly inhibits stable toxin production and reduces intestinal secretions, thus causing a decreased virulence of these enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Srivastava and Saxena evaluated in vitro activity of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> seeds aqueous extract against diarrhea caused by bacteria like 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Shigella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi,</italic> and found this extract highly effective on the tested bacterial strains [
