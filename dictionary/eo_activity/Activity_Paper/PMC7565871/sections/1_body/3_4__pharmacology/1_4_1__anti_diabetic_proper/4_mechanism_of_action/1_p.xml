<p>Ali et al., [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] demonstrated the effect of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> on α glucoside activity. α glucosidase is an enzyme which converts polysaccharides into monosaccharides. Intestines are only able to transport sugar to the blood in monosaccharide form. It was observed that an 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> extract significantly inhibits intestinal α glucosidase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.52 mg/mL, thus successfully limiting carbohydrate absorption. This study suggested that inhibition of α glucosidase is an important approach to limit postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetes.
