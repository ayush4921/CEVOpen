<p>The ethanolic extract of its seeds significantly reduced diabetes in rats at a dose of 300 mg/kg. In a similar study on diabetic rats, decreased levels of serum cholesterol, uric acid, aspartate transaminase, triglycerides, creatinine and blood glucose were observed. Another study also demonstrated that a hydro-methanolic seed extract of

With the administration of 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg, a significant reduction of serum cholesterol, blood glucose concentration, mean alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, uric acid, aspartate transaminase, alanine and creatinine were reported [
