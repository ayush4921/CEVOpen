<p>Ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> seeds showed a concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against enteropathogenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC). The petroleum ether extract of its bark also showed inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at a 50 Î¼g/mL minimum inhibitory concentration. However, compared to other plants, it showed a moderate activity [

 <xref rid="B118-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] showed that adherence of the EPEC strain to INT407 cells leads to cytoplasmic membrane damage (electron microscopic studies), apoptotic bodies by the condensation of chromatin, and mitochondrial swelling and damage (fluorescence microscopy). These effects were diminished in EPEC treated with 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> extracts.
