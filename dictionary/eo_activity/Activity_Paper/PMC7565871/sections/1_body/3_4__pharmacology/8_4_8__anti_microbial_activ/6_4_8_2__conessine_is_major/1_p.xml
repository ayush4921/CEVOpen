<p>Siriyong et al. concluded that conessine in 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> is responsible for antibacterial activity and can be useful as a combinatory therapy to restore antibiotic susceptibility in the extensively drug-resistant 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B137-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Siriyong et al. [
 <xref rid="B138-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] studied the synergistic activity of conessine in combination with various antibiotics against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain K767 (wild-type), K1455 (MexAB-OprM overexpressing), and K1523 (MexB deletion). An H33342 accumulation assay was used to evaluate efflux pump inhibition, while NPN uptake was used to assess membrane permeabilisation. Except for novobiocin, all other antibiotics tested such as cefotaxime, levofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and rifampicin showed synergistic activities. The authors observed that conessine might inhibit other efflux systems present in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as indicated by synergy inhibition in the MexB deletion strain, while the inhibition of the MexAB-OprM pump was confirmed (H33342 efflux). However, membrane permeabilisation was not observed. This suggest that conessine may be applied as a novel efflux pump inhibitor to restore antibiotic activity by inhibiting efflux pump systems in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and other Gram-negatives. Later, the authors tested a “
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains with defined mutations that result in the overexpression of the MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN efflux pumps” as well as a mutated strain with deletion of all these pumps. The authors also studied the effects in an in vivo 
 <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> infection model. Conessine along with levofloxacin enhanced bacterial inhibition in vitro, and restored antibiotic efficacy in vivo compared to the corresponding monotherapies. The authors conclude that conessine from 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic>, enhanced the efficacy of several antibiotics, and inhibited efflux mediated MDR, without showing any toxicity in 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae [
