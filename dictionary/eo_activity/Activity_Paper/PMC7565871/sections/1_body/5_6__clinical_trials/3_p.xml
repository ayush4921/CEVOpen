<p>A randomized controlled trial carried out by Kadam et al. [
 <xref rid="B157-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] using a mixture of 8 herbal plants, including 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> (1.02 g/10 g), for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. Both UDM toothpowder and standard control treatment yielded a statistically significant reduction in scores of gingival index and plaque. Another randomized clinical study with 32 children (3–12 years) with 
 <italic>Bhunimbadi-Vati</italic> that contains nine herbals including 
 <italic>H. pubescens,</italic> shows relief of “
 <italic>Mukha Vairasya</italic>” (bad taste in mouth) and “
 <italic>Tikta Amlodgara</italic>” (sour and better belching efficacy) [
