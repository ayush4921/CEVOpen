    "<h4>Background</h4>Triazole is an important heterocyclic moiety that occupies a unique position in heterocyclic chemistry, due to its large number of biological activities. It exists in two isomeric forms i.e. 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,3-triazole and is used as core molecule for the design and synthesis of many medicinal compounds. 1,2,4-Triazole possess broad spectrum of therapeutically interesting drug candidates such as analgesic, antiseptic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-urease, anti-inflammatory, diuretics, anticancer, anticonvulsant, antidiabetic and antimigraine agents.<h4>Methods</h4>The structures of all synthesized compounds were characterized by physicochemical properties and spectral means (IR and NMR). The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (B. subtilis), Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) bacterial and fungal (C. albicans and A. niger) strains by tube dilution method using ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and fluconazole as standards. In-vitro antioxidant and anti-urease screening was done by DPPH assay and indophenol method, respectively. The in-vitro anticancer evaluation was carried out against MCF-7 and HCT116 cancer cell lines using 5-FU as standards.<h4>Results, discussion and conclusion</h4>The biological screening results reveal that the compounds T<sub>5</sub> (MIC<sub>BS, EC</sub> = 24.7 µM, MIC<sub>PA</sub>, <sub>CA</sub> = 12.3 µM) and T<sub>17</sub> (MIC<sub>AN</sub> = 27.1 µM) exhibited potent antimicrobial activity as comparable to standards ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin (MIC<sub>Cipro</sub> = 18.1 µM, MIC<sub>Amo</sub> = 17.1 µM) and fluconazole (MIC<sub>Flu</sub> = 20.4 µM), respectively. The antioxidant evaluation showed that compounds T<sub>2</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 34.83 µg/ml) and T<sub>3</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 34.38 µg/ml) showed significant antioxidant activity and comparable to ascorbic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> = 35.44 µg/ml). Compounds T<sub>3</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 54.01 µg/ml) was the most potent urease inhibitor amongst the synthesized compounds and compared to standard thiourea (IC<sub>50</sub> = 54.25 µg/ml). The most potent anticancer activity was shown by compounds T<sub>2</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.84 μM) and T<sub>7</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.25 μM) against HCT116 cell lines as compared to standard 5-FU (IC<sub>50</sub> = 25.36 μM)."
