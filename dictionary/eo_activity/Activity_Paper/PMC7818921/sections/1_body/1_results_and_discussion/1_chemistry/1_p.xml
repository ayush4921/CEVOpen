<p id="Par46">The multistep synthetic process of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>

 </sub>–
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>20</bold>
 </sub>) was depicted in Scheme 
 <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Initially, ethylpalmitate (
 <bold>Int-i</bold>) was synthesized by the reaction of palmitic acid, ethanol and sulphuric acid. Palmitohydrazide (
 <bold>Int-ii</bold>) was synthesized from ethanolic solution of ethylpalmitate (
 <bold>Int-i</bold>) followed by addition of hydrazine hydrate. 5-Pentadecyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3
 <italic>H</italic>)-thione (
 <bold>Int-iii</bold>) was synthesized using 
 <bold>Int-ii</bold> in alc. potassium hydroxide solution followed by the addition of carbon disulfide and then followed by addition of hydrazine hydrate to 
 <bold>Int-iii</bold> yielded 4-amino-5-pentadecyl-4
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (
 <bold>Int-iv</bold>). Finally, the 
 <bold>Int-iv</bold> on reaction with different substituted aromatic aldehydes in ethanol yielded the title compounds (
