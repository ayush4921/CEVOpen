 <italic>Ureases</italic> relate to the class of Urea amidohydrolases enzymes containing two nickel(II) atoms. 
 <italic>Ureases</italic> are mainly obtained from plants, algae, fungi and bacteria. Bacterial 
 <italic>ureases</italic> are responsible for causing many diseases like pyelonephritis, hepatic coma, peptic ulceration, urinary stones and stomach cancer. Rationally, A category of anti
 <italic>urease</italic> or 
 <italic>urease</italic> inhibitory drugs was developed for curing the 
 <italic>urease</italic> caused disease by inhibiting 
 <italic>urease</italic> enzymes. The two nickel(II) atoms present in active site of 
 <italic>Ureases</italic> accelerate the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide gas. Both CO
 <sub>2</sub> and NH
 <sub>3</sub> are important virulence factor for the pathogenesis of many above given clinical conditions. Anti-
 <italic>urease</italic> compounds inhibit the hydrolysis of urea by antagonising 
 <italic>urease</italic> enzyme [

 <italic>urease</italic> activity.
