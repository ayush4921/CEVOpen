<p id="Par48">All the compounds were synthesized according to synthetic scheme under appropriate experimental conditions and analysed by elemental analysis, IR, mass, and 
 <sup>1</sup>H/
 <sup>13</sup>CNMR. The pharmacological potential was evaluated to study the effect of different substituents on antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-
 <italic>urease</italic> activities. From the outcomes of the pharmacological studies it can be concluded that the substitution of tri-methoxy (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>5</bold>
 </sub>) group increases the antibacterial activity whereas introduction of nitro (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>17</bold>
 </sub>) group at 
 <italic>p-</italic>position enhances the antifungal activity. The introduction of aldehyde (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>2</bold>
 </sub>) and methyl (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>3</bold>
 </sub>) at 
 <italic>p-</italic>position of aromatic ring may increase the anti-
 <italic>urease</italic> as well as antioxidant activities. The substitution of 
 <italic>p</italic>-aldehyde (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>2</bold>
 </sub>) and 
 <italic>o</italic>-hydroxy (
 <bold>T</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>7</bold>
 </sub>) groups on the aromatic ring may enhance the anticancer activity against HCT116 cell line.
