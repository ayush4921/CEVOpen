 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> of the Amaryllidaceae family, rich in quercetin, which inhibits the SARS main proteases, 3CLpro and PLpro, and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS) 3CLpro protease, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">Mani et al., 2020</xref>). It has also been proposed that the modulation of cellular unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy signalling being important to coronaviruses to complete different stages of the viral life cycle during infection, if perturbed by quercetin and resveratrol through the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) and NLRP-3 inflammasome pathways may have anti-coronavirus effects (

 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> (qinghao) is a plant of the Asteraceae family from which artemisinin is extracted. Together with its derivative, dihydroartemisinin, they have shown promise against parasites and viruses, including the human cytomegalovirus, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (

 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> L belonging to the family 
 <italic>Meliaceae</italic> showed antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type-1 infection as a potent entry inhibitor (
 <xref rid="bib219" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2010</xref>). Some of its bioactive compounds also boost the immune system by upregulating polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, macrophage activity, and lymphocyte proliferation response (
 <xref rid="bib189" ref-type="bibr">SaiRam et al., 1997</xref>). The aqueous extract of the branches was found to be effective against the Newcastle disease virus in embryonated SPF chicken eggs and SPF chickens. The plant is known to be rich in salanin, nimbin, azadirone, and azadirachtins (
 <xref rid="bib166" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2014</xref>) and show potent antiviral activities (
