They induce interferon production, enhance the activity of lymphocytes and increase phagocytosis. Examples of these immunomodulatory plants include garlic which remarkably enhance immune system activities. Garlic as an immune system booster has been found to exert an immune-potentiating effect by stimulating natural killer cell activity. Some studies strongly present garlic as a promising candidate as an immune modifier, which preserves the homeostasis of immune functions (
