 <italic>Borreira</italic> are genera of 
 <italic>Rubiaceae</italic> widespread in tropical and subtropical Africa. Some species of these genera perform crucial functions in herbal and traditional medicine in Europe, Africa South America, Asia. They are used in the treatment and management of diseases such as respiratory infections, inflammation of eye, malaria, skin diseases, fever, hemorrhage, urinary infections, diarrheal and other digestive problems, headache, and gums. Different biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-ulcer, larvicidal, gastrointestinal, and hepatoprotective have been reported from various extracts 
 <italic>Borreira</italic>. These biological activities have been attributed bioactive compounds from the plant such as terpenoids, flavonoids, with alkaloids and iridoids as the major active principles (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Conserva et al., 2012</xref>). Phytochemical screening has shown the presence of alkaloid called emetine in 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Moreira, 1964</xref>). And this emetine has been reported to have antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 0.46 μM when tested alongside with Remdesivir, lopinavir and homoharringtonine in their capacity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Results have also shown that emetine, an anti-protozoal agent, potently inhibits ZIKV and EBOV infection with a low nanomolar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and potent activity in vivo. Two mechanisms of action for emetine was also identified which are inhibition of ZIKV NS5 polymerase activity and disruption of lysosomal function. Emetine also inhibits EBOV entry (
