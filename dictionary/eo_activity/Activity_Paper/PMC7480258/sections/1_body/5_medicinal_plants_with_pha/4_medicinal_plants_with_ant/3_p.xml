 <italic>Boerhavia diffusa</italic>. Active compound isolated from 
 <italic>Boerhaavia diffusa</italic> extract is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight between 16,000 and 20,000. The protein and carbohydrates component of the glycoprotein are about 8 to 13 % and 70–80% its composition respectively (

 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Lami et al., 1992</xref>). Recipes from this plant alone or in combination with other medicinal plant shows appreciable antiviral effects against many viruses which cause infections of the respiratory tract, liver and heart diseases. Obviously, there is no uniform principle of action against RNA viruses. Experimental findings on inhibition showed intense and broad antiphytoviral activity which suggested the mode of action of the glycoprotein inhibitor in medicinal plants. This causes a significantly effective antiviral drug candidtate to be synthesized in the plant cells, which then offers protection against viral infections (
