 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> species have shown its extract were most effective when administered either simultaneously with the initiation of virus infection or post infection but not when given pre-infection, and this suggested that the extract may act at the early stage of infection such as during viral attachment and entry as well as viral replication. The evidence from aueous extract showed strong activity against viruses like HSV1 and HSV2 in vero cells by a process called quantitative polymerase chain reaction (

 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>Phyllanthus urinaria</italic> showed the strongest antiviral activity against both HSV1 and HSV2 viruses. Their therapeutic actions were proposed to be at the early stage of replication and infection (

The phytochemicals contributed to the antiviral activities of the plant include rutin, gallic acid, caffeolquinic acid, geraniin, corilagen, galloylglucopyranose, digalloylglucopyranoside, trigalloyglucopyranoside, quercetin glucoside and quercetin rhamnoside (
