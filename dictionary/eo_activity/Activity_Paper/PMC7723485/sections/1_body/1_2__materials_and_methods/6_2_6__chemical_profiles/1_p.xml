<p>The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of EA extracts were determined by the HPLC assay [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid, ferulic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and cinnamic acid were chosen as standards for phenols, whereas cirsimaritin was chosen as the standard for flavonoids. The samples (10 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml methanol and filtered through a 0.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>m filter. The HPLC system was equipped with a diode array detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Varian Polaris C18 column (5 
 <italic>µ</italic>m, 250 mm × 4.6 mm; Agilent, CA, USA). The injection volume was 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For the phenolic acid assay, the mobile phases were methanol (eluent A) and acetic acid (eluent B) in the following gradient elutions: 5% (A), 95% (B) in 0–5 min; 5%–20% (A), 95%–90% (B) in 5–10 min; 20%–40% (A), 90%–60% (B) in 10–20 min; 40%–60% (A), 60%–40% (B) in 20–30 min; and 60%–100% (A), 40%–0% (B) in 30–40 min. The samples were detected by a UV detector (280 nm). For the flavonoid assay, the mobile phases were methanol (eluent A) and acetic acid (eluent B) in the following gradient elutions: 50%–100% (A), 50%–0% (B) in 0–25 min. The samples were detected by using a UV detector (270 nm). The standards for phenolic acids and cirsimaritin (purchased from Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) had a coefficient of determination (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) that was greater than 0.995.
