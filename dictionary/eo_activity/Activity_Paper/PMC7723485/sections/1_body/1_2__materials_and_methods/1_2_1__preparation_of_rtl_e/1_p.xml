<p>The extraction protocol was based on our previous methods, with slight modifications [

 <italic>v</italic>) at 4°C for 72 h and filtered using a cheese cloth. The filtrate was filtered twice through a Whatman No. 1 filter paper and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was vacuum concentrated using a rotary evaporator below 40°C. The concentrated methanol extract was dissolved in 400 ml water and subsequently extracted with an equal volume of hexane and EA solvent, and the EA layers were divided through column chromatography using a Sephadex LH-20 column with 200 ml of 50–100% methanol sequentially. The different fractions were then collected from the EA layer (EAF1 to EAF8). The best of glucose uptake hepatocytes of fractions was evaluated and screened, and the EAF5 fractions were divided through column chromatography using an MCI gel column with 200 ml of 20–100% methanol sequentially. The different fractions were then collected from the EAF5 layer (EAF5-1 to EAF5-5), as shown in
