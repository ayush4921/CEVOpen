 <italic>Ruellia tuberosa</italic> L. (RTL) is a herb plant that has been used as folk medicine to cure diabetes in Asian countries for decades. Our previous studies have demonstrated that RTL aqueous or ethanolic extracts can significantly improve glucose uptake in C2C12 myoblasts, alleviate the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
 <italic>Î±</italic>-induced IR in skeletal muscles, and ameliorate hyperglycemia, IR indices, and aorta dysfunction in high-fat-diet-fed streptozotocin-induced T2DM rats [
