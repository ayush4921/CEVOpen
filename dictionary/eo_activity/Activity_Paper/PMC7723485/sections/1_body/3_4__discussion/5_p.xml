<p>However, previous studies have confirmed that syringic acid and

The administration of syringic acid in alloxan-induced diabetic rats for 30 days showed increased insulin, glycogen, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and C-peptide contents, as well as decreased blood sugar, HbA1c, and glucokinase, which are associated with an improvement in diabetic symptoms. Additionally, in histopathological sections, syringic acid was found to reduce pancreatic damage caused by alloxan and stimulate 
 <italic>β</italic>-cell regeneration, thus demonstrating its potential to treat diabetes [
