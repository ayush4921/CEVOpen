<p>With the exception of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to which all the isolates were susceptible and gentamicin to which two of the isolates were resistant, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ampicillin, and augumentin were ineffective while nitrofurantoin was able to inhibit the growth of five of the isolates. While the ofloxacin produced inhibition zones ranging between 15 and 30 mm, ciprofloxacin produced inhibition zones ranging between 16 and 25 mm as shown in
