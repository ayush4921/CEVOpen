<p>In this study, the antibacterial activity of the two different extracts against the various bacterial isolates showed the scientific validity of 
 <italic>Aframomum melegueta</italic> being used traditionally as a medicine. The results indicated that defatted methanolic extract (DME) was more active with higher antibacterial activity than the nondefatted methanolic extract (NDME) of this plant. The activity of the NDME at the highest concentration of 10 mg/mL was equivalent to the activity of the DME at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Thus, DME inhibited the bacterial isolates at lower concentrations compared with what were obtained from the NDME. While their antibacterial activities may be attributed to the presence of 6-paragol and 6-shogoal [

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and disturbance of the permeability barrier of the bacterial membrane structure [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Balakumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] suggested that the extract components cross the cell membrane, interact with the enzymes and proteins of the membrane, and produce a flux of protons towards the cell exterior to induce changes and the ultimate death of the cells. Pandian et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and Srinivasan [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] indicated that the bacterial cell death could have resulted from the binding of epicatechin and catechin to positively charged lipid bilayer of Gram-positive bacteria, inhibition of metabolic enzymes, and interference with the synthesis of certain amino acids necessary for bacterial growth. Olajuyigbe et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] also reported that the cell death from the bacteria treated with the extracts could have resulted from ultrastructural changes and breakdown of elemental components in the bacteria into different elements and leaked lipid and protein from the bacteria. Olajuyigbe et al. [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] further reported that the cell death resulted from the ability of the extracts to produce reactive oxygen species with deleterious effects. Since the bioactivity of extracts depends on the concentration used [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the ineffectiveness of the extracts at lower concentrations may be attributed to the presence of lesser amounts of the antimicrobial compounds in the extracts.
