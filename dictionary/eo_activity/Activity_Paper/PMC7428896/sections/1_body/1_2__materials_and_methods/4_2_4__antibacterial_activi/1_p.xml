<p>Each of the isolates was prepared by the colony suspension method [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The density of each strain's suspension was adjusted to equal that of the 0.5 McFarland standards by adding sterile distilled water to give a resultant concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cfu/mL. The antibacterial activity was determined using the agar diffusion method according to the modified Kirby–Bauer diffusion technique [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] by swabbing the Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) (Oxoids UK) plates with the resultant standardized overnight culture of each test isolate. Multidiscs containing different antibiotics including ofloxacin (5

 <italic>µ</italic>g), gentamicin (10 
 <italic>µ</italic>g), cefuroxime (30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g), ceftazidime (30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g), ampicillin (10 
 <italic>µ</italic>g), augumentin (30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g), and nitrofurantoin (300 
 <italic>µ</italic>g) were aseptically placed on the inoculated agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, the plates were examined for zones of inhibition [
