<p>The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the two extracts were determined in duplicate by the macrobroth dilution method in Mueller Hinton broth according to the Clinical Laboratory Standardization Institute (CLSI) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To determine the MICs of each extract, different concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/mL) of each of the extracts were prepared by serial dilution in double-strength Mueller Hinton broth. After the serial dilution, each tube was inoculated with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of each of the bacterial strains and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Blank Mueller Hinton broth was used as negative control. Each assay was performed two times. The MIC was defined as the lowest dilution that showed no bacterial growth in the Mueller Hinton broth.
