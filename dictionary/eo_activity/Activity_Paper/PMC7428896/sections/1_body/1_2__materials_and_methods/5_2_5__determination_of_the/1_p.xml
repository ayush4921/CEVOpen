<p>To determine the antibacterial activity of the extract by the agar dilution method as described by Afolayan and Meyer [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], different concentrations of the extract, 0.1 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL, were prepared in molten Mueller Hinton agar maintained in a water bath at 50°C. A loopful of each of the standardized bacterial cultures was aseptically inoculated into the solidified agar by stabbing. Two Mueller Hinton agar plates containing 5% methanol representing the final methanol concentration in the test plates without the extract served as negative controls. Another two blank plate containing only Mueller Hinton agar served as negative controls. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Each test was done in duplicate, and any test agar plate lacking visible growth at the point of stabbing was considered the minimum inhibitory concentration of each of the extracts
