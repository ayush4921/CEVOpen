<p>Mammalian cells (mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB71)) used in the cytotoxicity assay were a kind gift from Professor Simon Gordon, University of Oxford. The rezazurin assay method was employed for the cytotoxicity assay [
 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The 90% growth inhibitory concentration (GIC
 <sub>90</sub>) was ascertained and the selectivity index (SI), was determined as the ratio between the GIC
 <sub>90</sub> on RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages and the MIC on the respective bacterial strain. For example, the SI = GIC
 <sub>90</sub>/MIC. Paclitaxel was used as the control for the cytotoxic assay.
