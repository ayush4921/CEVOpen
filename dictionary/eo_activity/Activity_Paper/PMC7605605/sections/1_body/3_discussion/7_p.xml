<p>Secondary metabolites play a significant role in the biological activities of medicinal plants such as hypoglycemic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-leprosy activities, anti-inflammatory, anti-malarial, anticarcinogenic, anti-cholinergic, and antioxidant.
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In the present study, the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> contains phytoconstituents such as phenols, triterpenoid, flavonoids, saponins, and anthraquinones. Flavonoids and tannin were some of the renowned compounds that were isolated from the extract are capable of reducing the elevated blood glucose level.
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51â€“53</xref> Saponin is indicated to use as antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic and renoprotective, while tannin possesses antioxidant and renoprotective activity.

 <xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Polyphenolic compounds that are isolated from the extract are capable of reducing the TG, TC, and LDL levels through inhibition of the formation of AGEs in diabetic mice.
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Therefore, the significant anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of the extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> could be because of the presence of the above-mentioned phytoconstituents in the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic>.
