<p>Slight body weight Loss was observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and almost normalized by treatment with 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract. Dehydration and loss of body weight have been associated with diabetes mellitus.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In diabetic mice, increased water intake and decreased body weight were observed. This indicates a polydipsic condition and loss of weight due to the excessive breakdown of tissue proteins.
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The decrease in body weight in diabetic mice could be due to dehydration and catabolism of fats,
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> as well as proteins, which might lead to muscle wasting.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Oral administration of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract for 14 consecutive days to diabetic mice lessened their water intake and improved body weight. These effects could be due to better control of the hyperglycemic state in diabetic mice. Decreased fasting blood sugar improves body weight in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.
