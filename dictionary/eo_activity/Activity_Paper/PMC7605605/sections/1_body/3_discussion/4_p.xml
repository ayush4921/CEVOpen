<p>The increase in fasting BGL is an important characteristic feature of DM.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In the present study, there were elevations in fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic-treated mice. Though, the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> reduced fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic mice. The fasting blood glucose level was decreased by 13.89% (p&lt;0.05); 25.67% (p&lt;0.01); and 34.06% (p&lt;0.001) at 100, 200, and 400mg/kg doses of the extract, respectively, on the 7th day of treatment. Similarly, the fasting blood glucose level was decreased by 23.21% (p&lt;0.01); 38.20% (p&lt;0.001); and 43.53% (p&lt;0.001) at 100, 200, and 400mg/kg doses of the extract, respectively, on the 14th day of treatment. Likewise, the standard drug (GLC5mg/kg) reduced the fasting blood glucose level by 51.28% (p&lt;0.001), and 58.99% (p&lt;0.001), respectively, on the 7th and 14th days of treatment. These findings of a reduction in fasting blood glucose levels are in agreement with previous studies.

 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract increased, the fasting blood glucose level was shown to decrease. The glycemic control was nearly similar between GLC 5 mg/kg and 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract treatment. Therefore, the increment of the 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract doses may further provide a similar result as the standard drug. The current result showed the potential antihyperglycemic activity of the crude extract. Among, the possible explanations for the present result, the antihyperglycemic effect of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract could be due to restoration of insulin response via the presence of antihyperglycemic, “insulin-releasing” and “insulin-like” activity.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> It was also suggested that the anti-hyperglycemic effects of the 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract might be because of the high level of fiber that interferes with carbohydrate absorption, increased peripheral uptake of glucose, improved sensitivity of insulin receptor, and regenerative activity of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract on pancreatic tissue.
