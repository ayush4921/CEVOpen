<p>Oxidative substances (ROS) are important in causing inflammation; hence a plant extract with strong antioxidant potential could be a good anti-inflammatory. 
 <italic>Centaurea salicifolia</italic> M.Bieb. ex Willd. chloroform extracts showed strong antioxidant ability, maximum phenolic content, remarkable anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity [

 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> has a potentially high anti-inflammatory effect, which might be related to the polyphenolic content and antioxidant activities of the extract. Torres et al., [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] also reported that plants belonging to Bignoniacea family showed good anti-inflammatory activity, which might be because of phytochemical constituents that were found effective against LOX enzyme. Therefore, lipoxygenase inhibitors may be of many medicinal benefits in prevention of these inflammatory cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A plant with good anti-lipoxygenase or anti-inflammatory potential could be a good candidate for antiallegic, anti-arthritic and anticancer drug.
