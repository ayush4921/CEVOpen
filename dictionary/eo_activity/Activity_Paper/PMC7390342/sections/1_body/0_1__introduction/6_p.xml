 <italic>Jacaranda mimosifolia</italic> (D. Don) is an ornamental tree belonging to the family 
 <italic>Bignoniaceae</italic>, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Extracts of various organs of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> are used in several countries including Bangladesh, India and Pakistan to treat hypertension, ulcers, wounds, diarrhea, dysentery and amoebic infections [

 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> extracts, various aspects related to these phytochemicals including polyphenolic compounds, as well as otherother biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities remain unexplored. Here we aimed to evaluate the crude methanol extract and various fractions of increasing polarity of
