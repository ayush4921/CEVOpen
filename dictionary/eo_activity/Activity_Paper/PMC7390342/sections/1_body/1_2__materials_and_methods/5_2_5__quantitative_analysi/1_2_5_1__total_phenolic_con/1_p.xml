<p>TPC was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with some modifications. An aliquot (0.3 mL) of leaf extract was mixed with Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent (2.25 mL). After 5 min, 6% sodium carbonate (2.25 mL) was added and the mixture allowed to stand at room temperature for 90 min. The absorbance was measured at 725 nm in a spectrophotometer (HITACHI Model U-1100). A calibration curve for gallic acid in the range of 200–800 µg/mL was prepared in the same manner and results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of extract. The experimentwas performed in triplicate.
