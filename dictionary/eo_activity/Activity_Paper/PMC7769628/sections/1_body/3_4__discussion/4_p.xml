<p>Procyanidin and anthocyanin are polyphenolic groups of natural products and play an essential role in the human diet, even though many medical practitioners, epidemiologists, nutritionists, and food scientists have related a decrease in obesity and its related diseases such as diabetes to the high ingestion of plants containing these potent molecules [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The obtained results from the current study showed that the methanolic fraction containing procyanidin has a powerful action against the 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase metabolic enzyme. Actually, this enzyme is responsible for the digestions of the food containing complex polysaccharides to convert them to monosaccharide units. The obtained 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity outcomes were compared with a commercial antidiabetic drug Acarbose. The methanolic, hexane, aqueous, and acetone fractions of PJ plant have 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.84 ± 2.25, 38.9 ± 2.38, 158.4 ± 0.9, and 28.18 ± 1.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, while Acarbose has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 28.18 ± 1.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. A study was conducted in Jordan by Hamdan and Afifi on the 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>Paritaria diffusa</italic> leaves who found that the hydromethanol extract was inactive [
