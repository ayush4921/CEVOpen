<p>Pollinosis from PJ plant is known to cause allergy [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; this may explain the little interest and consequently scarcity of studies investigating the biological activities of this plant including cytotoxicity. A recent study found that the ethanol extract of PJ has a cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines, namely, PC-3, DU145, and HDF cell lines and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were &gt;300 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This is a little stronger than what we observed. However, according to the reported classification [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], acetone extract has a weak toxic effect, while the rest of the extracts have no cytotoxic effect. This suggests that all extracts of PJ are safe to use.
