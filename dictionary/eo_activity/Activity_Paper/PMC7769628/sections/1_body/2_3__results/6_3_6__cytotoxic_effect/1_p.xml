<p>In the present study, the antiproliferative potential of PJ solvent fractions, namely, aqueous, methanol, acetone, and hexane, was investigated on HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma. HeLa cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of each tested plant sample (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/ml) for 24 h, and the cell viability was quantified using an MTS assay. Treating HeLa cells with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/ml of PJ acetone fraction (
