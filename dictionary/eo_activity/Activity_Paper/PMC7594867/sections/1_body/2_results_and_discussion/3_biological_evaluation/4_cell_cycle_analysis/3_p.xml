<p>The results of the cell cycle analysis revealed G
 <sub>1</sub> -S cell cycle arrest by the three compounds (
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold>). Compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> caused the highest increase in the number of cells in the G
 <sub>1</sub> cell-cycle phase (70%) at the expense of the other phases, compared to 
 <bold>18b</bold> (53%) and 
 <bold>20a</bold> (57%), in

 <sub>1</sub> phase
