<p>The results revealed high 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against CDK-2 by the tested compounds with IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the nanomolar range. Compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against CDK-2, which was comparable to that of the positive control (staurosporine). The inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> was nearly three-fold higher than its thiourea analogue 
 <bold>20a</bold>. Moreover, the inhibitory activities of the two naphthalenyl derivatives 
 <bold>19a</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold> against CDK-2 was higher than that of the 4-methoxyphenyl urea 
 <bold>18b</bold>,
