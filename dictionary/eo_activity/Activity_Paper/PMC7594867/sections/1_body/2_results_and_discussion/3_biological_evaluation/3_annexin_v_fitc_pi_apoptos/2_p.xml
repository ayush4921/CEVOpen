<p>Previously, compound 
 <bold>10</bold>, the lead compound in this study was reported to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells through activation of caspase 3/7
 <sup>23</sup>. Accordingly, the ability of the new compounds to induce apoptosis in the same cells (MCF-7) was investigated in the current study. Compounds 
 <bold>18 b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold> the most active against MCF-7 cells were selected for this study. The ability of these compounds to induce apoptosis was evaluated using annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/Propidium Iodide (PI) staining assay according to the previous report
