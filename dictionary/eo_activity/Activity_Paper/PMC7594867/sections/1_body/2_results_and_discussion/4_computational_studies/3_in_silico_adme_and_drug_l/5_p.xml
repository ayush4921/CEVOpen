<p>The Clog P (MlogP) values of the new compounds were in the range of 1.71–3.15, which was higher than those of flavopiridol and palbociclib but was comparable with that compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>19c</bold> and 
 <bold>20c</bold> were the most lipophilic with ClogP values of 3.15 and 3.14, respectively. The chemical structure of the new compounds have 2–4 hydrogen bond acceptors (HB
 <sub>A</sub> &lt;10) and 3 hydrogen bond donors (HB
 <sub>D</sub> &lt; 5). These results indicated that all the new compounds conform to Lipinski’s rule. In addition, the new compounds showed drug-likeness score (DLS) in the range of 0.11–1.01, compared to 0.62 for palbociclib,
