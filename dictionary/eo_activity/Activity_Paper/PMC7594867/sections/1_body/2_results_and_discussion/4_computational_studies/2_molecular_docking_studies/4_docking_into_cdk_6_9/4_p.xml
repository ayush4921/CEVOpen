<p>The docking procedures into CDK-6/9 were essentially the same as those applied in the docking study into CDK-2
 <sup>25</sup>. Validation of docking study into CDK-6 revealed superposition of the re-docked ligand, palbociclib over the co-crystallized ligand with RMSD of 0.61 Å, while the re-docked CAN508 into CDK-9 superposed the position of the native ligand with RMSD of 1.06 Å (
