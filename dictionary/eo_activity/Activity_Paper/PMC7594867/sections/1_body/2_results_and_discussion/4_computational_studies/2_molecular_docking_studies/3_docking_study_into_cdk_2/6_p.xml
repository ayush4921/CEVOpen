<p>Compound 
 <bold>20a</bold> also adopted binding orientations in which the naphthalenyl-thiourea side chain superpose the position of 4-fluorophenyl-carboxamide moiety in compound

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref>. Moreover, the phenyl-carboxamide side chain in compound 
 <bold>20a</bold> adopted an orientation superposing over the position of the difluorophenyl-carboxamide chain in LZ9, while the pyrrole ring in compound 
 <bold>20a</bold> overlaid partially over the pyrazole ring in LZ9.
