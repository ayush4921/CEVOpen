<p>Moreover, the results of the docking study into CDK-2 indicated the important role of the urea/thiourea moieties in the formation of hydrogen bonding interactions between the tested pyrrolizines (
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold>) and amino acids in the active site of CDK-2. In addition, the pyrrolidine ring in the three compounds also contributed hydrophobically in the binding interactions into CDK-2 through the formation of a cluster of hydrophobic interactions with Ala31, Phe80, Leu134, and Ala144.
