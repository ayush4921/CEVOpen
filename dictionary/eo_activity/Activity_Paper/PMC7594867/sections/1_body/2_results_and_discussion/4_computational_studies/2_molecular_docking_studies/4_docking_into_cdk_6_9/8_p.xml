<p>Compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> also showed the highest affinity towards CDK-9. Investigation of the binding interactions of compound 
 <bold>18b</bold> into CDK-9 revealed one conventional hydrogen bond with Ile25, while compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> showed three hydrogen conventional bonds Thr29, Lys48, and Ala153, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0011">Figure 11</xref>. The results of the docking study into CDKs-6/9 indicated that the three compounds (
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold>) could have potential inhibitory activities against the two kinases.
