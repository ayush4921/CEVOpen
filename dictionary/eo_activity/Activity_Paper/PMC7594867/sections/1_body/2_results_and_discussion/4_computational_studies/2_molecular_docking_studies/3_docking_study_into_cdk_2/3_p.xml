<p>Among the three derivatives, compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> showed higher binding affinity towards CDK-2 compared to compounds 
 <bold>18b</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold> which was matched with their inhibitory activities against CDK-2, 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. In addition, the thiourea 
 <bold>20a</bold> exhibited also higher affinity to CDK-2 compared to the 4-flourophenyl derivative 
 <bold>18b</bold> which was also matched with their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values towards CDK-2, 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. To explain these results, the binding modes, orientations, and interactions of the three compounds (
 <bold>18b, 18a</bold>, and, 
 <bold>20a</bold>) were investigated in comparison to the native ligand to understand their inhibitory activities against CDK-2.
