<p id="par0070">The phenols content in the crude juices were calorimetrically estimated using the Folin- Ciocalteau assay [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The absorbance was performed at 760 nm by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UVmini-1240, Japan). TP content in the crude juices were calculated and presented as milligrams equivalent of gallic acid per gram dry weight (mg GAE/g DW) by refer to regression equation of standard curve (Y = 0.0122x – 0.0066, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9873).
