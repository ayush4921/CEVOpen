<p id="par0105">The scavenging potency of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical of pomegranate leaves and peels, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves crude juices was determined [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The absorbance at 517 nm was measured to assess the remaining amount of DPPH. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was applied as a standard. The ability to scavenge DPPH radicals was calculated using the following equation:
