<p id="p0060">Polyphenols constituents are categorized by the attendance of one or more hydroxy group on an aromatic circle. These components are categorized by their molecular mass, chemical construction, and intricacy to flavonoids (flavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanonols, iso-flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanidins, and chalcones) and non-flavonoid ones (phenolic acids, stilbenes, curcuminoids, lignans, and tannins) (

Thus, polyphenols have recently attracted much attention to the scientific community due to their dietary intake which is related to the deterrence of some chronic and wasting diseases that establish the main reasons of death. The unique properties of their nature and position of the substituents have concerned for biological utilization, namely, antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. These polyphenols have been isolated from a great number of plants, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, tea, coffee, dark chocolate, and so on (

Among the sources of polyphenols, citrus is a promising source due to its content from bioflavonoids including apigenin, acacetin, luteolin, diosmetin, chrysoeriol, and glycosides which play key roles in providing an extensive range of health useful effects. However, polyphenols' super-healthy properties depend on the amount ingested and their bioavailability (
