<p id="Par12">The non-structural proteins of DENV-2, NS1 (PDB IDs: 4O6B) were downloaded from PDB (protein data bank) because of better resolution and used a target for docking. The 3D structures of plant ligands were downloaded from PubChem. Ten ligands were selected for docking were Methyl dodecanoic acid (PubChem ID:5282687), Dodecanoic acid, (PubChem ID:3893), tridecanoic acid 12-methyl-, methyl-ester (PubChem ID: 21204), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2 hexadecen-1-ol (PubChem ID: 5366244), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methylpropyl) ester (PubChem ID: 6782), Hexadecanoic acid, 15-methyl-, methyl ester (PubChem ID: 522345) 9,12-octadecadienoyl chloride, (
