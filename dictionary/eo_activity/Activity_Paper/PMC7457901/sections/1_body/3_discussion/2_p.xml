<p id="Par19">In the present study, we demonstrated that the supercritical extracts of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> show highly significant anti-viral activity against the dengue-2 virus quantitatively with the help of a real-time PCR assay. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is a new extraction technique that is more accurate, safe, reliable, and time-saving, with a higher yield and better-purified compounds compared to conventional methods. The recently reported TaqMan amplification system works the one-step RT-PCR protocol and is a sensitive method for quantification. A previous study suggested that the MNTD of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> are 0.050 and 0.100 mg/ml have anti-dengue activities against DENV-1 serotype on the Vero E6 cells [

 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> as 0.020 mg/ml and 0.023 mg/ml are effective against DENV-1 on HepG2 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present study, the MNTD of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> extract was found 31.25 µg/ml effective against the DENV-2 virus on C6/36 cells. A study demonstrated that silver nanoparticles of 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata, Phyllanthus niruri</italic> and 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> showed potent inhibitory activity against the chikungunya virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For the antiviral assay, a real-time PCR was performed using either fluorescent hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes, as the TaqMan based RT-PCR assay is more specific than an SYBR green-based RT-PCR assay [
