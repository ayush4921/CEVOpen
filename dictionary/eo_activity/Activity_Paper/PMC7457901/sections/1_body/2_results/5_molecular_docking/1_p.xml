<p id="Par17">Ligand shown with blue color (ball and stick) and NS1 with grey color (Ribbon). The binding affinity is shown in bracket along with the name of respective compound and interacting residues illustration between protein (yellow and green) and ligand (white). The hydrogen bonding interaction between the ligands and protein was given in Fig.
