<p id="Par15">This study revealed that the 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> supercritical extract inhibited the 99.9% dengue-2 virus. The percentage of reduction in viral load of an active extract was compared with the positive control containing the same copy number of dengue-2 viruses, which had 1.76 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/ml of the virus after 7 days post-infection in the absence of any extract. The amplification curve was plotted with back titration which contains S1-1000 copies, 10 copies, 100 copies with infected plant extract. The 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> CT value was compared to virus control CT value (18) which contains 100 copies. If CT value increases then the virus decrease. An amplification curve depicting the anti-dengue activity of plant 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> has been shown in Fig.
