<p>2,2-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition was determined as described previously (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, each yogurt extract (16 μL) was mixed with 320 μL of 0.15 mM DPPH solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The mixture was shaken and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 515 nm using an ELISA reader (Synergy 2; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Inhibition of DPPH oxidation (%) was calculated as follows:
