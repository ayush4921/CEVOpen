<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the DPPH radical-scavenging activity of SPW yogurt was 5.81%–10.66%, which was considerably higher than that of SPE yogurt, which was 1.03%–3.24%. Moreover, the ABTS radical-scavenging activity of SPW yogurt was 40.00%–49.67%, but the activity was not detected in SPE yogurt. These results are consistent with those of 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. (2018)</xref>, who reported that the antioxidant activity of yogurt supplemented with water extract of fermented pepper was higher than that of methanol extract. Here, the antioxidant activities of yogurt seemed to increase with the concentration of SPE and SPW. In particular, the antioxidant activity of 1.0% SPW yogurt was the highest, and it was significantly higher than that of plain yogurt (p&lt;0.05). These results can be attributed to the TPC and TFC in the SP. Similar to the antioxidant effects, the TPC and TFC in yogurt increased with the increase in the concentration of SPW and SPE. The TPC and TFC in yogurt supplemented with SPW 1.0% were 393.13 and 320.90 μg/mL, respectively, which were the highest among the yogurt samples (p&lt;0.05). The TPC in yogurt supplemented with SPE and SPW was 93.55–115.12 and 282.52–393.19 μg/mL, respectively, and the TFC was 52.53–77.76 and 180.97–320.90 μg/mL, respectively. It is known that edible safflower yellow pigments, which belong to the C-glucosylquinochalcone family of flavonoids, are water soluble (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kruawan and Kangsadalampai (2006)</xref> reported that the water extract of 
 <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic> L. presented high antioxidant activity and TPC. In summary, the results demonstrated that SP extracted with hot water had greater antioxidant capacity, as evidenced by an increase in the TPC and TFC.
