<p>For years, a wide variety of natural products have been the source for drug discovery due to their various structural characteristics. In this sense, compounds that have at least one phenolic group in their molecular structure represent great diversity, and most of them, including flavonoids, tannins, lignans and phenolic acids, are responsible for the antioxidant properties of many plants [

 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, antioxidant phenolic compounds can be interesting pharmacological tools against several types of viruses. Thus, in the present review, 20 phenolic compounds were selected, and their actions against dengue virus and mechanisms of action are discussed.
