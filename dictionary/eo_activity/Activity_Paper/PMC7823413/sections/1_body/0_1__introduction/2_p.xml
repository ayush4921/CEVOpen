<p>DENV infection is highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. It is estimated that more than 50 million infections occur worldwide each year, and there are more than 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection [

All DENV serotypes can cause symptomatic infections, ranging from mild flu-like syndrome to more severe symptoms, such as coagulopathies and increased vascular permeability that can culminate in dengue hemorrhagic fever and hypovolemic shock [
