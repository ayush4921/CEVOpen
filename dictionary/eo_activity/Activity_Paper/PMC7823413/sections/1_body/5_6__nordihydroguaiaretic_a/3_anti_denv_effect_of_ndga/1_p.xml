<p>A study evaluated the effect of NDGA against DENV-2/NG and DENV-4 infection in Huh-7, U937 and VERO cells. This study concluded that posttreatment with NDGA significantly inhibited DENV replication, causing a reduction in the amount of lipid droplets (neutral lipid storage organelles involved in DENV morphogenesis that increase during infection and are necessary for exocytosis of cellular metabolites and viral proteins, such as NS1) [

Another study showed that treatment with NDGA (100 ÂµM) reduced secreted DENV-NS1 in Huh-7 cells by 92%; furthermore, treatment with NDGA caused dissociation of the structural protein capsid (C) from the lipid droplets, preventing the correct assembly of the DENV viral particle [
