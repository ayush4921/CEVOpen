<p>As described above for CVB3 and JEV, the importance of curcumin in modulating cellular systems, such as the ubiquitin–proteasome, leads to an antiviral effect. In the case of DENV, it has been described that the ubiquitin–proteasome system decreases the concentration of structural E-protein that could affect DENV infection [

According to this, a study concluded that curcumin at different concentrations (10, 15, and 20 μM) caused intracellular accumulation of viral proteins and promoted the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, causing decreased DENV infection. However, the mechanism by which this system affects the replicative cycle has not yet been established [
