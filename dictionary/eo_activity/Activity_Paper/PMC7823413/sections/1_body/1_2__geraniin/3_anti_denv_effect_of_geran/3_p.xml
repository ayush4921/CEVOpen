<p>The anti-DENV effect of geraniin has also been demonstrated in vivo using a model of immunodeficient BALB/c mice, which develop liver damage due to infection with DENV-2 [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The study demonstrated that polyphenol geraniin reduced viremia when administered to mice 72 h after infection (hpi) at a concentration of 131.30 μM prepared in 100 μL PBS. Additionally, histopathology showed that treatment with geraniin 24 h prior to infection could prevent severe liver damage caused by DENV-2 [
