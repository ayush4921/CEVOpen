<p>Catechin, delphinidin, quercetin and EGCG were proven effective against DENV-2 (strain 00st-22A) at an MOI of 0.03 in VERO cells. The inhibition percentages of catechin and delphinidin were above 60%, but quercetin and EGCG showed approximately 90% inhibition at the same concentration (100 μM). In the same study, the antiviral effect of EGCG was probed against the four DENV serotypes, but not other flaviviruses (100 μM), and the possible mechanism of action showed better activity at pretreatment than at posttreatment (DENV-2 MOI of 3.60 μM) [
