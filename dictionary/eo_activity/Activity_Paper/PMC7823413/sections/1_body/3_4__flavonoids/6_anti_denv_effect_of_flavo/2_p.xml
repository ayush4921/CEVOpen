<p>Additionally, the antiviral effect of quercetin has been probed in different DENV-2 strains, such as the NG strain at an MOI of 1 in VERO cells (19.2 μg/mL; SI: 34.3) with pre- and post-treatment inhibition [
 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]; the New Guinea C strain in BHK-21 cells but with a low selectivity index (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 176.76 μg/mL; SI: 0.88) [
 <xref rid="B73-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]; and the TR1751 strain with an MOI of 5 in BHK-21 cells, with inhibition percentages of 60.6% and 75.7% at concentrations of 1 µM and at 10 µM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The possible antiviral effect of quercetin and fisetin has even been reviewed with in silico methods, such as molecular docking, using different DENV viral proteins as possible pharmacological targets, and both could interact with glycoprotein E, glycoprotein NS1, protease NS3 and RdRP NS5. Therefore, it was assumed that polyphenols can have several mechanisms of action that inhibit different stages of the viral replicative cycle [

 <xref rid="B90-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Among six phenolic compounds, quercetin had the best favorable ligand–enzyme consensus score (CScore) of 5.95 with DENV-2 NS2B-NS3 protease [
 <xref rid="B92-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], but it did not have the best binding energy among the other five phenolic compounds with DENV NS5 and envelope proteins [
 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The inhibition and interaction of quercetin and DENV protease as important targets [

 <xref rid="B94-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] could be related to their mechanism of action.
