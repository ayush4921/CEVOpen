<p>Resveratrol, a natural oligomeric stilbene, is a phytoalexin principally derived from grapes, berries, peanuts, and other plant sources as one of the defense mechanisms against infection and stress and is a widely known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent [
 <xref rid="B101-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Oligomeric stilbenes are distributed in more than 15 families of plant species [

 <italic>cis-3</italic>,5,4â€²-trihydroxystilbene, but the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-isomer changes into the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-isomer in the presence of ultraviolet light. These differences could impact the different biological properties [
