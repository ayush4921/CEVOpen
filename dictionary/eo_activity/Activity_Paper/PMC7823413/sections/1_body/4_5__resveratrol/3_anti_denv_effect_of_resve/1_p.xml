<p>A recent study evaluated five natural compounds and found that, among the tested compounds, only resveratrol had an antiviral effect against DENV-2/16681 in HEK293T/17 cells, but not in HepG2 cells, after viral entry. Additionally, a dose-dependent effect was observed (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 11.37 μM) when cells were infected at a low MOI of 0.01, while the dose-dependent effect was not evident at a higher MOI of 2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 24.37 μM) [
