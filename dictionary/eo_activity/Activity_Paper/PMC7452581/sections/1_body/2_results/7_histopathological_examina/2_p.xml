 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), the livers of mice from the control group showed no pathological abnormalities (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). In contrast, APAP treatment resulted in several histopathological changes in the liver, such as major cell necrosis, loss of hepatocyte architecture around the blood vessels, and the infiltration of lymphocytes (
