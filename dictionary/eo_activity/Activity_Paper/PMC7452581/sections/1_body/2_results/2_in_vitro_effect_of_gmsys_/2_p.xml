 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, no significant cytotoxicity was showed in GMSYS at doses of up to 400 μg/mL. APAP significantly decreased cell viability to 43.68 ± 1.04% of the negative control (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 when compared with the APAP group), 200 μg/mL (52.47 ± 0.99% of the negative control,

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 when compared with the APAP group) attenuated the rates of cell death caused by APAP.
