 </xref> Silymarin was therefore used as a positive control. Silymarin and GMSYS were prepared in distilled water, and mice in the control and APAP groups were orally pre-administered with distilled water. Mice in the other groups were orally pre-administered with silymarin or different doses of GMSYS once daily for 7 consecutive days. At 6 h after the final administration, acute liver injury was induced by i.p. with 200 mg/kg APAP prepared in warm distilled water. Mice were fasted for 18 h after APAP injection and then sacrificed with Entobar (pentobarbital sodium; Hanlim Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea). Blood was collected in BD Microtainer blood collection tubes containing EDTA-2 K (Becton Dickinson Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) from the abdominal veins; plasma was separated (3,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C) and then stored at −80°C for subsequent assays. The liver and kidneys were immediately excised and weighed. The right lobe of the liver and the kidneys were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histopathological examinations. The left lobe of the liver was stored at −80°C for other analyses.
