    "<h4>Background</h4>Acetaminophen (<i>N</i>-acetyl-<i>p</i>-aminophenol, APAP) is a safe and effective analgesic at therapeutic dosage. However, APAP overdose is a major cause of acute liver injury. <i>Gamisoyo-san</i> (GMSYS; <i>Jiaweixiaoyao-san</i> in Chinese, <i>Kamishoyo-san</i> in Japanese), a traditional herbal formula, is used to treat phlegm and cough in Korea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of GMSYS against APAP-induced liver injury <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated the effect of GMSYS on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by measuring cell viability in murine BNL CL.2 liver cells. Additionally, BALB/c mice were orally administered with GMSYS once daily for 7 days. Eighteen hours after the last administration, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 200 mg/kg APAP. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, hepatic antioxidants, and histological changes were examined.<h4>Results</h4>Pretreatment with GMSYS attenuated the decrease in cell viability induced by APAP in BNL CL.2 cells. In mice, pre-administration with GMSYS alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing plasma ALT and AST activities and hepatic malondialdehyde, and by increasing the total glutathione (GSH)/reduced GSH ratio and the activities of several antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, GSH-S-transferase, and heme oxygenase-1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GMSYS has a protective effect against APAP-induced acute liver injury by decreasing plasma transaminases and increasing antioxidants. GMSYS may be an effective candidate for the prevention of acute liver injury."
