 </sup>. Several phytochemicals are currently under investigation for their applications in treating SARS-CoV-2, as many research groups have recently reported their studies on the potential use of these materials. One of the studies led by Jin Z. et al

 </sup>, demonstrated that the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2, a prospective drug target involved in the viral replication and transcription, can be targeted by Shikonin, a common plant-derived naphthoquinone. Further study on the molecular docking showed a reasonable docking pose indicating that Shikonin could bind to the substrate pocket

 </sup>, employed the computational based methods to identify chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors (3CL
 <sup>Pro</sup>) from FDA-approved antivirals and natural compounds library. Three antiviral drugs (Remdesivir, Saquinavir, and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (flavone and coumarin derivatives) were identified as potential inhibitors for 3CL
 <sup>Pro</sup> of the coronavirus. Another study on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>Pro</sup> has revealed several potential phytochemical flavonoids, including myricitrin and licoleafol, as inhibitors against this enzyme using the predicted 3D structure
