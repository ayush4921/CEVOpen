<p id="Par29">The viral output of SARS-CoV-2 was reported as the infectious titers that were determined by plaque assay. In brief, Vero cell monolayer was seeded into 6-well plate 24 h before infection. The cells were inoculated with a serial dilution of the virus and incubated for viral adsorption for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were overlaid with 3 mL/well of overlay medium containing MEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% agarose. The culture was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for three days to allow plaque development. After that, plaque phenotypes were visualized by staining with 0.33% Neutral Red solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 5 h. Plaque numbers were counted as plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFUs/mL) and presented as the percentage of plaque reduction.
