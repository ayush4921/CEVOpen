<p>Pellitorine is another compound in 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> that has garnered much research attention. This compound has been shown to be effective against sepsis in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Pellitorine demonstrated excellent protective effects against vascular barrier dysfunction by reducing permeability, CAMs expression, and leukocytes transmigration in HMGB-1-induced HUVECs and mice [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Most importantly, an intravenous dose of pellitorine as low as 9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mouse reduced the mortality of septic mice [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, these evidences suggest that 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> may possess antisepsis effect.
