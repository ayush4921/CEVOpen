<p>Although it is more renowned for its hypoglycemic effect to treat diabetes, increasing evidence supports the antisepsis potential of bitter gourd. An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study involving an LPS-stimulated mouse model of sepsis reported reduced levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6) and an elevated level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in septic mice fed with lyophilized powder of wild bitter gourd-supplemented diet [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These anti-inflammatory effects correlated with reduced levels of ALT, AST, and C-RP, all of which are markers of liver injury, suggesting its hepatoprotective effect [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have also demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of bitter gourd. For example, an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported that wild bitter gourd fruit extracts (hot water, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts) were effective against LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages, mainly by attenuating the secretion of NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and the expression of iNOS and pro-IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Its inhibitory effect on NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> is further supported by other studies which reported similar finding using different extracts of bitter gourd on LPS-stimulated macrophages [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>–
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Together, these findings highlight its potential to prevent the inflammatory response and ensuing organ damage in sepsis.
