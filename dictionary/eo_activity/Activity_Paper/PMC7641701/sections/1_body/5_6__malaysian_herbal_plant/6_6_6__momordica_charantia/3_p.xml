<p>The active constituent(s) responsible for the antisepsis effects of bitter gourd remains unknown; however, numerous active compounds isolated from 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> have recently been shown to have 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-inflammatory activity. Notably, seven compounds isolated from the acetone and methanol extracts of bitter gourd inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages and gentisic acid, 5-O-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-d-xyloside, which was isolated for the first time from bitter gourd, has been shown to inhibit the expression of COX-2 and IL-6 [

 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], charantoside XI exhibited the most significant anti-inflammatory activity on LPS-induced macrophages compared to the other three cucurbitane-type compounds. The antisepsis potential of these active compounds remains to be explored in future studies.
