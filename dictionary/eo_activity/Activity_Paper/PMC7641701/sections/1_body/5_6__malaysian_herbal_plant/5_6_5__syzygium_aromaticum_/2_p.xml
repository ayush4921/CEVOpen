<p>Although 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> flower buds aqueous extract has been shown to inhibit LPS-induced lung inflammation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], neither the extract nor the compound isolated from it has been extensively studied for antisepsis properties. Different extracts (acetone, ethanol, and methanol extracts) of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> flower buds demonstrated antibacterial activity against neonatal sepsis-causing bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp., with the most effective being methanol extract which gave the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. However, this result should be interpreted with caution in terms of its antisepsis potential in general as infections by many other organisms could also lead to sepsis or septic shock. The anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> is supported by several studies. For example, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> has been shown to inhibit the production of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, IL-10, and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> in LPS-induced macrophages [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Bachiega et al. [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] also demonstrated that eugenol inhibited the production of IL-6 and IL-10 but had no effect on IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>. Besides eugenol, another compound isolated from the flower buds of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> called biflorin suppressed LPS-stimulated release of inflammatory mediators such as NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and IL-6 by macrophages. In the same study, biflorin also improved the survival rate of LPS-induced endotoxemic mice [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Overall, the evidence on the antisepsis effect of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> is still limited, and more extensive studies are required in the future.
