<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of ginger is supported by a study which reported that oral administration of dried ginger dissolved in distilled water was able to inhibit LPS-induced inflammation in a mouse model by suppressing the production of IL-6 and IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>, mainly through the inhibition of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway [

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This is consistent with another study which reported that the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 was able to abrogate liver injury [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. These results suggest that the ginger extract may be beneficial not only as an anti-inflammatory agent but also to protect against tissue and organ damage commonly observed in severe sepsis cases.
