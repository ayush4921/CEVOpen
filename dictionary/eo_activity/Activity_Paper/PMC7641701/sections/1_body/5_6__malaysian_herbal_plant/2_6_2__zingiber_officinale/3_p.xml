<p>An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Tripathi et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] demonstrated that the alcoholic extract of ginger suppressed LPS-induced activation of macrophages as indicated by decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-12, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) and chemokines (Regulated on Activation Normal T-Cells Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1). Another study also reported that the major constituent of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>—6-gingerol—exhibited similar inhibitory effects on LPS-stimulated macrophages [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of the alcoholic extract of ginger reported previously [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] were largely attributed to 6-gingerol. Moreover, 6-gingerol was also shown to decrease the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), two common biomarkers of liver injury, in CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Indeed, both its anti-inflammatory activity and its ability to suppress liver injury further highlight the antisepsis potential of 6-gingerol.
