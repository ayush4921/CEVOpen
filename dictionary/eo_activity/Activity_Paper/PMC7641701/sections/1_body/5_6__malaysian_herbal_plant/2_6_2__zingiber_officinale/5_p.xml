<p>Other than 6-gingerol and zingerone, there are various active compounds isolated from ginger that have also shown great anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced macrophages, especially the shogaols, gingerols, and gingerdiones. Among the shogaols, 6-shogaol has been reported by a few 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to suppress LPS-induced inflammatory mediator production by inhibiting the expression of iNOS and COX-2 [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>–
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Moreover, 1-dehydro-10-gingerdione has also been shown to have similar inhibitory activity on iNOS expression, resulting in reduced production of NO [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Other gingerols (8- and 10-gingerol) and gingerdiones (1-dehydro-6-gingerdione and 12-dehydrogingerdione) are just a few among those that have been demonstrated to have 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>–
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] and may be further investigated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for their potential therapeutic use for sepsis.
