<p>A previous study reported that oral administration of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> extract-loaded nanoemulsion (CLEN) was able to improve the survival rate of LPS-induced lethal endotoxemic mice [

 <italic>C. longa</italic>. The protective effect of CLEN against endotoxin-induced mortality was associated with its ability to reduce serum levels of HMGB-1 and the expression of iNOS in various tissues including heart, lung, liver, and kidney [
