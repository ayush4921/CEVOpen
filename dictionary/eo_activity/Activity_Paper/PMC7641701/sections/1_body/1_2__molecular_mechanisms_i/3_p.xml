<p>Apart from causing organ damage, inflammatory mediators could also cause injury on the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, leading to endothelial dysfunctionâ€”a common feature of both sepsis and septic shock [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Endothelial dysfunction is accompanied by increased permeability, which could lead to vascular leakage and subsequently life-threatening conditions due to edema and hypotension [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Under normal physiological condition, NO is produced by endothelial cells using the constitutively expressed form of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme. However, excessive production of NO by the inducible form of NOS (iNOS) was found to contribute to hypotension and vascular abnormalities in patients with septic shock [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Damaged endothelial cells also release tissue factors that may activate a coagulation cascade which in turn could disturb the homeostatic balance in sepsis patients [
