<p>For some herbal plants, evidence on their antisepsis potential is largely demonstrated by specific constituents or compounds isolated from the plant extracts. For instance, andrographolide is a major constituent in the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and is thought to largely contribute to the antisepsis effect of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> ethyl acetate extract in LPS-induced endotoxemia [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Andrographolide at a dose of 1 to 10 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection was demonstrated to attenuate acute lung injury and acute liver injury in LPS-induced and LPS-/D-galactosamine-induced mice, respectively [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], whereas a relatively lower dose (3.5 to 7 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mouse) via intravenous injection enhanced the survival of CLP-induced mice [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, curcumin is the major constituent and it has been shown to promote survival and exert organ-protective effects against sepsis-induced injury in numerous studies [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>–
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. It is likely that the antisepsis effect of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, as indicated by the enhanced survival rate of LPS-induced mice receiving CLEN treatment [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], is attributed to curcumin. Both andrographolide and curcumin are the most pharmacologically active constituent and the most widely studied phytochemical in their respective plants [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>].
