<p>The 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO was evaluated for neuroprotective properties against AMPAR-current induction, deactivation, and desensitization rates. The amplitude generated by different AMPA-type receptors was recorded 
 <italic>via</italic> whole-cell patch technique on HEK293 AMPAR expressing cells. Using glutamate alone, the current produced (
 <italic>A</italic>) was then compared to the induced current obtained from glutamate plus EO amplitude (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>) for calculating any significant inhibition solely from the extract as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Preceding the compound treatment, HEK293 cells were normalized for the control 
 <italic>via</italic> 500 ms intervals of agonist; the initially acquired amplitude of GluA1, GluA2, GluA1/2, and GluA2/3 was recorded at 964 ± 55 pA, 1293 ± 63 pA, 490 ± 31 pA, and 452 ± 39 pA, respectively. No significant inhibition was observed by treating the cell with the EO as the amplitude slightly dropped to 812 ± 26 pA, 1095 ± 38 pA, 408 ± 33 pA, and 410 ± 28 pA following the previous order. Nonetheless, the impact of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO on AMPAR desensitization and deactivation was tested. The fast amplitude (
 <italic>τf</italic>), the slow amplitude (
 <italic>τs</italic>), and the relative amplitude of both (
 <italic>τf</italic>) and (
 <italic>τs</italic>) represented by (
 <italic>af</italic>) were used to attain the weighted tau (
 <italic>τw</italic>) for AMPAR-current deactivation and desensitization 
 <italic>via</italic> fitting exponentials. The desensitization before 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO treatment for GluA1, GluA2, GuA1/2, and GluA2/3 was 2.8 ± 0.1 ms, 2.3 ± 0.1 ms, 5.3 ± 0.2 ms, and 2.5 ± 0.3 ms, respectively. After treatment, the desensitization significantly increased to 3.7 ± 0.2 ms, 3.9 ± 0.2 ms, 6.8 ± 0.4 ms, and 3.5 ± 0.3 ms, respectively. The desensitization rate was 0.27, 0.26, 0.15, and 0.28, respectively. Likewise, the same significant effect of oil on AMPAR deactivation rate was observed, whereby the rate dropped from 0.43 ± 0.1, 0.45 ± 0.1, 0.42 ± 0.3, and 0.38 ± 0.2 to 2.6 ± 0.3, 0.24 ± 0.2, 0.21 ± 0.4, and 0.26 ± 0.3 for GluA1, GluA2, GluA1/2, and GluA2/3, respectively.
