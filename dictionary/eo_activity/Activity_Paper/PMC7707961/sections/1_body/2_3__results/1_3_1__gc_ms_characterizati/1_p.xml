<p>GC-MS analysis of the EO of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> growing in Palestine revealed that 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane 
 <bold>1</bold> (27.51%), caryophyllene oxide 
 <bold>2</bold> (20.08%), and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Twenty compounds amounting to about 100% of total EO have been identified, where the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, spiroalkane, and oxide sesquiterpenoid groups were the major groups. The phytochemical composition, retention index (RI), and retention time (RT) with their concentration (%) are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and the GC-MS chromatogram (
