<p>The wavelengths of maximum absorption of rutin and the developed tinctures were used for the measurements of the absorbance for the TFC calculation. It was revealed that rutin trihydrate and tinctures of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb have the maximum absorption at a wavelength of 411 ± 1 nm and in the range of 386–390 nm, respectively, in their differential spectra (
