<p>The obtained results are partly in line with the published studies earlier [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Kremer et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] identified six phenolic compounds (rutin, quercetin, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, ellagic, rosmarinic and syringic acids) using HPLC in methanolic and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>S. montana.</italic> Amount of rosmarinic acid as a predominant compound of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb (0.21–7.84 µg/mg) depends on the used technological ways and solvents [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In ethylacetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> the hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (protocatechuic, syringic and vanilic acids), hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (caffeic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, and ferulic acids), (±)-catechin and (–)-epicatechin were identified [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid and luteolin were identified in the extracts obtained with the aid of 80% ethanol from 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> collected in Egypt [
