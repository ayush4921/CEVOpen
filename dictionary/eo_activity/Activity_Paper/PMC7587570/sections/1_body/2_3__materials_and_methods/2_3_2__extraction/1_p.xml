<p>All the tinctures were obtained in a ratio of the herbal substance to a final product as approximately 1 to 10. As a solvent, 70% ethanol was used. The herbal substance was reduced to pieces. The crushed herbal substance was sieved through suitable sieves with the size of holes of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 mm. Then the ground herbal substance of the appropriate size was mixed with 70% ethanol. The mixtures stood in closed containers. Maceration was performed at room temperature for 7 days. After this period the residue was separated from the extraction solvent by means of filtration through a paper filter. Remaceration included maceration for 24 h with the following three macerations for a period of 2 h for each one. Filtration was performed after each maceration and the obtained liquids were combined. Therefore, the total maceration was for a period of 30 h (24 h + 3 macerations Ã— 2 h = 30 h).</p>
