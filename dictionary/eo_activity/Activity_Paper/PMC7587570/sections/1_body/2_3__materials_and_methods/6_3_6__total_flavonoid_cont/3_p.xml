<p>The second way was used for the other tinctures. Instead of plotting a calibration curve, a point of 50 µL of a stock solution of rutin trihydrate (1000 mg/L) was used at least one time per day. In this case TFC was calculated using the following formula: C = A

 <italic>m</italic> × 1000 × 
 <italic>k</italic>/A

  <sub>rutin</sub>

  <sub>rutin</sub>

 <italic>
  <sub>test</sub>
 </italic> is the absorbance of a reaction mixture of a tincture at the absorption maximum, A
 <italic>
  <sub>rutin</sub>
 </italic> is the absorbance of a reaction mixture of rutin solution in a concentration of 50 mg/L at the absorption maximum, m (mg) is mass of rutin trihydrate for the preparation of the stock solution (approximately 1000 mg/L), k is coefficient for the recalculation of rutin trihydrate into rutin (0.917), and V
 <italic>
  <sub>rutin</sub>
 </italic> is a volume in which rutin was dissolved.
