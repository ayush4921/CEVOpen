<p id="Par12">The aim of this paper was to compile an up-to-date botanical overview of the VOP medicinal plant market, concentrating on species composition and vernacular names. Specifically, we wanted to know what plant species are sold at the medicinal stalls of VOP today and how these differed from those listed by Van den Berg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We also compared the vernacular names for species in use today with those reported by Van den Berg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, we investigated whether the origin of currently marketed plant species and their attributed vernacular names reflected the cultural backgrounds of the VOP sellers. Our three hypotheses were as follows. First, we expected to find a higher and different medicinal species composition due to our methodological approach, which differed from that of previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and because the diversity of medicinal plants being offered for sale changes over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Availability of plant species changes from time period to time period, certain plants are conserved, new species are added, and other species are lost over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Second, we hypothesize that vernacular plant names would remain similar over time, as previously found in the Amazonian context [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thirdly, with their own language backgrounds, religious faiths, and practices, the VOP sellers are of mixed descent: indigenous, African, and European [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This mix of peoples is found throughout Brazil and influences the Brazilian Portuguese lexicon, including names of flora and fauna [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Afro-Brazilians of the Bahia state in northeastern Brazil, where a considerable number of enslaved Africans were forcefully brought to, sometimes use African-derived names for plants used in a medicinal and ritual context [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Also, many plant names in Surinam, a neighboring country to Brazil with a comparable history in the triangular trade involving the dislocation of western Africans, have African etymologies, influenced by the enslaved peoples that were forced to work there under brutal conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, following these examples, we hypothesized that the multicultural origins of the current population of north Brazil, including VOP sellers and consumers, would be reflected in the speciesâ€™ origin and vernacular names [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the end, the outcome of this research contributes to the understanding of the present biocultural diversity of one of the largest and most biodiverse markets in South America.
