<p id="Par19">We recorded 155 plant specimens with in total 165 corresponding vernacular names and collected 146 specimens from the medicinal stalls of the VOP (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Most of the vernacular names had Portuguese roots (59%), followed by Tupi (28%) roots, while three names had unknown origins (2%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). If a name had a double etymological root, they were classified in separate categories. We found names that had a combination of Tupi and Portuguese roots (9%) and African and Portuguese roots (2%). For example, 
 <italic>uxi-amarelo</italic> (
 <italic>Endopleura uchi</italic> (Huber) Cuatrec.) is a combination of a Tupi plant (
 <italic>uxi</italic>) and the Portuguese term for yellow (
 <italic>amarelo</italic>). Likewise, 
 <italic>Tapete de Oxalá</italic> (
 <italic>Episcia cupreata</italic> (Hook.) Hanst.) is a combination of an African term (the god Oxalá) and the Portuguese term for rug.
