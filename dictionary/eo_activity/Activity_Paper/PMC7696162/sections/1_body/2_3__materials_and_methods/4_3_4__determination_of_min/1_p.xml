<p>The MIC and MBC values of the test samples against the MRSA strains were established as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The determination was performed in a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate (Greiner, Germany) using a 2-fold standard broth microdilution method with an inoculum of about 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. The first well, designated as the negative control, was filled with 100 µL MHB. The second well, designated as the positive control, was filled with 100 µL of the bacterial suspension. A 100 µL aliquot of the test extract or fraction, prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, was then added to the 12th well. Two-fold dilutions were then made from the 12th well down to the 3rd well. Therefore, the 12th well contained the highest concentration (5 mg/mL), while the 3rd well contained the lowest concentration (0.01 mg/mL). The plate was then incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37 °C. After the incubation period, the MIC of the test extract or solvent fraction was determined. The MIC value is defined as the lowest concentration of the test sample that inhibited bacterial growth completely. For determining the MBC value, a 10 µL aliquot of the suspension in each of the 12 wells of the MIC determination was subcultured on an MHA plate. The plate was then incubated for 24 h, at 37 °C. After the incubation period, the plate was observed for bacterial growth and the MBC value was determined. The MBC is defined as the lowest concentration of the test sample that killed the bacterial strain completely. The MIC and MBC values were determined in duplicate. Chlorhexidine (0.1% CHX, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as a positive control. The antimicrobial activity of plant extracts may be expressed in different ways, including total activity values [
