<p>Antibacterial activity was evaluated using agar diffusion assay, according to Rukayadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Briefly, an inoculum of the bacterial strain was streaked on the surface of MHA plates using a sterile cotton swab. Sterile 6 mm filter paper discs (Whatman, Germany) were prewetted with 10 µL aliquot of the test extracts or fractions, prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The discs were then placed on the inoculated plates at an appropriate distance from each other. Positive (chlorhexidine, 0.1% CHX, St Louis, MO, USA) and negative (dimethyl sulfoxide, 10% DMSO, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) control discs were similarly prepared and placed on each test plate. Inoculated plates were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 37 
 <monospace>°</monospace>C and observed for inhibition zones. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and inhibition zone diameter (IZD) was measured in mm. Antibacterial activity was expressed as the percentage of relative inhibition zone diameter (RIZD) with respect to standard antibiotic (0.1% CHX), according to Alsohaili and Al-fawwaz [
