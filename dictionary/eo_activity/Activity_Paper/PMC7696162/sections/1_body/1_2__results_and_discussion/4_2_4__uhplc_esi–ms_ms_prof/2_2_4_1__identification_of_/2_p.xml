<p>Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> has a pseudomolecular ion of 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 315.0720, indicative of the molecular formula C
 <sub>13</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>O
 <sub>9</sub>. It was identified as dihydroxybenzoic acid 
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside based on fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 153 for [M-H-162]
 <sup>−</sup>, due to the loss of a hexoxyl moiety, and fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 109 for [M-H-162-44]
 <sup>−</sup> indicating a further loss of CO
 <sub>2</sub> moiety, in agreement with Karar and Kuhnert [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, compound 
 <bold>14</bold>, which exhibited a pseudomolecular ion of 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 329.0878 and base peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 167 for [M-H-162]
 <sup>−</sup> for a neural loss of a hexoxyl moiety, was assigned as vanillic acid-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside. The assignment was supported by comparison with the fragmentation pattern previously reported by Morales-Soto et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
