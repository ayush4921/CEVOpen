<p>Three compounds (
 <bold>12</bold>, 
 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>21</bold>) were identified as the dimeric forms of B-type proanthocyanidins (PAs), which could be differentiated from the A-type Pas with the extra 2 Da in their pseudomolecular ion [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>12</bold>, showing pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 577.1334, was identified as the (epi)catechin + (epi)catechin. The compound also exhibited a fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 425 ([M–H-152]
 <sup>−</sup>), which was due to the characteristic RDA cleavage at ring C of the dimer top unit [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 407 ([M-H-152-18]
 <sup>−</sup>) due to the subsequent loss of a water molecule from the parent molecule was also observed. The presence of two other dimeric derivatives, 
 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>21</bold>, was also indicated by the pseudomolecular ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 729.1458 (Rt = 4.03 min) and 729.1453 (Rt = 5.25 min). These compounds were identified as (epi)catechin gallate + (epi)catechin isomers based on the fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/z 577 indicative of galloyl moiety losses ([M-H-152]
 <sup>−</sup>) from the parent ion [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>20</bold> at Rt = 5.20 min was identified as (epi)catechin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate. It displayed a pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 441.0823. Its fragmentation pattern showed a fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 289 for [M-H-169]
 <sup>−</sup>, which corresponded to a loss of gallic acid moiety via cleavage of the ester bond and loss of the (epi)catechin unit [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
