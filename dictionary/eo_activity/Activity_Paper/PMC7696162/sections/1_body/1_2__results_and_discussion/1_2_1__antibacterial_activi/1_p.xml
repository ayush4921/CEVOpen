<p>Disc diffusion test was used to first screen the crude methanolic extracts and solvent fractions for presence of antibacterial activity. The appearance of zones of inhibition produced around the discs was observed, and their diameters were measured and recorded (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01539-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The standard antibiotic, 0.1% CHX, showed inhibition zones ranging from 7.00 to 10.33 mm against the bacterial strains. At the test concentration of 10 mg/mL, the crude methanolic extracts of the leaf and stem bark showed inhibition zones in the ranges of 8.00–9.67 mm and 7.00–10.00 mm, respectively. Among the different solvent fractions of the leaf, the EtOAc fraction showed the greatest activity towards all the bacterial strains, giving inhibition zones of 13.66, 12.00, 13.67 and 13.00 mm against MRSA ATCC 700699, MRSA KCCM 12255, MRSA1 and MRSA2, respectively. The same trend was observed for the stem bark fractions. However, compared to the leaf EtOAc fraction, the stem bark EtOAc fraction showed smaller inhibition zones of 8.00–9.00 mm, indicating that the stem bark either contained different bioactive constituents or lower amounts of the same bioactive constituents [

 <italic>A. pavarii</italic>. They reported that the methanol extract exhibited the highest activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The chloroform extract was active only against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while the n-hexane extract showed activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Overall, these results indicated that the polarity of the solvent plays an important role in the extraction of the active ingredients and consequently in their potential antimicrobial activity.
