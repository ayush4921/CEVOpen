<p>On the other hand, the MIC values of the crude stem bark methanolic extract were lower than the leaf extract, ranging between 0.63 and 1.25 mg/mL, while the MBC values ranged between 1.25 and 2.50 mg/mL. The stem bark methanolic extract was more potent against the standard MRSA strain, ATCC 700699 (MIC 0.63 mg/mL; MBC 1.25 mg/mL), than against MRSA KCCM 12255 and the two clinical isolates as it showed MIC and MBC values of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively, against these three strains. In comparison, the stem bark EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions were less potent towards all the MRSA strains, except against the clinical isolate MRSA2 (MIC 0.63 mg/mL; MBC 1.25 mg/mL).</p>
