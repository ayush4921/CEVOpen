<p id="Par44">The formation of gold nanoparticles was verified by the presence of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band, with maximum absorption between 500 and 550 nm, using UV–Vis spectroscopy. The spectra were collected at different times of formation using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Implen, Munich, Germany). AuNPs concentration used in the biological analysis was performed by Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) using a Nanosight NS300 with 488 nm laser (Malvern Instruments). The morphology, shape, size and elemental composition of AuNPs were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM FEI TECNAI G
 <sup>2</sup> F20 coupled with Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), operating a beam voltage of 200 keV. The diameter distribution was obtained using the Image J (NIH, USA) software using the TEM images. The crystalline structure of AuNPs was assessed by Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). For Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), biosynthesized AuNPs dispersion was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. AuNPs pellet was washed three times with deionized water with 50% ethanol to remove the excess of the extract from the AuNPs solution. The samples were lyophilized, and AuNPs powder or the BRP crude extract were mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) to obtain pellets. FTIR spectra were recorded using an IRTracer-100 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, JA) in the range of 4500 to 500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with a resolution of 2 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. TGA was carried out using an SDT Q 600 thermal analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The samples were placed in platinum pans and heated under an inert atmosphere with a rate of 10 °C/min at 900 °C.
