<p id="Par47">Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter‑Glo Assay kit (Promega Corporation). The kit reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. PC-3 cells were plated onto a 96-well plate at a density of 20,000 cells per well. The CellTiter‑Glo reagent was added to the washed cells 24 h after the treatments. The plates were shaken for 10 min at room temperature, followed by luminescence measurement using absorbance/fluorescence plate reader (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, BioTek).</p>
