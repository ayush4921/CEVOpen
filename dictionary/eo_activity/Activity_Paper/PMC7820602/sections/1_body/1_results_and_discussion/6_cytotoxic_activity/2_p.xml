<p id="Par29">Dose-dependent cytotoxic activity was observed in all samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The BRP crude extract and its fraction showed a high cytotoxic effect (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, extracts with IC

 </sup>. Moreover, BRP crude extract and dichloromethane fraction exhibited the highest cytotoxic effect (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). BRP crude extract and dichloromethane fraction present similar phytochemical composition such as formononetin, liquiritigenin, and medicarpin in high concentration, which are known to exhibit cytotoxic activity in different cancer cells (Table
