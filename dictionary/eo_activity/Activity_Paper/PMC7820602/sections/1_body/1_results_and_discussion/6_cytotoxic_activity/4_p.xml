<p id="Par31">Ethyl acetate fraction and AuNP
 <sub>ethyl acetate</sub> showed the least activity among the samples tested. These results could be related to the absence of compounds such as medicarpin and the benzophenones (present in extract and hexane fraction), which could have an important role in the anti-cancer activity and the synergism effect between the molecules. Some studies proposed that the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of propolis against cancer cells might be correlated to the synergism between properties of several compounds and may not exclusively due to the concentration of a specific molecule
