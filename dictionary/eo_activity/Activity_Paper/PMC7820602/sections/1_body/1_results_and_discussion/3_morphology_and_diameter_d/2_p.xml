<p id="Par16">The average size, measured by TEM, was in the range of 8–15 nm for all gold nanoparticles showing a narrow particle size distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,d,f,h). The smaller nanoparticles showed spherical shapes, whereas the larger particles exhibited several geometrical forms, such as triangles, pentagons, hexagons, and rods (Fig.
