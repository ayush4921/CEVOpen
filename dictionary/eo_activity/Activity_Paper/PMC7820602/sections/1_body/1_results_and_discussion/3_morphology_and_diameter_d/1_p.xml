 </sup>. Hexane fraction is rich in benzophenones (Guttiferone E; Oblongifolin A), while ethyl acetate fraction is rich in flavonoids and isoflavonoids such as liquiritigenin, formononetin, vestitol, and neovestitol. BRP crude extract and dichloromethane fraction present a similar phytochemical profile (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
