 <sub>extract</sub> and AuNP
 <sub>ethyl acetate</sub> showed low or no antimicrobial activity that can be associated with the low amounts of medicarpin, vestitol, and benzophenones in these extract and fraction. Moreover, ethyl acetate fraction did not present benzophenones showing the lower antimicrobial activity.
