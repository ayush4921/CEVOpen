<p id="p0500">Modern reviews show that the bioassay-guided method is used in TB drug discovery to identify bioactive compounds from natural crude extract(s). This process includes alternating steps to identify the bioactive compounds of natural compounds by using bioassays and chemical fractionation; hence, multiple samples are taken for mycobacteriologyâ€“herbal product chemistry analysis (

In recent years, chromatography and spectroscopy techniques have spearheaded technological advancements that have improved the sensitivity of fractionation procedures for natural products and made way for new studies on unknown materials, previously inspected genera and unknown chemical and new bioactive compounds (

Thus, the development of new phytochemical approaches for bioassaying anti-TB drugs is essential to produce highly effective ways of discovering herbal resources. The terminal point must be chosen wisely to present the good orientation of bioassay steps. Bioassay-guided drug discovery has been performed for different medicinal plants, such as
