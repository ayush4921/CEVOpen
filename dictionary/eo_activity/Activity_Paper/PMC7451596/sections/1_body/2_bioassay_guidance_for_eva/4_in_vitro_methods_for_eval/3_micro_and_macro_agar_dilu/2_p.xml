<p id="p0515">The activities and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of new natural plant extracts with known concentrations, fractions or materials can be quantified and evaluated in agar media. Except for many fastidious organisms, most mycobacterial strains, such as MTB, tend to produce active colonies on Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar media, which comprise oleic acid, albumin, dextrose and catalase (
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2007</xref>). The sample to be tested can be added to the semisolid media at 1% v/v final concentration and then, 100–200 µl, 4 ml, 1.5 ml and 20 ml of media are added to 96-well, 6-well, 24-well microplates or 150 mm diameter petri dishes, respectively. Once the agar has solidified, the inoculum is dropped on the medium surface by using a micro pipette. Then, 100 µl of inoculum is spread on Petri dishes, 10 µl of inoculum is spread on 6- or 24-well plates and 1–5 µl of inoculum is spread on 96-well plates. Incubated plates are kept overnight at 37 °C, and the plates should be inverted for the remaining incubation period. The major weakness of such a bioprocedure is that approximately a minimum of 18 days is needed for the visible growth of
