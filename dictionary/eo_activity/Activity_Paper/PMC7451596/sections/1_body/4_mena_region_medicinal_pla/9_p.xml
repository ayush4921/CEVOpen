 <italic>S. aintabensis</italic> presents activity against four strains of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with the MIC of 12.5–100 μg/ml and the petroleum ether fractions showed activity against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and H37Ra with MIC of 25 and 50 μg/ml respectively. The ethyl acetate fractions exhibited MIC value of 12.5 μg/ml against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and H37Ra, respectively. The strong properties due to present high quaintity of phenolic compound such as rosmarinic acid, naringenin, hesperidin, luteolin, caffeic acid were investigated. The ethanol extraction for 
 <italic>S. sylvatica</italic> L and fraction by petroleum ether showed MIC value at 50 μg/ml against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra.
