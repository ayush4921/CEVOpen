<p id="Par16">In Ethiopia, there has been success in the past recent years to reduce malaria burden. However, it is still prevalent in 75% of the country putting over 45 million people at risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The disease accounts for 7% of outpatient visits to health clinics and represents the third largest cause of morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, 8% of global 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria cases occur in Ethiopia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hence, the fight against malaria in Ethiopia remains a public health priority.
