<p id="Par30">Docking study was carried out on two crystal structures of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> enzymes plasmepsin II (Protein Data Bank; PDB: 4CKU) and l-lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH) [PDB: 1LDG], using SeeSar10.0 software (BioSolveIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany). For plasmepsin II, the selected binding site was the binding pocket of a previously designed inhibitor P2FE-400, 5-(1,1-dioxido-1,2-thiazinan-2-yl)-N1-((2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-4-((2-(3-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-yl)amino)-1-phenylbutan-2-yl)-N3,N3-dipropylisophthalamide; while for pfLDH, the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) binding site was selected for docking. The HYDE score was used to estimate the binding affinity of the molecules [
