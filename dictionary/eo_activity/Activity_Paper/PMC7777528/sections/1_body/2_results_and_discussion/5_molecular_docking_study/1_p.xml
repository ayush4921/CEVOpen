<p id="Par42">To get further insight on the mechanism of action of the isolated compounds and to study their binding interaction and identify hypothetical binding motifs, a docking study of knipholone, dianellin and the standard anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and artemisinin were carried out on two crystal structures of target enzymes. The two 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> enzymes were plasmepsin II (PDB code 4cku) involved in haemoglobin metabolism by the parasite, and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> l-lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH) (PDB code 1ldg) involved in glycolysis (or glucose metabolism of the parasite) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. There is a strong suggestion that haemoglobin digesting enzymes found in the food vacuole of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and pfLDH are potential anti-malarial chemotherapeutic targets for chloroquine and related aminoquionlones, anthraquinones and other oxidative phenolic compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Gossypol and other phenolic compounds were also found to be pfLDH inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Besides, chloroquine has been found to bind to the cofactor (NADH) binding site of pfLDH acting as a competitive inhibitor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].
