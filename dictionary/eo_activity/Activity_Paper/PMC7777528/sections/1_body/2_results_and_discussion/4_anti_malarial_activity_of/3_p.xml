<p id="Par39">Previously, the methanol and dichloromethane extracts of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> as well as dimeric anthraquinones, knipholone and dianellin isolated therefrom have been shown to have in vitro activity against chloroquine-resistant (W2) and chloroquine-sensitive (D6 and 3D7) strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The ED
 <sub>50</sub> of knipholone (1.49 μg/ml) against 3D7 strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was much lower than that of dianellin which showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.14 and 5.47 µg/ml against W2 and D6 strains, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, knipholone isolated from 
 <italic>Bulbine capitata</italic> and 
 <italic>Bulbine frutescens</italic> has been reported to possess in vitro activity against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) strains with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.06 and 1.7 µM, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].
