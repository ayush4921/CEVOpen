<p id="p0150">The present study demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruits peel extract attenuated enzyme inhibition in DM, obesity, and hypertension. In addition, FT-IR and GC-MS analyses of ethanolic extract of fruits peel revealed the occurrence of diverse bioactive compounds. Further extensive studies are required to get a deeper insight of not only on 
 <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking mechanisms of the bioactive substances in the metabolic pathway of obesity and hypertension in DM but also pivotal therapeutic role of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruits peel through 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.
