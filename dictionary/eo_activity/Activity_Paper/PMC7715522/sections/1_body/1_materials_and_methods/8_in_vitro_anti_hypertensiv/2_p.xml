<p id="p0060">Anti-hypertensive properties of extracts were determined in terms of ACE inhibition using UV–Vis spectrophotometer based on hippuric acid formation ability from hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leusine (HHL) catalyzed by ACE (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhary et al., 2014</xref>). Angiotensin converting enzyme (50 µL; 25 mU/mL) was mixed with 50 μL of the test solution at 37 °C for 10 min. On the other hand, substrate (150 μL; 8.3 mM of HHL in 50 mM sodium borate buffer constituting 0.5 M sodium chloride, pH 8.2) was mixed with solution and kept for 30 min at room temperature. Further, 250 μL of 1 M HCl was added into the mixture to stop the reaction, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL of ethyl acetate and centrifugation of mixture at 800

Ramipril (3.6 ng/mL) was used as standard and ACE inhibition was estimated according to the equation given below:
