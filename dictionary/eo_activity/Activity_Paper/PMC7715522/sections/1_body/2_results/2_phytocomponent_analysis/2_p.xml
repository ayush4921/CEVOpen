 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrates the presence of fundamental preliminary phytochemical components in different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> peel. The investigation uncovered the availability of disparate phytochemicals in aqueous peel extract. Ethanolic extract was also reported rich in carbohydrates, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, quinones, glycosides, cardiac glycosides, terpenoids, phenols, coumarins, and steroids. In contrary, acetone extract demonstrated the availability of limited phytoconstituents while chloroform extract contained tannins, alkaloids, quinones, terpenoids, and steroids. Quinones and phenols were observed only phytochemicals present in petroleum ether extract.
