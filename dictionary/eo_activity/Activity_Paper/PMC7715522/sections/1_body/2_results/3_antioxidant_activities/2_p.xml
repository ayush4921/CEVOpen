 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a shows the DPPH scavenging activities of peel extracts at different concentrations. At the highest concentration (1000 μg/mL), extracts showed DPPH radical degrading activities of 87.6 ± 1.8 and 78.32 ± 1.9%, respectively with respect to ascorbic acid (97.35 ± 1.6%). Result disclosed that aqueous extract, ethanolic extract, and ascorbic acid had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 471.70, 509.16, and 390.93 μg/mL, respectively.
