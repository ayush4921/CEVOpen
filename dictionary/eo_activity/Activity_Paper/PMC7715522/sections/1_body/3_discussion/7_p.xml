<p id="p0145">FT-IR and GC-MS chromatograms of ethanolic extract of fruits peel revealed the occurrence of a diverse bioactive components, particularly 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol, Dimethyl sulfone, 9-octadecenamide, and Pentadecanoic acid. Findings hypothesized that these bioactive metabolites may prevent metabolic diseases by inhibiting carbohydrate digestion and stimulating the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells (
