The massive therapeutic significance of plants exclusively relies upon the bioactive composites, particularly phytochemicals that produce physiological effects on human health. In this regard, an alternative approach to diversiform chemical constituents of the medicinal plant becomes imperative to the scientific community to validate and document its medicinal applications just as precursors for organizing complex synthetic substances. Therefore, this investigation established a distinctive role of
