  <p>Effects of HBL and HBB on Nrf2 activation. (A) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for the indicated times. (B) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 1 h. (C) RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with SB203580 (20 µM) or NAC (10 mM) for 2 h and then co-treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 1 h. After the treatment, nuclear protein was prepared. The cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting was performed using an antibody against Nrf2. TBP was used as the internal control for western blot analysis. *P&lt;0.05 vs. cells without HBL or HBB treatment. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; NAC, N-acetyl-L-cysteine; TBP, TATA-box-binding protein; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide.</p>
