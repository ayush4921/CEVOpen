  <p>Effects of p38 and ROS on the changes in HO-1 expression mediated by HBL and HBB. (A) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with SB203580 (20 µM, p38 inhibitor) or NAC (10 mM, ROS scavenger) for 2 h and then co-treated with HBL (200 µg/ml) for 6 h or HBB (200 µg/ml) for 10 h. (B) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL or HBB for 24 h and then the ROS level was measured using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining. (C) RAW264.7 cells were treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for the indicated times. (D) RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with NAC (10 mM) for 2 h and then co-treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 20 min. The cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting was performed using antibodies against HO-1, P-p38 and p38. Actin was used as an internal control for western blot analysis. *P&lt;0.05 vs. cells without HBL or HBB treatment. ROS, reactive oxygen species; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; NAC, N-acetyl-L-cysteine; P, phosphorylated; T, total; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide.</p>
