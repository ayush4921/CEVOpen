<p>The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 is associated with the upregulation of HO-1 expression (

 <xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, whether HBL and HBB influence the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 was investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f7-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 significantly increased after 1 h of HBL and HBB treatment. In addition, HBL and HBB induced a concentration-dependent increase in the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (

 <xref rid="f7-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB induced the upregulation of HO-1 protein through the activation of ROS, p38 and Nrf2.
