<p>RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with HBL, HBB or HBF for 4 h to ensure that the extracts were sufficiently absorbed by the cells, and then co-treated with LPS for 20 h so that inflammatory mediators were expressed by LPS in sufficient quantities for detection (

 <xref rid="f1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which indicates that the inhibition of NO production by HBL and HBB was not due to the cytotoxicity of the extracts. The effects of HBL and HBB on cell viability in the presence of LPS were also evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, treatment with LPS alone decreased cell viability, while HBL and HBB attenuated the LPS-induced reduction in cell viability. The ability of HBL and HBB to block the LPS-induced overexpression of inflammatory mediators, namely iNOS and COX-2, and inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, in RAW264.7 cells was also investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the upregulation of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was observed in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, which was significantly inhibited by HBL. Similarly, HBB significantly attenuated the expression of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β and IL-6, but not TNF-α in the LPS-induced cells. Previous studies have reported the anti-inflammatory activity of HBF (

 <xref rid="b10-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activities of HBL, HBB and HBF were compared in the present study. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>, the inhibitory effect of HBL on the production of NO and expression of iNOS and IL-1β was higher than that of HBB at a concentration of 100 µg/ml. Moreover, HBF did not significantly inhibit the LPS-induced production of NO and expression of iNOS and IL-1β (
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). We hypothesized that the differences in the activities of the extracts may be associated with the levels of polyphenols and flavonoids they contain. Therefore, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of HBL, HBB and HBF were compared. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were reduced in the order HBL &gt; HBB &gt; HBF, which was the same as the order of their inhibitory activities against the production of inflammatory mediators. This result indicates that the difference in the inhibitory activities of HBL, HBB and HBF against the production of inflammatory mediators is likely due to differences in the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of the extracts. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activities of HBL and HBB were compared with that of ibuprofen, an NSAID. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, the inhibitory activity of HBB against NO production was lower than that of ibuprofen, whereas the inhibitory activity of HBL was comparable with that of ibuprofen.
