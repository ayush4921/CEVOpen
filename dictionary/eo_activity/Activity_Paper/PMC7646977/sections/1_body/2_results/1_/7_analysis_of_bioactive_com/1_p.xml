<p>Standardization of materials is essential for the development of functional products. Thus, the levels of certain polyphenolic compounds in HBL, HBB and HBF were analyzed, as honeyberry has been reported to contain polyphenolic compounds such as protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid (

 <xref rid="f9-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, chlorogenic acid (58.66 µg/g extract), caffeic acid (21.51 µg/g extract), coumaric acid (120.51 µg/g extract) and ferulic acid (283.31 µg/g extracts) were detected in HBL. In HBB, protocatechuic acid (4.23 µg/g extract), chlorogenic acid (21.86 µg/g extract), caffeic acid (43.88 µg/g extract), coumaric acid (26.77 µg/g extract) and ferulic acid (8.69 µg/g extract) were detected. HBF contained protocatechuic acid (6.53 µg/g extract), chlorogenic acid (27.23 µg/g extract), coumaric acid (5.44 µg/g extract) and ferulic acid (7.99 µg/g extract). The anti-inflammatory activities of these polyphenolic compounds have been reported in previous studies (
