<p>Finally, it was observed that the expression of ATF3 was increased in cells treated with HBL and HBB. It has been reported that ATF3 plays an important role in innate immunity (

 <xref rid="b51-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In the present study, ATF3 knockdown completely blocked the HBL- and HBB-induced downregulation of inflammatory mediators, which indicates that ATF3 may be a major mediator of the anti-inflammatory activity of HBL and HBB, although HBL and HBB can also inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators through various signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-kB, and Nrf2/HO-1. It has been reported that a deficiency of ATF3 increases the production of inflammatory mediators via the inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling (
 <xref rid="b52-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Thus, the effect of the HBL- and HBB-induced expression of ATF3 on Nrf2/HO-1 signaling requires further elucidation. In addition, the mechanisms through which HBL and HBB promote the expression of ATF3 need to be investigated.
