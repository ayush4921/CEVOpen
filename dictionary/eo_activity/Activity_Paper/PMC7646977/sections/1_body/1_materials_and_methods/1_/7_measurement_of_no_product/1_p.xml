<p>The Griess assay was performed to measure NO production, following a previously described method (
 <xref rid="b22-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, after plating RAW264.7 cells (1×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) on a 12-well plate for 24 h, the cells were pretreated with 100 and/or 200 µg/ml HBL, HBB and HBF, and 100 µg/ml ibuprofen at 37°C for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) at 37°C for 20 h. Then, 100 µl cell culture supernatant was mixed with 100 µl Griess reagent (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at room temperature for 15 min, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using UV/visible spectrophotometer (Xma-3000PC).
