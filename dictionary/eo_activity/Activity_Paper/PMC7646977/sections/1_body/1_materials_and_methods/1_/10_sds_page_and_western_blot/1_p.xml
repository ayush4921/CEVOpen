<p>Western blot analysis was performed according to a previously described method (
 <xref rid="b22-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB at 37°C for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) at 37°C for 30 min or 1 h. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with SB203580 (20 µM; p38 inhibitor) or NAC (10 mM; ROS scavenger) at 37°C for 2 h and then co-treated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB at 37°C for 20 min. After treatment, RAW264.7 cells were washed three times with cold 1X PBS, and the protein was extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mM Tris Base/Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute (Boston BioProducts) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at 4°C for 30 min. The protein concentration was quantified using a BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Briefly, 5 µl cell lysate was mixed with 45 µl distilled water and 1 ml BCA protein assay solution (Reagent A:B=50:1, v/v), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The absorbance was then measured at 562 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (Xma-3000PC). The protein (30 µg/lane) was separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). After blocking the PVDF membrane using 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) with stirring at room temperature for 1 h, the PVDF membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies in 0.05% TBS-T containing 5% non-fat dry milk: IκB-α (1:1,000; cat. no. 4814), p65 (1:1,000; cat. no. 8242), phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1,000; cat. no. 4377), ERK1/2 (1:1,000; cat. no. 9102), phospho-p38 (1:1,000; cat. no. 4511), p38 (1:1,000; cat. no. 9212), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1; 1:1,000; cat. no. 70081), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2; 1:1,000; cat. no. 12721), β-actin (1:1,000; cat. no. 5172) and TATA-box-binding protein (TBP; 1:1,000; cat. no. 8515) all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3; 1:1,000; cat. no. sc-188) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. After treatment with the primary antibodies, the PVDF membrane was washed three times with 0.05% TBS-T, and then incubated with the following secondary antibodies in 0.05% TBS-T containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature: Anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. 7074) and anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. 7076), both from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Chemiluminescence was detected with Amersham ECL western blotting reagent (Cytiva) and visualized using a LI-COR C-DiGit Blot Scanner (Li-COR Biosciences). The density of the western blot bands was calculated using the software UN-SCAN-IT gel version 5.1 (Silk Scientific, Inc.).
