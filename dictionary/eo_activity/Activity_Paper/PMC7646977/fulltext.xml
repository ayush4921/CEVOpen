Functional studies of honeyberry have mainly focused on the fruits, which have been reported to exert various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory activity, with limited or no studies on the other parts of the plant, such as the leaves and branches. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of extracts of the leaves (HBL), branches (HBB) and fruit (HBF) of honeyberry plant were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. HBL and HBB significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, and the inhibitory effects of HBL and HBB were stronger than those of HBF. HBL and HBB blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 independently of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1;. HBL did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or p38; however, HBB effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 but not ERK1/2. HBL and HBB increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein by inducing the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) through the activation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/p38 pathway; the reduction in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) expression by HBL and HBB was inhibited by HO-1 knockdown. In addition, HBL and HBB increased the expression of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), and the reduction in iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; expression by HBL and HBB was inhibited by ATF3 knockdown. Collectively, HBL and HBB inhibited LPS-induced nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B activation by blocking the nuclear accumulation of p65, increasing HO-1 expression through activation of the ROS/p38/Nrf2 pathway, and increasing ATF3 expression. Furthermore, HBB inhibited LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that HBL and HBB may have great potential as natural products for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anti-inflammation</kwd><kwd>honeyberry</kwd><kwd>inflammatory response</kwd><kwd><italic>Lonicera caerulea</italic></kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation, which is one of the physical barriers of innate immunity, is the protective response by which the body eliminates harmful stimuli, such as damaged cells, pathogens and irritants (<xref rid="b1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, the prolonged inflammatory response of immune cells to noxious stimuli leads to chronic inflammation, which causes various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis, Alzheimer's disease and neurological diseases (<xref rid="b2-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Macrophages, which play a pivotal role in the innate immune system, release various inflammatory cytokines and mediators to protect the body from external harmful factors (<xref rid="b3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, and inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), have been linked to pathophysiological events and chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="b4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, the control of excessive inflammatory responses is important for the prevention of chronic inflammatory diseases, and drugs that suppress excessive inflammatory responses are constantly being developed.</p><p>Currently used anti-inflammatory drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may cause serious side effects. Therefore, numerous researchers have focused on the development of anti-inflammatory drugs from plant sources that are considered to be safe, effective, biocompatible and cost-effective alternatives (<xref rid="b2-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Berries are fruits rich in nutritive compounds, such as minerals, vitamins and dietary fiber. They also contain polyphenolic compounds that have strong anti-inflammatory properties (<xref rid="b5-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Honeyberry (<italic>Lonicera caerulea</italic>) has long been used as a traditional medicine in China, Japan and northern Russia (<xref rid="b6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Honeyberry fruits have been reported to have strong antioxidant effects due to their ascorbic acid content and the presence of phenolic compounds, including anthocyanins, flavonoids and low-molecular-weight phenolic acids (<xref rid="b7-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, a study found that honeyberry fruits had the strongest antioxidant property among 12 types of colored berries from northern China (<xref rid="b8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A number of studies have shown the various effects of honeyberry fruits, which include anti-inflammatory (<xref rid="b9-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), hepatoprotective (<xref rid="b11-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), lipid and glucose metabolism-enhancing (<xref rid="b12-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), anti-hyperthyroidism (<xref rid="b13-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), anti-obesity (<xref rid="b14-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and anticancer effects (<xref rid="b15-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These fruits contain a variety of polyphenolic compounds, including protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid, which have a close association with anti-inflammatory effects (<xref rid="b17-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, the anti-inflammatory activity of honeyberry cultivars has been shown to depend on the levels of polyphenolic compounds they contain (<xref rid="b19-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Much research has been carried out into the pharmacological activity of honeyberry; however, these studies have mainly focused on honeyberry fruits, and reports of the pharmacological activities of its leaves and branches are limited. The leaves and branches of plants are important for the development of natural medicines due to the presence of high levels of functional substances with various biological activities; therefore, pharmacological studies on the leaves and branches of honeyberry are recommended. Notably, the leaves of chokeberry and mulberry have higher contents of functional substances and higher levels of antioxidant activity than the fruits (<xref rid="b20-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

The injection volume of the extract was 10 &#x000b5;l and the elution was monitored at 254 nm. The anti-inflammatory compounds of HBL, HBB and HBF were identified by comparison with the chromatograms of analytical standards, including protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed in triplicate.

HBL and HBB significantly reduced the LPS-mediated production of NO (<xref rid="f1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The results of the MTT assay demonstrated that HBL and HBB were not toxic to RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="f1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which indicates that the inhibition of NO production by HBL and HBB was not due to the cytotoxicity of the extracts. The effects of HBL and HBB on cell viability in the presence of LPS were also evaluated. As shown in <xref rid="f1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, treatment with LPS alone decreased cell viability, while HBL and HBB attenuated the LPS-induced reduction in cell viability. The ability of HBL and HBB to block the LPS-induced overexpression of inflammatory mediators, namely iNOS and COX-2, and inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, in RAW264.7 cells was also investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f2-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the upregulation of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; was observed in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, which was significantly inhibited by HBL. Similarly, HBB significantly attenuated the expression of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, but not TNF-&#x003b1; in the LPS-induced cells. Previous studies have reported the anti-inflammatory activity of HBF (<xref rid="b9-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activities of HBL, HBB and HBF were compared in the present study. As shown in <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>, the inhibitory effect of HBL on the production of NO and expression of iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; was higher than that of HBB at a concentration of 100 &#x000b5;g/ml. Moreover, HBF did not significantly inhibit the LPS-induced production of NO and expression of iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). We hypothesized that the differences in the activities of the extracts may be associated with the levels of polyphenols and flavonoids they contain. Therefore, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of HBL, HBB and HBF were compared. As shown in <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were reduced in the order HBL &#x0003e; HBB &#x0003e; HBF, which was the same as the order of their inhibitory activities against the production of inflammatory mediators. This result indicates that the difference in the inhibitory activities of HBL, HBB and HBF against the production of inflammatory mediators is likely due to differences in the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of the extracts. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activities of HBL and HBB were compared with that of ibuprofen, an NSAID. As shown in <xref rid="f3-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, the inhibitory activity of HBB against NO production was lower than that of ibuprofen, whereas the inhibitory activity of HBL was comparable with that of ibuprofen.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of HBL and HBB on the regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells</title><p>The ability of HBL and HBB to inhibit the LPS-mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B was investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, HBL and HBB did not suppress the LPS-induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1;; however, HBL and HBB significantly attenuated the LPS-induced nuclear accumulation of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 (<xref rid="f4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB may inhibit the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling independently of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation. Whether HBL and HBB inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway was also investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f4-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, LPS increased the phosphorylation levels of p38 and ERK1/2, which was not inhibited by HBL. However, HBB significantly attenuated the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 but not that of ERK1/2. These results indicate that HBL did not inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, whereas HBB inhibited the activation of p38.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of HBL and HBB on HO-1 expression in RAW264.7 cells</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="f5-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, HBL significantly increased the expression of HO-1 protein from 1 h after treatment. The expression level of HO-1 was observed to be highest at 6 h of HBL treatment, and gradually decreased when the treatment duration was &#x0003e;6 h. HBB started to significantly increase the expression level of HO-1 protein from 6 h of treatment, and the level continued to increase until 24 h after treatment. The effect of different HBL and HBB concentrations on HO-1 protein expression levels were also examined. As the previous results confirmed that the HO-1 expression induced by HBL and HBB was highest at 6 and 10 h after the start of treatment, respectively, RAW264.7 cells were treated with HBL and HBB for 6 and 10 h. As shown in <xref rid="f5-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, HBL and HBB concentration-dependently increased the HO-1 protein level. Furthermore, whether the increase in HO-1 protein level induced by HBL and HBB was associated with the LPS-mediated overexpression of iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the knockdown of HO-1 by transfection with HO-1 siRNA blocked the HBL- and HBB-induced downregulation of iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="f5-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB inhibited the overexpression of pro-inflammatory mediators through the upregulation of the HO-1 protein expression level.</p></sec><sec><title>HBL- and HBB-induced increase in HO-1 protein level is dependent on ROS/p38 activation</title><p>It has been reported that ROS increase the expression of HO-1 and are upstream of p38 (<xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Isoegomaketone has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators through the activation of a ROS/p38/HO-1 pathway (<xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, the effect of ROS/p38 signaling on the HBL- and HBB-mediated expression of HO-1 was investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, the inhibition of p38 by SB203580 and of ROS by NAC suppressed the HBL- and HBB-induced expression of HO-1. Thus, whether HBL and HBB induce the production of ROS was investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, ROS production was observed in HBL- and HBB-treated RAW264.7 cells. In addition, HBL and HBB increased the phosphorylation level of p38 (<xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), and the inhibition of ROS by NAC attenuated the HBL and HBB-induced p38 phosphorylation (<xref rid="f6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB induced HO-1 expression through the ROS-dependent activation of p38.</p></sec><sec><title>HBL- and HBB-induced increase in HO-1 protein level is dependent on ROS/p38/Nrf2 activation</title><p>The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 is associated with the upregulation of HO-1 expression (<xref rid="b22-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, whether HBL and HBB influence the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 was investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f7-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 significantly increased after 1 h of HBL and HBB treatment. In addition, HBL and HBB induced a concentration-dependent increase in the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (<xref rid="f7-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, it was observed that the inhibition of p38 by SB203580 and the inhibition of ROS by NAC blocked the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 induced by HBL and HBB (<xref rid="f7-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). These results indicate that HBL and HBB induced the upregulation of HO-1 protein through the activation of ROS, p38 and Nrf2.</p></sec><sec><title>Upregulation of ATF3 contributes to the inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by HBL and HBB</title><p>There is evidence to suggest that ATF3 inhibits the inflammatory response (<xref rid="b25-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Thus, the effect of ATF3 on the inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators by HBL and HBB was investigated. As shown in <xref rid="f8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, HBL and HBB rapidly increased the expression of ATF3. In addition, HBL and HBB dose-dependently increased the ATF3 protein expression level (<xref rid="f8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). The knockdown of ATF3 by transfection with ATF3 siRNA was observed to attenuate the HBL- and HBB-induced downregulation of iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="f8-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). These results indicate that the upregulation of ATF3 by HBL and HBB may be associated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of bioactive compounds in HBL, HBB and HBF</title><p>Standardization of materials is essential for the development of functional products. Thus, the levels of certain polyphenolic compounds in HBL, HBB and HBF were analyzed, as honeyberry has been reported to contain polyphenolic compounds such as protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid (<xref rid="b17-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f9-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, chlorogenic acid (58.66 &#x000b5;g/g extract), caffeic acid (21.51 &#x000b5;g/g extract), coumaric acid (120.51 &#x000b5;g/g extract) and ferulic acid (283.31 &#x000b5;g/g extracts) were detected in HBL. In HBB, protocatechuic acid (4.23 &#x000b5;g/g extract), chlorogenic acid (21.86 &#x000b5;g/g extract), caffeic acid (43.88 &#x000b5;g/g extract), coumaric acid (26.77 &#x000b5;g/g extract) and ferulic acid (8.69 &#x000b5;g/g extract) were detected. HBF contained protocatechuic acid (6.53 &#x000b5;g/g extract), chlorogenic acid (27.23 &#x000b5;g/g extract), coumaric acid (5.44 &#x000b5;g/g extract) and ferulic acid (7.99 &#x000b5;g/g extract). The anti-inflammatory activities of these polyphenolic compounds have been reported in previous studies (<xref rid="b26-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that ferulic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid are able to activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway (<xref rid="b31-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although inflammation is a beneficial response that helps to protect the body from external pathogens, it is considered that excessive inflammatory responses should be controlled to prevent the development of chronic inflammation-associated diseases (<xref rid="b1-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The development of new anti-inflammatory agents is desirable due to the side effects and treatment failures associated with currently available anti-inflammatory drugs (<xref rid="b35-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). There is growing evidence that various plants and plant-derived compounds have therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects with few or no side effects (<xref rid="b35-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, in the present study, the anti-inflammatory activity of HBL and HBB derived from honeyberry were evaluated and their potential molecular mechanisms of action were elucidated.</p><p>According to previous reports, HBF inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators during the LPS-induced inflammatory response (<xref rid="b6-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, in the present study, it was observed that HBF (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) did not inhibit the LPS-induced overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, namely NO, iNOS, and IL-1&#x003b2;, whereas HBL and HBB significantly suppressed the overproduction of these mediators at the same concentration. Polyphenolic compounds are associated with lower risk of degenerative and chronic diseases than other dietary components and are known to have anti-inflammatory properties (<xref rid="b37-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The present study found that the levels of polyphenolic compounds in the extracts decreased in the order HBL &#x0003e; HBB &#x0003e; HBF. This result indicates that the difference in the inhibitory activities of HBL, HBB and HBF against the production of inflammatory mediators may be associated with the levels of polyphenolic compounds they contain. We also hypothesize that the differences in the inhibitory effect of HBF on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in different studies may be due to variations in the growth environment of honeyberry. This is because the secondary metabolites of plants are regulated by the environment in which the plants are grown (<xref rid="b38-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is an important transcription factor involved in the inflammatory response (<xref rid="b39-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, activate NF-&#x003ba;B by inducing cytosolic I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation and the subsequent accumulation of p65 in the nucleus, which leads to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="b39-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that HBL and HBB did not inhibit the LPS-induced cytosolic degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; but attenuated the increase in the nuclear level of p65 protein. There is evidence that p65 phosphorylation is essential for the nuclear accumulation of p65 and transcriptional activation (<xref rid="b40-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). There are various phosphorylation sites of p65, among which the phosphorylation of serine 529 has been reported to be involved in the nuclear accumulation of p65 (<xref rid="b40-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the inhibitory effects of HBL and HBB on p65 nuclear accumulation are caused by the inhibition of p65 phosphorylation at serine 529. However, this hypothesis requires elucidation through further study.</p><p>MAPK is also involved in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="b41-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In the present study, HBL did not inhibit the LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38. However, HBB suppressed LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As p38 MAPK is considered a potential molecular target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, p38 inhibitors are currently being developed. The anti-inflammatory activities of these p38 inhibitors have been confirmed clinically (<xref rid="b41-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the data in the present study indicate that the inhibition of p38 activation by HBB was associated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators.</p><p>The present study also indicated that HBL and HBB upregulated the HO-1 protein expression level through the ROS/p38-dependent activation of Nrf2, and that HO-1 knockdown inhibited the downregulation of inflammatory mediators by HBL and HBB. It has previously been shown that ROS induce the expression of HO-1 through the p38-dependent activation of Nrf2 (<xref rid="b24-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b43-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which can inhibit the inflammatory process. Therefore, Nrf2 activators are considered potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of various human diseases, including inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="b44-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Furthermore, Nrf2 activation-dependent responses are an effective means of preventing and treating inflammation, the most effective of which is the expression of HO-1 (<xref rid="b45-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that is known to regulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 (<xref rid="b47-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In the absence of stimulation, Nrf2 binds to Keap1 and is present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. However, ROS induces the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus through the degradation of Keap1. Nuclear Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element and induces the transcription of HO-1 (<xref rid="b48-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). On the basis of these previous studies (<xref rid="b47-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), we hypothesize that ROS produced by HBL and HBB may induce Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus through the degradation of Keap1, contributing the expression of HO-1. Thus, the present data may provide evidence of a link between ROS/p38/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and the anti-inflammatory activity of HBL and HBB.</p><p>Finally, it was observed that the expression of ATF3 was increased in cells treated with HBL and HBB. It has been reported that ATF3 plays an important role in innate immunity (<xref rid="b49-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and that its expression mitigates the production of various pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="b50-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In an <italic>in vivo</italic> study, ATF3 knock-out mice died sooner than wild-type mice when injected with a high dose of LPS (<xref rid="b49-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that ATF3 mitigates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="b49-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b51-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In the present study, ATF3 knockdown completely blocked the HBL- and HBB-induced downregulation of inflammatory mediators, which indicates that ATF3 may be a major mediator of the anti-inflammatory activity of HBL and HBB, although HBL and HBB can also inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators through various signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-kB, and Nrf2/HO-1. It has been reported that a deficiency of ATF3 increases the production of inflammatory mediators via the inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling (<xref rid="b52-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Thus, the effect of the HBL- and HBB-induced expression of ATF3 on Nrf2/HO-1 signaling requires further elucidation. In addition, the mechanisms through which HBL and HBB promote the expression of ATF3 need to be investigated.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that HBL and HBB inhibited LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation by blocking the nuclear accumulation of p65, increasing HO-1 expression through ROS/p38/Nrf2 activation, and increasing ATF3 expression. Furthermore, HBB inhibited LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation. The regulatory effects of HBL and HBB on these signaling pathways may be associated with their anti-inflammatory activities. These findings suggest that HBL and HBB may have great potential as anti-inflammatory drugs and should be further explored for development as natural anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the study is limited as it involved only cell-based experiments. Therefore, preclinical studies using animal models are required to validate the anti-inflammatory activities of HBL and HBB prior to their development as natural anti-inflammatory drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (grant nos.
