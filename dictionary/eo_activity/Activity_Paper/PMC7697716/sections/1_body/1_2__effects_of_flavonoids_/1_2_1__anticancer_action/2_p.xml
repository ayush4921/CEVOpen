<p>Hesperedin (Hsp) is an important flavonoid which displays efficient anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles were synthesized and loaded with Hsp to form hesperidin nanoparticles (HspNPs) to determine its potential application as an anticancer agent against C6 glioma cells. The encapsulated Hsp exhibited decreased in vitro cell viability against the C6 glioma cell line, and the controlled release of Hsp decreased the cytotoxicity of PLGA [
