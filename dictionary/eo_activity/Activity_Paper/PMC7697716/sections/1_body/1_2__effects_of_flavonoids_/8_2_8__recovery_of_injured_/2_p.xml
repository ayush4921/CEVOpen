<p>Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels from existing vessels which is important for normal development. Uncontrolled angiogenesis causes serious diseases such as inflammatory disorders, obesity, multiple sclerosis, asthma, endometrioses, and cirrhosis. Plant polyphenols such as flavonoids and chalcones inhibit angiogenesis by regulating multiple signaling pathways [
