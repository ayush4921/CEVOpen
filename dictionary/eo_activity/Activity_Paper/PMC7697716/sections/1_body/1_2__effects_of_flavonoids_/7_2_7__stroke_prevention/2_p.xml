<p>Ischemic stroke most common therapeutic drug is the tissue plasminogen activator, which due to complications can only be administered to 5% of the patients; therefore, the need to have an effective drug for ischemic stroke is necessary. Different systems such as vascular and inflammatory system interact with each other to form a stable homeostasis of CNS and the semipermeable membrane that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the CNS known as the blood brain barrier (BBB). The brain recovers itself from injury using CNS and BBB. The endothelium cells of BBB secretes molecules that adjust the after effect of ischemic stroke (stroke vasculome) when its genes are upregulated [

Stem cells can release anti-inflammatory agents. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) directly modulate the inflammation-associated stroke vasculome after ischemic stroke. Fisetin, a flavonoid inhibited LPS-induced TNFÎ± production and suppressing nuclear factor jB activation thus acting as a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent after post ischemia injury in vitro [

The cortical development, where neurons in brain failed to migrate in the proper formation in utero, results in malfunctioning known as Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). The naturally occurring flavonoid rutin has been used on animal models to treat FCD. At a dose of 50 mg/kg, a pronounced recovery was observed in motor neurons. This may act as a clinical drug in the future [
