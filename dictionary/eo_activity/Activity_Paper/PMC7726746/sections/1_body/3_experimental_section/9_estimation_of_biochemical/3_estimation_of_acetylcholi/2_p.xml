 </sup> The brain homogenate (50 Î¼L), 3 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8), 0.1 mL of 14 mM acetylcholine iodide, and 0.1 mL of 10 mM 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) were mixed. The mixture was incubated for 5 min. The increase in the absorbance was recorded for 2 min at a 30 s interval at 412 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer, Japan). The activity of AChE was expressed in enzyme unit/mg of the protein.
