<p>Male Wistar rats of 280 ± 10 g were obtained from the animal housing facility of the institute (CSIR - Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru - 570020, India). The animals were kept under standard husbandry conditions with food and water. The temperature was maintained at 21 ± 3 °C. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC No.: 160/2019) as per the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Govt. of India, New Delhi.
