<p>The escape latency time (ELT) was observed on the 8th to 11th day of the protocol schedule. On the 8th day, there were no significant changes (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) found in scopolamine-treated and oleoresin-treated rats, whereas ELT was reduced in donepezil-treated rats and normal rats among the groups. On the 11th day, ELT was decreased in all of the groups. There were no significant changes observed between normal, pepper-treated, and chili-oleoresin-treated groups (

Scopolamine-treated rats showed comparatively less TSTQ when compared to normal, oleoresin-treated, and donepezil-treated rats. Although the chili-oleoresin-treated group showed slightly lower TSTQ, there were no remarkable changes between normal, pepper, turmeric oleoresin, and donepezil groups (

 </xref>b,c). Behavioral activities such as ELT and TSTQ were studied during the acquisition (learning ability) and retrieval trials (memory). It is essential to observe that the Morris water maze (MWM) test investigating spatial learning and memory was used in detecting changes of the central cholinergic system.

 </sup> In the MWM test, rats showed a significant decrease in day 4 ELT when compared to day 1 ELT. They showed normal learning ability. In addition, day five assessments resulted in a significant increase in TSTQ when compared to the time spent in other quadrants. They showed normal retrieval capacity. This reveals that scopolamine produced the abnormal learning and memory process in rats. Therefore, in this study, the design administration of pepper and chili oleoresins for 13 consecutive days showed significant attenuation against scopolamine-induced changes in learning and memory dysfunction. However, the turmeric-oleoresin-treated group produce showed less significant improvements compared to other oleoresin-treated groups.
