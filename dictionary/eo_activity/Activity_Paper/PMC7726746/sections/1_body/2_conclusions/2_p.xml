<p>Scopolamine induction caused Alzheimerâ€™s-type dementia by increasing the AChE level and oxidative stress, which are majorly associated with cognitive and memory impairments. Based on this study, the major biomarkers like beta-amyloid and inflammatory cytokines can be further evaluated to affirm and uphold the strong evidence of spice oleoresins in the long-term injected-scopolamine-mediated changes. Spice oleoresins improve the antioxidant level and reduce the lipid peroxidation induced by scopolamine compared to drug donepezil and reversed scopolamine-mediated changes. Thus, spice oleoresins could be potential candidates for the treatment of cognitive impairment in AD.</p>
