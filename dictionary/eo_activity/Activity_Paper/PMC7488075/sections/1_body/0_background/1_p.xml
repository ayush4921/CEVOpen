<p id="Par24">Globally, oral diseases are highly prevalent and pose a major public health challenge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Oral microbiota, that cause oral diseases, have developed resistance against some antibacterial agents such as metronidazole, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalosporin and penicillin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Some antimicrobials also have unfavorable side effects such as toxicity, teeth staining, diarrhea, vomiting and the alteration of the oral cavity normal flora [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Chlorhexidine mouth wash for example has been shown to result in teeth staining, oral mucous membrane staining, increased calculus formation, parotid swelling, desquamation of the oral mucosa and urticaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other antibacterial agents that also result in unfavorable side effects such as toxicity are amine fluorides, cetylpyridinium and chloride [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The development of antimicrobial resistance and side effects caused by the current antimicrobials has resulted in a need for alternatives that are safe, user-friendly and cost-effective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Extracts from some plants have been found to be efficacious against oral diseases.

 <italic>Mangifera indica, Rosa indica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> Miller have demonstrated inhibitory properties against some dental caries and periodontal pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Their activity is postulated to be through the inhibition of microbial growth and bacterial adhesion in biofilms formed on the tooth surface [
