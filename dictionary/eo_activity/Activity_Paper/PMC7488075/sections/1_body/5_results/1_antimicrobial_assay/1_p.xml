 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the results of the microbial growth inhibition by 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> against MRSA
 <italic>, S. aureus, S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The organic extracts of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> exhibited higher antimicrobial activity compared to the aqueous extracts. Among the organic extracts, methanol extracts demonstrated greater zones of inhibition. The most susceptible microorganism was 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> followed by MRSA, 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> and lastly, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with little to no inhibition observed. The MeOH (
 <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.722) and MeOH:DCM (
 <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.069) extracts resulted in zones of inhibition of 19.50 mm and 17.00 mm respectively against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The Methanol (10 mm) and MeOH:DCM (10 mm) 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> extracts gave slightly greater zones of inhibition against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> than the aqueous extracts (9 mm), with a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt; 0.005 (Fig.
