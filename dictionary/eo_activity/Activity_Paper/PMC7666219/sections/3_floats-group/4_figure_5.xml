  <p>Concentrations of total PAs in the stream at the surface water monitoring site (
   <bold>A</bold>) and in seepage waters in the wells (
   <bold>B</bold>) ± SDs of the total PA concentrations in triplicate samples. The type 1 PAs represent the sum of nine PAs that were detected in plants and water (Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), whereas the type 2 PAs represent the sum of twelve PAs that were detected in water only (Table 1 of the SM). The dates of the sampling events are listed in Table 2 of the SM, the seepage water sampling locations mapped in Fig.
