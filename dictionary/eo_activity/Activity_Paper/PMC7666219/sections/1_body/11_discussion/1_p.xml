<p id="Par19">This research reports PAs from butterbur in surface water for the first time, and provides evidence for our starting hypothesis that PAs can naturally leach from butterbur into water and make it unsafe to drink. Several previous studies identified PAs as soil or surface water contaminants

 </sup>) and thus contribute to the overall exposure of farm and wildlife animals to PAs. Furthermore, this study illustrates PA leaching from PA-producing plants to groundwater wells via seepage water. Open bottomed shallow groundwater wells are common in remote one-household settlements with no centralized water supply in both developing and developed countries. These wells are frequently subject to pollution of organic matter, nitrate and pesticides that seep from farming areas and noncentralized sanitation. To the best of our knowledge PAs in well water have not been examined before.
