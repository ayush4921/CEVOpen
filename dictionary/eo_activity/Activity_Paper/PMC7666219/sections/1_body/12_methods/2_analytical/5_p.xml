<p id="Par33">The concentrations of individual PAs were reported as the average concentrations quantified in triplicate samples. In cases when the individual PAs were quantified in only 2 of the triplicate samples (close to the approximate 5–9 ng/L limit of quantification of the full method), the concentrations of individual PAs were reported as the average of 2 positive samples. If individual PAs were quantified in only 1 of the triplicate samples, the concentrations were not quantified and reported as

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) were reported as the averages of the sums of all PAs quantified in triplicate samples.
