<p id="Par30">The water samples were passed through a 2.5 μm filter paper (Whatman quantitative-Grade 42) under a vacuum and acidified to a pH of 3.0 with 0.1 mol/L formic acid. Solid phase extraction cartridges 
 <italic>Oasis MCX</italic> (6 cc, 150 mg 30 µm particle) were conditioned with 5 ml MeOH followed by 5 ml H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and then 1.0 L of the acidified water samples were loaded at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The loaded cartridges were washed with 5 ml 0.065 mmol/L formic acid and successively eluted with 5 ml MeOH and with 10 ml 3:1 (V/V) mixture of A: MeOH and B: 10% ammonia solution. A gentle nitrogen flow dried the eluates in a heating block at 40 °C. The dried extracts were dissolved in 1.0 ml 40% (V/V) MeCN and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE membrane prior to analysis.
