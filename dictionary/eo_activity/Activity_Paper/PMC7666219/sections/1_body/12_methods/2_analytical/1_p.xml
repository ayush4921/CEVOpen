 </sup>. In short, three plants from each sampling point were finely chopped into 2 mm pieces, vigorously mixed, 0.1 g was measured into 10 ml amber glass tubes, 10 ml of MeOH was added and the mixture was sonicated for 15 min. Subsequently, the supernatants were transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Extraction cycles with additional MeOH and sonication from the remaining plant materials were repeated twice, resulting in a total of 30 ml of supernatant per sample. The supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 2100 g and dried under gentle nitrogen flow in a heating block at 40 °C. The dried extracts were dissolved in 1 ml 40% (V/V) MeCN and filtered through 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filters prior to analysis.
