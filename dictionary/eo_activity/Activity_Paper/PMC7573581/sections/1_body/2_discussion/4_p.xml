<p id="Par42">The above mentioned β hair pin motif is a supersecondary structure. It comprises an antiparallel β sheet. Sequential segments of polypeptide chain form this β sheet, which are connected by a tight reverse turn. Here in ACE2 protein, this antiparallel β sheet is flanked by, in both sides with H5 and H6 helices of that protein. Globular protein ACE2 largely consists of straight runs in secondary structure. Stretches of a polypeptide joins this secondary structure, which change the direction abruptly. This β hair pin motif structures are present at the surface of the protein. Here the specific β hair pin motif contents amino acid sequences such as ASN134, Pro 135, ASP136 and ASN 137, which is present in the ligand binding site of ACE2 receptor protein. Proline is present as second residue, so that it can easily achieve the required conformation. This conformation has been changed due to binding of spike protein fragment. Distorted structure of ACE2 exposing ASP136, ASN 137, PRO 138, GLN 139 amino acids, can interact with GLN 403, LYS 451, ASP 416 of S protein of SARS-CoV2, at the ligand binding site of that protein.</p>
