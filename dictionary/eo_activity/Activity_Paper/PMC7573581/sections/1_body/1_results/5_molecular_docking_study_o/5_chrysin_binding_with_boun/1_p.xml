<p id="Par28">Chrysin binds with the spike protein fragment and its ACE2 receptor with binding energy − 6.87 kcal/mole (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). This phytochemical binding site is almost similar with that of spike protein fragment molecule and its receptor. A conformational change occurs in ACE2 receptor molecule after spike protein fragment binding. Chrysin binding cleft is located near to that site as shown in Fig.
