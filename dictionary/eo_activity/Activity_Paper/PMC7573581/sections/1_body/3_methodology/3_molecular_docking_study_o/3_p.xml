<p id="Par63">The protein–protein interaction energy between spike protein fragment and its receptor ACE2 is an important criterion to evaluate the effect of natural products, which could bind to the binding surface between spike protein fragment and ACE2 receptor. Binding affinity defined as the strength of protein–protein interaction, which is related with the cellular functions of those proteins. This binding energy can be expressed as a physiochemical parameter, known as dissociation constant (Kd)
