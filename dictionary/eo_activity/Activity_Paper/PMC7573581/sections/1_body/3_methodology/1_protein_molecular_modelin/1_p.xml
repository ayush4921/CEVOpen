<p id="Par51">The 3D structure of spike protein (from amino acid sequence 331 to 524) and its binding site with its host cell receptor ACE2 protein have been highlighted in this study. In RSCB database, the available 3D structure of spike protein (PDB ID 6LZG) contains two ligands e.g. Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and NAG. Only primary amino acid sequence of spike protein (from position 331 to 524) and its 3D structure, is relevant for our study. So, by using template sequence 6lzg.1. B with 100% sequence identity, for primary sequence (from position 331 to 524), modeled structure of spike protein fragment, has been created by homology modeling study. Homology modeled structure of RBD fragment (from amino acid residues 331 to 524 of spike protein) in SARS-CoV-2 is considered in this paper as responsible fragment for strong binding with ACE2 receptor protein of human. Before molecular docking analysis, following steps are performed with the primary sequence of spike protein fragment using homology modeling technique.
