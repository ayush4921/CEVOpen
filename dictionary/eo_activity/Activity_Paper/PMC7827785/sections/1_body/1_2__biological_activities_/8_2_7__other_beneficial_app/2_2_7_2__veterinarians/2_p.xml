<p>Legumes have been suggested as an additional ingredient to create pasture forages since they represent a protein source for livestock, improve the rumen microbiome and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the range of legumes, 
 <italic>Lespedeza procumbens</italic>, 
 <italic>Desmodium paniculatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Leucaena leucocephala</italic>, 
 <italic>D. ovalifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>Flemingia macrophylla</italic> possess a relatively high content of CTs. They have been suggested to modify rumen fermentation in beef cattle, probably due to the presence of tannins, so they may act similarly in animals by complexing proteins and short-chain fatty acids, which may provide a prebiotic effect, as stated [

As an example, a blinded study tested the effect of a proprietary chestnut tannin extract on the duration of neonatal diarrhea in calves. The results were consistent with other previous data, notably a lowering of the duration of the diarrheic episodes without affecting the weight of the animals [

 <italic>L. pedunculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. corniculatus</italic> are reported to avoid protein degradation and to improve amino acid residue absorption at the intestinal level, which ultimately enhances animal performance, with an apparent higher ovulation rate and clean wool production in sheep [

 <italic>Berberis vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>R. coriaria</italic> extracts were applied against relevant pathogenic protozoans like 
 <italic>Theileria equis</italic> and common 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>B. bovis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. bigemina</italic> or 
 <italic>B. caballi</italic>, in a mouse-infected model. The experiment showed better levels of selected biomarkers in plasma, due to the synergetic effect of compounds present in the used extracts, of which tannins and flavonoids were detected as the main chemicals [
