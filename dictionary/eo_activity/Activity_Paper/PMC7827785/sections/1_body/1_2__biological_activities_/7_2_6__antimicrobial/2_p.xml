<p>Several species belonging to genus 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> were tested in vitro as antibacterial and antifungal agents. The main tannins involved in these activities were different among the species and plant parts analyzed. Extracts were tested against two strains of 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, with and without the chromosomal insertion 
 <italic>cag,</italic> whose presence is associated with an increased inflammatory profile. The whole extract, after 24 and 48 h of treatment, showed values of 1200 and 134 Î¼g/mL of minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against the cag- 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Tannins and other phenolic compounds have been suggested to be involved in the antibacterial mechanism by the inhibition of bacterial ionic pumps [

 <italic>R. ulmifolius</italic>, has been evaluated in terms of amoebicidal, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Trophozoites from 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic> showed a dose-dependent sensitivity to the extract, but not comparable with the positive control. The antibacterial and antifungal capacity of extracts was determined by inhibition zone (IZ) diameters, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MBC. 
 <italic>R. ulmifolius</italic> extracts presented MIC and MBC for all bacteria and the yeast in the range of mg/mL. The best results in terms of IZ were achieved for 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> while Gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus feacium</italic> were less sensitive [

 <italic>R. ulmifolius</italic>, which presented a high content of tannins (both HTs and CTs) demonstrated significant antifungal activity against five filamentous fungi: 
 <italic>Beauveria</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic>, 
 <italic>Phialophora verrucosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</italic> [
