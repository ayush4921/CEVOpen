<p>Aside from five known bile acids, a new bile acid trifluoroacetate was isolated from jellyfish-derived fungus 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> J08NF-4. Its chemical structure and mechanism of action were similar to those of synthetic steroid mifepristone, which is clinically used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and recently turned out to be a PPARγ agonist. Docking studies confirmed that this new bile acid, like mifepristone, is capable of binding the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPARγ, thus suppressing the NF-kB pathway and downregulating the pro-inflammatory mediators iNOS, TNF-α, and NO, with generalized anti-inflammatory effects, as confirmed by in vitro assay on LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages [
