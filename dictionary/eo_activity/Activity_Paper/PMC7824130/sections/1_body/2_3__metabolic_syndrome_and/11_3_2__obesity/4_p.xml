<p>In another recent study, two natural labdane diterpenes and a drimane sesquiterpene were isolated from the hexane extract of 
 <italic>Curcuma amada</italic> and they were tested for their inhibitory activity against rat intestinal α-glucosidase and porcine pancreatic lipase. One of the two diterpenes showed relevant inhibitory activity toward both enzymes. Therefore, some semi-synthetic derivatives of this molecule were prepared and screened: a reduced derivative maintained α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, while it lost lipase inhibition. At the opposite end of the spectrum, oxidized and acetate derivatives acted as good lipase inhibitors but had a weak α-glucosidase inhibitory activity [
