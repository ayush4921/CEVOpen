<p>A growing body of literature demonstrates the potential anti-obesity action of natural bioactive compounds, mostly derived from plants [

 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> were recently tested for various properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperlipidemic effects. Two sulfur-containing compounds were isolated from these extracts and were evaluated for their anti-adipogenic activity on pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line. One compound had no significant anti-adipogenic activity, while the other one showed a significant inhibition of intracellular lipid accumulation, probably due to the presence of an isothiocyanate group (ITC) in its structure. For this reason, a series of ITC derivatives were prepared, and most of them also showed anti-adipogenic activity [

 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L.) were screened on 3T3-L1 cells for their effects on adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Among them, one β-carboline alkaloid inhibited adipogenesis and lipid accumulation through the regulation of adipogenic, lipogenic and lipolytic genes [
