<p>Another interesting research is the in vitro screening of the antioxidant action of six diterpene derivatives, named Gracilin A, H, K, J, L, and tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1, isolated from 
 <italic>Spongionella</italic> sp., a marine sponge. The two parameters for the evaluation of antioxidant activity were MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and LDH levels: the first is correlated with mitochondrial function, the second is a cytoplasmic enzyme released in the culture medium following cell membrane damage. The tested compounds showed significant neuroprotective activity, interacting with targets such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and kinases involved in apoptosis [
