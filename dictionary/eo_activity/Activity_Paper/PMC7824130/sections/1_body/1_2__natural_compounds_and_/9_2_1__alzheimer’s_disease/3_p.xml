<p>The screening of libraries of natural compounds has also proven to be a promising strategy to identify multi-target compounds for the treatment of AD. Embelin, a 1,4-benzoquinone isolated from 
 <italic>Embelia ribes</italic> fruits, recently emerged from one such screening, showing inhibitory activity towards AChE, BChE and beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1, involved in the deposition of Aβ). Another two natural products present in the library, L-tetrahydropalmatine and papaverine, exhibited a good inhibition of AChE. Moreover, embelin, in LS-180 cells, acted as an inductor of P-gp, an ATP-dependent efflux pump situated in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) whose decreased levels can lead to the accumulation of Aβ plaques [
