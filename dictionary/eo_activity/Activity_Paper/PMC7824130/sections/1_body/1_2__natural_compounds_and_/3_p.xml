 <italic>Ach</italic> (or Iceland moss), as an example, is the most famous cetrarioid lichen species. It has been used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, and recently the neuroprotective properties of its major metabolite, fumarprotocetraric acid (FUM) were evaluated on neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells and glial U373-MG cells. FUM revealed different activities, acting as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals, decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reducing GSH depletion and increasing the ratio of reduced glutathioneto oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG ratio). Moreover, FUM decreased mitochondrial Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> levels, protected the mitochondrial membrane against H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced damage, suppressed H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced expression of protease caspase-3, decreased pro-apoptotic factor Bax levels and increased the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 levels [
