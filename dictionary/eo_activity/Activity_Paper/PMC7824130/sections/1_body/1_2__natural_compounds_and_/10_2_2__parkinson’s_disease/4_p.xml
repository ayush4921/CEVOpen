<p>MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitory activities of seven compounds isolated from the extract of 
 <italic>S.flavescens</italic> were recently investigated, highlighting (−)-maackian as a potent inhibitor of MAO-B and as a candidate for the development of drugs for Parkinson’s disease. The structurally related compound (−)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan was a non-selective inhibitor of both isoforms, as well as formononetin and genistein. Sophora-flavanone B weakly inhibited MAO-A, but not MAO-B, while kushenol F showed a good inhibitory activity on MAO-A and a weak one on MAO-B [
