<p>The protein thiol content in fructose-BSA glycated mixtures was assessed by Ellman's assay with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Ten microliters of glycated samples was incubated with 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 5 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 25°C for 15 minutes. The absorbance of samples was measured at 412 nm using a Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). The concentration of free thiol was measured from the L-cysteine standard curve (0.031–5.0 mM). The amount of protein thiol was expressed as nmol L-cysteine/mg protein.
