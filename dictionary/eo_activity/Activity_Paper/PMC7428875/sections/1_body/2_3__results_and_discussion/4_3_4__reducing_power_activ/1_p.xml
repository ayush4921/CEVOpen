 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the reducing power activity of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties. The highest reducing power activity was found in FDI (0.24 ± 0.24 mg AAE/g) followed by FDK (0.21 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), FDB (0.19 ± 0.06 mg AAE/g), FDT (0.10 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), FDD (0.04 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), FDM (0.03 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), and FDA (0.02 ± 0.01 mg AAE/g). The standard curve of ascorbic acid was plotted to measure the reducing activity and quercetin was used as a positive control.
