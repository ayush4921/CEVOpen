<p>The amount of fructosamine was investigated by calculating the reducing activity of serum protein in the alkaline solution using the colorimetric test [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It was reported by Chompoo et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] that the suppression of fructosamine and alpha-dicarbonyls levels could reduce the formation of AGEs. In this study, it was found that the highest percentage inhibition of fructosamine level was in FDB (86.5%) followed by FDM (67.3%), FDA (66.3%), FDT (54.8%), FDK (52.7%), FDD (48.8%), and FDI (46.9%), respectively, at 0.5â€‰mg/mL concentration whereas quercetin showed a reduction of fructosamine at 42.6% after 28 days of incubation. During the initial state of glycation, the unstable Schiff complexes have formed, rearranged into Amadori products (fructosamine), and used as an indicator for controlling blood sugar levels in diabetes patients [
