<p>The glycation of fructose sugar with BSA promotes protein oxidation and changes the structure of BSA associated with alterations of its biological characteristics [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Under hyperglycemic conditions, fructose was produced from sorbitol through glucose by the polyol pathway [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Fructose acts as an important precursor in the intracellular production of AGEs and engages in glycation better compared to glucose [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Fructose concentration was found to be higher in tissues of diabetic patients with active polyol pathway such as ocular lens, kidney, and peripheral nerves. Meanwhile, the thiol group of cysteine residues is receptive to oxidative attack by free radical damage to proteins, and the construction of disulfide bonds in protein aggregation resulted in the damage of enzymatic [

Not only that, the oxidation of amino acids such as lysine (Lys), arginine (Arg), and threonine (Thr) or secondary reaction of amino acid residues like cysteine (Cys) and histidine (His) with reactive carbonyl substances leads to the development of protein carbonyl derivatives [
