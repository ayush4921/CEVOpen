<p>The phytochemical constituents of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> plant extracts were identified as phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Methanolic leaves and callus extracts of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>kunstleri</italic> were reported to contain tannins, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, and phenolics [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both vitexin and isovitexin were detected in the aqueous and methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> leaves and thought to be responsible for the antidiabetic properties [

 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> leaf extract has been detected using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometers [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A compound known as lupeol (C
