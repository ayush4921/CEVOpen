<p>Traditional uses in Valmalenco attribute to 
 <italic>Pinus mugo</italic> activities on integumentary, digestive, musculoskeletal, and respiratory systems, as well as veterinary purposes. Among the most cited properties, we found anti-inflammatory and disinfectant, especially for skin traumas or the treatment of cattle paws and hooves. Burns, frostbites, rushes, skin eruptions, and sprains are considered pathological conditions treatable with this species, in addition to activities such as digestive, expectorant, and decongestant, useful in the treatment of sore throat, cough, and colds. Different parts of the plant, as well as different ways of administration are used with the purpose of reaching the desired effects. Among the former are resin, sprouts, and cones. Among the latter, infusions, ointments, syrups, or the direct application, especially for the resin. In this regard, a peculiar use is referred in case of bones fractures: the fresh resin is melted, filtered, and applied directly on the fractured limb. Once hardened, it makes a natural plaster cast, functional if kept for 30â€“40 days. The inhabitants of the valley believe that the idle muscles are maintained strong and tonic by the resin, while a common plaster cast would cause their weakening.
