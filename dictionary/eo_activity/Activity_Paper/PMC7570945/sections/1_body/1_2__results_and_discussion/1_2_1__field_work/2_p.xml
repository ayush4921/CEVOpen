<p>The study provides information on 59 species (1659 citations) used for human and animal healthcare, belonging to 53 genera and 30 botanical families. Asteraceae is the most cited family (692 citations for 13 species, 41.7% of the total citations), including plants both well known in the studied area (e.g., 
 <italic>Achillea moschata</italic> Wulfen, 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L.) and multi-purpose plants, e.g., used in different disease categories (e.g., 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L.). From the literature, it is evident that Asteraceae is actually the most representative family in Valmalenco (with 46 species, 27.7% of the autochthonous species cited in a reference text concerning the spontaneous plants in the province of Sondrio [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Other families with a high number of citations include either fewer species (Pinaceae: 289 citations for four species; Malvaceae: 142 citations for two species) or many plants most of which were less frequently cited by informants (Labiatae with 83 citations for 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> spp. and few citations for the others). Of the mentioned plants, 36 (61%) were herbaceous perennials, 15 (25%) woody perennials and 3 sub-shrubs (5%). Annuals, biennials, lianas, ferns and lichens accounted for the remaining 9%. 86.9% of citations concerning the use of wild species and only 6.6% of cultivated species (
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> L., 
 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Miller, 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L., 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.). In 6.4% of the cases, the used species can be either wild or cultivated (
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> L., 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> L.). The main used parts are flowers (21 species; 642 citations) and leaves (21 species; 301 citations) followed by the epigeous part (19; 222).
