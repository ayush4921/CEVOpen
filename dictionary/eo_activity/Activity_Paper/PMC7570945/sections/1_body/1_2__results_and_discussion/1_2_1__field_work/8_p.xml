 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Valfurva (SO) [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Tremezzina (CO) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and in the territory of Stelvio National Park (SO) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These studies point out that the most used species in folk medicine are 
 <italic>Achillea moschata</italic>, 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus pulegioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Artemisia genipi</italic>. A major part of the medicinal uses (71%) recorded in these studies are specific of a certain area; 54 of the uses cited by informants in Caspoggio have not been previously reported in the consulted ethnobotanical literature of Italian Alpine areas and 53 of them are new for Italy (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04144">Table S1</xref>). These findings highlight how mountain areas are important hotspots of biocultural diversity and that different habitats as well as geographical factors and socio-cultural histories may deeply affect human relationships with the natural resources. Jaccard’s similarity index shows values ranging from 7% (Valmalenco vs. Ligurian North Western Alps) to 27% (Valmalenco vs. Valfurva) with an average value of 13% (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04144-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There is a significant negative correlation between geographic distance and the Jaccard values (Spearman: −0.876; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) suggesting that villagers inhabiting areas closer to Valmalenco tend to have a similar knowledge of the use of medicinal plants. This is confirmed by a dendrogram carried out on Jaccard’s similarity index showing that ethnopharmacological data from Alpine areas of Lombardy cluster together while Piedmont and Liguria Alps group in a separated cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04144-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Valvestino (VV) seems to be an exception showing the lowest similarity value (9%) to our study area compared to the other Lombardy valleys; out of these areas, Valvestino is located at the greatest distance from Valmalenco. Based on these results it may be assumed that communities sharing ecological factors, historical backgrounds and sociocultural values have developed a similar ethnobotanical knowledge; in addition, is also possible that an exchange of ethnobotanical knowledge could have taken place, either recently or in the past, among the neighboring valleys.
