<p>Documenting traditional medicinal uses can provide valuable information on locally available species which can act as potential sources of new drugs or natural products. This is particularly true in areas understudied from this perspective like the Alpine communities where our study has been carried out. Alpine regions have an environmentally complex mosaic of different habitats as well as historical and cultural peculiarities that have marked and shaped the development of a rich ethnobotanical knowledge. Through a wide survey involving 137 informants, the present investigation shows that traditional knowledge is still quite rich and alive in Valmalenco, and that medicinal plants continue to play an important role for the local communities as part of their ancient cultural heritage. The high number of traditional uses (67) not previously documented for Italian Alpine areas provide evidence of this. Furthermore, the traditional use of medicinal plants cited is considered ‘still relevant’ in 96.6% of citations, suggesting that medicinal uses are still practiced and transmitted within the community. </p>
