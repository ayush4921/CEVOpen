<p>Results of the pharmacological and phytochemical bibliographic research show that the scientific information for the medicinal use of the plants cited in the ethnobotanical investigation is limited. Specifically, little is found about the forms of preparation or quantities used; even when this information is available the extracts analyzed are too often very different from the typical preparations of folk medicine. Thus, it is difficult to confirm or validate traditional uses with laboratory experimentation. Moreover, some of the species reported in the present work have never been investigated from this perspective. A summary of these results is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04144">Table S1</xref> and we believe this could provide useful information on what already exists from ethnobotanical and phytochemical studies. This represents an encouragement to new investigations in this direction, meant to extend our current knowledge, with the purpose of validating ancient traditional uses.
