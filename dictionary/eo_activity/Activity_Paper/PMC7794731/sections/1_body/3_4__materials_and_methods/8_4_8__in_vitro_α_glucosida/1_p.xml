<p>The α-glucosidase inhibition of isolated compound catechin was assessed according to the reported method [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with minor modifications. The reaction mixture was prepared by adding 100 μL α-glucosidase (0.5 unit/mL) enzyme, 600 μL phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 6.9), and 50 μL compound dilutions (31.05, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 µg/mL). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The enzymatic reactions were started by adding 100 μL substrate (
 <italic>p</italic>-nitro-phenyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside) solution (5 mM) prepared in phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 6.9), then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 400 μL sodium carbonate (0.2 M) solution and finally absorbance was recorded at 405 nm. The reaction mixture without compound was used as a control and the blank solution was prepared without α-glucosidase enzyme. Percent α-glucosidase inhibitory potential was calculated by the following Equation (3):
