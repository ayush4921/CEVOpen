<p>The α-amylase inhibitory potential was estimated using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) assay [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Isolated compound catechin was dissolved in mixture of DMSO (10%), Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>/NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> buffer (0.02M) and NaCl (0.006M) at pH 6.9 and then various dilutions were prepared in the range 31.05, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL. Enzyme α-amylase (200 μL; 2 units/mL) was mixed with catechin (200 μL) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Then 200 μL starch (1%) solution was added to each serial dilution and incubated for 3 min. To stop the reaction 200 μL sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate (DNSA) reagent, 2M NaOH, and 20 mL of 3,5 dinitrosalicylic acid (96 mM) were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixtures were boiled at 85–90 °C for 10 min in a water bath. After cooling the mixture was diluted with distilled water (5 mL) and then the absorbance was recorded at 540 nm through UV Visible spectrophotometer. A blank solution was prepared containing only isolated compound catechin but no enzyme. Standard acarbose (100 μg/mL–2 μg/mL) was prepared as positive control. The α-amylase enzyme inhibitory activity was calculated using the Equation (2):
