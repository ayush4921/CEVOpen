<p>ABTS (2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) free radicals were produced according to the reported assay [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Antiradical potential of catechin was measured by taking 300 µL catechin solution and 3.0 mL ABTS solution, mixed thoroughly and incubated for 6 min. Finally the absorbance was measured by UV spectrophotometer. Ascorbic acid as positive control as mentioned above have been used. Percent ABTS free radicals scavenging potential was calculated using Equation (1).
