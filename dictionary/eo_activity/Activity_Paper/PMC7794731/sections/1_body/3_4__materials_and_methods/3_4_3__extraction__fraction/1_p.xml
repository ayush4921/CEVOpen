<p>According to the method presented in a previously published article [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the plant extract preparation and fractionation were carried out. About 10 kg of dried berries fruits were crushed through mechanical grinder to obtain fine powders. The extraction was carried out using fruit powder mixed in 80% methanol for two weeks with periodical shaking. The resulting mixture was filtered using muslin cloth followed by Whattman filter paper and the filtrate was dried into a semisolid mass at 45 °C under reduced pressure in the rotary evaporator. Finally the resultant 750 g semisolid mass of extract was solidified in an open air. The resultant methanol extract in the specified amount was dissolved in a mixture (0.5 L) of methanol/water (7:3) and successively extracted by solvent–solvent extraction method using different solvents (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate 
 <italic>n</italic>- butanol, and aqueous starting from a low polarity to high. On the basis of in vitro analysis, the result of the chloroform fraction was found as the most active and was further subjected to isolation of bioactive compounds. The chloroform fraction was subjected to silica gel chromatography column with internal diameter of 10 cm packed height 50 cm in solvent system of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and ethyl acetate (3:7) yielded compound 2.5 g (catechin) in pure form. The compound was characterized through different spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, H-NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, and Mass spectrometry. The purified compound catechin was screened for in vitro and in vivo antioxidant and antidiabetic activity.
