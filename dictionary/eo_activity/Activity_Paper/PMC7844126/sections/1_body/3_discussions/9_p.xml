<p id="par0155">In the present study, there were no significant differences (
 <italic>P &lt; 0.05</italic>) in the plasma creatinine levels (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>); although it was observed that rats administered AESG 1000 mg/kg recorded a significant elevation (
 <italic>P &lt; 0.05</italic>) in plasma urea level (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The implication of the data obtained in the study is that the functional integrity of the kidney was not compromised by AESG (
 <xref rid="fig0055" ref-type="fig">Figs. 14â€“17</xref> ). Wasan et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] had earlier reported that oral administration of leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>glauca</italic> to test animals was capable of stimulating increase in plasma urea concentration, likely due to the presence of chemotherapeutic agents inherent in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. glauca</italic> (quassinoids glaucarubinone and alianthinone) [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the significant increase in plasma urea at AESG 1000 mg/kg might have resulted from an increase in amino acids metabolism elicited by the effect of therapeutic compounds present in the plant [
