<p id="par0135">The degree of liver damage induced by chemical substances or otherwise may be evaluated by determining the levels of specific biochemical markers of liver function, such as AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the present study, AESG did not cause any significant clinical damage to the liver (
 <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig">Figs. 11–13</xref>). This is further strengthened by the observation that there were no significant changes in plasma ALT levels of test rats administered AESG, relative to control (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). There was no observed increase in the plasma AST and GGT activities (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The European document for ecotoxicology and toxicology had stated that the biological significance of the decrease in specific liver enzyme activity was unclear; as such, was typically dismissed as being of no toxicological importance [
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Contrariwise, the plasma ALP activity was significantly elevated (
 <italic>P &lt; 0.05</italic>) in all test rats. Several iso-enzymes of ALP exist in the liver, bones, placenta, kidneys, and intestines. The activity of this enzyme is increased in many clinical states, the most important being bone and liver diseases [
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Significant elevation in plasma ALP activity without hepatic lesion has been reported, linked to cholestasis [
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. With the plasma levels of ALT remaining normal and GGT reduced, it is unlikely that the increase in plasma ALP could be of hepatic origin. The significant increase in plasma ALP activities observed in the current study might have been due to secretions from other tissues capable of synthesizing iso-enzymes of ALP (tissue nonspecific ALP, TNSALP) [
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>] (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This, therefore, suggests biliary duct obstruction [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It is also important to note that the prominent congestions observed in the liver (
 <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig">Figs. 11–13</xref>-IV) of rats administered AESG might have caused hepatobiliary obstruction, which is suggestive that the biliary duct ALP (TNSALP) could be responsible for the elevated ALP activity in the bloodstream (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>); although the magnitude of this contribution, nevertheless, remains uncertain.
