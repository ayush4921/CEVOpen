<p>The extraction yield obtained for hydroethanolic extraction for the studied plants is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. From this figure, it emerges that the hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> gave a better yield than the other two plant organs. The lowest yield was obtained with 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots.
