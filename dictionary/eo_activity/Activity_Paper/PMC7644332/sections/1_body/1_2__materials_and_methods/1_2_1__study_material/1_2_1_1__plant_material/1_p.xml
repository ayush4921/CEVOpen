<p>Plant materials used were constituted of 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots, 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> whole plant, and 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> leaves. These plant organs were collected in March 2019 in the municipality of Za-Kpota and Djidja (Zou department, southern Benin) and certified at the Benin National Herbarium under the voucher number YH261/HNB for 
 <italic>Rourea coccinea</italic>, YH262/HNB for 
 <italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic>, and YH263/HNB for 
 <italic>Gardenia ternifolia</italic>. The harvest time of these plants studied was chosen based on the foliage time of each plant. In addition, it is during these periods that the traditional healers collect these plant samples for use in Beninese pharmacopeia.
