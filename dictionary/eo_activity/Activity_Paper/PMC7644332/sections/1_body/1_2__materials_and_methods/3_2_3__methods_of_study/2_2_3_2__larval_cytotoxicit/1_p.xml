<p>The cytotoxic effect of the studied plants hydroethanolic extract was evaluated on brine shrimp larvae. This is a preliminary nonclinical toxicity test performed according to the method described by Dougnon et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> larvae were obtained by hatching 10 mg of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> eggs under continuous agitation in 1 L of seawater for 48 h. Order stock extract solution's 2 dilution series with a concentration of 20 mg/mL were carried out in order to have an increasing scale concentration. 1 mL of each diluted solutions was added to 1 mL of sea water containing 16 live larvae. A control solution without the extract was prepared under same conditions. All solutions were incubated under agitation for 24 hours. Counting dead larvae number in each solution under an optical microscope produced a representative curve of the number of surviving larvae versus the concentration of the extract. The data (concentration-response) were log-transformed, and the LC
 <sub>50</sub> (mean lethal concentrations) was determined. To assess the larval toxicity of the extract, the correlation grid associating the degree of toxicity with LC
 <sub>50</sub> proposed by Mousseux was used [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. According to this grid, if the LC
 <sub>50</sub> value is greater than 0.1 mg/mL, the extract is declared nontoxic. If this value is between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL, the extract is weakly toxic, and if the LC
 <sub>50</sub> is less than 0.5 mg/mL, the extract is toxic.
