 <italic>(3) Histological Examinations</italic>. Histological sections of the liver and kidneys were performed at the Histopathology Laboratory of the Institute of Applied Biomedical Sciences (ISBA) of the University of Abomey-Calavi. The pathomorphological study consisted of hematoxylin-eosin staining of thin sections of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thicknesses. It is routine staining after which the nuclei, stained by hematoxylin, appear dark blue and the cytoplasm, stained by eosin, appear pink. The microscopic observation of these sections was carried out with the ZEISS camera microscope at different magnifications, so that only the most representative photographs were selected.
