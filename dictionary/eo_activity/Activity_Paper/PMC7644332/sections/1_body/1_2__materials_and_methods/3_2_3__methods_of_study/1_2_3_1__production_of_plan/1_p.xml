 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> leaves, 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> whole plant, and 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots collected were washed thoroughly with tap water to remove any form of dirt and dried in the shade at room temperature at the Research Unit in Applied Microbiology and Pharmacology of natural substances (URMAPha). They were then powdered with an electric mill. From this powder, a hydroethanolic extraction was carried out according to the methodology described by Klotoé et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fifty (50) grams of powder were macerated in 500 mL of the mixed solvent with equal volume of distilled water and 96% ethanol. The mixture was continuously stirred for 72 hours at room temperature. The homogenate obtained has been filtered three times on hydrophilic cotton and once on Wittman paper No. 1. The filtrate obtained has been evaporated at the temperature of 40°C in an oven until a dry mass that represents the extract. The extract obtained has been weighed and used to evaluate the extraction yield (EY) and then kept in the refrigerator at 4°C. The following formula was used:
