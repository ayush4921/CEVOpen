 <italic>In silico</italic> prediction analysis predicted harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside to be absorbed poorly in the gastrointestinal tract and not permeable across the blood brain barrier (BBB) as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside was also predicted as a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. The compound was predicted not to be an inhibitor of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4. The oral LD
 <sub>50</sub> was predicted to be 2000 mg/kg, with a toxicity class of 4.
