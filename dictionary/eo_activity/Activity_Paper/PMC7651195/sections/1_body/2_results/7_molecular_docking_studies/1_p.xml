<p>The binding potentials of Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and standard FDA approved drugs (Azithromycin, Chloroquine, and Remdesivir) were studied by means of molecular docking. Ligand-protein interactions between viral protein (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), the host receptor target (ACE2) and Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005 F0006 F0007">Figures 5–7</xref>. Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside displayed a good binding in complex with the host receptor target, initiation and termination sequence of the viral spike protein messenger RNA compared to all studied standard drugs with binding affinities of −7.5, −6.4 and 6.3 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Interestingly, it showed comparable binding affinity with Remdesivir, when in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a slight difference of 0.2 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> but better binding compared to Azithromycin and Chloroquine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figures S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">S3</xref>; and 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).
