<p>As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref>, incubation of harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside with neutrophils significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) inhibited ROS production stimulated by zymosan in PMNs with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.33 + 0.01 µg/mL. The activity was dose dependent with increasing concentration. The compound also significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) suppressed the proliferation of T-cell proliferation, with a 26% inhibitory activity compared to the control as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4B</xref>.
