<p>Blood obtained from a consented apparently healthy volunteer was subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and proliferation to extract T-cells as described previously (Nielsen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The cells were cultured in a 96-well round bottom tissue culture plate at a concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/mL. They were thereafter stimulated with 1.25 mg/mL of phytohaemagglutinin and incubated with the isolated compound (0.5, 5.00 and 50.00 µg/mL) at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 72 h. After incubation, the reaction was pulsed with titrated thymidine 0.5 µCi/well, and further incubated for 18 h. The cells were harvested with a cell harvester (SKATRON A.S. Flow Lab., Norway) into a glass fibre-filter (Cambridge Technology USA), and measured by counting with a liquid scintillation counter. After 120 s, the counts per minute (cpm) results were recorded (Erukainure, Mesaik, et al.,
