<p>We obtained freely available daily data of confirmed cases and deaths for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic across the world from the COVID-19 – Statistics and Research website from January 2020 to March 2020 (Roser et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0555" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; ECDC, 
 <xref rid="CIT0666" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The COVID-19 – Statistics and Research team retrieves daily global and national statistics of COVID-19 from two credible sources, the World Health Organization (WHO) and, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We aggregated the daily confirmed data (cases and deaths) for each country into monthly data for January to March 2020, and subsequently performed the spatiotemporal distribution analysis of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths using the ArcGIS 10.6 software (ESRI, Redland, CA, USA).
