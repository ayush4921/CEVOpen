<p>Taken together, these results suggest the immunomodulatory properties of harpagide 5-O-Î²-D-glucopyranoside isolated from 
 <italic>C. volubile</italic> leaves which may be explored in the treatment and management of COVID-19. This is further corroborated by its strong molecular interaction and binding with the translation initiation and termination sequence sites of S protein mRNA and S protein of SARS-COV-2 and its host receptor protein (ACE2 receptor). In addition, there is a need for implementation of targeted intervention policies and resources which should include a global health emergency involving continuous collaborative surveillance, information sharing, research and implementation of evidence-based public health and clinical practices.
