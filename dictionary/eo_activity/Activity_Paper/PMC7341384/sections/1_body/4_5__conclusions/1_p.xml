<p>Our findings demonstrated that 3 commonly used Thai medicinal plants are effective for wound treatment and supported their uses in Thai traditional medicine. Their effectiveness can be scientifically explained in terms of the activities of these plant extracts and their active markers that promote wound healing through the inhibition of nitric oxide and superoxide anions and through increasing fibroblast cell proliferation and accelerating wound closure. Further studies are necessary to explain the wound healing property of these herbs and to develop them into a potential wound healing agent.</p>
