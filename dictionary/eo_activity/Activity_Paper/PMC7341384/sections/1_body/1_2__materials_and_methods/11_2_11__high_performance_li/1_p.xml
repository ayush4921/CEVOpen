<p>The HPLC (UV 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) equipped with an UV-detector was set at 253 nm. The chromatographic separation was performed at room temperature on an XDB-C18 analytical column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, USA) injection volume 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l at low rate 1.0 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% v/v phosphoric acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). Total running time was 60 min and the gradient program was as follows: 5% B for 0–5 min, 5% B to 50% B for 35 min, 50% B to 95% B for 15 min, and 95% B to 5% B for 5 min. The compounds were quantified using Agilent lab software.
