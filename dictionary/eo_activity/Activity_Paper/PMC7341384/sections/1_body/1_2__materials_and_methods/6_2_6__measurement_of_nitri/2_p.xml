<p>The viability of cells was determined by MTT assay after incubation with LPS and medicinal plant extracts for 24 hrs. MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to 96-well plates (plate 1) and incubated for 2 hrs, and then the supernatant was discarded. A solution of 0.04 M HCl in isopropanol was added to dissolve formazans formed in the cells and the absorbance measured at 570 nm [

 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated.
