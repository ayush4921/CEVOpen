<p>The results showed that ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> could reduce superoxide anion, inhibit nitric oxide production, promote fibroblast proliferation, and accelerate wound closure. These two extracts would be useful for the first and second stages of wound healing as described above. Although the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>saliva</italic> showed the lowest activity against superoxide anion and no activity against nitric oxide, it showed the highest wound closure activity among all extracts and asiaticoside, the reference compound. 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> extract would be beneficial at the second stage of wound healing. For this reason, these three ethanolic plant extracts had passed the selection criteria in testing their markers for these activities. These markers were 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-mangostin for 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic>, glycyrrhizin for 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic>, and thymoquinone for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic>.
