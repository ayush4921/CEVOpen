 <italic>Weissella cibaaria</italic> (JW15) was assessed upon lipopolysaccharide challenge in mouse macrophages, where the probiotic was associated with reduced induction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). When the stimulus was changed to heat-killed JW15, the same study observed diminished production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> using down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 [

 <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG and GR-1 appear capable of anti-inflammatory effects using down-regulation of TNF-α production in human monocytes and mouse macrophages [
