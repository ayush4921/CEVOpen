<p id="p0030">The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as the receptor for cell entry, which is highly expressed in gut and lung tissues that produce well-described symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the gut, proximal and distal enterocytes are targets [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and both the receptor and these cell types are known to be pathologically connected with intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nausea and diarrhoea are reported to be primary symptoms of COVID-19 even before the development of fever and respiratory symptoms, whereas abdominal pain continues to be reported frequently in patients admitted to intensive care [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The most severe cases of COVID-19 often involve pneumonia followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], involving hypoxaemic respiratory distress concurrent with lung neutrophilia, mucus and fluid accumulation in bronchi, and bronchiectasis [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
