<p>As shown, the lowest concentration of sodium (307.66 mEq/L) was found on the seventh day for PO 100 mg/kg whereas the highest sodium concentration (352.33 mEq/L) was related to the control group on the seventh day. The lowest concentration of potassium (11.33 mEq/L) was found on the first, sixth, and seventh day for PO 200 mg/kg. On the other hand, the control group had the highest potassium concentration (19 mEq/L) on the seventh day. The lowest concentration of urine osmolality (418.33 mOsm/kg) was observed on the seventh day for PO 200 mg/kg while the control group had the highest osmolality (458.33 mOsm/kg) on day seven. Similarly, the control group and the group that used 50 mg/kg of the PO demonstrated no significant differences in three first day. </p>
