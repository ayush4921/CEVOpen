<p>The blood sample was taken from the heart, and urine was collected from the bladder at the postmortem examination (Bekkevold et al., 2012

More precisely, both plasma and urine sodium and potassium concentrations, as well as plasma BUN and creatinine were estimated by a flame photometer (IL 943 flame photometer) and an automated chemistry analyzer (VetAce, ALFAWasserman), respectively (Bekkevold et al., 2012
