<p>This group included 2 subgroups and each subgroup consisted of 4 subgroups. In these groups, mice had access to water but in different amounts encompassing 75% (75% water ration) and 50% (50% water ration) of daily water intake. All blood and urine samples were taken at 9 am for 7 days (Bekkevold et al., 2012
