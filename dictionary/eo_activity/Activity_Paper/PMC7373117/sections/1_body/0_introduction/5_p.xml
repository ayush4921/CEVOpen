<p>The bark of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) is locally used in India for diarrhea as a paste along with other plants.[
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The bark of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) has been used as antitumor agent and along with that its bark has also been used for some liver disorders from early ages.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Alkaloids isolated from the flowers of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) were investigated for anxiolytic properties in a research and the results showed significant effect that was performed on Swiss albino male mice. Compound known as erythraline is α4, β2-nicotinic receptors antagonist and has prominent anxiolytic effect.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The crude aqueous extract of flowers of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) shows potential spasmolytic, bronchodilatory, and antioxidant effect.[
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] From the alcoholic extract of stem bark of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb), certain flavonoids were isolated. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were used to investigate their biological activity, showing apoptosis-inducing effect.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In this study, flavonoids from 
 <italic>E. suberosa (Roxb</italic>) bark were found to be the most potent cytotoxic agent with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 20 IM in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In spite of apoptosis, these flavonoids significantly inhibited nuclear transcription factor (NF-κB) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling pathway.[
