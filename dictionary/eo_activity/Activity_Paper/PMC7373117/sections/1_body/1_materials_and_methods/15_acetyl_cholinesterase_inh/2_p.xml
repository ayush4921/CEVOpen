<p>All the above were added to well-1, respectively, followed by prereading at 405nm. The mixture of the contents was incubated for 10min at 37°C after which reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μL of 0.5-mM substrate acetylthiocholine iodide for Acetylcholine. At the end, 10 μL dithio nitrobenzoic acid with 0.5mM concentration was added and incubated for further 15min at 37°C. At 405nm, absorbance was measured again through 96-well plate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek, Winooski, USA). Eserine of 0.5-mM concentration was applied as positive control. The following formula was used to calculate percent inhibition (% inhibition):</p>
