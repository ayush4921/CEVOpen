<p>Antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) bark was performed on crude extract and its fractions. For each fraction, 1mg per mL stock solution was prepared in methanol. Dilutions from 1000 μg/ mL to 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, and 7.81 μg/ mL were prepared by serial dilution method. 1 mL methanol solution of Diphenyl picrylhydrazyl in concentration of (1mg/mL) was mixed with each 1 mL of diluted solutions. After incubation for 30min at 25°C in darkness, absorbance was recorded at 517nm. The assay was performed in triplicates and %age inhibition was measured by using following formula:
