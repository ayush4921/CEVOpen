<p>Sample solution of 60 μL and 50 μL of 0.1 M PBS having pH 6.8 containing α-glucosidase solution of 0.2 U/ mL concentrations was put in 96-well plate and placed in an incubator for 20min at 37°C. To the aforementioned each 96-well plate, 50 μL of 5mM ρ-nitrophenyl-α-
 <sc>D</sc>-glucopyranoside (PNPG) solution in 0.1 M PBS having pH 6.8 was added and incubated again at 37°C for 20min. After incubation process, reaction was stopped by the addition of 160 mL of 0.2-M sodium carbonate into all wells of the plate. At 405nm, absorbance was recorded by microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek). Percent inhibition and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of samples were calculated by using the following formula: inhibition (%) = control – test / control × 100.
