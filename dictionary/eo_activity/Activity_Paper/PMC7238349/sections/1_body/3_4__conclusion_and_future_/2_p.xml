<p>Several modes of preparation, usage factors, health risks, and countermeasures on the use of antimalarial herbal drugs should be systematically examined through advanced scientific approaches. This will aid in the identification and authentication of therapeutic potency of antimalarial compounds isolated from medicinal herbs, thereby promoting its global relevance as efficacious and safe antimalarial plants in primary health care. Individuals, societies, sociogroups, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations should devise plans which could assist in the conservation of these medicinal plants in order to prevent their extermination and exploitation of indigenous populations, as well as considerations for cultural disruptions should one or more of these plant species become a valuable resource. In the meantime, the outcomes of this study serve as a platform of appraisal for indigenous claims of medicinal plants as effective antimalarial drugs in Nigeria and the world as a whole.</p>
