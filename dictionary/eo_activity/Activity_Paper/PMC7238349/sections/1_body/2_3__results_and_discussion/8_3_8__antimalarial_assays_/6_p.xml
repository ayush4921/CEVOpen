 <italic>Carica papaya.</italic> The antimalarial property of 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> leaf extracts was screened against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 and Dd2 strains using bioassay-guided fractions and dichloromethane extract. The petroleum ether and chloroform fractions of 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> fruit and root assessed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for antimalarial activity against early 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection in mice displayed pronounced chemosuppressive effect at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. Significant activities were observed in petroleum ether fractions (61.78%) compared to 48.11% of chloroform fraction [

 <italic>C. papaya</italic> and 
 <italic>V. amygdalina</italic> in ameliorating plasmodium infection in mice showed significant result at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. The oral administration significantly surged the RBC and PCV renaissance when compared to the disease control. This underlined the importance of plants in conventional therapy of malaria infection [

 <italic>C. papaya</italic> was appraised on chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> The extracts significantly inhibited the activities of both plasmodium strains with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40.75%, 36.54%, 25.30%, and 18.0% for chloroquine-sensitive and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50.23%, 32.50%, 21.45%, and 23.12% for chloroquine-resistance plasmodium strains [
