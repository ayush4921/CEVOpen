<p>Malaria epidemic has been enormously high in low socioeconomic empowered regions. In Africa, nearly 19 million cases of malaria infections have been reported accounting to 89% of the global cases and almost 17 million deaths have been published [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It affected the morbidity and mortality rate owing to pathogenic resistance to conventional drugs, vector control agents, and human migration [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several factors have been analysed and reported to control malaria infections in Africa. These are climate suitability, dams or reservoirs, migration, and vegetation. According to the report published by The World malaria in 2018, malarial cases have tremendously reduced in relation to the report of 2010. Despite this, between 2015 and 2017, no significant progress was achieved in curbing malaria cases [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This trend could be indicative of the widely spread of drug-resistant malaria and the intricacy of parasites' life cycle [
