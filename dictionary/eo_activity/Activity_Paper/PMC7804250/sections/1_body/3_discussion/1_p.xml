 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. Some biotic elicitors or physical stimulations are always used to improve the production of secondary metabolites in vitro 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. MJ and SA have been proven to be signalling molecules involved in the plant defence response and are now widely used as elicitors for secondary metabolite production in vitro
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, the concentration, type and time course of elicitors have a great impact on the accumulation of secondary metabolites 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. In previous studies, the treatment of plant cultures with MJ has been shown to increase the accumulation of triterpenoid saponins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>, alkaloids
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>, and ginsenoside
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, many studies have found that secondary metabolite products in SA-treated plant cells are also significantly increased
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, studies have found that mechanical damage increases and induces the production of various secondary metabolites, including volatiles
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup>. Wounding treatment also increased the accumulation of volatiles, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. In 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> suspensions, there have been some inconsistencies regarding the content of SAN after treatment with SA and MJ
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. However, in California poppy, both MJ and SA significantly increased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) the content of SAN
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Consistent with these findings, we observed an enhancement of SAN content in the MJ treatment group in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Interestingly, SAN content decreased in the MJ + wounding or SA + wounding groups, and the same phenomenon also appeared in 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>, in which necrosis caused by mechanical wounding at damaged sites can be recovered by exogenously supplied MJ. The biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites is mainly regulated by gene expression levels. With the completion of the whole genome sequencing of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>, some key genes involved in biosynthesis of sanguinarine have been identified
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, such as P6H and DBOX. P6H is responsible for catalyzing PRO and ALL to produce SAN and CHE, respectively. DBOX is the key gene that catalyzes the last step of SAN and CHE synthesis. Based on the gene expression data, elicitors have different effects on the P6H and DBOX genes. Specifically, MJ has a greater effect on the DBOX gene than on P6H. In contrast, SA has a greater effect on the P6H gene than on DBOX. In 
 <italic>Argemone mexicana</italic>, yeast extract increases DBOX activity, but does not increase after MeJa induction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup>. This shows that different species are affected differently by the elicitor. Based on these results, we believe that MJ is the best elicitor for increased SAN production, with hope for its application to the production of sanguinarine during harvesting in the future.
