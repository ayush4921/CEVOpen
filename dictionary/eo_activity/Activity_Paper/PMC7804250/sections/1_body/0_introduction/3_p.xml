<p id="Par4">In 2017, the whole genome of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> was sequenced, which is the first species in Papaveraceae to have a completed genome-wide sequence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. Research on elicitors of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> will further promote the study of the regulation of SAN synthesis. Currently, the protocol of regeneration and transformation in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> has been established, and the SAN biosynthetic pathway and genes in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> have been validated (Fig.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MJ, SA and wounding on BIA metabolism in plant tissue culture seedlings to enhance SAN production in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Moreover, multiple processing at different times was evaluated. Additionally, the effect of different elicitors was evaluated on the basis of the metabolic profile and gene expression in the SAN and CHE biosynthesis pathway.
