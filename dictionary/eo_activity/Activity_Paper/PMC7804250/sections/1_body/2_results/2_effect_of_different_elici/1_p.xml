<p id="Par10">The production of protopine and sanguinarine need to be catalysed by the enzymes encoded by the P6H and DBOX genes; therefore, the effect of the induction mode on the content can be further analysed by detecting the expression levels of these two genes. By analysing the mRNA expression levels of the P6H and DBOX genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which catalyse production of protopine and sanguinarine, the effect of the elicitor can be further analysed. We found that the P6H gene expression was the highest in the SA group at 24 h, which then decreased with time. In contrast to that in the SA group, the expression level of the P6H gene was highest in the SA + wounding group at 72 h. Interestingly, the expression pattern of the DBOX gene was the opposite of that of P6H. All the treatments increased the expression of the DBOX gene, which increased with time, except for that in the SA + wounding group at 120 h. The highest expression was induced by MJ treatment in all methods, followed by that induced by SA treatment.
