 </sup>. The freeze-dried plant tissues (0.5 mg) were mixed with methanol (25 mL). Then, the samples were extracted for 30 min by ultrasonication, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through a 0.22-mm membrane filter. Finally, the solution was chromatographically separated by an ultra-HPLC Agilent 1290 instrument using a BEH C18 column. The automatic sampler temperature was set at 6 °C. Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) was coupled with a QQQ mass spectrometer (6460A, Agilent). A calibration curve was generated using 5 points and was used to evaluate the absolute quantification of the target compound.
