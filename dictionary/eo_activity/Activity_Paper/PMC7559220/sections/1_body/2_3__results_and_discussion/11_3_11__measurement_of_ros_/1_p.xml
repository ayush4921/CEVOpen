<p>The oxidative pressure made by the free radical produced in response to the external stimuli is the premier cause of apoptosis in cancer cells. Previous research indicates that AgNPs cause oxidative stress and suppress the function of tumor suppressor genes, reduce mitochondrial potential, and induce lipid peroxidation that results in cell apoptosis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. The production of ROS was estimated after treating MCF-7 cells with extract (25.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and AgNPs (12.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The estimation of ROS equivalent to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>μ</italic>M) was evaluated compared to the control untreated cell with a different time interval. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12"> Figure 12</xref> demonstrates the quantification of ROS in AgNP- and extract-exposed cells related to the control cells. However, AgNPs were more efficient in the production of ROS as compared to extract-treated cells. This may be due to the effect wherein the plant extract has the ability to scavenge some free radicals. The production of ROS was maximum after 16 hours, and it turned to decrease gradually. The effect of ROS on cellular events depends on the concentrations and duration of treatment. A typical response of cellular events during stress condition is the cell cycle arrest at the G
 <sub>0</sub> phase, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. We observed that the level of ROS generated by AgNPs is on a time-dependent manner. Hsin and colleagues reported that AgNPs generate ROS (reactive oxygen species) in the NIH3T3 cell and induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by activating the JNP pathway [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. ROS are free radicals generated by the biological system for their normal cell functions. The abnormal level of ROS results in the malfunction of cellular components that cause damage to DNA, lipid peroxidation, arresting cell cycle caspase activation, and apoptosis [
