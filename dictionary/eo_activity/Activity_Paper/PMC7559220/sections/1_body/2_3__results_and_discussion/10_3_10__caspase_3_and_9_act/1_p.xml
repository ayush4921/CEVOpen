<p>Apoptosis is the course of programmed cellular death that manifests disassembling of the intracellular components while avoiding harm and inflammation of surrounding cells [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Caspases are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and cell death [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Functionally, caspases have two main types, i.e., effector (caspases 3, 6, and 7) and initiator (caspases 2, 8, 9, and 10) caspases [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Apoptosis is initiated by the interaction of caspase 3 with caspases 8 and 9. This signal interaction also displays no return in the apoptotic pathway [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The apoptosis was further authenticated by measuring the level of the caspase 3 and 9 production in AgNP and extract-treated MCF-7 cells over the untreated control group. Caspases 3 and 9 are the terminal phase inducer of program cell death in cancer cells when activated by external stimuli. The caspase 3 and 9 activities were twofold enhanced in cells exposed to AgNPs and extract compared to control (untreated) cells (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. During apoptosis, a series of initiator caspases, e.g., caspase 9, and executioner caspases, e.g., caspase 3, are expressed as an inactive zymogen in the cytoplasm that helps in the program cell death [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. AgNPs activate these caspases 3 and 9 and some other reactive oxygen species that cause DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, misfolding of proteins, and apoptosis as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. It has been reported that on activation, caspase 3 cleaves and translocates caspase-activated DNAse (CAD) that results in DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation by endonuclease activity is considered as a prominent event in the apoptosis which occurs in the early stages [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The same type of observation was made by Arora et al. studying the effect of AgNPs on cellular responses [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].
