<p>AgNP-treated MCF-7 cells were investigated by AO/EB fluorescence staining techniques for determination of apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, six-well plates were used to culture MCF-7 cells to a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well for 24 hours. Cells were then exposed to the already calculated inhibitory concentration (IC50
 <sub>0</sub>) for 24 hrs. Unexposed cells to AgNPs were taken as the control. A mixture of the AO/EB dyes (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was prepared by mixing the two dyes prepared initially at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in PBS each. After staining the treated and control samples, these cells were monitored and imaged by fluorescence microscope (Olympus) with excitation (488 nm) and emission (520 nm).
