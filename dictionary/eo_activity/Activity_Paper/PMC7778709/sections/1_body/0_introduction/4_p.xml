<p id="Par5">After deep investigative analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 constructure, researchers have been able to identify all the possible targets of the SARS-CoV-2 in a detailed way [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The promising results of the computational molecular docking of both compounds in almost all targets, in comparison with the reference potent drugs, theoretically confirmed their exceptional multitarget inhibitory activity against coronaviral-2 particles (to the best of my knowledge, the two compounds are considered the first potent multitarget anti-COVID-19 compounds). This interesting outcome inspired me to experimentally bioevaluate them. Precisely as the hypothetical predictions, the in vitro bioassay outcomes were also very promising. Based on all the previous facts and results, we can expect that 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> will successfully act as very potent anti-COVID-19 drug candidates through several and distinct mechanisms of action (i.e., through a very effective anti-COVID-19 mode of multiaction). Detailed illustrations of all the discovered target COVID-19 therapy nonstructural proteins (nsps) and structural proteins (sps) present in SARS-CoV-2 and human (up to date) are presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, respectively. In this research paper, I report the successful repurposing of the two previously synthesized antioxidant 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>, as effective and potent anti-COVID-19 agents (as the first potent antidotal multitarget anti-SARS-CoV-2/anti-COVID-19 drugs).
