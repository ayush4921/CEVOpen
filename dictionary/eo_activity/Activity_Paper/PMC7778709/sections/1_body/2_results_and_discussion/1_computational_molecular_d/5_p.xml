<p id="Par13">Remdesivir, computationally, comes first among the three reference drugs (and third among all tested compounds in general) in anti-COVID-19 activities with binding energies range of − 7.00 to − 9.10 kcal/mol. Remdesivir shows its best binding affinity with the target enzyme nsp14 (N7-MTase), as it binds to this important SARS-CoV-2 enzyme with a very good binding energy of − 9.10 kcal/mol. Ivermectin and favipiravir come last, with their best binding affinities observed with the two coronaviral-2 enzymes nsp14 (N7-MTase; − 7.20 kcal/mol) and RdRp (RTP site; − 6.90 kcal/mol), respectively.</p>
