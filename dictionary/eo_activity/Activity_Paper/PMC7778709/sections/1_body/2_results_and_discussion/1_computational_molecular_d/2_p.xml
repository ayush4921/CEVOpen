<p id="Par10">On close inspection of the top pose score values (present in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) of docking most nsps and sps of SARS-CoV-2 (along with ACE2 of human, which is almost the only human entry point for the virus into the human body until now, see Introduction section and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) using COVID-19 Docking Server, it is clearly observed that 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> is distinguishably ranked first in its inhibitory binding affinities and potencies with an excellent range of binding energies of − 8.10 to − 12.00 kcal/mol. The binding affinities of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> dramatically exceed those of all the three reference drugs (they are about to be twice as those of favipiravir) and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>, as the potent antioxidant 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> molecule powerfully binds to the respective proteins forming very stable inhibited (deactivated) complexes with relatively amazing binding energies which are the lowest among all (i.e., significantly lower than the binding energies of all the other four compounds in their complexes with the respective nsps and sps). Specifically, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> molecule gives its best inhibitory binding affinities with the three nsps RdRp-RNA (RTP site) (− 12.00 kcal/mol), nsp14 (N7-MTase) (− 11.40 kcal/mol), and PLpro (dimer) (− 10.60 kcal/mol), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a–d), which are three of the most effective protein targets in hindering and stopping the life cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 through inhibition and deactivation of their active sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These exceptional results are very promising as they indicate the high possibility of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> to be a very potent inhibitor (blocker) of RdRp, nsp14, and/or PLpro. Other proteins affording very encouraging excellent binding affinities with 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> molecule include ACE2, nsp16 (all sites), N protein (NCB site), nsp3 (both sites), helicase (both sites), Mpro, and RdRp without RNA (RNA site) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), respectively.
