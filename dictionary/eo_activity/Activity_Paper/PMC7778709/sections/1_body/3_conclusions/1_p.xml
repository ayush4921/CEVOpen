<p id="Par18">Thinking outside the box is very important to win our current challenge against the scary COVID-19 pandemic. Potent multiblockade of, mainly, the novel SARS-CoV-2 proteins including enzymes and receptors could be seen as one of the most effective fertile approaches for comprehensive COVID-19 therapy through designing, discovering, and searching for multitarget SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, thus much efforts in drug discovery in 2020 were focused on trying to successfully repurpose known drugs and compounds in order to effectively inhibit this extremely resistant coronavirus. My specific efforts led to the discovery of two very promising potent multitarget SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors through the successful reevaluation and repurposing of the known antioxidant 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds, previously synthesized by me, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> (1,2,3-tris[5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]propan-2-ol) and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> (5-[5-(7-chloro-4-hydroxyquinolin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]benzene-1,2,3-triol), which effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.31 (according to the used anti-COVID-19 assay, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> is the most potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor discovered till now) and 1.01 μM, and amazingly presented about 65-/171-/303.5-fold and 20-/52.5-/93-fold anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities and potencies more than remdesivir/ivermectin/favipiravir, respectively. On the other hand, the discovery of the very potent anti-COVID-19 activities of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecules through the successful biological reevaluation and repurposing opens the door for us to establish the first class of anti-COVID-19 agents of the type “polyphenolic 1,3,4-oxadiazoles” which will specifically comprise a series of 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (beginning with the first two effective members, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>). Prior extensive computational molecular studies showed that 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> have the ideal and balanced values of the pharmacokinetic and druglikeness parameters required to be effectively potent anti-COVID-19 drugs inside the human body. Computational molecular modeling analysis of the best inhibitory docking binding modes of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecules with the SARS-CoV-2/human proteins showed that the 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl moieties greatly increase the blocking affinities and potencies at the active and/or allosteric sites of the SARS-CoV-2/human enzymes or proteins (binding energies reach − 12.00 kcal/mol for 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and − 9.90 kcal/mol for 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>) when compared to those of the three references (which lack this effective antioxidant 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl moiety), remdesivir, ivermectin, and favipiravir (binding energies maximally reach − 9.10, − 7.20, and − 6.90 kcal/mol, respectively). Surprisingly, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> surpassed 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> and the three moderately to highly potent reference drugs in the values of almost all compared computational and experimental anti-COVID-19 parameters, scores, and activities. Specifically, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> give their best inhibitory binding affinities results with the catalytic active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. If the 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> compound successfully passes the in vivo bioassays and then the preclinical/clinical trials with highly effective and satisfactorily significant results as anti-COVID-19 agent, a possible combination therapy (e.g., as an oral tablet/capsule, an intravenous/intramuscular parenteral vial/ampoule, or a nasal/oral/ocular prophylactic gel/drops) with a second highly potent old anti-RNA virus drug, such as remdesivir, may be a recommended available choice for ultimate COVID-19 treatment in the near future. In brief, in this new research paper, the antioxidant 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecules were successfully reevaluated, repurposed, and reported as very promising hit molecules (they could also be considered as the first extremely potent anticoronaviral-2 polyphenolic 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds “Coronavirus-2 Killers”) with general multitarget and very potent successful inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (mainly), and consequently, both compounds are two of the first known promising under-investigation candidate drugs for the effective and complete treatment of COVID-19.
