<p>Nigella may be considered as a borderline “promising” treatment example as there is some preliminary clinical evidence for its relief of cough but it seems to be restricted to asthma patients, so from a physiopathological point of view is not clear how useful it would be in cold/flu. As for the others, although considered safe, there is simply not enough evidence – clinical or pre-clinical – in relation to their benefits on the target symptoms (cough, fever) or conditions (cold, flu).</p>
