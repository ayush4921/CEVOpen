 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies were reported against a range of respiratory viruses but for some preparations only at higher concentrations (

 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic>, as well as fractions rich in chicoric acid, polysaccharide, and alkylamide, were evaluated in rats. Phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophage was increased with increasing concentrations of the Echinacea components. Also, a trend of increase in TNF-α and NO release, after 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> LPS stimulation, by the alveolar macrophages was observed. High concentration led to a release of cytokines (such as TNF-α and IFN-γ) in rat’s spleen macrophage (
