 <italic>Platycodon chinensis</italic> has been experimentally proven for cough and fever in mice (
 <xref rid="B360" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B534" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). An aqueous extract from 
 <italic>P. chinensis</italic> presented anti-inflammatory activity in rats, in the carrageenan model. The extract inhibited the production of cytokines and the expression of COX-2 (
 <xref rid="B268" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Platycosides are inhibitors of the production of IL-6, PGD2, LTC4, and Î²-Hex, therefore presenting potential for allergy symptoms treatment (

 <xref rid="B297" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 1975</xref>). Crude platycodin presented anti-histaminic and anticholinergic effects in guinea-pig, but not presented anti-serotonin or anti-bradykinin effect (
 <xref rid="B463" ref-type="bibr">Takagi and Lee, 1972</xref>). Isolated platycodin D and D3 presented anti-inflammatory and potential expectorant activities. In rat and hamster tracheal surface epithelial cells, both compounds increased mucin release. Platycodin D3 was most active than ATP (mucin secretagogue) and ambroxol (mucolytic) (

 <italic>P. chinensis</italic> inhibited cough in mice (
