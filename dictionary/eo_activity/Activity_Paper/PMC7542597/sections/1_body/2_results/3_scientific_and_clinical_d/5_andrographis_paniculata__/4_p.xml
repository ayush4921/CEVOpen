<p>Preclinical evidence. This herbal medicine has been experimentally proven for respiratory disease, based on a mouse-model for influenza (an adapted H1N1 strain PR8A/PR/8/34). Treatment with andrographolide decreased the virus loads and the expression of the inflammatory cytokines. Also, diminished lung pathology and overall survival rate (

 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and andrographolide have been linked to the increasing proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of IL-2 and inhibition of the tumor cell proliferation immune system (

 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract SHA-10 and 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> extract SHE-3 showed an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> effect on the activation and proliferation of immune-competent cells as well on the production of key cytokines and immune activation markers (

 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and key constituents (
