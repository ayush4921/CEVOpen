<p>A total of 39 herbal medicines were identified as very likely to appeal to COVID-19 patients. According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found 
 <italic>positive</italic> in 5 cases, 
 <italic>promising</italic> in 10 cases, and 
 <italic>unknown</italic> for the rest. On the same basis, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling clinical evidence for a positive assessment to endorse the adjuvant use of paracetamol and/or codeine due to their common adverse effects in the respiratory function.
