<p>Free radicals are molecular species or atoms which contain one or more unpaired electrons. These are constantly produced in the human body as a result of cell metabolism [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Free radicals have important roles in gene expression and activation of receptors as well as in regulation of signal transduction [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, an excess of free radicals can become toxic to living cells [
