<p>In ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> assay, a blue/green ABTS
 <sup>.+</sup> chromophore is generated by the oxidation of ABTS with potassium persulfate. Antioxidants which have the ability of donating hydrogen reduced the blue/green color of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> and can be measured spectrophotometrically at 745 nm [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. DPPH is a stable synthetic radical and does not deteriorate in water, methanol, or ethanol [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In DPPH assay, presence of hydrophilic antioxidants such as proton radical scavengers or hydrogen donors, reduced the color of DPPH to straw color [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] from its original deep violet color at 517 nm. Moreover, the DPPH assay determines only the hydrophilic antioxidants whereas the ABTS
 <sup>.+</sup> assay measures both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants [
