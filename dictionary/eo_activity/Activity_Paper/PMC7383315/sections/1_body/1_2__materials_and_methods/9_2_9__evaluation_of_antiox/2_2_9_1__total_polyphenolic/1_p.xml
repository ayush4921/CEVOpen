<p>Total polyphenol content of ethanol and aqueous extracts of PHAF was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in 96-well microplates with some modifications. Absorbance was recorded at 765 nm and gallic acid was used to construct the standard curve. TPC of ethanol and aqueous extracts of PHAF were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of extract on a dry weight basis.
