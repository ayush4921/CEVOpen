<p>Scientific names from the SciResources 1-2 were stored in two separate fields. Collectively, a total of 1822 drug monographs possess scientific names from one or both resources. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2(c)</xref> provides information on the number of scientific names. As demonstrated, a total of 851 monographs including 621 herbs, 181 drugs with animal origin, and 49 minerals had scientific names. There are 66 and 114 different families based on “SciName1” and “SciName2,” respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2(d)</xref> shows the most common plant families extracted from the two resources with the highest frequency seen in 
 <italic>Leguminosae</italic>, 
 <italic>Compositae</italic>, 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> families, respectively. 
 <italic>Leguminosae</italic>, commonly known as 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic> or pea family, is widely distributed with approximately 730 genera and 19,400 species [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This richness of this species is reflected in great morphological and chemical diversity, from which numerous compounds are derived [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The outstanding feature of this family is the presence of roots tubercles or nodules which harbor nitrogen-fixing bacteria (
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic>). Pharmacological actions of these plants include analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic, antimicrobial, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The Compositae (
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic>) is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants. They are found in diverse habitats and contains over 40 economically important species including food (lettuce and Jerusalem artichoke), oil (sunflower and safflower), medicinal (chamomile), and ornamental (
 <italic>Chrysanthemum</italic>, 
 <italic>dahlia</italic>, 
 <italic>zinnia</italic>, and 
 <italic>marigold</italic>) crops. Many members of 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> with pharmacological activity contain important phytochemical compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and diterpenoids and have antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, insecticide, and antitumor capacities of 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, also known as the mint family, is a large plant family of mostly shrubs and herbs containing about 236 genera and 6,900 to 7,200 species. 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> are distributed globally with particularly high diversity in the Mediterranean region. Medicinal properties of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species are often attributed to their high content of volatile compounds. Many members of the family including Ajuga, Coleus, and Salvia are widely cultivated as ornamentals, while others such as sage (
 <italic>Salvia</italic>), thyme (
 <italic>Thymus</italic>), mint (
 <italic>Mentha</italic>), marjoram (
 <italic>Origanum</italic>), rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>), lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula</italic>), and basil (
 <italic>Ocimum</italic>) are widely used as culinary herbs and spices [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> or carrot family consists of plants with a characteristic umbrella-arranged fruit. Comprising of approximately 450 genera and 3700 species, this family of plants can be found worldwide [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The noteworthy character of this family is the high content of volatile oil or oleoresin [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Members of 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> possess various compounds with many biological activities. Some of the main properties are antibacterial, hepatoprotective, vasorelaxant, and antitumor activities as well as the ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit cyclooxygenase [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Other medicinal herbs with high commercial value can be especially found in 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Boraginaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Cucurbitaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Euphorbiaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Papaveraceae</italic> plant families.
