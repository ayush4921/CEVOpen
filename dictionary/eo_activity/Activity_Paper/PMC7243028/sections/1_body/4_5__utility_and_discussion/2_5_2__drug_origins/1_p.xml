<p>Drugs were defined to have herbal, animal, mineral, or other origins, the percentages of which and their share in the main 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> types were shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>. Herbs clearly constituted the majority of drug monographs, followed by medicinal substances with animal and mineral origin that comprise approximately 17% and 14% of the database, respectively. Approximately 0.4% (6 drugs) had origins other than those mentioned above, which consisted of those that encompass drugs of any origin or drug monographs with no consensus on the origin. For example, “
 <italic>So</italic>'
 <italic>out</italic>” is a general term including any drug that is insufflated through the nose. Another example is “
 <italic>Ghavand</italic>,” a drug of ambiguous origin. As Aghili has stated, some scholars have described it as an herbal oil, while others have believed it to be an oil of animal origin. Collectively, herbs constituted the most instances in all of types of 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic>, whilst medicinal substances with an animal origin were mostly hot-wet, and minerals typically had a dry, cold-dry, or balanced 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic>.
