<p>On the other hand, there are several methods to discover new pharmacologically active plant compounds including biodiversity-based [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In fact, databases of traditional medicine can be a valuable resource for new drug discovery. For example, TCM scientists have addressed this issue and developed a number of databases such as traditional Chinese medicine integrated database (TCMID) [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or collective molecular activities of useful plants (CMAUP) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which are host to data on all aspects of TCM, including diseases, drugs, and their targets. These databases also provide external links to other resources including OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), Drugbank, PubChem, and STITCH (search tool for interactions of chemicals) [
