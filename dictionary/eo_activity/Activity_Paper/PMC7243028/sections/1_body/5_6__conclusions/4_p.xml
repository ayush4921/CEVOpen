<p>Since IrGO ontologies include English translations and definitions for ITM concepts, we intend to link our database to ontologies of IrGO as they develop to make the database usable for non-Persian speakers. This will also be of aid in creating a systems pharmacology platform of ITM 
 <italic>materia medica</italic> that encompasses the relationships between the drugs, their targets, and diseases and constructing a network of the information provided in the ITM literature. We will endeavor to expand the database and include other resources of ITM 
 <italic>materia medica</italic> and also provide links to phytochemical and other traditional medicine databases.
