 <italic>F. indica</italic>. The cultures maintained under UV treatment associated with a photoperiod regime showed enhanced levels of total phenolics and total flavonoids contents than respective controls. However, the results indicated that optimum accumulation of phenolics (total phenolics contents (TPC): 11.8 μg GAE/mg DW, total phenolics production (TPP): 488.1 μg GAE/mg DW) was found in cultures under photoperiod (16L/8D h) at UV-C dose (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). This was followed by culture grown under continuous light (24 h) with the maximum levels of total phenolic contents (TPC: 10.8 μg GAE/mg DW; TPP: 378.2 μg GAE/mg DW) at UV-C dose (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) in comparison to control [Fig.
