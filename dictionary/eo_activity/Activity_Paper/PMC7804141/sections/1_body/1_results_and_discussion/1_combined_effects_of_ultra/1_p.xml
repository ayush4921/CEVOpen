<p id="Par10">Light possess significant role in growth and development of plants. The application of different light sources as eliciting phytochemicals in pharmaceutical plants is getting deep attention. UV-C irradiation is one of them that play role in switching control expression of genes associated with growth and secondary metabolism of cells

 <sup>2</sup>) for 30 min under photoperiod (16L/8D h) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). This was followed by cultures grown under continuous light (24 h) with maximum biomass (FW: 345.9 g/L; DW: 13.9 g/L) at respective dose (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) of UV-C radiation for 40 min and biomass accumulation (FW: 227.2 g/L; DW: 9.43 g/L) in dark after 20 min exposure to UV radiation (3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) as compared with controls respectively [Fig.
