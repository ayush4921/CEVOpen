<p id="Par29">Similarly, the trend was also noted down in ABTS activity. The data showed that maximum activity (489.11 µmol TAEC mg /DW) was recorded in calli mediated with UV-C dose (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and grown in photoperiod (16L/8D h) while cultures grown in continuous light (24 h) after 20 mints of exposure to UV-C radiations (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) were found to enhance the ABTS activity up to (486.05 µmol TAEC mg /DW). However, the callus cultures under Dark (24 h) showed maximum activity (468.97 µmol TAEC mg /DW) after UV-C dose (9.0 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) as compared with control.
