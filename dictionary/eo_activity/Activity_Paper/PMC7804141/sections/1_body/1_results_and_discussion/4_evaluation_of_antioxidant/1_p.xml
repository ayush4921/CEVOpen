<p id="Par27">The callus cultures of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> irradiated by UV-C treatments under various photoperiod regimes were assessed for Antioxidant activity by employing DPPH, FRAP and ABTS assays. The DPPH assay is an extensively adopted technique to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of plant cells-derived products by considerable sensitivity, modest clarity and economic feasibility

 </sup>. The results indicated; the optimum DPPH activity (92.8%) was recorded in UV-C (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) mediated cultures maintained in photoperiod (16L/8D h) and DPPH activity (92.4%) in cultures elicited with UV-C (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 40 min and grown in Continuous light (24 h) [Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>]. The least DPPH activity (90.24%) was found in cultures exposed to UV-C dose of 3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup> for 20 min and developed in dark conditions (24 h). Recently, Khan et al. reported the same correlation and phenolics based increase in DPPH activity in cell cultures of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> under continuous light

 <italic>Fragaria x ananassava</italic> (Duchesne) to UV-C. The results conclusively show that rise in FRSA activity under UV-C treatments is because of enhanced accumulation of secondary phytochemicals as free radical scavengers
