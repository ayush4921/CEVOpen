 </sup> with little modifications. Shortly, 10 μL of extracted samples and FRAP solution (190 μL) were mixed [composed of acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6); FeCl 3.6H
 <sub>2</sub>O (20 mM) and TPTZ (10 mM); ratio 10:1:1 (v/v/v)]. Then the reaction mixtures were stored at 25 ± 1 °C for 15 min. Absorbance was recorded at wavelength (630 nm) using Microplate Reader (BioTek ELX800, Bio-Tek Instruments). Antioxidant capacity of samples was expressed in terms of TEAC (Trolox C equivalent antioxidant capacity).
