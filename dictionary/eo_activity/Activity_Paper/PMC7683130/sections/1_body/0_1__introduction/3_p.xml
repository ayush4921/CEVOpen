<p>Nepal is rich in biodiversity owing to its unique geographical location and diverse climatic and altitudinal variations. The existing plant checklist of Nepal has documented around 6000 species of flowering plants and 530 ferns [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, botanists have claimed that thousands of plant species are unexplored due to their extreme geographical location and availability of funding. Among the documented plant species, the medicinal potential of several plant species has not been scientifically validated. Many studies have reported the impact of diverse environmental conditions such as climate, altitude, soil type, rainfall, humidity, and degree of sun exposure on the phytoconstituents and biological activities of plant species [

Since there is tremendous geographical and climatic variation in Nepal, the chemical and biological profiles of flora and fauna found in Nepal may be varied from other places in the world. Therefore, in the present study, we selected seven Nepalese plants based on their local uses and limited scientific exploration of various parts of plants. The present study is aimed at quantitatively analyzing the reducing sugar and total phenolic content and exploring the antioxidant potential of selected plants of Nepalese origin. This research is the first to explore the reducing sugar content of selected plants and also the first scientific report on
