<p>Although a number of studies [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] have been carried out demonstrating the antioxidant potential of various parts of the studied plant using different extraction solvents, the study on the antioxidant potential of 70% ethanolic extract of a selected part of the studied plant samples from Nepal has not been performed yet. In our previous study [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we reported the antioxidant potential of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>L. neesiana</italic> stems with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 175.32 and 187.91 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Similarly, Adhikari-Devkota et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported the antioxidant activity of 60% ethanolic extract of leaves and twigs of 
 <italic>L. neesiana</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 29.5 ± 1.04 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Sharma and Kumar [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] revealed the antioxidant potential of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. malabathricum</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 21.86 ± 0.625 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The variation in the results of antioxidant activity of the plant samples between the present and previous studies may be due to the differences in extraction solvent/technique, parts of the plant used, genotype, elevation, soil characteristics, and climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To our knowledge, there was no prior scientific report exploring the antioxidant potential, RSC, and TPC of 
 <italic>F. glaberrima.</italic> The present study provides preliminary data on 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> by demonstrating a significant amount of RSC and TPC together with the potent antioxidant capacity. Further studies can be conducted on 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> to explore the biological activities and isolate the chemical constituents.
