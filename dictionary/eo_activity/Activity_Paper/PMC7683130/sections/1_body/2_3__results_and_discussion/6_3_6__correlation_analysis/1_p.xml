<p>The correlation of total phenolic content with DPPH radical scavenging activity is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Pearson's correlation coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>) and coefficient of determination (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) were found to be 0.866 and 0.750, respectively. The statistical analysis showed a positive and significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, which indicates the possible contribution of total phenolic content in the antioxidant activity of plant samples. Many other studies [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] have also reported the positive correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity.
