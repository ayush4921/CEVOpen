<p>HepG2 cells (6 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) in complete DMEM medium were seeded on a 6-well plate. Ten hours later, the complete medium was discarded, and the cells were maintained in serum-free, high glucose DMEM medium overnight. A conjugation of fatty acids 1.0 mM (oleic acid/palmitic acid, 2:1) and fat-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) was prepared at a 6:1 ratio in 2.0% FBS-DMEM medium and delivered to the cells. In addition, honey was simultaneously added at final concentrations 1.0% and 2.0% (
