<p>Reducing sugars, D-glucose and D-fructose, in honeys were analyzed following instructions from K-SUFRG 06/14 kit (Megazyme, Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Briefly, D-glucose was assayed by utilizing hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate avoiding sucrose hydrolysis. The content of D-fructose was recorded after the analysis of D-glucose content, following isomerization with phosphoglucose isomerase.</p>
