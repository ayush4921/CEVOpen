<p>Radical scavenging activity (RSA) of the medicinal honeys was recorded by determining the reduction in radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) following Meda et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Honey was diluted in methanol and filtered with a 0.45 µm sterile Millex filter (Merk, Bayswater, VIC, Australia). Then, 0.8 mL of a 2.5% honey solution (

 <italic>v</italic>) was added to 2.7 mL of 0.024 mg/mL DPPH in methanol. The mixture was vigorously shaken for 15 s and incubated for 30 min without light at room temperature. The DPPH reduction was read at 517 nm absorbance using a Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). RSA was the percentage of DPPH discoloration calculated from the equation:
 <disp-formula>% RSA = [(ADPPH − AS)/ADPPH] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where ADPPH and AS are the absorbance units of DPPH solutions in the absence and presence of honey, respectively.
