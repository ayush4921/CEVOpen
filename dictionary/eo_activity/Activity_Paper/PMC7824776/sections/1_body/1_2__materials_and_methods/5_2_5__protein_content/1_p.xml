<p>Protein content was assayed following Bradford’s method (1976) using a Thermo Scientific™Coomassie Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Scoresby, VIC, Australia). In doing so, a volume of 20 µL of honey solution (10%,

After ten min incubation at room temperature, the plate was read at 595 nm absorbance using a POLARstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). A calibration curve using bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards in the range of 0 to 100 μg/mL was used to calculate the protein content.
