<p>Phenolic and flavonoid compounds are markers of antioxidant activity and the content of total phenolics (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) were commonly analyzed to predict therapeutic potential of natural products [

Guggul honey contained the highest level of phenolic compounds (108.2 mg GAE/100 g), followed by manuka and arjuna honeys (72.1 and 73.4 mg GAE/100 g), whereas olive honey contained a moderate level (59.8 mg/100 g) and jiaogulan honey showed the least quantity (31.6 mg/100 g) (
