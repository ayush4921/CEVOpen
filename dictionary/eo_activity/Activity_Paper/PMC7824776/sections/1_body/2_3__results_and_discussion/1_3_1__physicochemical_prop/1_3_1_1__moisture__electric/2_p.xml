<p>Electrical conductivity (EC) indicates the quantity of mineral elements, organic acids and proteins in the composition of honey. EC recorded in all medicinal honeys was less than 0.8 mS/cm, the maximal limit regulated for blossom honey and was comparable to the other findings [

We also found that EC values in the newly developed medicinal honeys (0.24â€“0.34 mS/cm) were lower than those in manuka honey (0.54 mS/cm). This could result from the variations in nectar composition and environment that honeybees are exposed to [
