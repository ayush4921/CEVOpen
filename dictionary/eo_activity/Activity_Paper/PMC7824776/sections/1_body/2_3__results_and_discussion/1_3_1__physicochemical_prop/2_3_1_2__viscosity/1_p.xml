<p>The viscosity data indicated all tested honeys were Newtonian liquids (

 <xref rid="B45-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The novel medicinal honeys demonstrated much higher viscosity than manuka honey. Guggul honey presented the highest viscosity (316.2 Pa·s), followed by arjuna, jiaogulan and olive honey (125.8, 100.0 and 63.1 Pa·s). Although manuka honey showed the lowest viscosity (15.8 Pa·s), its viscosity is comparable with that of other natural honeys (1.8–13.8 Pa·s) [
