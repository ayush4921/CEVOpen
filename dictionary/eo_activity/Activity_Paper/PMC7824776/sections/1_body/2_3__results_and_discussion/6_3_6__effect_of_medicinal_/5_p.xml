<p>Arjuna honey (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>C) at 2.0% induced 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> and highly upregulated 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> gene expression (2.3-fold change relative to control) but did not upregulate 
 <italic>HMGCR</italic> gene transcription. This honey, however, did not show its effect on the transcriptional levels of 
 <italic>LXRÎ±</italic> gene. These results are consistent with the TC reduction in HepG2 cells treated with this honey (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), indicating that 2% arjuna honey are effective in lowering cholesterol through the activation of 
 <italic>AMPK-SREBP2</italic> pathway. The findings are supported by previous studies demonstrating that 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> extracts decreased plasma lipids and increased HDL to reduce the severity of atherosclerotic lesion in aorta [
 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and modify lipid profile in human subjects with coronary artery disease [
