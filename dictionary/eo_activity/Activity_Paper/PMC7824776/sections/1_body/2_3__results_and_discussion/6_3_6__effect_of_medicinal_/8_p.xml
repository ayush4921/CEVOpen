<p>The honeys were also tested for their effect on 
 <italic>PPARα</italic> gene, a central molecule in lipid catabolism. Manuka and guggul honeys upregulated 
 <italic>PPARα</italic> gene expression at both 1.0% and 2.0% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), whereas arjuna and jiaogulan honeys increased this gene transcription at 2.0% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>A–E). However, the gene expression results did not correspond to the high TG content in HepG2 cells treated with the honeys. Although it was reported that the activation of 
 <italic>PPARα</italic> suppresses the availability of triglycerides for the assembly of very low-density lipoprotein and increases hepatic TG accumulation [
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], the mechanism through which the tested honeys activated 
 <italic>PPARα</italic>, its direct targets and the links to the increased triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells remain unclear.
