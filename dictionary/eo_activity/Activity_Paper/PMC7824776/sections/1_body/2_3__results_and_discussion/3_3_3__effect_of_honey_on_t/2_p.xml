<p>The tested honeys at 1.0% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) did not affect the cell viability in the whole period of the experiment, except manuka and jiaogulan honeys which reduced cell viability to 84.4% and 74.4% after 72 h, respectively. Interestingly, the analogue, guggul, jiaogulan and olive honeys at 3.0% significantly reduced cell viability after 24, 48 and 72 h, suggest that the analogue and these honeys induced cytotoxicity in a similar pattern. Manuka and arjuna honeys at 3.0% maintained all cell viability after 24 h, and then reduced their viability after 48 and 72 h. All tested honeys at 5.0% and 10.0% significantly reduced cell viability. This could be due to the high sugar levels that induced apoptosis, which was also observed in other mammalian cell lines, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells [

Noticeably, 5% jiaogulan honey reduced 93.5% cell viability after 72 h and 10% of this honey eliminated 92% of viable cells after 24 h until 72 h. The data indicated jiaogulan honey is the most cytotoxic of the tested honeys and are supportive of previous findings that reported the cancer-preventative effect of jiaogulan extracts [
