<p id="p0070">Quercetin and its glycosylated analogs, especially those substituted at C-3 and C-7 positions and those with an additional hydroxyl group in A ring, are considered as potent antiretroviral agents. Indeed, herbacitrin and quercetin had strong antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (
