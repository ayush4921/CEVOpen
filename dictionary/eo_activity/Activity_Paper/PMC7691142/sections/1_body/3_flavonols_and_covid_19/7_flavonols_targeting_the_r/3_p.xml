<p id="p0135">Quercetin, kaempferol, and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives were tested against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp using molecular docking (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva et al., 2020</xref>). The obtained data indicated that quercetin and kaempferol, as well as their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives, interact as potential inhibitors for RdRp protein. The comparison between the values of binding energies revealed that most of quercetin derivatives (quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinose, quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, quercetin-3′-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate, quercetin-3′-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate) except quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate possess binding affinities better than quercetin itself. Quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinose (rutin) was the most active compared to all quercetin derivatives, which confirms the importance of the rutinoside moiety to increase the number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Also, this study reported that molecules substituted with glucuronic units had low binding energies to the RdRp. The reactivity of the glucuronic units could be attributed to the presence of the hydroxyl groups and carboxylic function. The attachment position of glucuronic unit with quercetin had effects on its reactivity. According to these results, the substitution of quercetin with a glucuronic unit in C-3 position reduces its reactivity compared to the substitution in C-7 and C-3′ positions. The data indicated that glucuronide derivatives of kaempferol are more active than their sulfate derivatives. Kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinose (nicotiflorin) had the strongest activity compared to all the tested molecules in this study. Also, the substitution with a sulfate unit at C-3 of both aglycones (kaempferol and quercetin) reduces their reactivity.
