<p id="p0130">RdRp also known as nsp12 is a central component of SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription machinery. With the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as co-factors, this enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and plays a central role in the replication and transcription process. Indeed, this latter constitutes a primary target for docking studies, and molecules able to disturb its activity may be considered as potential treatments of COVID-19 viral infection (
