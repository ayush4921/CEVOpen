<p id="p0120">Many studies reported the ability of flavonols to bind with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor. Indeed, this ability to interact with these proteins is highly related to the chemical structures of these molecules. The existence of ortho di-OH hydroxyl groups in the B ring of flavonols creates a stable complex reinforced by strong hydrogen bonds between S protein and the flavonols (

 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and his colleagues (2020)</xref>, which reported the docking study of four flavonols namely fisetin, quercetin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol against S protein. Data showed that these compounds interacted with the S2 domain of the S protein with high binding affinities compared to hydroxychloroquine as a positive control. The comparison between the results of quercetin and its derivative isorhamnetin having a methoxyl group (OMe) attached at the C-3′ position of the B ring, revealed that steric hindrance of the OMe groupment reduces the formation ability of hydrogen bonds and affects the nature of the interactive residues (
