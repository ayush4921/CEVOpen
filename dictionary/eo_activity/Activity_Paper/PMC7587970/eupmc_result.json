    "In the current study, further chemical investigation of the fruiting bodies of <i>Fomes officinalis</i> led to isolate seven new 24-methyl-lanostane triterpenoids, named officimalonic acids I-O (<b>1</b>-<b>7</b>). Their structures were elucidated based on the analysis of spectroscopic data (HR-MS, 1D and 2D NMR, UV, IR). Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> possessed an unusual C-23 spirostructure moiety, while compounds <b>4</b>-<b>7</b> had 23,26-lactone unit. Anti-inflammatory assay revealed that compounds <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> exhibited significant inhibitory activities against NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and cyclooxygenase (COX-2)."
