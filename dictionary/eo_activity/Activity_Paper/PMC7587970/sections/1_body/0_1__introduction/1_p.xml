<p>24-methyl-lanostane triterpenoids are a class of compounds present in most fungal species of the family Polyporaceae, which has attracted wide attention among the natural product chemistry community due to their diversity structure and bioactivities [

 <italic>Fomes officinalis</italic> (Vill. Ex Fr.) Ames (Polyporaceae) is a perennial wood-decay fungus, distributed in the Northern regions of China and in the Pacific Northwest United States, Canada, and Europe [

 <italic>F. officinalis</italic> was traditionally used to treat cough and asthma in the Chinese Uygur Medicine prescription [
