<p>Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> had a molecular formula C
 <sub>34</sub>H
 <sub>48</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>, which was determined by the HR-ESI-MS at

 <sup>+</sup> (calculated for C
 <sub>34</sub>H
 <sub>48</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>Na, 607.3247). Analysis of

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) data of 
 <bold>3</bold> indicated that it had a similar structure with 
 <bold>1</bold>. The obvious differences between them were the presence of two double bonds (Δ
 <sup>7</sup> and Δ
 <sup>9(11)</sup>) in 
 <bold>3</bold> instead of one double bond (Δ
 <sup>8</sup>) present in 
 <bold>1</bold>. The two olefinic protons signals at

 <sub>H</sub> 5.57 (brs, H-7) and 5.40 (brs, H-11) supported the assignment. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY correlations of H-5/H-6/H-7 and H-11/H-12, together with the HMBC correlations from H-7 to C-9, and from H-11 to C-8, confirmed the above assignment. Therefore, the structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> was elucidated as depicted, named officimalonic acid K.
