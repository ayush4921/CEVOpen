<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was determined to have the molecular formula C
 <sub>34</sub>H
 <sub>50</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> by HR-ESI-MS at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 571.3598 [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> (calculated for C
 <sub>34</sub>H
 <sub>51</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, 571.3635), 16 mass less than that of 
 <bold>1</bold>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04807-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) data of 
 <bold>2</bold> showed very similar results with those of 
 <bold>1</bold>. The major difference was that instead of a methylene signal, the signals of oxygenated methine (CH-12) were missed in 
 <bold>2</bold>, suggesting that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is one less hydroxyl than 
 <bold>1</bold>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY correlations of H-11/H-12 and the HMBC correlation from H
 <sub>2</sub>-18 to C-12, supported the assignment. The structure of 
 <bold>2</bold> was thus elucidated as depicted, named officimalonic acid J.
