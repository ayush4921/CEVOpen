<p>Jacobsen and co-workers have recently described a method for the one-step, diastereoselective 1,2-difluorination of alkenes, mediated by a hypervalent iodine catalyst [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The substrate scope of the Jacobsen method has certain constraints but their original report did include some examples of α,β-unsaturated amides, and so we were motivated to investigate the method in this work, using compound 
 <bold>3</bold> [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as the substrate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>). We recognized that the product of this reaction would most likely be the unwanted 
 <italic>erythro</italic>-isomer 
 <bold>6</bold> but we nevertheless deemed it a worthwhile preliminary investigation. Disappointingly, the treatment of the precursor 
 <bold>3</bold> with pyridine·HF and either catalyst 
 <bold>4</bold> or 
 <bold>5</bold> at room temperature for two days gave no discernible reaction, and the starting material 
 <bold>3</bold> was recovered intact. Warming the reaction mixture to 50 °C caused the disappearance of 
 <bold>3</bold> but the formation of an intractable mixture of products. We were forced to conclude that the rather complex structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> was incompatible with the Jacobsen catalytic system.
