<p>The inhibition of AChE was measured using a modification of a previously described colorimetric assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>) [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It quickly became apparent that the limited solubility of piperine (
 <bold>1</bold>) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, even in the presence of methanol as a co-solvent, was a major problem in this assay. We observed cloudiness or the appearance of a precipitate at higher concentrations of 
 <bold>1</bold>, which affected the reproducibility of the assay, and prevented complete inhibition from being achieved (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The estimated IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <bold>1</bold> was &gt;1,000 μM. In contrast, analog 
 <bold>2</bold> posed no solubility problems in this assay, generating a reproducible curve all the way to complete inhibition and returning an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 51.7 μM. Thus, the replacement of the C=C fragment in 
 <bold>1</bold> with a 
 <italic>threo</italic>-difluoroalkane motif in 
 <bold>2</bold> appears to preserve or enhance the AChE-binding ability, while simultaneously offering the advantage of improved aqueous solubility.
