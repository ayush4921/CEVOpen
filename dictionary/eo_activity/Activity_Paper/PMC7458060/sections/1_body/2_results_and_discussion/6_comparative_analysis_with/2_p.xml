<p id="p0145">Experimental research studies carried out in the world in terms of anti-influenza activities have been determined only for 35 out of 224 taxa (15.6%). Still, among these studies, the active substances were detected for only 18 taxa (8.0%); for the remaining 17 taxa (7.6%), it was observed that they had not been specified (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ). In 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, only “the parts used in research” were given as an idea for these taxa for which active gradients had been “not specified”. It is noteworthy that no investigation has been conducted for 189 (84.4%) taxa yet (they are highlighted in bold in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among these 35 taxa, the most common active chemicals are quercetin and chlorogenic acid (7.1%), mentofin (5.4%) and 1,8-cineole (3.6%). The most preferred mechanisms in research are inhibition of viral replication by inhibiting viral nucleoprotein synthesis or polymerase and neuraminidase activity (40.4% out of the 47 mechanisms in total), blocking the receptor site of the viruses by inhibition of neuraminidase, reducing the hemagglutination, or blocking hemadsorption (31.9%), inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathic effect by blocking hemadsorption (21.3%), and stimulating and boosting of the immunity (6.4%). The reason that the six taxa at the end of the list are shown as a line separated from the alphabetical sequence is that there was no significant result for virus inactivation in the experimental studies conducted for them (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
