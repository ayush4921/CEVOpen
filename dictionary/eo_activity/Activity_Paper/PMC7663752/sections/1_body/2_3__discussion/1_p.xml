<p>Previous studies have shown that the growth and chemical components of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> are significantly different under different growth conditions, light, growth years and harvest ways [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that there were remarkable differences in morphology including stem height and diameter, amount of lateral bud, and texture of stem etc. from five regions, and the content of polysaccharides was also significantly different. However, few studies have focused on the chemical composition differences of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions. In this study, the categories and contents of volatile compounds in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions were different, with the samples from Zhejiang Province (ZB1 and ZB2) containing the most, and those from Fujian Province (FB1 and FB2) the least (

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that short light/dark cycle can increase the biomass and polysaccharide yield of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>. Different growth condition and symbiotic bacteria in the roots of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> may also lead to differences in volatile components [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05046" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], so the categories and contents of volatile compounds in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions may be caused by the different temperature, humidity, soil conditions or sunshine duration in the different regions.
