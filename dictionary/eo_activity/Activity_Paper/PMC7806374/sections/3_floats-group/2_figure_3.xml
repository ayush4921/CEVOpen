  <p>The effect of 
   <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract on the reduction of reactive oxygen species upon hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity was employed by DCF fluorescence staining in (a, c) HaCaT cell line and (b, d) HFb cell line. The fluorescence intensities were expressed in fold changes compared to vehicle control (-H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-leaf extract). The effect of leaf extract on the migration of (e) HaCaT cells and (f) HFb cells was shown as a wound closure area or the remaining area uncovered by the cells. The scratch-wound closure was monitored fifteen hours later. The scratch area at time zero was set to 100%. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc analysis, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6. The methanol leaf extract treatments (+H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>+leaf extract) showed as 
   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
   <sup>∗∗</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and 
   <sup>∗∗∗</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 compared with hydrogen peroxide treatment (+H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>). Besides, the methanol leaf extract treatment at all range of concentrations (+H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>+leaf extract) showed no significant difference (“ns”) from vehicle control (-H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-leaf extract).
