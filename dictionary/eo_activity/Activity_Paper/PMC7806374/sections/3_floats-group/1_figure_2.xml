  <p>The graphs showed the viability of human keratinocyte, HaCaT, and human fibroblast, HFb, cell lines upon (a) hydrogen peroxide (H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>) treatment and (b) the leaf extract treatment. The capability of the leaf extracts to rescue the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity was employed in (c) HaCaT cell line and (d) HFb cell line. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc analysis,
