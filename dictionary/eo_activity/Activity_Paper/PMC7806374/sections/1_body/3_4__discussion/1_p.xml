<p>Upon tissue damage, several cascades respond to the injury and alleviate the suffering. One of those cascades is the inflammatory process, which is aimed at eliminating the invading pathogen, getting rid of tissue debris, and secreting secondary messengers to initiate the downstream pathways. In the normal wound healing, the ROS such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide act as the secondary messengers to regulate downstream pathways such as tissue inflammation and proliferation [

Due to the short half-life of superoxide anions, they are catalyzed by superoxide dismutase to hydrogen peroxide, a relatively stable compound. Although hydrogen peroxide is safer than other oxidants, its accumulation during the prolonged stimulation of the inflammatory process can further regenerate hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. Iron is the abundant transition metal in our body. It is involved in the redox cycling pathway in the cell to generate hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide. A previous study showed that the imbalance of iron homeostasis has been described in several chronic inflammatory diseases [

Under the pathological process, the dysregulated, incomplete, or overactive inflammation results in abnormal wound healing such as scars, keloids, and chronic wounds. The balance between proinflammation and anti-inflammation needs to be well regulated to control the damage and minimize tissue injuries. Otherwise, the prolonged inflammation may result in an excessive free radical which further damages tissue. Therefore, the constriction of the inflammation stage was targeted to manage the severity of the injury [
