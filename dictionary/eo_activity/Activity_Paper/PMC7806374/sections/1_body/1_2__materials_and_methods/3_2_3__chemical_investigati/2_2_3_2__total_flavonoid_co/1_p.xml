<p>The total flavonoid content was determined by the aluminum chloride colorimetric method as described by Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In brief, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L extract or reference standard quercetin solution was dissolved in 560 
 <italic>μ</italic>L deionized water, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1 M potassium acetate, and 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 95% ethanol. The mixture was mixed with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 10% aluminum chloride then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The total flavonoid content of the leaf extract was measured at a wavelength of 415 nm. The amount of total flavonoid of the methanol leaf extract was expressed as quercetin equivalents (QE).
