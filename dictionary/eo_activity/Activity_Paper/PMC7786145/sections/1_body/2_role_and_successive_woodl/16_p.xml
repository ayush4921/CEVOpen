<p id="Par30">In the same view of the conservation, the argan tree has been the focus of numerous research and social development projects. In association with the European Union, the Social Development Agency in Morocco has launched the Argan project call in 2003 for a period of five years for a total estimated cost of 12 million euros. Aims of the project were to improve livelihood of rural women trough income generating activities and sustainable management of the argan grove. In addition, a research program for a total amount of 3.7 million dirhams was launched by the agency in 2004 focused on the theme of (i) valuation of argan oil products, (ii) vegetative multiplication and root symbioses of argan tree and optimization of argan ecosystems, (iii) agroforestry, and (iv) natural and human environment. In 2011, for a period of 3 years, the Hassan II Academy of Sciences and Techniques funded a project on genetic and molecular characterization and multiplication by micro-cuttings of argan tree. Recently, research was oriented toward identifying of high performing genotypes with the capacity to produce quality oil in sufficient quantity and to grow rapidly through the selection and mass propagation. Therefore, with the aim of developing arganiculture, there is an urgent need for applied research and knowledge on qualitative and quantitative potential of the argan tree in terms of yield and quality product (Ait Aabd et al.
