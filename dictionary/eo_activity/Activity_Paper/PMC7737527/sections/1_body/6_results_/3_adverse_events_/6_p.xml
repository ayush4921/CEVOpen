<p>Six discontinuations of treatment due to TEAEs were reported. Two subjects discontinued due to moderate TEAEs on active drug: 1 sinus tachycardia 8 days after first dosing (considered drug-related), 1 syncope that was also reported as SAE (for details see above). Four subjects had mild TEAEs, 3 of which were on active drug and 1 on placebo: 1 swelling of right cheek due to tooth inflammation (not considered drug-related), 1 redness of both eyes on placebo (not drug-related), 1 exanthema of buttock and extremities on active drug (considered drug-related), and 1 trichomoniasis (not drug-related). Each of these TEAEs resolved completely. Of the further 6 subjects who discontinued, 5 withdrew consent, and 1 had a belated medical history finding that would have precluded his inclusion. </p>
