<p>Study reports were reviewed to compile the data used in this analysis. Study designs, demographics, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and safety laboratory results for AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), CK (creatine kinase), amylase, lipase, GLDH (glutamate dehydrogenase), GGT (gamma glutamyl transpeptidase), total bilirubin, and creatinine in serum were systematically analyzed. Numbers, percentages per group, and relative risk of occurrence were calculated. TEAEs were sorted by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA, current version, respectively) primary system organ class and preferred term, intensity was categorized into mild, moderate and severe, and into serious and non-serious. Laboratory results were analyzed regarding the occurrence of values above 1.5-fold of the upper limit of normal during the in-house phase of the studies. </p>
