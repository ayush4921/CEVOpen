<p>A well-known medicinal plant 
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> shows anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and diuretic properties due to its flavonoid and steroidal alkaloid contents. Its dominant steroidal alkaloid solamargine has exhibited potent anticancer activity against a wide range of cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B97-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Solamargine may induce cell apoptosis via modulating the expression of TNF receptors (TNFRs), down-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, increasing caspase-3 activity, and causing DNA damage [

 <italic>A. flavus</italic> isolated from its stem produced more solamargine than the host callus culture [
