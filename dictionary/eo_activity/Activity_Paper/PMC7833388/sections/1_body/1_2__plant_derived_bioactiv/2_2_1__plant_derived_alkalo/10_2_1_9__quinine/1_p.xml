<p>The stem bark and roots of the 
 <italic>Cinchona</italic> spp. are well-established sources of quinine. It has been used as the only effective medication for malaria for centuries until the development of synthetic antimalarial drugs in 1940s. Quinine functions as an antimalarial by acting as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide and also as gametocytocidal for 
 <italic>Plasmodium malariae</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> but not for 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [

 <xref rid="B94-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Maehara and co-workers have found 21 endophytic fungal strains of 
 <italic>Cinchona ledgeriana</italic> positive for quinine synthesis and identified them as strains of 
 <italic>Arthrinium</italic>, 
 <italic>Fomitopsis</italic>, 
 <italic>Diaporthe</italic>,

 <italic>Phomopsis</italic>, and

 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species capable of producing quinine (
