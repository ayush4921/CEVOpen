<p>Valuable anticancer alkaloid homoharringtonine (HHT) for the first time has been isolated from the bark and leaves of threatened medicinal tree 
 <italic>Cephalotaxus harringtonia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. It acts as a translation inhibitor during G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>2</sub> phases of cell division. In 2012, homoharringtonine was approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia under generic name omacetaxine mepeosuccinate by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA [

 <italic>Cephalotaxus hainanensis</italic> for the HHT biosynthesis ability and found that 
 <italic>Alternaria tenuissima</italic> was a stable HHT-producing endophyte [
