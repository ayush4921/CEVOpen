<p>Rutin, a glycoside of the flavonoid quercetin with powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and promising neuroprotective properties is found in vegetables and fruits. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of rutin involves inhibition of expression of COX-2 and iNOS via inhibition of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Rutin decreases Bcl-2 expression, Bcl-2/Bax ratio, MYCN mRNA levels, and the secretion of TNF-Î±, demonstrating its anticancer property [

Its neuroprotective mechanisms include reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improved antioxidant enzyme activities, activation of MAPK cascade, up-regulation of the ion transport and antiapoptotic genes, and restoration of the activities of mitochondrial complex enzymes [
