<p>Curcumin is the major active principal of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> spp. It shows strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities via the downregulation of COX-2, lipoxygenase, TNF-α, IL-1, -2, -6, -8, and Janus kinases. Curcumin anticancer activity involves cell cycle arrest via inhibition of cyclin D1 and CDK4, and induction of apoptotic signals via the up-regulation of Fas, FasL, and DR
 <sub>5</sub> expression, p-53 mediated activation of caspase, and inhibition of TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB [

A recent report has suggested curcumin as a potent epigenetic modulator with activities like inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), regulation of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), regulation of microRNAs (miRNA). It also interacts with DNA and transcription factors [

 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> and an unidentified isolate [
