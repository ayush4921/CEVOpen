<p>Quercetin is a red pigment with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, antidiabetic, cardiovascular, and neuroprotective properties that is widely distributed in plants. Quercetin causes cell cycle arrest in the S phase and activates apoptosis in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B164-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Quercetin along with vitamin C may be used for the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) in high-risk populations [
 <xref rid="B165-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Its antidiabetic activity is exhibited by induced insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. The cardiovascular effects of quercetin are exerted by its inhibitory effect on the angiotensin-converting enzyme and by activating Na+-K+-2Clâˆ’cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) in renal epithelial cells [

The mechanism behind the neuroprotective effect of quercetin may involve mitigating oxidative stress via induction of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ antioxidant response element (ARE) and antioxidant paraoxonase 2 (PON2) [
