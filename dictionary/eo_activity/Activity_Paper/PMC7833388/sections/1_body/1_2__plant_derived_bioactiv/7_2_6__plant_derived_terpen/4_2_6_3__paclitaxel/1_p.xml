<p>Paclitaxel (PTX) is a highly functionalized diterpenoid taxane family compound with a four-membered oxetane ring and a C-13 ester side chain. It is used as a basic chemotherapy drug to treat several cancer types and was first extracted from medicinal plant Pacific yew (
 <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic>) in 1971 [

 <sub>0</sub> phase and induces apoptosis [

 <italic>T. andreanae</italic> from 
 <italic>Taxus</italic> spp. was the very first endophyte reported to produce paclitaxel, taxol [

 <italic>Taxus</italic> and non-
 <italic>Taxus</italic> species, as listed in
