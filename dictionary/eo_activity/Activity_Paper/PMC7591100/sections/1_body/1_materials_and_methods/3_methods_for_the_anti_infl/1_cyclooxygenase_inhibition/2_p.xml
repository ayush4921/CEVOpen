<p>Detailed data preparation, analysis and interpretation were provided by the kits’ manufacturer (Cayman’s COX inhibitor screening assay kit, item no. 560,131). In brief, the 96-well microtitre plate was set up to include two blank wells (blk), two non-specific binding wells (NSB), two maximum binding (B
 <sub>0</sub>) wells, one total activity (TA) well, eights wells for varying concentrations of standards run in duplicates, one background (BC) well for each COX, one 100% initial activity (IA) well for each COX and the remaining wells for varying concentrations of COX-inhibitor samples. The 96-well sample plate map is presented in
