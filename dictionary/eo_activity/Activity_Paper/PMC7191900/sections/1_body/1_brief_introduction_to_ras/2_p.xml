<p>The Ras protein mainly regulates the differentiation and proliferation of cells, and is called the “molecular switch” in the transmission of cellular signalling networks. Ras protein is a low molecular weight protein that is distributed inside the cell membrane and has the function of binding to guanine nucleotides, which plays an significant role in cell growth, proliferation, development, differentiation, and cancer cell production

However, if Ras protein is always in an activated state, it will have a continuous stimulating effect on the growth and proliferation of cells, which makes the cells in a state of continuous proliferation or even canceration. Therefore, Ras protein has a very close relationship with tumour generation and development.
