<p>Quinones are a class of chemical constituents with a quinoid structure, which are mainly classified into four types: benzoquinone, naphthoquinone, phenanthrenequinone, and anthraquinone. This article summarises the inhibition of FTase by natural products and their derivatives isolated from 
 <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> L., sponges, 
 <italic>A. camphorata</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Dichrostachys cinerea</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.031 μM to 100 μM. It is found that phenanthraquinone compounds extracted from 
 <italic>Adocia</italic> sp. Sponge have a better inhibitory effect on FTase, especially compounds 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>10</bold>, for their similarity FPP. There are many types and a large number of anthraquinones, including compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> to 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold> to 
 <bold>14</bold> (
