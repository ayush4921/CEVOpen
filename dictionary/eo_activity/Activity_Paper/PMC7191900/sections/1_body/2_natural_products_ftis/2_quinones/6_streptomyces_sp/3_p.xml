 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. Among these compounds, UCF 116A (
 <bold>16</bold>) and UCF 116B (
 <bold>17</bold>) have a strong inhibitory effect against bovine brain FTase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.2 and 0.6 μM), whereas UCF 116C (
 <bold>18</bold>) has a weaker inhibitory effect (100 μM)

 </xref>. The kinetic analysis indicated that UCF 116B is competitive inhibitor of Ras protein, and UCF 116 compounds are all Ras-competitive and non-CAAX mimetic type inhibitors of FTase. It is further concluded that the substituent at the terminal amide linkage of the three compounds, the cyclohexenecarboxylalanine moiety of the compound 
 <bold>17</bold> and the modification of the substituents at the C-11 site all have a non-negligible inhibitory activity against the FTase. More effective FTIs can be found based on these findings.
