 </xref> found that the modification of the prenylated side chain of the natural product can regulate biological activity. For example, an increase in the number of prenyl units on the side chain of mallotojaponin B may enhance anti-malarial and FTase inhibitory activity. Whereas studies on tecomaquinone I indicated that this increase leads to a decrease in FTase activity. After synthesis and determination of derivatives of compounds 
 <bold>31</bold> and 
 <bold>32</bold>, it was found that this series of compounds have strong or weak inhibitory effects on FTase, and most of the compounds also have moderate antimalarial activity.
