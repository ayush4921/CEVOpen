<p id="Par22">Finally, for the vernacular names, we calculated the ethnophytonymy index [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], i.e. the percentage of taxa present in the flora that have folk names; the allochtonous ethnophytonymy index proposed by Carri√≥ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] assesses the rate between taxa having a vernacular name in non-Catalan languages (even for those taxa also having some Catalan names) and the total number of collected taxa; and the linguistic diversity index in phytonymy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], i.e. the mean number of folk names for the plants recorded in the ethnofloristic prospection, computes the rate between the number of vernacular names and their taxa to evaluate the linguistic richness of a territory independently of its flora.
