<p id="Par19">With the aim of assessing the state of ethnobotanical knowledge in the studied area, the following indices were calculated. The informant consensus factor (F
 <sub>IC</sub>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which is the ratio of the number of UR minus the number of used taxa to the number of UR minus one, is more reliable when closer to 1. The ethnobotanicity index (EI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], which is the quotient between the number of plants used (only taking into account the native plants) and the total number of plants that constitute the flora of the territory, is expressed as a percentage. For this purpose, we have considered the plants present in the 10 × 10 km UTM squares corresponding to the studied area in the Banc de Dades de Biodiversitat de Catalunya [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The index of medicinal importance (MI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] was also calculated, dividing the total use reports for a specific use category by the number of taxa possessing this use.
