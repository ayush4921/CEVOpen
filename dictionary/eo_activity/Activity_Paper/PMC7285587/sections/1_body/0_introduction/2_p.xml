<p id="Par6">Although the arid zones have not attracted the interest of researchers as much as mountain or tropical areas, since, a priori, they are considered less rich and diverse compared to the zones with more exuberant vegetation, the arid Iberian lands have been studied in depth from the botanical point of view by the pioneering work of Bolòs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Braun-Blanquet and Bolòs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some examples of botanical studies focused on flora and vegetation, carried out in areas close to the Garrigues district, may be found at Masclans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], Boldú [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Recasens and Conesa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Recasens et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Solé-Senan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and the references contained in these papers. Concerning useful plants, the classical approach for arid lands has been the study of economic plants that could be grown or exploited in these areas for landscape protection and, mostly, agricultural and livestock raising activities (e.g. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]), including the Iberian Peninsula [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], although to date, none has yet been performed in Catalonia.
