<p id="Par41">To confirm the top twenty taxa (excepting 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic>, only determined at the genus level) and their main medicinal uses with three or more use reports, we reviewed the literature (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Seventy-seven uses of these 19 taxa are coincidental with those recorded in the literature set consulted. For an important percentage, 59.74%, of the ethnobotanical uses, we validated the information with at least one of the sources checked. By far, Dukeâ€™s CRC handbook of medicinal herbs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] with 33.77% were the most inclusive, systematic and detailed works analysed. The traditional uses confirmed in this literature, which is often used in drug register processes, may be considered as the most consolidated, with a view to introducing new products onto the market. Whereas the roughly 40% of the ethnobotanical uses (all of them reliable in terms of the number of three or more use reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]) not found in the literature set should be the object of further phytochemical and/or pharmacological investigation.
