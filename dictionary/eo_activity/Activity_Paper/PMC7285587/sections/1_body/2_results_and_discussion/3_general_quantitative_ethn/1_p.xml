<p id="Par29">With a view to assessing the state of ethnobotanical general knowledge in the studied area, we calculated the informant consensus factor (F
 <sub>IC</sub>) obtained for our interviewees (0.93), although we have also calculated the F
 <sub>IC</sub> for medicinal information (0.89) in order to be able to compare it with other territories. It occupies a position in the upper part of the range of the values obtained for other Catalan language studied areas (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
