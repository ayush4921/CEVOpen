<p id="Par30">The ethnobotanicity index (EI), calculated not taking into account the 41 taxa of allochthonous plants recorded (those not present in Bolòs et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), is 23.47% for the studied area; this roughly means that between one fifth and one quarter of the plants of the area have been claimed as useful by the informants. The Garrigues EI is very close to Montseny and Gironès values, and slightly lower than in other Catalan language studied areas (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
