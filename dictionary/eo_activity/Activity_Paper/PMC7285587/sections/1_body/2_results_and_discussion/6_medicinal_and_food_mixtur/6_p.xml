<p id="Par51">The number of taxa only reported in food mixtures is higher than the number of taxa in the medicinal ones. The analysis carried out shows seven taxa with a maximum value (ITUM = 1), indicating their use only in mixtures. Most of them are spices like 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J.Presl, 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> Hook.f., 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt., 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. or 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. et Perry, but also 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> L. These high ITUM values could be explained by the fact that all of these taxa are used as a seasoning and they are rarely used alone.
