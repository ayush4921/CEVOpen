<p>From late stationary phase promastigotes (3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL) axenically cultured amastigotes were acquired. Using medium 199 with Hank’s salts supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin, the cells were centrifuged and then resuspended. After that, by using 1 N HCl, the pH was made to 5.5. Following incubation of cells at 31
 <sup>°</sup>C for 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic> and 37
 <sup>°</sup>C for 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, amastigote-like rounded morphology together with loss of flagella and cell clumping started appearing within 24 h. The parasites were kept for a week as some motile parasites with intermediate forms and short flagella were detected. The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% hi-FCS and 20 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) at 37
 <sup>°</sup>C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 72 h. A cell-free medium was used to grow parasites in vitro and to set up the test system for determination of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the extracts.
