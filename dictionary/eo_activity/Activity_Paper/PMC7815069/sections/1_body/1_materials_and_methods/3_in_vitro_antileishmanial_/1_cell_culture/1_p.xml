<p>In vitro antipromastigote activity test was carried out against the promastigote stage of clinical isolates of L. aethiopica and L. donovani. The two clinical isolates were grown in tissue culture flasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU penicillin/mL (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) solution at 22°C for L. aethiopica and 24°C for L. donovani.
