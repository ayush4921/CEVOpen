<p>Of all the extracts, 
 <italic>O. integrifolia</italic> exhibited highest antipromastigote activity with percentage inhibition of 71.78% and 71.40% (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with maximum tested concentration (ie, 100 Âµg/mL) against 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> respectively. At this concentration, 
 <italic>O. integrifolia</italic> exerted similar effect against the amastigotes of 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> with percentage inhibition of 67.31% and 70.58% respectively (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>F. communis</italic> also exerted comparable antipromastigote activity with percentage inhibition of 68.47% and 63.57% against 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> respectively. While the same plant exerted slightly lower activity against the amastigotes of both Leishmanial species (
