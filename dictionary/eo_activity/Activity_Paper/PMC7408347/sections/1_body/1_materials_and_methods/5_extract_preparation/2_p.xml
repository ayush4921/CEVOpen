<p id="par0050">Normal tap water was used to clean the samples at room temperature. The samples were dried in the shade for 5 days until totally dried. The dried samples were ground to powder using a kitchen blender. Total weight of the ground samples was 402.43 g. Subsequently, the ground samples were extracted with 1.5 L methanol using Soxhlet extraction for 45 h [

The remaining residue was mixed with 200 mL distilled water; this mixture was then transferred to a separatory funnel to be fractioned using different solvents with various polarities including hexane, DCM, water, ethyl acetate, methanol, and butanol. In total, 30 mL of each solvent mixture was added and shaken in the separatory funnel for 20â€“30 min; a researcher periodically checked and released the pressure from the separatory funnel [

Weight of each crude extract was recorded as follows: 0.7 g of hexane extract, 11.98 g of DCM extract, 0.58 g of ethyl acetate extract, 1.5 g of butanol extract, 1.0 g of methanol extract, and 10.6 g of aqueous extract.
