<p id="p0205">The results of TPC presented in this paper showed that it was the highest in ethanolic samples, however, methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Tv</italic> and 
 <italic>Om</italic> from Egypt are reported to have higher TPC in comparison with ethanolic ones (8.10 and 5.20 mg GAE/g for methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Tv</italic> and 
 <italic>Om</italic>, respectively, and 7.30 and 4.65 mg GAE/g for their ethanolic extracts) (
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Roby et al., 2013</xref>). Recent findings indicate that methanolic extracts contain higher TPC in comparison to aqueous, which is in agreement with the results presented in this paper. Moreover, extracts of 
 <italic>Ov</italic> from Romania and Greece had higher TPC than 
 <italic>Tv/Thymus capitatus</italic> (about 68.00 mg GAE/g and 53.00 mg/g for the Romanian species, and 55.00 and 35.00 mg GAE/g for the Greek species) (

 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Skendi et al., 2017</xref>) which is in accordance with the results presented in this paper. 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Proestos et al. (2005)</xref>, on the other hand, found that 
 <italic>Tv</italic> methanolic extract possesses a higher TPC than 
 <italic>Om</italic> and 
 <italic>Tc</italic> extracts (19.20, 16.90 and 9 mg GAE/g, respectively), while according to our results, 
 <italic>Om</italic> contains the highest TPC, followed by 
 <italic>Tv</italic> and 
 <italic>Tc</italic>, with the lowest TPC. On the other hand, TPC calculated from the HPLC analysis of the Greek species showed that both methanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Ov</italic> have higher polyphenolic content compared to 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic> extracts, which is not in agreement with our results, probably due to the different number of compounds quantified in the analysis. The results of a study involving the TPC of methanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Tm</italic> from Serbia (
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Stankovic et al., 2011</xref>) are also in accordance with our results, methanolic extract showing a value of about 170.00 mg GAE/g, while the aqueous extract contained about 110.00 mg GAE/g phenolics. On the other hand, it was shown that the amount of TPC in methanolic and aqueous extracts of several Lamiaceae plants from Poland was as following: 
 <italic>Tv</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Om</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Ov</italic> and 
 <italic>Om</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Tv</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Ov</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Ulewicz-Magulska and Wesolowski, 2019</xref>), which is not consistent with our results. This difference might be attributed to the climate conditions and geographical distance between the growth sites of the investigated plants.
