<p id="p0240">Hydroxyl radicals derived from hydrogen peroxide are known to induce oxidative damage in plasmid DNA (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2019</xref>), resulting in strand breaks. However, this research proved the significance of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> genoprotective capacity of aqueous, ethanolic and methanolic extracts of the six Lamiaceae species traditionally used in Serbia. As far as the literature survey could confirm, no report was published on the DNA damage protection activity of the studied Lamiaceae species. Among the Lamiaceae species, a study on 
 <italic>Teucrium polium</italic> showed that aqueous extracts at the concentration of even 40 mg/mL significantly protected the supercoiled DNA (
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Tepe et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, 
 <italic>T. ramosissimum</italic> methanolic extract at the concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL showed a protective effect towards the DNA exposed to hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation (
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Sghaier et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, aqueous extracts showed the highest genoprotective capacity in our study, in spite of being the least active in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant assay. However, this is in accordance with the literature data, since in a study with methanolic and hexane extracts of two other Lamiaceae species, 
 <italic>Marrubium parviflorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Lamium amplexicaule</italic> from Turkey, hexane extracts showed weak activities in DPPH assay (0.74 and 1.59 mmol TE/g, respectively, for the extracts at the concentration of 2 mg/mL), whereas in the assay with the plasmid, it exhibited high activity at the concentration range of 0.02–0.04 mg/mL. This incidence was reported to also be found in other researches (
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Yumrutas and Saygideger, 2010</xref>). 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Yumrutas and Saygideger (2010)</xref> hypothesized that non-polar compounds in the hexane extracts might be responsible for the displayed activity in protecting the plasmid DNA, however it still remains unknown what might be the reason for the ability of aqueous extracts from our study to contribute to the protection of DNA, since the HPLC analysis was not able to clarify it.
