<p id="p0115">In the present study, extracts of six Lamiaceae species traditionally used in Serbia were subjected to the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> examination of their potential to reduce the deleterious effects of free radicals in acellular, prokaryotic and eukaryotic model systems. Likewise, their total phenolic, phenolic acids, flavonoid and flavonol contents were quantified in order to link the exhibited biological activities with the respective groups of phytochemicals.
