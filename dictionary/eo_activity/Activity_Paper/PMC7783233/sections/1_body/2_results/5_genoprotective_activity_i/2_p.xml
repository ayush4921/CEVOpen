<p id="p0180">The genoprotective activity of extracts was tested on the plasmid DNA on three concentrations and in three individual experiments. Plasmid DNA was treated with hydrogen peroxide and UV light, which ultimately produced hydroxyl radicals. Positive control was not treated with a genoprotective agent; however, all the other probes were exposed to the effect of the plant extracts. Since the positive control was not treated with the extracts, it was expected to have the highest percentage of an open form of plasmid (the plasmid DNA was most damaged in this probe). Methanol and ethanol alone did not have an impact on DNA. All of the extracts, on the other hand, showed genoprotective activity against hydroxyl radicals, with aqueous extracts providing the best protection of DNA from free radicals (lower percentage of open plasmid DNA form on the chart) (

 <sub>50</sub> values of aqueous extracts varied from 0.17 (

 <italic>Om</italic>), of ethanolic extracts varied from 0.33 (
 <italic>Ts</italic>) to 0.40 mg/mL (
 <italic>Tv</italic>) and of methanolic extracts ranged from 0.36 (
 <italic>Tc</italic>) to 0.52 mg/mL (
 <italic>Tm</italic>), making 
 <italic>Tv</italic>, 
 <italic>Ts</italic> and 
 <italic>Tc</italic> the most promising genoprotective agents in this assay (
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). All tested extracts showed statistically significant effects against plasmid DNA damage, nonetheless the best genoprotective potential of aqueous extracts, leaving methanolic and ethanolic ones less active, are not in accordance with the results obtained in DPPH test.
