<p id="p0135">On the other hand, when the PAC was considered, a different relationship between the extracts was observed i.e. PAC was higher in methanolic extracts compared to the ethanolic ones. Regardless, only in 
 <italic>Om</italic> ethanolic and aqueous extracts PAC is shown to be significantly different. The highest PAC was observed in 
 <italic>Ov</italic> methanolic extract, followed by 
 <italic>Ov</italic> ethanolic extract (96.04 and 74.19 mg CAE/g, respectively). The lowest PAC was found in 
 <italic>Tv</italic> aqueous extract (6.78 mg CAE/g), while it was not detected in several aqueous and ethanolic extracts at the concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.
