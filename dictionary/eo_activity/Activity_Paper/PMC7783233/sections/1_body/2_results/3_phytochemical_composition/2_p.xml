<p id="p0120">The contents of total phenolics, phenolic acids, flavonoids and flavonols were calculated by applying appropriate calibration curves and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For each test, the results were screened on three concentrations (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL) in order to make the obtained results comparable with DPPH assay. Moreover, by using different concentrations, the methods underwent a verification, since a concentration gradient for the vast majority of samples was found. Furthermore, only the results obtained at the concentration of 0.25 mg/mL will be considered for further discussion, since a dose dependency was observed for the phytochemical contents, meaning that with the increase of extract concentration, there is a higher amount of polyphenolics found in them.
