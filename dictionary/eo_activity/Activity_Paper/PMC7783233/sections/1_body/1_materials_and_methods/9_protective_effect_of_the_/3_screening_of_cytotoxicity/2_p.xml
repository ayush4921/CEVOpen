<p id="p0095">MTT test was performed following the protocol previously described in details (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kolarević et al., 2019</xref>). The effect of the extracts (in three concentrations: 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL) on the viability of MRC-5 cells was measured during 1 h and 24 h. Ethanol and methanol in the final concentration of 0.35% were used as solvent controls. The medium was removed after the treatment, and the cell monolayer was washed with 1 × PBS. To each well was further added 200 µL of MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL). After the incubation of the plates (3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>), the supernatant was extracted from the wells, and formazan crystals were dissolved by adding of 200 µL DMSO per well. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm.
