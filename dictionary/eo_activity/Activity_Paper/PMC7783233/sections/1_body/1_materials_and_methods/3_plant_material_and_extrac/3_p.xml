<p id="p0040">Ten grams of ground plant material was subjected to the procedure of classical maceration (24 h, room temperature) using methanol and ethanol (70:30 alcohol:water), and hot distilled water as solvents (10% w/v). The prepared mixtures were exposed to ultrasound (30 °C, 2 h). The extracts were filtered twice through Whatman No. 1. The excess of solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-114). Until further analyses, the obtained extracts were stored at 4 °C, protected from light and moisture.</p>
