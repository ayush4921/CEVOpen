<p id="p0110">Statistical analyses were carried out using Statistica 10 Software. Kolmogorov-Smirnoff was used to determine if the data were normally distributed. As the data were in line for the usage of nonparametric tests, Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA was applied followed by the Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test for pairwise comparison of the treated groups with negative and solvent controls. The level of significance for all comparisons was set at p &lt; 0.05. In order to evaluate the influence of extraction solvents on phytochemical contents and values obtained by DPPH assay, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test were performed. Differences were considered as statistically significant if the p-value was&lt;0.05. Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were calculated among the results obtained from DPPH assay and phytochemical content, and presented according to 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Taylor (1990)</xref>. For SOS/
 <italic>umuC</italic> assay the significance of DNA damage inhibition in co-treatments with extracts in comparison with hydrogen peroxide alone was assessed by 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
