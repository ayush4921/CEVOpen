 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows synergistic activity of polyherbal extract (methanol extract) against selected bacteria. The zone of inhibition was 33 ± 3 mm, 17 ± 2 mm, 22 ± 2 mm, 40 ± 2 mm, 33 ± 1 mm and 38 ± 2 mm against

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. Polyherbal extract was found to be highly effective against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. Previously reported antimicrobial potential of flavonoids from the medicinal plants. Flavonoids showed antimicrobial properties against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These flavonoids make a complex with soluble proteins or extracellular protein and finally complex with cell wall of bacteria; also lipophilic flavonoids significantly disrupt microbial membrane of the cells. These tannins from medicinal plant origin inactivate microbial adhesion enzymes and also inhibit the transport of various proteins, and finally form a complex with polysaccharides (

 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic> showed the presence of tannins and is highly responsible for antibacterial activity. Tannin from plant origin showed various antibacterial potentials. Earlier, the antimicrobial property of 
 <italic>Mollugo cerviana</italic> plant extract was studied against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains was studied. The zone of inhibition was registered between 12 and 32 mm and methanol extract was found to be good. Also, n-butanol and ethylacetate solvent extract showed zone of inhibition between 12 and 20 mm (
