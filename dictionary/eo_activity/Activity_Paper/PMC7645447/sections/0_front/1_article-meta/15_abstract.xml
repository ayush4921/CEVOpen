  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The essential oil was extracted from dried leaf samples using the Soxhlet extraction method. The oil was separated from the solvent and the bioactive compounds were identified using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The identified peaks in the mass spectrum were matched with the database of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The FT-IR results indicated the presence of alcohols, carboxylic acids, phenols, alkanes, ketones, and primary amine compounds. GC-MS identified 43 compounds representing 95% of the total leaf essential oil components. Some of the major isolated compounds included a pyrrolizine; 1-dodecanol; 1,2-nonadecanediol; phytol; 1,3-dioxolane; 4-undecene, 9-methyl, (Z)-; 1-eicosanol; and imidazole.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>The identified constituents of the extracted oil have established pharmacologic and insecticidal activities, and these compounds are also used in the drink, food, and cosmetic industries. This extract is highly valuable for the medical treatment of various ailments.</p>
