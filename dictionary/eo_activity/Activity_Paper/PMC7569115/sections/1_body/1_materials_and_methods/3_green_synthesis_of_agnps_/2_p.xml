<p id="p0025">The prepared extract was utilized for the synthesis of AgNPs. 20 mL of 1 M AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> solution was added into 80 mL of rhizome extract. Then extract along with optimized AgNPs was incubated until the colorless solution turns into brownish color, which reveals the reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> into Ag
 <sup>0</sup> nanoparticle. The visible color change was observed at a 1:9 ratio.
