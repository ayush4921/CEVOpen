<p id="p0040">Several studies evaluated the green synthesis of AgNPs by different medicinal plant aqueous extracts for increasing various biological applications (
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2007</xref>). It was observed that NPs synthesis was initiated once the synergistic aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Z. officinale and C. longa</italic> added in the 1â€¯mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> solution. The color of AgNPs and 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> aqueous solutions was progressively modified from yellow to brownish color which reveals the AgNPs formation. The color transformation during the synthesis of AgNPs is related to the excitation effect of surface plasmon resonance (

 <italic>Z. officinale and C. longa</italic> have potential for acting as a reducing agent.
