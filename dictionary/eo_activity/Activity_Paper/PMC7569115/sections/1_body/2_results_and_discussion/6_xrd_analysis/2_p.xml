 <italic>Ceropegia bulbosa</italic> Roxb root tuber extract and observed XRD diffraction peaks at the 111, 200, 220, and 311 planes, which correspond to the AgNPs. Synthesized AgNPs were also confirmed for their antibacterial and larvicidal activity. In this study, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the dried synergistic powder sample of green synthesized AgNPs had shown distinct four diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 38°, 44°, 64°, and 77°, which can be endorsed to the reflections from lattice planes indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes, reflected the crystal structures [
