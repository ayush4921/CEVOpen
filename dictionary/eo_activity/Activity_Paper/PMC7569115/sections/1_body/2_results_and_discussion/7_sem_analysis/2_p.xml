 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). These size variations might be the presence of biomolecules from the rhizome extracts, which were the caping surface of AgNPs. It was observed that AgNPs have a uniform crystalline structure and relatively spherical. Accumulation of NPs was induced by solvent evaporation during the sample production. In a study, SEM analysis of NPs synthesized using
