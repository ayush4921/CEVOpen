<p>The experimental procedures of the animal study were proved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Nankai University. 4T1 breast cancer cells (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) were injected in the mammary fat pads of 6 − 8 weeks old female BALB/c mice. Once the tumours grew to a volume of approximately 100–150 mm
 <sup>3</sup>, they were placed into five treatment groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3, with a total tumour number of 15). The mice were treated daily for 18 days via oral gavage. Body weights and tumour size were determined every other day. Tumour measurements were found using a digital vernier calliper, and the volumes were determined using the following calculation: (short
 <sup>2</sup>) × long × 0.5. Experiments were performed under an approved IACUC protocol according to federal and institutional guidelines and regulations. Inhibition rate of tumour growth was calculated using the following formula: 100 × {1 − [(tumour volume
 <sub>final</sub> − tumour volume
 <sub>initial</sub>) for 
 <bold>X22</bold>-treated group]/[(tumour volume
 <sub>final</sub> − tumour volume
 <sub>initial</sub>) for the vehicle-treated group]}.
