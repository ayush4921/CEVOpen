<p>Cells were plated on six-well culture plates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL and were treated with the indicated concentrations of 
 <bold>X22</bold> or ribociclib for 12, 24, 36 or 48 h after they adherence. Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for three times and then fixed with ice cold 75% ethanol overnight. The fixed cells were then washed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide (50 mg/mL) in the presence of RNase A (0.5 mg) for 30 min at 37 °C. The stained cells were then subjected to flow cytometry (Modfit, BD) for cell cycle analysis.
