<p>Given the strong inhibitory ability of 
 <bold>X22</bold> in MCF7 and A549 cells, we examined the effect of 
 <bold>X22</bold> on the cell cycle. Cells were treated with compound 
 <bold>X22</bold>, ribociclib and DMSO for 24 h. Representative flow cytometry patterns are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>. The results showed that 
 <bold>X22</bold> significantly blocked the cell cycle at G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by decreases in S phase in both cell lines, as compared to the cells incubated with DMSO. Ribociclib mainly blocked the cell cycle at G
 <sub>1</sub> phase (

 <bold>X22</bold>, ribociclib and DMSO for 12, 36 and 48 h (

 <bold>X22</bold> induced the cell cycle arrest, which are consistent with our observations above

 <sub>2</sub>/M arrest. These data indicated that 
 <bold>X22</bold> could induce G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest of the cell cycle in both breast and lung cancer cells.
