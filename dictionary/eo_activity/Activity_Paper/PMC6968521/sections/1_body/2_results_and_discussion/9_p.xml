<p>Interestingly, a hydrogen-bond was formed between the oxygen of the sulphonyl of 
 <bold>X22</bold> with the backbone of the ASP109 in another docking configuration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). At the front of the ATP binding pocket in CDK9, GLY112 possessing the smallest residue makes this hydrophobic site accommodate flexible side chain like compound 
 <bold>X22</bold>, while THR107 at the same position in CDK6 shows a little crowded for flexible group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>). The much bigger hydrophobic site permit the compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> exits in multiple configurations docking CDK9 forming hydrogen bond for binding tightly. The difference might offer an explanation the stronger inhibitory potency compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> against CDK9 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>= 10â€‰nM). Thus, 
 <bold>X22</bold> as an ATP-competitive inhibitor potently binds in the ATP pockets of CDKs kinases.
