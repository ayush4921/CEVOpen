<p>Based on preliminary research, we then adopted the H at 
 <bold>R</bold> position to design several derivates (
 <bold>X9</bold>–
 <bold>X13</bold>, 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to focus on the effect of the sulphur and its oxidation state at 
 <bold>L</bold> position and length of the tail on the enzyme test. Obviously, 
 <bold>X9</bold> with sulphone enhanced the inhibition against the three kinases, compared with 
 <bold>X8</bold>. In the example of compound 
 <bold>X9</bold>–
 <bold>X13</bold>, the inhibition against CDK9 was keeping at a relative high level, but the efficacy activity on CDK4/6 was declined with the increasing space between the isothiocyanato and sulphone structurally.
