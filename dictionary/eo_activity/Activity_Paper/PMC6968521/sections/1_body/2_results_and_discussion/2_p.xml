 </xref>. As the noteworthy antitumor functions of sulphur atom and isothiocyanate as mentioned above, we introduced these moieties to form molecules to investigate the structure–activity relationship. We changed the substituent at 
 <bold>R</bold> position on the phenyl ring, as well as the functional group 
 <bold>L</bold> and length of spacer between the isothiocyanato and phenyl ring. The pathways adopted for the synthesis of compounds 
 <bold>X1</bold>–
 <bold>X23</bold> were carried out as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001 SCH0002 SCH0003">Schemes 1–3</xref>. The synthesis of the key intermediates 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>5e</bold> was depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>. Firstly, refluxing the commercial obtained potassium phthalimide 
 <bold>1</bold> with various dibromoalkane in acetone yielded the mono-bromides 
 <bold>3a</bold>–
 <bold>3e</bold> bearing the phthalimide tail meeting the different length for SAR. Then, 
 <bold>3a</bold>–
 <bold>3e</bold> were refluxed with potassium thioacetate (KSAc) in THF to afford thioacetates 
 <bold>4a</bold>–
 <bold>4e</bold>, following acidic hydrolysis reaction in methanol to give the thiols 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>5e</bold>. In 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0002">Scheme 2</xref>, prepared 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>5e</bold> were arylated by 
 <italic>p</italic>-fluoronitrobenzene with various 
 <bold>R</bold> substituents (
 <bold>6a</bold>–
 <bold>6d</bold>) to give the intermediates 
 <bold>7a</bold>–
 <bold>7h</bold>. On the other hand, 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>5e</bold> reacted with 1-(bromomethyl)-4-nitrobenzene (
 <bold>11</bold>) in DMF under the alkaline condition of K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> to obtain the 
 <bold>12a</bold>–
 <bold>12e</bold>. Especially emphasised in dotted line cage, thioether intermediates 
 <bold>7a</bold>–
 <bold>7e</bold> and 
 <bold>12a</bold>–
 <bold>12e</bold>, were oxidised absolutely to corresponding sulphone 
 <bold>8a</bold>–
 <bold>8e</bold> and 
 <bold>13a</bold>–
 <bold>13e</bold>. Subsequently, nitro group in intermediates 
 <bold>7a</bold>–
 <bold>8e</bold> and 
 <bold>12a</bold>–
 <bold>13e</bold> need to be reduced to primary amine using either iron powder activated by acetic acid or zinc powder (
 <bold>9a</bold>–
 <bold>9e</bold>, 
 <bold>10a</bold>–
 <bold>10e</bold>, 
 <bold>14a</bold>–
 <bold>14e</bold>, 
 <bold>15a</bold>–
 <bold>15e</bold>). After that, all the primary amine intermediates described above underwent Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction with commercially available 
 <bold>16</bold> by catalytic amount of palladium acetate to create the key intermediates 
 <bold>17a</bold>–
 <bold>18e</bold> and 
 <bold>19a</bold>–
 <bold>20e</bold>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0003">Scheme 3</xref>, the derivatives except 
 <bold>X5</bold>–
 <bold>X7</bold> were produced via two successive steps without intermediate purification. 
 <bold>17a</bold>–
 <bold>20e</bold> first were refluxed with 80% hydrazine hydrate in methanol to deprotect, following reacting with carbon disulphide and 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>′-dicylohexylcarbodiimide to afford the isothiocyanates derivatives 
 <bold>X1</bold>–
 <bold>X4</bold> and 
 <bold>X8</bold>–
 <bold>X23</bold>. Finally, sulphone derivative 
 <bold>X6</bold> was obtained by oxidising 
 <bold>X4</bold> completely with an excess of m-CPBA. Sulfoxide derivatives 
 <bold>X5</bold> and 
 <bold>X7</bold> were obtained through incomplete oxidation from 
 <bold>X4</bold> and 
 <bold>X1</bold>, respectively, which were accomplished through controlling strictly the amount of 1.1 equiv m-CPBA.
