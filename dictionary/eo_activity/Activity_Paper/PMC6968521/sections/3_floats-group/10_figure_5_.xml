  <p>X22 induced cell apoptosis in breast and lung cancer cells. (A) Cells were seeded in six-well plates and treated with the indicated concentrations of X22 or ribociclib for 48 h. Cells were then stained with the AnnexinV-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD of the percentages of apoptotic cells from three independent experiments. (B) Expressions of p53, phospho-p53 (Ser15), Bax, Bcl-2 in MCF-7 and A549 cells were detected by western blotting after the treatment with the indicated concentrations of ribociclib or X22 for 48 h. *
