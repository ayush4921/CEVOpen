<p>Results from the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that ovariectomy induced a significant reduction of the uterus relative weight. This result is in accordance with a previous report indicating that after 14 days of ovariectomy, there is an important reduction of endogenous estrogens inducing uterus atrophy [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, the administration of estradiol valerate for 3 consecutive days was found to increase the uterus relative weight and the uterus and vagina epithelial heights. The augmentation of the uterus and vagina epithelial heights was in accordance with the histomorphology of these organs, which showed the hypertrophy of uterine epithelial cells and the stratification of the vaginal epithelium. These results are in accordance with previous reports realized with estradiol valerate on ovariectomized rats [

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, the literature reports that these trophic and proliferative effects on the uterus and the vagina are mediated by the estrogen receptor alpha (ER
 <italic>α</italic>) subtype [
