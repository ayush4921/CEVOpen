<p>The daily coadministration of estradiol valerate with the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves decreased the uterus relative weight and epithelial height of the uterus and the vagina. This effect could be due to the presence of flavonoids and flavonols in the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves. Indeed, it has been shown that these compounds are capable of binding estrogen receptors [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and competing with estrogens for binding ERs [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In addition, the literature reports that, in response to estrogen stimulation, uterine epithelial cells change from cubic to cylindrical [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The bilateral ablation of the ovaries leads to atrophy of the uterus epithelium made up of cubic cells [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Estradiol was also reported to be synthesized 
 <italic>in situ</italic> in the uterus and to act in a paracrine manner to stimulate uterine growth [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In accordance with these literature data, our results showed that the uterine epithelium of ovariectomized animals (OVX) was made up of cubic cells, in comparison with SHAM control animals, in which this epithelium was rather cylindrical and might justify the reduction of the uterine epithelial height observed in the OVX group. The decrease of the uterine epithelium size in the OVX group was correlated with a decrease in uterine levels of total cholesterol. According to Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], the 
 <italic>novo</italic> synthesis of cholesterol in the uterus is stimulated by serum estradiol. Therefore, the bilateral ovariectomy, which was found to decrease serum levels of estradiol [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], would have decreased uterine cholesterol levels by lowering circulating estrogen levels. Although the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves did not reverse the effect of estradiol valerate on uterine cholesterol levels, it reduced its effect on uterine steroidogenesis as it decreased uterine levels of estradiol. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves could have inhibited at least one stage of steroidogenesis, leading to reduced levels of estradiol. In addition, the aforementioned extract could be endowed with hypercholesterolemic properties as it reduced the use of uterine cholesterol for steroidogenesis. This effect could be due to the presence of flavonoids and anthocyanins in this extract as these phytochemicals were reported to increase HDL-cholesterol levels [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves induced hormesis-type responses on both cholesterol and estradiol levels in the uterus. Hormesis was defined as a dose-response relationship phenomenon characterized by low-dose inhibition and high-dose stimulation or inversely, leading to a U-shaped, an inverse U-shaped, or a J-shaped dose response [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This dose-response revolution is not yet fully understood.
