<p>Uterine levels of estradiol reduced by 94% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in ovariectomized animals, compared with the SHAM control group. The daily administration of estradiol valerate inversed this effect of ovariectomy as it increased this parameter by 1052% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), in comparison with the OVX control. The coadministration of estradiol valerate with tamoxifen reduced uterine levels of estradiol by 49.54% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), in comparison with the OVX + E
 <sub>2</sub>V group. A similar effect was observed in animals cotreated with E
 <sub>2</sub>V and the aqueous extract of
