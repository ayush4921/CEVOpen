 <italic>(ii) Effects on the uterine histomorphology</italic>. The uterus of sham-operated animals was lined by a tall columnar epithelium (

Following treatment with estradiol valerate only, or in coadministration with tamoxifen, uterine epithelial cells were similar to those of sham-operated animals, but with a reduced thickness. The uterine epithelium of animals cotreated with estradiol valerate and the aqueous extract of
