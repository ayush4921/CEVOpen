 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref> shows that ovariectomy decreased the uterine epithelial height by 57.14% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared with the SHAM control group. The daily administration of estradiol valerate increased this parameter by 51% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with the OVX control. The coadministration of estradiol valerate with tamoxifen did not significantly affect the uterine epithelial height, which remained similar to that of the OVX + E
 <sub>2</sub>V group. At tested doses, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves inhibited the tropic effect of estradiol valerate by reducing (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) the uterine epithelial height, with significant effects at doses of 100 (46.6%) and 200 (41.4%) mg/kg, compared with the OVX + E
 <sub>2</sub>V group.
