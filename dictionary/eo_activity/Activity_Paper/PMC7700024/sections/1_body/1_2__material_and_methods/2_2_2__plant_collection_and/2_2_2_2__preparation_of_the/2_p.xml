<p>Four doses of this extract were administered to animals: 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW. These doses have been extrapolated from previous studies realized on rats [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Uhunmwangho and Omoregie [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that the oral administration of 50 mg/kg of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> fruit induced antioxidant activity in rats. This dose was therefore divided by 2 to obtain the lowest dose of 25 mg/kg. The doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg were obtained by multiplying 50 mg/kg by 2 and 4, respectively.
