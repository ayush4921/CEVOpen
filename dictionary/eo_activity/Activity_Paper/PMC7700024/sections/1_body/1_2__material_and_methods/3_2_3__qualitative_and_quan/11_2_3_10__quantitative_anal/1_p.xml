<p>Total flavonoids were estimated using the aluminium colorimetric method described by Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In brief, 1500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of distilled water and 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sodium nitrite at 5% were added to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of aluminium chloride (10%) and 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sodium hydroxide (1 M) were added to the mixture. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm. Total flavonoid content was calculated as milligram quercetin equivalent/gram extract (mgQE/gE) using the equation obtained from the calibration curve (
 <italic>y</italic> = 300.75
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0897; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9956).
