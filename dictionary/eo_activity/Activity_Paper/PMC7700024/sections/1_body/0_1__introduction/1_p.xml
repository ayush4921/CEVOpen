<p>Steroid hormones play an important role in regulating proliferation and protein synthesis of target cells. Estrogens particularly are known to stimulate a variety of biosynthetic processes, such as those of the breast and the uterus. In addition, nonsteroidal antiestrogens were found to antagonize many of the actions of estrogens through competitive estrogen receptor (ER) binding, inhibition of aromatase activity, and steroidogenesis [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These antiestrogenic mechanisms could help reduce estrogenic response such as cell proliferation. Estrogen activities are mediated by two main isoforms of intracellular estrogen receptors: ER

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ER
 <italic>α</italic> is expressed in about 75% of diagnosed breast tumors [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which can thus be treated with agents targeting estrogen-mediated signaling, such as antiestrogens [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Estradiol has been recognized as the main hormone that stimulates the growth and development of cancer [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], especially estrogen-dependent cancers. They are the most prevalent hormone-related cancers in the world (50–80%) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The introduction of adjuvant systemic therapy led to a significant improvement in postsurgical survival and a reduction in disease relapse, especially in women with early-diagnosed breast cancer and with positive ER tumors, who may receive endocrine therapy alone or in combination with cytotoxic therapy [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the use of these modern treatments was associated with substantial side effects [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and frequent recurrences [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nowadays, the use of natural medicines as alternative treatments for cancer has greatly increased. The literature mentions the role of phytoestrogens in the treatment of breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, phytoestrogens were found capable of inducing biological responses, which may be able to modulate the actions of endogenous estrogens [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] through mechanisms including ER modulation, aromatase inhibition, antiangiogenesis, inhibition of hormone action, and modulation of hormone production [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In order to elaborate effective strategies to control cell proliferation-related diseases such as estrogen-dependent cancers, research is increasingly focused on herbal medicines with traditionally reported anticancer properties and/or scientific evidence of antioxidant properties; as oxidative stress was found to promote cell proliferation [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and to contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
