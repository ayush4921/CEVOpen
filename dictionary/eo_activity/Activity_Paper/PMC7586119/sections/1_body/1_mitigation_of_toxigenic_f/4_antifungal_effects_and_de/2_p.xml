 <xref rid="bib162" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017a</xref>). Furthermore, phytochemicals induce cytotoxicity in fungi by disrupting cell membrane permeability and functions; inhibiting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes; inhibiting enzymes involved in cell wall components synthesis; and altering the cell compartment, osmotic and the redox balance (

 <xref rid="bib163" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017b</xref>). Phytochemicals are capable of inhibiting enzymes that activate Phase I carcinogens as well as induce enzymes for Phase II detoxification (
