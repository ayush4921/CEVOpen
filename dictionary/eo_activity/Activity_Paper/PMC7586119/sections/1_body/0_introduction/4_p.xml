<p id="p0020">Various approaches to control and prevent mycotoxins in food and feed have been developed. These approaches are categorised as chemical and micro-biological methods (

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adebiyi et al., 2019</xref>). These methods were shown to be effective in the prevention of growth of toxigenic fungi and production of associated mycotoxins during pre-harvest, after harvest food and during storage of food commodities. Chemical methods involve the use of chemicals such as ammonia, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydoxyxyanisole and oltipraz to decontaminate mycotoxins (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Čolović et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to their inefficacy in decontamination of mycotoxins, their long-term extreme use is still limited due to their residual toxic product/s, public health and environmental concerns (
