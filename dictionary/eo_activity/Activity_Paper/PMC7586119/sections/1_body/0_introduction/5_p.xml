<p id="p0025">Physical methods include cleaning, dehulling, sorting, milling and ultra-violet light, pulsed light, cold plasma as well as irradiation. Other physical methods involve the use of adsorbents or binders such as activated charcoal, bentonite, zeolites and sepiolite clay. The methods have been effectively applied in decontaminating mycotoxins. However, technology implementation costs, potential residual toxic effects, poor adsorption and low specificity (i.e. selective action) against some mycotoxins still hamper their routine application (
