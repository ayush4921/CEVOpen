<p id="p0105">Frontiers in the field of nanotechnology have led to their vast applications in the field of nanomedicine, extending to the agricultural sector. Great strides have been made in the implementation of nanotechnology in agriculture for controlling mycotoxin contamination in food and feed supply chain (
 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">Thipe et al., 2018</xref>). The era of green nanotechnology, with the use of plant phytochemicals for the production of nanomaterials, has greatly improved their safety for use in agriculture as mycotoxin detoxifying agents (

 <xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">Thipe et al., 2020</xref>). A combination of nanotechnology and botanical extracts, as well as their phytochemicals, has shown significant results in the pharmacological, agricultural and cosmetic industries. Nano-encapsulated phytochemicals demonstrated strong efficacy over the free form because of the increased surface area, protection of encapsulated compounds from internal and external environmental conditions (

Nanocarriers can protect bioactive phytochemical compounds against thermal and photodegradation and further provide controlled release of antifungal compounds for the development of active packaging for maintaining the integrity of food/feed during storage and protection from fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination (

 <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">Sajid et al., 2019</xref>). To date, there are different types of nanocarriers used for drug delivery, including liposomes, metal nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles and nanosponges. All these nanocarriers have been reported to be effective as drug delivery systems for plant-based products in cosmetics, agriculture and medicine (

 <xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">Udomkun and Njukwe, 2020</xref>). However, there is limited information in the literature on the use of nanosponge encapsulated biofungicides, and for that, this paper highlights the use of cyclodextrin nanosponges as carrier vehicles to encapsulate phytochemicals.
