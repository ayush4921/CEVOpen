<p id="p0135">The search for alternative mycotoxin detoxification strategies is of paramount interest in food safety. From the literature reviewed herein, it was noted that the use of botanical extracts and their phytochemicals coupled with nanosponge encapsulation technology can reduce/detoxify mycotoxins with little or no negative consequences. Only a few studies have been carried out on the decontamination of mycotoxins using nano-encapsulated bioactive compounds. Cyclodextrin based-nanosponge encapsulated plant extracts or bioactive compounds can improve the efficacy of plant extracts or their phytochemicals for decontamination of mycotoxins as reviewed in this paper. This approach further increases the bioavailability of benign bioactive compounds utilized in agriculture as environmentally-friendly fungicides, highly-effective at low concentration with strong antifungal and mycotoxin-inhibiting activities.</p>
