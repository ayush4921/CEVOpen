<p id="p0140">Future work should seek to develop methods that may enable the use of these agents as food and feed additives for the same purpose. Detailed studies on the mechanisms of interaction between nano-encapsulated bioactive compounds and food components, together with their effects on human and animal health, should also be explored. Indeed, the potential of such nanosponges and plant bioactive compounds to play a dual pharmacological and nutraceutical function as biofungicides and detoxifying agents in mitigating the effects mycotoxins is very interesting.</p>
