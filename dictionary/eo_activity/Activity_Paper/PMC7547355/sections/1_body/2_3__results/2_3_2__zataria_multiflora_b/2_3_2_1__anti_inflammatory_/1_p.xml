<p>Therapeutic effects of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> on inflammation in the lung and remedy of cough due to colds have been reported in traditional medicine [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> decreased total white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, and eosinophils counts in the animal model-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [

 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> extract on tracheal responsiveness and emphysema in the animals model of COPD have also been reported [

 <italic>Z. multi</italic>ï¬‚
 <italic>ora</italic> on total and differential WBC in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as well as on lung pathology, serum levels of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), total protein, and histamine of ovalbumin- (OVA-) sensitized animals [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. What follows from these findings is that 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> has probably potential therapeutic effects on respiratory disorders associated with inflammation in the lung, such as asthma and COPD.
