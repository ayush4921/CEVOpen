<p>Intraperitoneal administration of TQ (3â€‰mg/kg) before OVA-sensitized mice airway significantly decreased eosinophil count in the lung and also increased Th2 cytokines in the BAL fluid after airway challenge with OVA antigen. TQ also reduced the serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG1. Additionally, TQ significantly inhibited eosinophilic lung inflammation and mucus-producing goblet cells in the histological assessment. TQ also significantly reduces the levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the BAL fluid [
