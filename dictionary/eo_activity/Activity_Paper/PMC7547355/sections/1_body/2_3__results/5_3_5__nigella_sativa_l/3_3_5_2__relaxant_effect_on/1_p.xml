<p>The crude extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds (0.1–3.0 mg/ml) exhibited contraction effect on rabbit jejunum. The extract of the plant creates a dose-dependent shift to the right in the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> dose-response curves similar to verapamil and exhibits a calcium channel blocker effect. 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract (0.1–3.0 mg/ml) also has a relaxant effect on carbachol, histamine, or K(+) induced contractions in guinea pig trachea smooth muscle trough calcium channel blocking effects [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (0.25, 0.5, and 1 g%) creates the rightward shift in calcium concentration-response curves of calcium-induced contraction of guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle, which may be due to calcium antagonist effects of the extract [
