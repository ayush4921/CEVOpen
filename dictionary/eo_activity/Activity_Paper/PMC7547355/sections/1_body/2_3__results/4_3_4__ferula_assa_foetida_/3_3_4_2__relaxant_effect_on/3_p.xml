<p>The relaxant effects of 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> and its main constituents (umbelliprenin) on the tracheal smooth muscle contracted by methacholine and KCL were also reported [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. It has been reported that 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> extract (1–7 mg/ml) reduces the spontaneous contraction of the isolated guinea-pig ileum and also contraction induced by KCl (28 mM), acetylcholine (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and histamine (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). Extract of the plant (3 mg/ml) has antagonists property in guinea-pig isolated ileum precontracted with KCl and also has cyclooxygenase inhibitor property [

 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> seed's essential oil (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%) showed antispasmodic action on isolated rat's ileum contraction induced by acetylcholine [

 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> extract (2.2 mg/100 g, b.w.) significantly reduces the mean arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In one study it was shown that 
 <italic>F. sinaica</italic> root extract (50 mg) has inhibitory effects on rabbit aorta contractions induced by norepinephrine (10
 <sup>−4</sup> M) [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Moreover, the vasodilatation property of 
 <italic>F. assa-foetida</italic> extracts (180 and 360 mg/ml) on arterial rings was suggested [
