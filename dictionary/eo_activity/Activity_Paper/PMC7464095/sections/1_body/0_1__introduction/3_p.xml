<p>The genus 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> is one of the biggest genera in the family Fabaceae and is represented by more than 2500 species [
 <xref rid="B9-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The genus also contains 478 taxa in Turkey and it has many endemic species (202, endemism ratio: 42%) to Turkey [
 <xref rid="B10-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Regarding folk medicinal uses, the genus is traditionally used for several purposes. For example, 
 <italic>A. gumnifer</italic> and 
 <italic>A. longifolius</italic> roots are used to treat diabetes mellitus [
 <xref rid="B11-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <italic>A. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. brachylcalyx</italic> are used against stomachache and sore throat [
 <xref rid="B12-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>A. lamarckii</italic> for ulcer [

 <italic>A. cephalotes</italic> var. 
 <italic>brevicalyx</italic> for wound healing [
 <xref rid="B14-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and 
 <italic>A. tmoleus</italic> for abdominal pain and toothache [
 <xref rid="B15-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. From the light of these ethnobotanical records, several biological and chemical studies were performed on the members of the genus [

 <xref rid="B22-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the chemical studies, some biologically-active compounds, including hyperoside, apigenin, kaempferol, and naringenin, were detected [

 <italic>A. microcephalus</italic> is a stout and erect perennial plant (50–100 cm). Leaves are lanceolate and narrowly elliptic. Inflorescence is 3.5–5 mm diameter and contains 30–50 sessile flowers. Calyx is 15–18 mm and tubular-campanulate. Corolla is 18–35 mm and deep yellow [
 <xref rid="B26-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the current work, we aimed to examine biological properties (antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory effect) and chemical composition (total and individual phenolic compounds) of different parts (aerial parts, leaves, flowers, stems and roots) of 
 <italic>A. macrocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>finitimus</italic>.
