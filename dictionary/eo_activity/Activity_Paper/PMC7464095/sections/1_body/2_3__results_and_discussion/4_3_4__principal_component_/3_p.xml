<p>Looking at the samples plot, a separation between the organs was achieved along PCs, with the leaves and flowers very distant from the three other organs (roots, aerial parts, and stem) (

 <italic>A. macrocephanus</italic>, leaves were found to be a promising source, enclosing biomolecules responsible for antioxidant properties and melanoma management ability. This is the result of the difference in quantity and quality of phytocompounds synthesizes in those organs. This quantitative and qualitative difference of phytocompounds is due to the anatomical and morphological structure as well as in several physiological processes that occur in the different organs [
