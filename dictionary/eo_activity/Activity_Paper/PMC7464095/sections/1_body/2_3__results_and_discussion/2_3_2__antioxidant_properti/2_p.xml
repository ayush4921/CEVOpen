<p>Several researchers suggested that only one method is not enough to evaluate antioxidant abilities of plant extracts and thus, multiple methods including different mechanisms are required to obtain a full antioxidant picture. [

 <xref rid="B60-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, different expression methods have been observed in these different methods. With this fact, any comparison between results might be unreasonable and sometimes impossible. Thus, relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) has been developed by some researchers to obtain an accurate comparison between studies [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00231-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Clearly, among the tested plant parts, the leaves had the strongest antioxidant ability, followed by aerial parts, stems, flowers and, roots. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00231-f002">Figure 2</xref>, with one exception (metal chelation), the leaves exhibited the best ability in the methods performed. This fact also was confirmed by correlation analysis. The contradictory results from metal chelating assays might be explained with the presence of non-phenolic chelators such as polysaccharides, peptides, and sulphates. This approach was observed in earlier studies [
