<p>The total flavonoid content (TFC) of the plant extract was determined by the aluminium chloride colorimetric method with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. 0.5 mL of extract or standard solution of catechin or rutin was added to the test tube containing 2 mL of distilled water. 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 5% sodium nitrite was added to the flask, and after 5 min, 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 10% aluminium chloride solution was added. After 5 min, 1 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide was added, and another 1.2 mL of distilled water was added. The solution was mixed well, and the absorbance was measured against the prepared blank at 510 nm using a UV Visible spectrophotometer. Results were calculated with the catechin and the rutin standard curve and recorded as 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol of total flavonoids in a gram of extract, as the catechin (CE) and rutin (RE) equivalents. Analyses were run in triplicate and expressed (total flavonoid content was expressed in 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol of catechin hydrate or rutin/
 <italic>g</italic> of dry extract) as average values with standard deviations.
