<p>Fixed-weight material (56.17 g) of the SF aerial parts was placed into a Soxhlet apparatus 0.6L and was exhaustively extracted with solvents of increasing polarity (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and methanol), consecutively. The obtained extracts were evaporated under vacuum to dryness. The dry weights of the extracts were 1.03 g (1,83%), 1.13 g (2,01%), and 10.30 g (18,34%), respectively, and were stored in glass tubes until use. For the neuroprotective activity experiments, the extracts were dissolved in DMSO at 250 mg/mL just before use.</p>
