<p>Presently, there is no available cure for AD, and no significant progress on treatment has been documented in the past 2 decades. Only symptomatic treatment is currently available, mainly with the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, which however are not slowing down AD progression [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, there is a need for novel drugs development that will be more effective in combating AD. A large pool to identify possible candidates from are the medicinal plants and their bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some of these compounds may have the capacity to counteract the oxidative stress consequences that have been observed not only in AD, but also in every prevalent neurodegenerative disease [
