<p>It has been reported that a glycosidic compound exhibited a potent neuroprotective activity, improved microglial activation and behavioral dysfunction [

Previous studies proved that asiatic acid could reduce the level of corticosterone in a rat’s brain, which ameliorates the content of monoamine neurotransmitters and increases the function of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal for its antidepressant effects [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Neagu et al., (2018) reported that asiatic acid and madecassic acid inhibited the AChE enzyme more effectively than other triterpenes as it could support the evidence for the use of CA for cognitive function improvement. Herbal medicines have been used for the treatment of memory and cognitive functions [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. According to S. Bhadra et al., (2016) asiatic acid, a triterpenoid component of CA, was found to have an inhibitory effect against the AChE enzyme [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. N. Omar et al., (2019) reported that asiatic acid that was present in CA could cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and maintained in the tight junction of the BBB [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the comparison between triterpenes compounds and different accessions of CA are still undetermined. In addition, methanolic extracts of CA species from India were demonstrated to exert a potent cholinesterase inhibition activity, in vitro free radical scavenging, and the improvement of scopolamine-induced amnesia activity [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The present study demonstrated that SECA-K017 and SECA-K018 containing four triterpene compounds showed AChE inhibitory activity. However, SECA-K019 did not show AChE inhibitory activity probably due to the lack of madecassic acid content. In an attempt to confirm the bioactivity of a CA extract, molecular docking was conducted to recognize the binding interactions of triterpene compounds in the catalytic site of the crystal structure of AChE (PDB: 4EY7).
