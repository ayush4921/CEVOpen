 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> (L.) Urban (CA) is a herbal plant from the Apiaceae family which is native to South and Southeast Asian countries including Sri Lanka, India, China, Malaysia, and Indonesia [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In Malaysia, it is also known as pegaga and is one of the medicinal plants traditionally used for brain and nerve cell revitalization [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The major bioactive chemical compounds in CA are alkaloids, triterpenes, flavonoids, volatile oils, and glycosides [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among the different classes of natural products, the triterpenoids are the most diverse class of organic compounds. The primary bioactive compounds in CA are madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid, which belong to the class of triterpenes [

Previous study reported that these compounds have been utilized as biomarker components for the quality assessment of raw materials and herbal products of CA. However, environmental factors such as climate (temperature, humidity, wind, and light), location, growth, and soil fertility could affect the chemical components in natural plants [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Devkota et al., (2015) reported that the environmental conditions such as light exposure, fertilizer, and soil type could affect the triterpenes content in CA [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, a proficient qualitative and quantitative analysis is needed to ensure their efficacy, quality, and safety. The neuropharmacological value of CA on neuroprotection and the regeneration of the peripheral nervous system has been widely investigated [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, it is more likely that the presence of triterpenes in CA may be effective against AD [
