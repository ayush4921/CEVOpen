<p>The AChE inhibitory activity was evaluated using Ellman’s method, as reported previously [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Each sample (20 µL of 5 mg/mL in DMSO) was dispensed in triplicate into a 96-well microplate and mixed with 190 µL of DTNB, 20 µL of substrate (ATCI). The control wells contained 2% of DMSO instead of the extract. The enzymatic activity was measured at 412 nm every 30 s intervals for 3 min. The buffer solution was used as negative control.
