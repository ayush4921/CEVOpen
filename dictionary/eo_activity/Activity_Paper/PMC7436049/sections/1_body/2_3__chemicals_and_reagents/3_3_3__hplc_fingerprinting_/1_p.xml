<p>An HPLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a diode-array UV-vis detector and C18 HPLC column (15 cm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 µm) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used. The mobile phase consists of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) using a gradient elution program for 55 min with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a detection wavelength at 206 nm for analysis as described by previous literature with slight modifications (

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. About 10 mg samples were suspended in methanol:water (7:3) and filtered through a 0.2 µm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane syringe filter, prior to the HPLC analysis. Standard solutions were prepared in methanol at concentration 1000 µg/mL. An appropriate volume of each standard solution was mixed and diluted with methanol to obtain 5 concentrations ranging from 10–1000 ppm to obtain calibration curves for quantitative analysis. The relative amount of the compound was expressed as milligram per gram extract.
