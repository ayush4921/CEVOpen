<p>Withanolide A isolated from the alcoholic extract of roots (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) was characterized as 4β,27-dihydroxy-1-oxo-5β,6β-epoxy with a-2,24-dienolide (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Similarly, withanolide C, isolated from the plant, 
 <italic>possessed </italic>5 and 6β epoxide rings with chloro-group at C-5 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Various sitoindosides were produced by substitution of the acyl group (sitoindoside VII and VIII) and glucose units (sitoindoside IX and X) at C-27 of saponins. Withanone and tubacapsenolide F, with six derivatives, were isolated from aqueous extract of the whole plant (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Spectroscopic studies revealed the presence of 2-en-1-one with a steroid having an epoxy group at 6 and 7 positions, which was verified by 2-mercaptoethanol with 5 and 6β epoxy steroids (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Withanolide Q consisted of a hydroxyl group at C-23 while OH group was absent at C-27 in withanolide R (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Withanolide S isolated from the alcoholic extract of leaves during biogenetic study possessed close structural similarity to withanolide E, except the presence of secondary axial hydroxyl moiety with lack of epoxide ring. Two novel withanolides N and O (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) along with known withanolide D, E (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and P (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) were discovered from the alcoholic extract of plant leaves. Another study displayed the presence of eight novel withanolides F–M from the alcoholic extract of air-dried crushed leaves (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).
