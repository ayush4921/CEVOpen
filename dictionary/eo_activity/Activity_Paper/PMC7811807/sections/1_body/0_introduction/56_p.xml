<p>Glycowithanolides (sitoindosides VII-X, withaferin A) isolated and purified from roots of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> were administered to rats at doses of 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg of body weight for 10 days. The extracts reduced iron-induced hepatotoxicity due to the anti-oxidant activity of glycowithanolides (

The powder of roots affected the circulatory level of urea, ammonia, lipid peroxidation products (hydroperoxides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), and liver marker enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase) showing hepatoprotective potential.  The plant elevated the level of hepatic protection by affecting the concentration of liver markers and lipid peroxidation products in experimental hyperammonemia. The hepatoprotective activity might be mediated by the controlling mechanism of alkaloids, withanolides, flavonoids, urea, and urea related compounds (
