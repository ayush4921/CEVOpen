<p>It was discovered recently that the mechanism of immunomodulation involved phytochemicals such as 2,3-dihydrowithaferin -A-3-β-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfate, daucosterol, withasomniferol-A, withaferin-A, and β-sitosterol, which regulated multiple immunity pathways via bioactive-targets and protein-protein interactions (
