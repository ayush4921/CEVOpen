<p>Glycowithanolides extracted from the plant roots were assessed for anxiolytic and antidepressant activities at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg for 5 days in rats. The results of the extract were comparable to those of the standard drug, benzodiazepine lorazepam (

The methanolic and aqueous plant extracts gradually lowered marble-burying behavior without affecting motor activity in reference to fluoxetine, parachlorophenylalanine, and ritanserin. The neuroprotective properties of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> root extracts (50 mg/kg of body weight) in mice were evaluated for the treatment of the disorder in mice using a marble covering model. The extract depicted a lessened marble covering activity as compared to the standard drugs such as fluoxetine, parachlorophenylalanine, and ritanserin (
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>). In another investigation, mice treated with daily oral doses of plant root extracts (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg) showed enhanced marble burying tests in a dose dependant fashion. The extract was also investigated effective against foot shock stress-induced hyperthermia. Thus the plant is beneficial for treating antidepressant and anxiolytic activities (
