<p>The ethanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> was applied at a dose of 0.05–0.4 mg/ml to leukemic THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 24 to 72 hr. Results showed that after 24 hr treatment, increase in leukemic THP-1 and PMBC viability was observed. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cell viability remains increased with decrease in leukemic THP-1 and inhibition of cell growth to 50% for HT-29, HCT-15, SW620, 502, 713, Colo-205, A549, HOP-62, and Hep-G2 cell lines at 30 µg/ml of the extract after 72 hr (
