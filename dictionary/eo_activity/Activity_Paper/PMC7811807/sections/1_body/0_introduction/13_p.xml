<p>Different oil extracts from berries of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> were analyzed using GC-MS showing saturated and unsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid (11.247%), palmitic acid (2.842%), linoleic acid (4.000%), tetracosanoic acid (0.880%), palmitic acid (0.42%), elaidic acid (0.01%), linoleic acid (0.23%), and oleic acid (0.14%) (
