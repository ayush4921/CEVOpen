 <italic>. </italic>The methanolic extract of roots, leaves, and bark inhibited the growth of Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) bacterial strains at the concentration of 10-100 μg/ml. Methanoic extracts of roots and leaves were assessed against various fungi such as 
 <italic>A. flavus, D. turcica</italic>, and
 <italic> F. verticillioides </italic>at a concentration of 100 µg with positive control of nystatin. The zone of maximum inhibition was witnessed in the range of 7–14 mm against the fungal strains (
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). Methanolic extract of the leaves repressed the development of 
 <italic>Enterococcus </italic>species and
 <italic> S. aureus</italic> at a dose of 1–2 mg/ml (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). Acetone, methanol, ethanol, and chloroform extracts of the plant roots demonstrated noteworthy microbicidal potential against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). Leaf, stem, and root extracts of the plant were studied against 
 <italic>F. crown</italic> for antifungal potential at a concentration of 100 mg/100 ml of solvent. Aqueous and organic solvent extracts of the aforesaid parts of the plant revealed supreme inhibition at a range of 5–45 mm with the positive control, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (
