<p>Literature has witnessed a few review articles discussing some other aspects of 
 <italic>W. somnifera </italic>(
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, a comprehensive review is still in demand to appraise state of the art concerning phytochemical composition, medicinal applications, and nutrapharmaceutical potentials of the miraculous plant 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic>. We emphasized mainly the clinical trials, toxicity, and pre-clinical trials of the multiuse plant. This review will help to bridge the knowledge gaps among pharmacists, medicinal chemists, and pharmacologists about phytochemicals, the therapeutic uses, and pharmaceutical applications of the beneficial plant. The review appraised recent papers on the high value-added applications of the plant material in medicine and pharmacy.
