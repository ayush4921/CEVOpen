<p>The ethanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (12–25 mg/kg of body weight) was orally administered to albino rats (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>). The effects of whole plant extracts (100 or 200 mg/kg of body weight) were evaluated against the pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold in mice. It was revealed that plant extract increased the PTZ seizure threshold in a dose-dependent manner (

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> was studied by evaluation of TNFα, Inter Leukin (IL) IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 in collagen-induced arthritis in rats. Oral administration of aqueous root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (300 mg/kg) attenuated the transcription factors of arthritis in rats by lowering the reactive oxygen species and metaloproteinase-8 level to normal in collagen-induced arthritis bearing rats (
