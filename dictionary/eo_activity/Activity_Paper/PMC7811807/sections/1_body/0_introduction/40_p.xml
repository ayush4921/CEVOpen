<p>The methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> showed a protective effect against morphine-induced analgesic tolerance by the spine density reduction mechanism in rats. The biological mechanism involves activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ which produced pro-longer protection against morphine-induced analgesic tolerance. The methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (100 mg/kg of body weight) was administered in reference with morphine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ antagonist GW-9662 (5 and 10 µM) to male Sprague rats. Results showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ antagonist shows functional capability for attenuation of prolonged morphine analgesic effect along with reduced tolerance after repeated administration of methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic>. Moreover, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ antagonist (5 and 10 µM) and 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (1.00 mg/ml of methanolic root extract) were administered to cell culture line SH-SY5Y for evaluation of the protective effect on µ-opioid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ receptor. Cell culture analysis reveals that blocking of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ receptor by GW-9662 helps in the down-regulation of µ-opioid m-RNA which in turn enhances the availability of the µ-opioid receptor for analgesic effect (
