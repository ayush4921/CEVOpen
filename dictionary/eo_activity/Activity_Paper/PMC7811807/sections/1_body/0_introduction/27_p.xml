<p>Acetonic extract of the plant leaves was investigated against instar larvae and pupae of 
 <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic>. Studies showed that pesticidal activity happened by causing toxicity, reduced transformation of larval-pupal, and adult intermediates. Thus, 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> can be used as an insect growth regulator, which caused disruption at molting and metamorphosis stage of growth (

 <italic>Ageratum coenyzoides, Chenopodium album, </italic>and 
 <italic>Achyranthus aspera.</italic> It was established that aqueous extract of leaves is a more potent herbicid than stem and root extracts (
