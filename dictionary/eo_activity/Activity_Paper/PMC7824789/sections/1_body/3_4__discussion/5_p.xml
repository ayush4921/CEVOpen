<p>Regardless of the effect of the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract on cell survival, its antioxidant activity has been demonstrated, associated with the polyphenols contained in this extract. The antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extracts have been directly assessed, one of the most used methods for assessing the antioxidant activity of natural oils/extracts with the ability to scavenge DPPH radicals. It has been shown that radicals most effectively capture antioxidants contained in 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract from the V2 phase of vegetation. At the same time, in this phase of vegetation, 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. contains the largest number of polyphenols, including flavonoids. Literature data confirm that there is a direct relationship between the content of polyphenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of most plant extracts/components [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of polyphenols is associated with hydroxyl groups associated with the aromatic ring, which are able donate hydrogen atoms with electrons and stabilize free radicals [
 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of these compounds is also associated with the ability to chelate transition metal ions and quench singlet oxygen. The consequence of polyphenol antioxidant activity is also their participation in lipid stabilization by preventing their peroxidation [

 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, due to the different mechanisms of possible antioxidant activity, polyphenols can effectively inhibit phospholipid metabolism particularly lipid peroxidation that occurs on enzymatic and non-enzymatic ways following cells exposure to UV radiation contained e.g., in sunlight. Despite of the multiple pathways of UV radiation action, dependent to a large extent on its wavelength, exposure to it usually leads to the intracellular pro-oxidative pathways induction and oxidative stress occurring, which results in the lipid oxidation upon lipid radical formation [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Oxidative chain reactions are initiated by non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation initiators such as hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals. Membrane phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), namely arachidonic, linoleic, linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids mostly suffer from UV-induced peroxidation.
