 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> L. is an annual herbaceous plant of Lamiaceae Lindl. Family. 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L., related to thyme and rosemary, is native to North Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia, Southern and Southeastern Europe. Satureja species contain, in various concentrations, many phenolic and volatile components such as carvacrol, γ-terpinene, thymol, p-cymene, β-arylene, linalool, and other terpenoids [

The mentioned compounds are synthesized mainly in plants in order to protect them against harmful environmental factors, including UV radiation contained in the sunlight. However, the exact chemical composition depends on the Satureja species, as well as the location and the prevailing climate [

 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Phenolic compounds exert multiple biological effects such as antioxidant, free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties [
