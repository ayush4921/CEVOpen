<p>GC-2010 gas chromatograph and GCMS-QP2010 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) were used for the determination of essential oil components. An automated injector AOC-5000 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), with SPME system was used for sample preparation and injection. The RTX-5MS column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm stationary phase thickness, was used for separation of volatile compounds. For mass spectrometry an electron ionization detector set at 70 eV was used. The conditions of GC-MS method were as described before [

 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Initial column temperature 60 °C, injector temperature 280 °C, ion source temperature 260 °C, interface temperature 260 °C. The injection was performed at split ratio 1:10. The temperature was increased gradually from 60 °C to 150 °C at 5 °C/min and from 150 °C to 280 °C at 20 °C/min and kept for 3 min. Total analysis time was 30.5 min. Compounds were determined analyzing mass spectra and comparing to the electronic NIST v14.1 library of mass spectra.
