<p>Radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extracts was assessed using DPPH radical scavenging method [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. DPPH solution was prepared by dissolving 4 mg of DPPH in 50 mL of acetonitrile, 50 mL of methanol and 100 mL of prepared acetate buffer (1.36 g of sodium acetate dissolved in 100 mL of bi-distilled water, pH 5.5 was adjusted using 33% aqueous acetic acid). 77 μL of sample extract was added to 3000 μL of radical solution, mixed by shaking vial and after 15 min. incubation time the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at the wavelength of 515 nm. The prepared solution was kept in darkness. The measurements were performed triplicate. Results were expressed in rutin equivalents (RE mg/g).
