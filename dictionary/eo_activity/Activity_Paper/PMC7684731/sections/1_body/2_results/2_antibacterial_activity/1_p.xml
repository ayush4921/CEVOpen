<p id="Par35">In this study, the antibacterial MIC and MBC values of the 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark and it’s fractions against 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> using dilution methods were presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The MIC values of 0.5 mg/ml or less were considered as good antibacterial activity. Generally, Fr2, Fr1 and crude extract demonstrated good MIC values against 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. MIC value of 0.3 mg/ml was observed when Fr1 and Fr2 were used against 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Fr2 showed the best antibacterial activity against the two types of bacteria. Positive control demonstrated the most potent inhibition activity against the two types of bacteria.
