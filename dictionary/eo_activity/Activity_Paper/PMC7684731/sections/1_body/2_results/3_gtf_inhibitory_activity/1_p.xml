<p id="Par36">Fraction four (Fr4), methanolic crude extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark, and Fr3 at the concentration of 100 μg/ml inhibited GTF secreted from 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> to a remarkable extent with more than 85% inhibitions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Judging from the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values; Fr4, and methanolic crude extracts showed remarkable inhibition of GTF activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.9 and 8.4 μg/ml, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Chlorhexidine, as a positive control, showed good activity against GTF.
