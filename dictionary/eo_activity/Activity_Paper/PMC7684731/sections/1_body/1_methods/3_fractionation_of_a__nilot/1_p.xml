<p id="Par23">The crude extract (400 mg /2 ml of 50% methanol) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column. The column was eluted with methanol (250 ml), methanol-water (80:20, v/v; 150 ml, Fr1), methanol-water (50:50, v/v; 250 ml, Fr2), methanol-water (5:95, v/v; 100 ml, Fr3) and finally acetone-water (70:30, v/v; 250 ml, Fr4). The fractions (Fr1–4) were concentrated in vacuo (38 °C) and freeze-dried to give four powders with approximate weights of 34.2 mg, 35.7 mg, 44.8 mg, and 244.5 mg for Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 respectively. Furthermore, the crude extract and fractions were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with reversed-phase column C
 <sub>18</sub> (Sunniest 4.5 mm i.d. X 250 mm). The solvent system used was as follows: a gradient program for 65 min from 5 to 100% methanol in water with 0.05% TFA (Trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, monitored at 280 nm.
