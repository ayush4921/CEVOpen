 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> 6715 and 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> ATCC 33277 were cultured in brain heart infusion broth. For 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> broth supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml vitamin K
 <sub>3</sub> and 5 μg/ml hemin. The samples were tested for antibacterial activity in sterile 96-well plates. The inoculums were prepared by diluting the broth culture to 10
 <sup>6</sup>cell/ml for 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and 10
 <sup>8</sup>cell/ml for 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> approximately. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Chlorhexidine was included in the assay as a positive control. Then cultures were incubated 24 h for 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and 72 h for 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> at 37 °C under anaerobic condition. Microbial growth was indicated by adding 50 μl of (0.2 mg/ml) p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) to culture and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited the color change of INT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), 10 μl from wells that showed no color change were transferred to 100 μl of fresh media and then incubated for 24 h under the anaerobic condition at 37 °C. Microbial growth was also indicated by adding INT to culture. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited the color change of INT.
