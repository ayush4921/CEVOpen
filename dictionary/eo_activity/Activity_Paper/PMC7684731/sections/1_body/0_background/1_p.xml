<p id="Par17">Dental caries is an irreversible localized infection that results in progressive tooth decay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Itâ€™s a common type of dental disease associated with microorganisms present on the tooth surface in dental plaque. One of the main etiologic factors of dental caries is considered to be 
 <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic>, which belong to the gram-positive mutans streptococci group. The presence of 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> is relatively higher on the molars compared to the anterior teeth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence of 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> is more closely associated with high caries activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> can colonize the tooth surface and initiate plaque formation by synthesizing water-insoluble glucan from sucrose by glucosyltransferases (GTF), resulting in a firm attachment to the tooth surface and form lactic and other organic acids by fermentation of various sugars in foods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Different strategies for preventing dental caries caused by cariogenic bacteria, such as depression of the growth of streptococcus, inhibition of GTF activity, and hydrolysis of glucans by enzymes, have been developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Further accumulation of plaque around the gingival margin and subgingival region may lead to shifts in the balance of the microflora from mainly gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria, and an increased number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria will cause the development of periodontal diseases [
