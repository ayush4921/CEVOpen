<p>It was assumed that the nutritive value of plants is highly related to its content of primary metabolites, e.g., sugars, proteins and lipids [
 <xref rid="B9-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this regard, sugars and organic acids are related to taste and flavor [
 <xref rid="B47-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], essential amino acids are involved in some biological processes, such as protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B48-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and a lower saturated/unsaturated fatty acids (SFA/USFA) ratio is linked to cardio-protective effects [
 <xref rid="B49-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It has been reported that the higher the CO2 levels, the higher the rate of photosynthetic activity, which is linked to the enhancement of the carboxylation reaction of rubisco, the enzyme responsible for CO
 <sub>2</sub> fixation [
 <xref rid="B37-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a consequence of photosynthesis improvement, sugars could be accumulated and also broken down via dark respiration, resulting in production of the precursors necessary for synthesis of different classes of primary and secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="B50-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Supporting such a concept, the individual AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> treatments induced significant increases in the content of total soluble sugar of

 <sub>2</sub> only (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00168-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Further, the synchronous application of AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> caused a significant accumulation in the levels of the majority of the measured sugars relative to AMF alone treatment. Similarly, CO
 <sub>2</sub> enrichment enhanced the accumulation of sucrose and starch in oil palm [
 <xref rid="B51-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and increased the accumulation of total soluble carbohydrates and starch in ginger varieties [
 <xref rid="B52-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. AMF treatments were found to induce the accumulation of total soluble sugars in lettuce [
 <xref rid="B53-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further, the interaction between AMF and CO
 <sub>2</sub> improved forage quality of alfalfa plants by increasing the levels of glucose, fructose and hemicellulose and decreasing that of lignin [
