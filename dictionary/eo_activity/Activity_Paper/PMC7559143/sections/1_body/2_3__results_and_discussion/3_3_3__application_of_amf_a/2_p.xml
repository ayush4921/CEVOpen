<p>Besides, the current results revealed that the combined AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> treatment induced a significant increase in the majority of the detected organic acids, amino acids (including both essential and non-essential amino acids) and fatty acids in 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>, relative to AMF alone (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00168-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00168-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Regarding the individual treatments, AMF was more efficient in inducing the accumulation of these primary metabolites than eCO
 <sub>2</sub>. All AMF and/or eCO
 <sub>2</sub> treatments did not affect the SFA/USFA ratio. Similarly, it was reported that AMF-inoculated maize plants, under low temperature, had higher amino acid concentrations than non-mycorrizal ones, especially for Thr, Lys, Gly, Ala and His contents [
 <xref rid="B55-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In contrast, proline content was reduced in mycorhizal 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> grown under saline conditions [
 <xref rid="B56-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Moreover, different effects of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on amino acids were reported, which were reduced in barley [
 <xref rid="B57-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], increased in spring wheat [
 <xref rid="B58-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], or were not affected in maize [
 <xref rid="B59-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It was also shown that organic acid levels were increased in mycorrhizal 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> grown under heavy metal concentrations [
 <xref rid="B60-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], while they were not increased in 
 <italic>Portulacaria afra</italic> under eCO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B61-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The concentration of most fatty acids of soybean was unchanged under higher levels of CO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B62-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. On the other hand, a significant increase in the levels of individual fatty acids was reported in parsley and dill grown under eCO
 <sub>2</sub>, which is more evident on UFA than SFA [
 <xref rid="B9-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the synchronous application of AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> could be beneficial to avoid the negative impact of the individual treatment and/or to support their positive effects.
