<p>Supporting our results, several studies have investigated the potential effects of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF, separately and in combination, on the levels of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in a variety of plant species. For instance, AMF treatments caused an increase in phenolic compounds content of lettuce [

 <xref rid="B66-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and in the antioxidant capacity of sweet basil [
 <xref rid="B67-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, the flavonoids of some wild plants, such as 
 <italic>Libidibia ferrea</italic>, were found to be accumulated by mycorrhizal association [

 <sub>2</sub> induced the accumulation of some phenolic compounds in birch [
 <xref rid="B69-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, a low phenolic content was reported for some plants such as rice [
 <xref rid="B70-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] under eCO
 <sub>2</sub>. Regarding the interaction between eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF, it was reported that the induction of secondary metabolites in lettuce and alfalfa by AMF was negatively affected under eCO
 <sub>2</sub>, probably due to utilization of photoassimilates for increasing plant biomass and for AMF growth as well, at the expense of secondary metabolism [

 <xref rid="B44-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, it could be suggested that climatic changes might have an impact on AMF, which in turn, affect the metabolic functions of their host plants.
