<p>Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the induction of secondary metabolites in response to AMF associations and eCO
 <sub>2</sub>. It was found that AMF could affect secondary metabolites through improved photosynthesis and mineral content of the host plants, activation of pathways involved in synthesis of secondary metabolites, or higher expression of some genes related to secondary metabolism [

 <sub>2</sub>-induced changes in plant secondary metabolism have been attributed to either excess amount of non-structural carbohydrates, resulting in an increment in carbon-based secondary metabolites [
