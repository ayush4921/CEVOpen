<p>Apart from phenolic acids, 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> contained additional antibacterial compounds as revealed by GC-MS analysis. For instance, 1-Adamantyl heterocycle, which was detected in the twigs of 
 <italic>Protea caffra,</italic> is usually incorporated into anti-infectious molecules to improve their efficacy [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Several potent antimicrobial and antiviral agents such as Rimantadine [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Oxadiazole [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Isoxazole [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Thiadiazole [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] are all 1-adamantanyl derivatives. It was of great interest to note that 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> produces levoglucosan (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), an important source of C1-C10 and C1-C13 carbon skeletons used to produce the antibiotics erythromycin A and B, [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. 1-Heptacosanol, another compound detected in 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic>, is a fatty alcohol present in plants [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], marine algae [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and cuttlefish, 
 <italic>Sepiella inermis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The compound has potent antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The presence of 1-heptacosanol in 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> suggests that the plant might have potent antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], nematocidal [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] properties. Unlike 1-nonadecanol which is a known antibacterial phyto-compound [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], polygalitol has not yet been demonstrated to have antibacterial properties, but has been detected in several plant extracts with potent antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Polygalitol was the most abundant compound in the cold ethyl acetate fraction which demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial activities in the present study (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Further studies are warranted to determine the compound’s phytochemical properties. Given that 1-heptacosanol, an antibacterial compound, was the major phyto-chemical constituent in the hot ethyl acetate fraction, it is logical to suggest that it was probably the one that inhibited the growth of both 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Polygalitol and other phyto-compounds detected in this sub-fraction could also have contributed to the observed antibacterial activities. Oxalyl chloride detected in the acetone sub-fraction is a synthetic compound used in oxidative processes involved in manufacturing antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides and other organic products [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. There are no indications in the current literature suggesting that the compound is produced by plants and/or that it is biologically active. Oxalyl chloride was therefore probably incorporated into 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> tissues from an external source. Further investigation would reveal which of the two compounds present in the sub-fraction (acetone) was responsible for the weak antibacterial activity observed against 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> (MIC ≥ 1.25 mg/mL). The principle antibacterial compounds in the 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> should, however, be unequivocally identified and their respective antibacterial mechanisms elucidated.
