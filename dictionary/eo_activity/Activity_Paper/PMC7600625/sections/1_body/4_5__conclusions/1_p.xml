<p>Natural products and their derivatives have, of late, attracted much attention as potential sources of drug leads that could be effective in combating microbial infections prevalent in humans. The present study revealed that 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> is a potential source of antibacterial compounds effective against both drug-sensitive and -resistant bacterial strains. It is, however, pertinent that the antibacterial compounds in the plant be unequivocally identified and their mode of action elucidated. This is the first report on the pharmacologically properties of 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> and based on the current findings, it is recommended that the other members of 
 <italic>Protea</italic> species (&gt;300) be explored for potential therapeutic properties.
