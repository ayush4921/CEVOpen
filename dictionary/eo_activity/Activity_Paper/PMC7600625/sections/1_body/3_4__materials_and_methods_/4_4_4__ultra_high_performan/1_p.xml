 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The assay was done in triplicate and results presented as mean ± standard error. The mean values obtained were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and where statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) existed, these values were further separated using the Duncan’s multiple range test. Bio-statistical analysis were done using the SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
