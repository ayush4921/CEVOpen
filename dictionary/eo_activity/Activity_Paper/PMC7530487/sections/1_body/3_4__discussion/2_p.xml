<p>The yield obtained at the end of the extraction is quite sufficient to conduct the experiment as designed. There are differences in percentage yield among different solvents used for extraction. A previous study recorded different solvents with significant effects on the extractable solids yield of 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> root. The study revealed the highest extractable solids (15.6%) with absolute methanol followed by 50% ethanol, 50% methanol, and 50% acetone (14.3%, 12.3%, and 12.2%, resp.). Aqua solvent extracted half of extractable solids in comparison with absolute methanol, whereas 100% ethanol and 100% acetone only extracted 25% of extractable solids extracted by 100% methanol [

 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> root was significantly affected by the extraction solvents. The findings were in agreement with previous research on 
 <italic>Limnophila aromatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and 
 <italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] whereby the variation in percentage yield can be explained by the difference in solubility of different compounds in the sample.
