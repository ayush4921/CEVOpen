<p>Chronic toxicity test of the crude extract was carried out on adult Javanese medaka (
 <italic>Oryzias javanicus</italic>) (length of 1.9-1.9–2.7 cm, weight of 0.1–0.3 g, and age of 6 months) for 2 weeks in chlorine-free tap water as reported by OCED. Random selection of J. medaka of both sexes was carried out and maintained at the stocking density of five fish per liter. The fishes were exposed to seven different concentrations of the crude extract (35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95 mg/L). Three replicates each alongside the control groups were used for the test. The selection of the test concentration of crude extract was made based on the result obtained from acute toxicity tests of the crude extract on Javanese medaka. Survivals as well as behaviors of the fish were monitored closely during the experiment. The fishes were fed prior to and during the experimental period. During the experiment, the behaviors of the experimental fishes were monitored regularly [

The experiments were conducted in compliance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animals use and care as well as ethical clearance by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Universiti Putra Malaysia (ref. no. UPM/IACUC/AUP-R005/2016).
