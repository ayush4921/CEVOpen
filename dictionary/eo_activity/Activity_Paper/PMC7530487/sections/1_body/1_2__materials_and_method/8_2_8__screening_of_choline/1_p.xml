<p>Screening of cholinesterase activities of the crude extract on adult J. medaka (length of 1.9–2.7 cm, weight of 0.1–0.3 g, and age of 6 months) was carried out in chlorine-free tap water. Fishes were divided into four groups with 25 fishes per group and acclimatized for 2 weeks. The fishes were maintained in separate aerated 14-liter tanks and water was changed after every 24 hrs. The fishes were initially exposed to the safe dose of crude extract 50 mg/L for 24 hours and later exposed to 0.15 mM arsenic. These concentrations were chosen based on previous studies of acute, chronic toxicity test of crude extract as well as subacute and subchronic toxicity test of arsenic. The control groups were maintained in the same conditions but without arsenic and crude extract for 10 days. Three replicates were used for each concentration along with control groups [
