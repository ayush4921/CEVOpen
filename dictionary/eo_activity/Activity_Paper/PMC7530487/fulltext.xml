Introduction</title><p>
<italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (Gb) or maidenhair tree is commonly found in China and used for several medicinal purposes since time immemorial. It is one of the most used ancient seeds referred to as &#x0201c;living fossil,&#x0201d; tree that can survive for more than 1000 years and can reach a height of up to 40&#x02009;m [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Leaf extract from this tree is traditionally used in Asia for centuries to treat circulatory disorders, asthma, tinnitus, vertigo, and cognitive problems [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several reports show that extracts from different parts of this plant are used as supplements or brain stimulant which has been standardized worldwide as safe and most recommended medicinal plant. Different parts of the tree have been commercialized and used in the treatment of several ailments in developed countries especially in the elderly and amongst people with dementia as nootropic agents due to its high activities [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cholinesterase inhibitory effect of the extract from this tree has been documented. Hence, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> and memantine are classified as among antidementic agents since 2000 years ago [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phytochemical study of extracts from Gb tree revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds mainly terpenoids, flavonol glycosides, and proanthocyanidins. The most available bioactive compounds present in this plant are flavonol glycosides (quercetin and catechin) and terpenoids (ginkgolides and bilobalides), which are reported as unique bioactive components of this tree due to their high neurocurative effects. The pharmacological effects as well as medicinal properties of this plant are due to the presence of terpenoids, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins as reported by several scientists [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Experimental animal studies also discovered the mechanisms of action that have been postulated to reaffirm its pharmacological properties, ability to inhibit platelet-activating factor and enhance nitric oxide elimination from the body system. Subsequently, its effect on increased peripheral and cerebral blood flow was reported and believed to be one of its major mechanisms of action [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Modulations of different neurotransmitter systems by extract from different parts of this tree have also been documented. It acts as strong inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A and synaptosomal uptake of DA, 5-HT, and norepinephrine [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, extracts from different parts of this tree show high free radical scavenger activities, neuroprotective effects, and antiapoptotic properties. The plant has high potential to inhibit amyloid-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> neurotoxicity, protect against hypoxic challenges, and neutralize oxidative stress [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several previous studies of this plant have mainly focused on the efficacy of this tree extract in the management of dementia. Although, inconsistent and controversial results have been documented, this may be due to the different types and concentrations of the available bioactive compounds [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Cholinesterase or choline esterase belongs to the esterase family; these include set of enzymes that break acetylcholine to choline-based esters [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, the mechanisms of action of these enzymes are either of the two: speed up the hydrolysis of cholinergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine) or metabolize acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. These biochemical reactions are very vital to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its normal resting state after activation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, acetylcholine at a motor enclave triggers muscle contraction, for the muscle to relax afterward cholinesterase has to act to neutralize acetylcholine rather than remaining locked in a tense state [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Javanese medaka fishes belong to the genus Oryzias, commonly found in fresh and salt water in Asia. The genus has about 20 species that are small in size (usually less than 4&#x02009;cm) and highly transparent [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They are mostly present in shallow nonmoving or slow moving stream near the shore or bank, often found in rice paddy, ponds, irrigation channels, and small creeks. Almost all species of this genus are surface swimmers with relatively large eyes at the sides and slightly flattened head that are easily recognized by looking down the swimming fish from above [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among this genus <italic>O. latipes</italic> species has already been confirmed as one of the best experimental fish for several studies. The fish has been used as a unique model for molecular studies, genomic sequence, informatics study, and transgenic study [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another two species of genus are <italic>O. javanicus</italic> and <italic>O. dancena</italic> that are among the popularly used models in environmental sciences research. They are commonly found in Southeast Asia due to their wide distribution in the region. They can easily be acclimatized and kept in both fresh and salt water, although the former prefers fishes that can withstand hyperosmotic environment and the latter prefers fishes that can withstand hypoosmotic environment [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Despite the increased use of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> leaf and seed as a supplements and or medicinal agent, there is paucity of information on its toxicity and cholinesterase effects on animal's cells and tissues. Hence, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> 80% methanol seed extract on cholinesterase activities in the brain of Javanese medaka.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Method</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Plants Collection and Identification</title><p>
<italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> seed was purchased from wholesalers at Chinese Traditional Pharmacy at Puchong, Selangor, Malaysia. The herb was identified by botanists at the Institute of Bioscience (IBS), University Putra Malaysia (UPM), and voucher number was allocated (SK2894/15). The seed was washed and air-dried at room temperature 26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000b0;C for two weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Plant Extraction</title><p>
<italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> seed was cleaned and allowed to dry for two weeks at room temperature (26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000b0;C) before crushing to semipowdered form (40&#x02013;60 mesh). A total of 200&#x02009;g of leaf sample was soaked for 3 days in 1000&#x02009;mL of 80% methanol in flat bottom flasks (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The powdered seed methanol mixture was shaken daily for three days at 26&#x000b0;C to obtain high crude extract; this procedure was repeated three times to extract all bioactive components of the seed. The extract obtained was then filtered with Whatman filter paper (1.5 Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and then concentrated to semisolid form at 42&#x000b0;C with a rotary evaporator (IKA&#x000ae; RV 10, USA). The resultant crude extract obtained was then weighed and transferred into sample bottles and stored at 4&#x000b0;C until required for use [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Percentage yield of the crude extract was calculated as the weight of the filtrate divided by the total weight of the grounded seed in semipowder multiplied by 100: Yield (%)&#x02009;=&#x02009;[wt of extract (g)/wt of plant material (g)]&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Plants Sample Dilution and Dose Preparation</title><p>Stock solution was prepared by dissolving 100&#x02009;mg of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> crude seed extract in 1&#x02009;mL of 100% DMSO (100&#x02009;mg/mL). The use of DMSO was to solubilize the crude extract, since the extract is not absolutely soluble in aqua solvent. Preparation of substocks solution in microliter (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) was done by diluting the stock solution to the concentration of interest using distilled water. Working solution was prepared from substock solution using twofold serial dilution with distilled water at eight concentrations ranging from 7.81 to 1000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL in a 96-well microplate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Determination of Cholinesterase Activity of Plant Extract</title><p>A 50&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.4 was used as a buffer throughout the experiment. Cholinesterase (AChE) used in the assay was from the homogenized brain of experimental fishes. DTNB, ATC, BTC, and PTC were prepared in 50&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl in 96-well plates I. A 210&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH7.4), 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of 0.1&#x02009;mM DTNB, and 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of AChE from the brain (54&#x02009;mg/mL) were transferred into another 96-well plate II and incubated for 15&#x02009;min at 28&#x000b0;C. Then, 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of ATC, BTC, or PTC (2.5&#x02009;mM) was then added to the mixture in 96-well plate II and incubated for 10 minutes. Based on Ellman's method, anticholinesterase (ChE) activity was measured using a modified 96-well microplate assay. The hydrolysis of the substrate acetylthiocholine by cholinesterase enzyme results in the production of thiocholine. Thiocholine reacts with Ellman's reagent (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate-5-mercaptothiocholine which was measured at 405&#x02009;nm with microplate reader.

Discussion</title><p>Traditional medicines are naturally derived from plant bioactive substances with minimal or no industrial processing. They have been used to cure or prevent illness within local or regional healing practices [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This work was design to evaluate toxicity and anticholinesterase effect of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> 80% methanolic seed extract.</p><p>The yield obtained at the end of the extraction is quite sufficient to conduct the experiment as designed. There are differences in percentage yield among different solvents used for extraction. A previous study recorded different solvents with significant effects on the extractable solids yield of <italic>S. chinensis</italic> root. The study revealed the highest extractable solids (15.6%) with absolute methanol followed by 50% ethanol, 50% methanol, and 50% acetone (14.3%, 12.3%, and 12.2%, resp.). Aqua solvent extracted half of extractable solids in comparison with absolute methanol, whereas 100% ethanol and 100% acetone only extracted 25% of extractable solids extracted by 100% methanol [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The result showed that recovery yields of crude semisolid extract prepared from <italic>S. chinensis</italic> root was significantly affected by the extraction solvents. The findings were in agreement with previous research on <italic>Limnophila aromatica</italic> [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and <italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic> L. [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] whereby the variation in percentage yield can be explained by the difference in solubility of different compounds in the sample.</p><p>Increase of arsenic concentration is responsible for the increase of mortality rate as shown in the subacute and subchronic toxicity results (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The studies showed that chronic exposure to arsenic through well waters has led to peripheral vascular disease referred to as black foot disease [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic may lead to various cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, and ventricular arrhythmias [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ability of arsenic to stimulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase present in the plasma membrane of vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) causing increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxides and hydrogen peroxide has also been reported [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ROS generation due to exposure to arsenic and nitric oxide (NO) made up peroxynitrite which is a strong oxidant that mediates inflammatory process such as cyclooxygenase-2 [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Survival rate of the exposed fishes decreases with increasing concentration of crude extract in both acute and chronic toxicity test (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). From this study, it is clearly shown that most of the mortalities were caused by the effect of bioactive constituent present in the crude extract in either high concentrations as in acute toxicity test or cumulative effect as in chronic toxicity test. Although most of the bioactive constituents (polyphenol) present in the plant crude extract mainly have medicinal effect, some researchers also revealed the effect of phenolic compounds such as alkaloid to be detrimental to body cells, tissues, and organs especially if taken in high concentration or used over a long period of time [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Previous studies showed that most of the anti-inflammatory agents (flavonoid) cause gastroduodenal mucosal injury resulting from deleterious effect of gastric acid overwhelming the normal defensive properties of the mucosa when used in high concentration [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The possibility of systemic effects resulting from the inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis was also reported. Inhibition of prostaglandin may affect the availability of the epithelial mucus, secretion of bicarbonate, mucosal blood flow, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal resistance to injury [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Several works of literature on <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity study reported the effect of extract with anti-inflammatory effect to affect vital organs such as liver, kidney, heart, spleen, and brain [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Damage to these vital organs due to the high concentration of phenolic compounds or their cumulative effect over time may be the main causes of the death in this experimental study.</p><p>Cholinesterase refers to the family of enzymes that speed up the hydrolysis of the acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Anticholinesterases or AChE inhibitors inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase from hydrolyzing ACh, increasing both the level and duration of the neurotransmitter action [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Decrease in cholinesterase activities was observed in fishes that were exposed to arsenic only. There is slight difference in cholinesterase inhibition between fishes that were treated with crude extract only and the fishes that were treated with crude extract followed by exposure to arsenic (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Slight decrease in cholinesterase activity in fishes that were treated with crude extract followed by exposure to arsenic may be due to the effect of arsenic. Several studies reported the effect of arsenic in inhibiting cholinesterase activities. Chandravanshi et al. in an experimental study, reported the ability of arsenic to cause significant decrease in serum acetylcholinesterase activities in in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This result is also in agreement with the previous studies that demonstrated a decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase in neuroblastoma cells of mice [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in arsenic induced rat whole brain [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and in two models of fish [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Increase of cholinesterase activities in fishes treated with crude extract followed by administration of arsenic may be due to the neutralizing effect of the phenolic compounds present in the crude extract. Several bioactive compounds were reported to reverse the effect of cholinesterase reduced activities. Alkaloid is among the phenolic compounds that act by selective, competitive, and rapidly reversible AChE inhibition that interacts with the anionic subsite, as well as with the aromatic gorge [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The compound is also an allosteric ligand at nicotinic cholinergic receptors inducing their modulation. Alkaloid interacts with the nicotinic receptor at binding sites separate from those for ACh and nicotinic agonists and acts specifically to enhance the activity (sensitize) of nicotinic receptors in the presence of ACh [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Vitexin was the identified crude extract using HPLC method. Although there is no online literature that reported the identification or isolation of vitexin in any part of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, several studies revealed the presence of various phenolic compounds in this plant. Hence this result is not in line with the work reported by [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] who identified several flavonoids in <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> extract such as ginkgolide (A, B, C, J), quercetin, and isorhamnetin but not vitexin. It has been reported that vitexin (50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) was able to prevent the formation of ROS and NRS which are the markers of protein and lipid oxidation, carbonyl protein, and malondialdehyde [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It also reduced loss of membrane potential by a mechanism of increased mitochondrial biogenesis, such as induction of the expression of antioxidant genes nuclei factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) with increased GSH level [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>Plant crude extract showed low toxicity effects on Javanese medaka and high cholinesterase inhibition activities.
