<p>To analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407, we investigated their effects on the NF-κB pathway in RAW264.7 cells by qRT-PCR. NF-κB expression was significantly higher in LPS-treated cells than that in the non-treated controls (

In parallel with the change in NF-κB levels, the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 was also remarkably increased by LPS; treatment with SBR, MOB, or GenoTX-407 blocked this LPS-mediated increase in TNF- α and IL-6 levels. Considering the upregulation of NF-κB and pro-inflammatory cytokines, gene expression levels of the inflammatory enzymes iNOS and COX2 were increased following exposure to LPS. Notably, treatment with SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 significantly inhibited the expression of these enzymes in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, LPS treatment remarkably upregulated NO levels, and co-treatment with SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 inhibited this upregulation.
