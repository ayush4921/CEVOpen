<p>The obesity prevalence has been increasing alarmingly, and it has become a global concern. The OA antiobesity effects have been reported in mice [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showed that OA inhibits the inflammatory response during adipocyte differentiation through blocking IL-6-TRAF6-NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling and visfatin, a proinflammatory and visceral fat-specific adipokine expressed in adipocytes [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. OA can inhibit fat production while maintaining total estrogen levels, which may be related to the significant downregulation of ACC, a key gene for fat synthesis [

In addition, obesity leads to chronic inflammation in the whole body, yet SO1989 (a derivative of OA) can restore the balance between M1 polarized and M2 polarized macrophages in obese mice induced by high fat diet (HFD), thereby improving fat inflammation and metabolic dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Recent study has shown that the administration of OA to prediabetic rats can improve body/liver weight ratio, and significantly reduced plasma triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. DKS26 (a derivative of OA) plays the role of hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and islets protective effects through cAMP/PKA signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Moreover, nano-OA can effectively improve the metabolic dysfunction induced by high-fat candy diet in rats by improving its bioavailability and pharmacodynamic properties [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In conclusion, OA and its derivatives are potential drugs against metabolic syndrome.
