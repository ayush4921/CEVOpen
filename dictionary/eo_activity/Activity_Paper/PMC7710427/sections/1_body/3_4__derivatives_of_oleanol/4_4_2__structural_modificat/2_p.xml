<p>Ji's group linked aspirin to the carboxyl group at position 28 to obtain a series of conjugates 7-9b [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The inhibitory activity of oleanolic acid-aspirin conjugate on 5-hydroxy tryptamine synthesis and the activity of promoting bone formation were investigated. Among them, the conjugate 7b had the strongest inhibitory effect on serotonin, with the inhibition rate as high as 87.2%, slightly higher than that of the positive control LP533401, which was 12 times that of oleanolic acid and 14 times that of aspirin. In the experiment of promoting osteoblast activity, conjugate 7b also showed the strongest activity, which was close to the proliferation effect of the positive control drug. By comparing conjugate 8b and 9b with 7b, it can be concluded that the carbonyl group at position 28 of OA is a pharmacophore for antiserotonin synthesis, and the modification of hydroxyl at position 3 has little effect on the activity.
