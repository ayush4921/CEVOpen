<p>Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] conducted a more comprehensive study on the self-microemulsifying drug delivery system of oleanolic acid (SMEDDS-OA). The results of SMEDDS-OA dissolution test in vitro showed that the cumulative dissolution rate of the drug in 15 minutes reached more than 85%, while the reference marketed tablets were less than 60%, and the solubility increased by more than 1000 times compared with OA [

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] also studied the pharmacokinetics of SMEDDS-OA in rats. And likewise compared with oral tablets, its relative bioavailability reached 402.24%. Those suggest that self-microemulsifying drug delivery system can improve the solubility and bioavailability of OA. In a word, the basic experimental research is more comprehensive, but there are few reports about clinical trials.
