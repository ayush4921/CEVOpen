<p>Oleanolic acid (OA, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) belongs to oleanane type pentacyclic triterpenes, widely distributed in nearly 200 species of plants, including Swertia, Ligustrum lucidum, grape, and elderberry [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this paper, by reviewing the preparation technology of oleanolic acid at home and abroad in recent years, it is found that there are mainly two ways to improve the water solubility, permeability, and bioavailability of oleanolic acid. One is to prepare new dosage forms of oleanolic acid, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, solid dispersions, and phospholipid complexes to improve oleanolic acid dissolution, penetration and absorption [
