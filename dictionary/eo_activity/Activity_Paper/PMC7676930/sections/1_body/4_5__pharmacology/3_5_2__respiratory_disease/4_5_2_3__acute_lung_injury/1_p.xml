<p>As the research continues, some studies have reported that FCB is a promising agent to treat acute lung injury. TFCB (15–60 mg/kg/day for 5 days) could markedly attenuate LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice, which was associated with a decrease of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 [

 <italic>κ</italic>B, and Fas Ligand (FasL) [

 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and IL-8 in the LPS-induced acute lung injury mice model. Also, those changes may partly be relevant for the weakening of AKT/PI3K phosphorylation and the attenuation of lipid rafts formation [
