<p>Based on a recent study, isosteroid alkaloids from FCB (including imperialine, peimine, peiminine, peimisine, imperialine-3-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside, and delavine (0–50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M for 24 h)) could inhibit cigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress in RAW264.7 macrophages, which was associated with a decrease of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase of glutathione, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the result indicates that FCB could be a potential inhibitor of oxidative stress [
