<p>Alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain cyclic structures with, at least, one basic nitrogen atom being incorporated within, which have a wide distribution in medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As the fundamental components of FCB, alkaloids are traditionally believed to be responsible for the pharmacological activities of FCB [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and have been considered as a key index for the identification and quality control of FCB [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, the content of total alkaloids in FCB is extremely low, approximately ranging from 0.02% to 0.3% [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Previous studies showed that the alkaloids from FCB could be classified into two groups based on the carbon framework: isosteroidal alkaloids and steroidal alkaloids; the former accounts for approximately 75% of the total alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the last several decades, many phytochemical research studies have been carried out to extract and identify the alkaloids in FCB. To date, more than 30 alkaloids in FCB have been identified, mainly including imperialine, peimisine, peiminine, peimine, and chuanbeinone.
