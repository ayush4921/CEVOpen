<p>FCB is a famous TCM with a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects and has been extensively used as a major ingredient in cough syrups with a huge commercial market. At present, FCB is still mainly harvested from the wild fields. However, the wild 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> species used as the botanical origins of FCB grow extremely slow. Also, they are difficult to meet the increasing market demands [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In addition, the overexploitation of wild resources results in the extinction of many 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> species. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to find out an alternative way to improve the production of FCB. Encouragingly, the emerging of artificial cultivation technique has partly solved the shortage of supplies. Also, the content of total alkaloids in cultivated FCB is higher than that in wild FCB [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. But, many shortcomings remain; for example, large-scale cultivation of those species is limited because of the restricted growth conditions. Additionally, the output of artificial cultivation is not ideal whereas the cost of that is high, and it still requires a long time to grow into an apparent size [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Moreover, the practical value of 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> propagation by seed is low because the growth of seedlings in natural habitats is too weak [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Recently, tissue culture has been considered as a promising approach because it dramatically reduces the breeding time of 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> species. But, there is a fly in the ointment: the stages of rooting and transplanting are difficult, which may result from dormancy of bulbs [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Hence, the propagation of 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> is another point worth taking into consideration. Of course, searching for the substitutes is also a feasible way to offset the shortage of FCB. For instance, Fritillariae Ussuriensis Bulbus possesses pharmacologic function similar to that of FCB and has abundant natural resources [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. So, it is a valuable subject to verify whether Bulbus Fritillariae Ussuriensis 
 <italic>or</italic> other 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> herbs could be used as FCB. Overall, it is necessary to explore the better approach to shorten the growth time of medicinal 
 <italic>Fritillaria</italic> plants, promote the output of FCB, and prevent the overexploitation of wild original species.
