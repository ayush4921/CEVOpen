<p>Based on the Ki values of the compounds, the intermediate 2-phenyl-4-(substituted benzylidene)oxazole-5(4 
 <italic>H</italic> )-ones (2) compound did not show significant inhibitory potency on hCA I, hCA II, and AChE enzymes with the highest Ki and IC50 values. Conversion of compound 2 which has oxazole-5(4H)-ones main skeleton to open-chain sulfonamide-based compounds 3aâ€“g led to an increase in the enzyme inhibitory potency in the compounds. It can be expressed here that acid-catalyzed ring opening reaction led to having more potent bioactive compounds. So, benzamide moieties may cause an increase in bioactivity with all enzymes.
