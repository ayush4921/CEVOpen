<p>The compounds 3a–g were reported for the first time with their enzyme inhibitory potencies on hCA I, hCA II, and AChE enzymes (Table). Our results indicated that 3a–g had effective inhibition profiles against slow cytosolic isoform hCA I, and cytosolic dominant rapid isoenzyme hCA II with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range 4.07 ± 0.38 – 29.70 ± 3.18 nM, and 10.68 ± 0.98 – 37.16 ± 7.55 nM, respectively by considering Ki values. On the other hand, acetazolamide (AZA) which is used as a clinical drug had Ki values of 30.74 ± 3.52 nM on hCA I, and 22.27 ± 1.56 nM on hCA II. Ki values of the cycylic compound 2 were 50.34 ± 1.59 nM (hCA I) and 62.54 ± 11.51 nM (hCA II).</p>
