<p>Sulfamethazine-bearing compound 3g was the most effective inhibitor on hCA I isoenzyme, while sulfanilamide-bearing compound 3c was the most effective toward hCA II isoenzyme in terms of Ki values. The compounds 3a (1.7), 3c (4.8), 3d (3.3), 3e (3.8), 3f (2.7), and 3g (7.5) toward hCA I and 3a (1.2), 3b (1.8), 3c (2.1), 3d (1.3), and 3g (1.5) toward hCA II were more potent than AZA based on Ki values.</p>
