<p>One of the diseases that affects elderly people is Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) which is a neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive dementia [5,6]. Moreover, it is a global economic and social burden. According to the World Alzheimer Report, it is estimated that there will be around 131.5 million cases by 2050 [7]. Some of the pathologies of AD are the loss of cholinergic neurons and a decreasing amount of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in synapses. Cholinesterases [acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)] have a crucial role in the process of AD that regulates synaptic levels of Ach [8]. Cholinergic hypothesis was the first approach to explain the symptoms of AD. While AChE levels in the brain reduce, the activity of BuChE either does not change, or in some cases increases. Therefore, inhibiting AChE activity could be a beneficial pathway as a disease-modifying aspect [9,10]. AChE inhibitors are the most used medication in the treatment of AD which act as irreversible or reversible inhibitors. While donepezil and galantamine are reversible inhibitors, rivastigmine is a pseudo-irreversible inhibitor. Current treatments used in the clinic unfortunately cannot prevent the progression of AD but they can temporarily relieve symptoms, or decelerate the progress. Even though some valuable progress has been made in the treatment of AD, we still urgently need to find out more selective and effective antiAD drugs with less side effects than the ones available on the market [11].</p>
