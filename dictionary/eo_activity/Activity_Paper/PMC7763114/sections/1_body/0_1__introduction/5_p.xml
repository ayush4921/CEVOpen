<p>Different kinds of zinc binding compounds have been recognized as compounds targeting CAs [20]. Sulfonamides are powerful CAs inhibitors which show their activity by binding in an anion form with the zinc ion at the active site of the enzyme [21]. Primary and secondary sulfonamide and their analogs show significant CAs inhibitory potency. The most popular CAs inhibitors used in clinics for decades are acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dorzolamide, and brinzolamide [21â€“23]. In addition, sulfonamide derivatives are also known to have a wide-range of bioactivities, such as diuretic, antiglaucoma, anticancer, and antioxidant. Their significant pharmacological activities have also led to the design of new attractive candidates to be evaluated in clinical studies [22,24].</p>
