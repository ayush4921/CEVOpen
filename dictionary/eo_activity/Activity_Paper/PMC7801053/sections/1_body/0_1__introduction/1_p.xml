<p>Melanin is a pigment that is essential for protecting human skin against UV radiation. However, the abnormal accumulation of melanin induced skin pigmentation disorders. Melanogenesis is a complex process to produce melanin under control of tyrosinase. Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a binuclear copper-containing monooxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of phenol to the corresponding

Hydroquinone, arbutin, kojic acid, azelaic acid, L-ascorbic acid, ellagic acid, and tranexamic acid are commercial tyrosinase inhibitors, which have been used as skin-whitening agents, but these compounds have certain drawbacks [
