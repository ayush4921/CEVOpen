<p>Tyrosinase has four possible oxidation states (
 <italic>deoxy</italic>-, 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-, 
 <italic>met</italic>-, and 
 <italic>deact</italic>-form) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 
 <italic>Met</italic>-tyrosinase, having a hydroxy and the two Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in the binding site, is responsible for the oxidation of catechols. In this oxidizing process, 
 <italic>met</italic>-tyrosinase is reduced to 
 <italic>deoxy</italic>-tyrosinase which rapidly binds dioxygen to give 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase form. 
 <italic>Oxy</italic>-tyrosinase, which is the primary form of the enzyme, oxidizes both phenols and catechols to 
 <italic>o</italic>-quinones by the monooxygenase and oxidase mechanisms, respectively. In the active site of 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase, two bound Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions and the peroxide group play a catalytic oxidation role. Mushroom tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), which was used in the inhibitory assay, plays the same role with respect to 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase form. Thus, in this study, the molecular docking studies of 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, and 
 <bold>8</bold>, respectively, with 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase (PDB ID : 1WX2) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were carried out to explore their interactions and inhibition mechanisms.
