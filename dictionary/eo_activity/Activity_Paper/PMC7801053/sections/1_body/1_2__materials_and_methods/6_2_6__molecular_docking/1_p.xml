<p>Docking studies of 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, and the positive reference (kojic acid) were performed with Molecular Operating Environment 2016 (MOE 2016.0802) suite. The structures of these compounds were constructed by using the Builder module. Subsequently, all compounds were minimized up to 0.0001 gradients using the Amber12 : EHT force field. The crystal structure of the 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase was taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1WX2). The caddie protein (ORF378) and water molecules were removed. The enzyme structure was prepared using the QuickPrep module. The binding site was determined based on the PLB (Propensity for Ligand Binding) score in the Site Finder module. The molecular docking was performed by Dock module, using Triangle Matcher placement, Induced Fit refinement, London dG, and GBVI/WSA dG scoring methods. Five top poses showed up based on the negative binding free energy value (
 <italic>S</italic> value). The best pose was selected to analyze the receptor-ligand interactions by using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2016.
