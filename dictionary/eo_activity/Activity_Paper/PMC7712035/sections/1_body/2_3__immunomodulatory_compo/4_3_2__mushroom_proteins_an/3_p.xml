<p>Similarly, a large number FIPs have been identified. The FIP names, the medicinal mushrooms that produce them, and evidence for their specific immunomodulatory effects are presented in 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00269-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Among these, the best known is probably Ling-Zhi-8 from 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> which acts as an immunosuppressive agent [

In addition, aside from immunomodulation, many FIPs have also shown antitumor activities in pharmacological tests, including the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, the induction of apoptosis and autophagy, and the reduction of invasion and migration of tumor cells. At present, most of these tests are conducted using tissue cultures. Further tests using animal models and clinical trials are needed in order to confirm their safety and efficacy in humans. If confirmed, these FIPs could be more efficiently produced and commercialized through genetic engineering for clinical use.
