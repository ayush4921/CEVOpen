<p>Among the bioactive compounds derived from mushrooms with immunomodulatory activity, those based on polysaccharides, with or without side chain modifications (including polysaccharopeptides and polysaccharide proteins) are the most reported during the last several decades [

 <xref rid="jof-06-00269-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents a list of polysaccharides from medicinal mushrooms that have shown immunomodulatory activities. Among the reported polysaccharides with immunomodulatory and antitumor activities, the best-known is lentinan, isolated from shiitake (
 <italic>L. edodes</italic>), as well as schizophyllan from 
 <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic>. Both lectinan and schizophyllan contain β-1,3-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans with β-1,6 branches. Specifically, lentinan showed immunomodulatory properties against gastric cancer while schizophyllan was effective against head and neck cancer. Both products have been licensed and approved in Japan since 1986 for clinical use, in combination with chemotherapy against the two respective cancers [
