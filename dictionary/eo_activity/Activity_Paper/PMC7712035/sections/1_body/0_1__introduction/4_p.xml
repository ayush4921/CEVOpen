<p>Different MMs contain different functional components that may impact the same or different immunomodulatory pathways at varying efficacies. In the following sections, we first provide a brief description of the known MMs. We then summarize the diversity, structure, function, and molecular mechanism of action of functional ingredients from MMs that have shown to be involved in immunomodulation. We finish by briefly describing how genomics can accelerate research on medicinal mushrooms.</p>
