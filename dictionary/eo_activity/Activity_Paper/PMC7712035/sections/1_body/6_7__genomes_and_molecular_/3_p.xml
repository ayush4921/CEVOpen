<p>At present, most of the genes and metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of immunomodulators in the categories of polysaccharides, lectins, and terpenoids in medicinal mushrooms have not been identified or confirmed. However, the availability of increasing genomic resources coupled with the broad pharmacological activities and therapeutic effects of medicinal mushrooms should help facilitate the identification of genes and metabolic pathways involved in their biosynthesis. Such understandings could help future productions of those compounds through biotechnology using surrogate hosts.</p>
