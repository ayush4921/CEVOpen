<p>Terpenes and terpenoids are widely distributed in mushrooms. They are a large and diversified group of organic compounds but share the core of isoprene five-carbon atom units of molecular formula (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>)n as the main building block (

 <italic>G. lingzhi</italic>. These triterpenoids can help reduce drug nephrotoxicity and minimize inflammation.

 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> and 
 <italic>G. lingzhi</italic>, including ganodermic and ganoderic acids, ganoderals, ganoderols, ganodermanontriol, lucidone, and ganodermanondiol. All these compounds have shown immunomodulating, antitumor, and/or anti-infective activities [
