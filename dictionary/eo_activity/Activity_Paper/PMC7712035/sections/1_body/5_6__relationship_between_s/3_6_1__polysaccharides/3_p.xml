<p>Aside from the main-chain structure and branching pattern, the conformation of polysaccharides can also impact their bioactivity, e.g., by influencing the stability of the structure. In polysaccharides, the triple helix conformation is usually more stable than other conformations and bears the cytokine stimulating activity of the Î²-
