<p>Chemical modification is an effective and common approach to increase biological activities of polysaccharides. This approach has been applied to develop a number of effective immunomodulators from mushroom polysaccharides. Those modifications include carboxymethylation, hydroxylation, formyl-methylation, amino-ethylation, or sulfation. The introduction of such chemical groups may increase the possible contacts between the modified polysaccharides and the immune cell receptors through hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic attraction, and thus increase the immunological response. For example, the sulfated cell wall glucan from

Taken together, molecular weight, branching, chemical configuration, and chemical modification can all have strong influence on the bioactivity of polysaccharides from mushrooms.
