<p>The number and lengths of short branched chains in mushroom polysaccharides can significantly influence their bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B155-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. In most cases, the bioactive immunomodulator polysaccharides are characterized by a main chain of 1,3-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucan with a small number of short branched chains with 1,6-β-linkage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00269-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Studies have shown that immunologically active polysaccharides generally have a degree of branching number (DB) between 20% and 40%. For example, lentinan has a DB number of 40%, schizophyllan of 33%, and PSK of 20%. While a high DB number is generally correlated with a high activity, in some cases, debranching of polysaccharides can also increase their bioactivity. For example, the partially debranched form of pachymaran from 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> showed greater activity than the original native form [
 <xref rid="B158-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Even in the well-studied lentinan, its maximal immunomodulating and antitumor activities were achieved when the molecule had a DB of 32% [
 <xref rid="B159-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>], and there was a negative correlation between their biological activity and DB number between 32 and 40% [
