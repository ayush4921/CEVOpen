<p>The number of severe 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections is on the rise, which is concerning due to their virulence, ability to survive in extreme environments, and resistance to antifungal agents (
 <xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">Paramythiotou et al., 2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species can cause a wide variety of infections ranging from mild to severe, such as candidemia which has a mortality rate up to 38% in immunosuppressed patients (i.e., organ transplantation patients, patients under chemotherapy, HIV-infected, and diabetic) (

 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira Santos et al., 2018</xref>). The rate of fungal infections, including candidiasis, can reach 20% in the intensive care unit and antifungal medications including azoles, echinocandins, fluoropyrimidines, and polyenes are typically used to treat these infections. However, determining the appropriate dose for treatment is challenging when considering their side effects (

 <italic>Candida</italic> is deuteromycetes fungi and belongs to the Cryptococcaceae family, with up to 200 species. There are thirty species most commonly isolated in human infections including

 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic>,
