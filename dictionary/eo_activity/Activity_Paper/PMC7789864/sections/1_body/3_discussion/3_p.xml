<p>We found that MIC showed that the ethanol extracts of VA-C were relatively higher than water and methanol. MIC values were between 12.5 µg/ml and 25 µg/ml for ethanol and represented a dilution of 4 and 3, respectively. For water and methanol the MIC values are specified at 25 µg/ml which represents dilution 3. Our results are similar to those of 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Keikha et al. (2018)</xref> who also found that the ethanol extract of VA-C was more effective than the aqueous extract when the MIC values of ethanol against isolates of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species were between 0.78 µg/ml and 1.56 µg/ml, which represent dilution 7 and 8, respectively. The values of the aqueous extract were between 6.25 µg/ml and 1.562 µg/ml, which represent dilutions of 5 and 7, respectively.
