<p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) had proved potential bactericidal, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory activities that were suggested as a promising solution to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [

The ability of these plant extracts to mediate the conversion of Ag ions to AgNPs might be due to the rich content of different biologically active compounds such as flavones, ketones, aldehydes, amides, carboxylic acids, proteins, DNA, and enzymes that mediate the reduction process of Ag ions to AgNPs [
