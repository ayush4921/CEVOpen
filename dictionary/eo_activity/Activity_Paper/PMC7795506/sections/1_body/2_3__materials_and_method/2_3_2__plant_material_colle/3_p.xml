The capillary-gas chromatography /mass spectrometry, GC-2010 (SHIMADZU corp., Kyoto, Japan) supplied with 30 m Rtx-5MS capillary column of 0.25 mm in diameter and film thickness of 0.25 μm with helium, as a carrier gas, and a maximum temperature of 280 °C. The isolated compounds were identified by the commercial libraries of the The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) research library [
