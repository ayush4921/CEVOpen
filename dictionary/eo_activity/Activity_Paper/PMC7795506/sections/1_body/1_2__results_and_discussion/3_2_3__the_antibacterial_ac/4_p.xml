<p>In the current study, the antibacterial activity of the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> was limited and unclear compared to the ethanolic extract. The antibacterial activity had been studied previously for different types of herbs and medicinal plants organic extracts compared to water extracts. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> showed a significant antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus, S. aureus, E.</italic> coli, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> where the water extract was only effective against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Previous studies showed that the methanolic and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Matricaria pubescens</italic>, unlike water extract, induced a large inhibition zone against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and Methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with 50% growth inhibition [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] due to the higher contents of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in these extracts. Thus, the current study suggested a potential antibacterial impact of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> aerial parts.
