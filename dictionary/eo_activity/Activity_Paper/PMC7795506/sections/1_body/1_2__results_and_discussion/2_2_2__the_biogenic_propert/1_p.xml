<p>In the current study, the constructed AF-AgNPs molecules were built up by the combination of the plant extract with AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>, which produced a colorless solution, upon subjecting to the day sunlight for 30 min, the color had changed to light yellow and turned into dark brown or reddish-brown at the end of the incubation period, as shown in
