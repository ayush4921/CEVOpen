<p>FT-IR is one of the most important techniques to measure the high-resolution spectral data including the absorption or emission wavelengths of a synthesized compound [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The potential phytoconstituents of the plant extract, with and without silver nanoparticles, were identified by FT-IR. In the current study, the ability of the tested plant extract to react with silver ions to constitute the AF-AgNPs was revealed, as shown in
