<p>Malaria, a very common disease globally with a high mortality rate, is caused by 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, a parasitic organism [

 <xref rid="B124-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The parasite gets into the human body through the bites of infected mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B127-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. It is one of the deadliest diseases in the world [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], as it is estimated that every 2 min, a child dies of malaria, and each year more than two hundred million new cases of the disease are reported [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Most of the people who die from the disease are young children in Africa. The effects of cordycepin on the malaria parasite in mice were first studied by Trigo et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]; they suggested that the growth of the parasite was affected by cordycepin that affects the nucleic acid and protein synthesis of the parasite. This makes cordycepin a possible molecule which can be explored further as a probable anti-malarial agent.
