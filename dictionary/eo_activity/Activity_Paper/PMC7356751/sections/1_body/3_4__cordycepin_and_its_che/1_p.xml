 <sub>3</sub>, molecular weight 251.24 Da, melting point 228–231 °C) is chemically (9-(3-deoxy-β-D-ribofuranosyl) adenine), 3’–deoxyadenosine [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The structure of cordycepin consists of a purine molecule attached to one ribose sugar moiety [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The NMR spectrum of cordycepin shows a singlet at 3.4 ppm, attributed to the C-H proton and a -NH
 <sub>2</sub> peak reported to be present at 4.6 ppm, whereas, the peaks due to the different -OH groups are found to in the 8–8.5 ppm range [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The concentration of cordycepin in 
 <italic>C. militaris</italic>, i.e., around 2–3 mg/kg, is very low compared to the needs of the commercial market, therefore various synthetic and semi-synthetic methods have been reported for the preparation of cordycepin [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Cordycepin can be synthesized chemically by replacing an OH group with an H group at the 3′-position of the ribofuranosyl moiety to produce an adenosine analogue [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Cordycepin is found to be structurally very similar to adenosine except for the lack of a 3′-hydroxyl group [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] Due to its very close structural similarity with adenosine, it is considered to be a very potent bioactive component with essential properties for its nutraceutical applications. There are various reports suggesting that cordycepin competitively inhibits the courses of synthesis and metabolism of DNA and RNA, as well as it affects the activity of adenosine deaminase and the mTOR signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, cordycepin has been reported to have a wide variety of pharmacological actions such as antioxidant, immunological, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, and hypoglycemic properties [
