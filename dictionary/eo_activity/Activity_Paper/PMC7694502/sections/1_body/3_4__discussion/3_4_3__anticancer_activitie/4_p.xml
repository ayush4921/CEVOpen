<p>The effect of related plants showed efficient effects against breast and prostate cancer. In fact, extract from 
 <italic>T.</italic> persicum was reported to inhibit PC-3 prostate cancer cells proliferation [

 <italic>T.</italic> capitatum and 
 <italic>T.</italic> creticum were effective against MCF-7 breast cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B102-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>T.</italic> romasissimun and has an anticancer potential by inhibiting K562 proliferation [
 <xref rid="B103-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Nevertheless, the reported IC50 values were different, and that could be related to the area from which the plant has been collected and/or the cancer cell types. However, it is well known that 
 <italic>T.</italic> polium extract may also potentiate the apoptotic effects of some anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and vinblastine on several cancer cell lines, including Saos-2, A431, SW480, and Skmel-3 [
 <xref rid="B104-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Further preclinical investigations concerning the in vivo anticancer effects on Walker 256/B, MatLyLu, and other cancer types might be of potential interests to confirm the protective effect of 
 <italic>T.</italic> polium and its possibility to contribute to the discovery of new drug products to treat cancer.
