<p>According to our result, terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, are the most abundant compound class in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> aerial parts as defined by the HR-LCMS technique. Among the identified compounds (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), many secondary metabolites with known antioxidants and anticancer activities belong to different classes of bioactive molecules, including isoprenoid, fatty acids, amino fatty acids, amino alcohols, glycerolipids, amino sugars, phenol, alkaloids, flavanol, small peptides, etc. [

 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry is a very sensitive method, which can identify many new compounds. Indeed, Aghakhani et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] isolated twenty-two new flavonoid compounds that were first reported for 
 <italic>Phlomis</italic> species. Our results are in agreement with previous studies that indicated that the 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic> genus contains different classes of phytoconstituents such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], polyphenols, flavonoids [

 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and fatty acid esters [

 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Moreover, flavonoids are polyphenols that are detected in medicinal plants with a wide variety of biological activities [
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Many previous studies have described the presence of various flavonoids such as apigenin, luteolin, rutin, cirsiliol, cirsimaritin, salvigenin, and eupatorin in the roots, aerial parts, and inflorescences of the plant [

 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, one intermediate in the biosynthetic pathways of alkaloids, iridoid glycoside (Harpagoside), was also detected [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This compound has been detected in a wide variety of plants and in some animals. Furthermore, two iridoid glycosides, teucardoside and teuhircoside, from the hydrophilic fraction of 
 <italic>T. polium var. pilosum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. polium var. Alba</italic> were isolated [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Elmasri et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] isolated iridoid and phenylethanol glycosides and a monoterpenoid from the areal part of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>. It was reported that 3′,4′,5trihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-flavone exhibited an inhibition of the biofilm-forming strain 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It was reported by Sharififar et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] that the methanolic extract of the areal part of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> contains four major flavonoids where rutin and apigenin were found to be the most active fractions as radical scavengers. In 2018, Özer et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] used the LC-MS/MS method to analyze compounds and to investigate the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> L. in decoction and infusion. Among the secondary metabolites, polyphenols represent an interesting class that have biological activities such as antioxidant and anticancer [

 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Moreover, flavonoids, another secondary metabolites class, are widely produced by plants to fight against biotic and abiotic aggression. It has been well demonstrated that this compounds exhibited antioxidant and anticancer activities [

 <xref rid="B70-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The degree of polymerization and the differences arising from hydroxyl group substitutions makes this class of metabolites very large, with about 4000 different compounds [
