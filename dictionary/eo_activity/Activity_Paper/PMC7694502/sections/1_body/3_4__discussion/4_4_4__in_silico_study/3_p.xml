<p>Our results indicated that our selected compounds displaying the lowest binding energies share a higher number of common residues with the active sites of receptor 1E3G having the corresponding interacting residues, LEU 701, LEU 704, ASN 705, LEU 707, GLY 708, GLN 711, TRP 741, MET742, MET 745, VAL 746, MET 749, ARG 752, PHE 764, MET 780, MET787, LEU 873, PHE 876, THR 877, LEU 880, MET 895, and ILE 899. The docking results were well supported by those in vitro showing that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract can be a new potential resource of natural antioxidant and anticancer compounds.
