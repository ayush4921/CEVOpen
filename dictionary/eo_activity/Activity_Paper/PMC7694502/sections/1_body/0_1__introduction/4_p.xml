<p>The main objective of the present study was to investigate the phytochemical composition of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract using the HR-LCMS technique, the bioactive class of compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, tanninsâ€¦), and its antioxidant properties using four test systems. The antitumor effect was tested against two malignant cell lines: MatLyLu and Walker 256/B. The computational approach was used to confirm the antioxidant and anticancer activities of the identified compounds targeting the human peroxiredoxin 5 enzyme and human androgen/progesterone receptors.
