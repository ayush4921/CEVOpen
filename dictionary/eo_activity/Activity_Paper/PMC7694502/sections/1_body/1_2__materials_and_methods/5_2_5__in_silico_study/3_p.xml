<p>The re-docking of the original ligand into the active site of the three tested target proteins are well reproduced with RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) values of 0.72, 1.14, and 0.651 Ã…, respectively, for peroxiredoxin 5 receptor, human progesterone receptor, and human androgen receptor. A stepwise molecular docking study was reported in previous study [
