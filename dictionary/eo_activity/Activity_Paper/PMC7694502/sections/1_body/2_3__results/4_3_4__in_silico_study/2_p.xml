<p>All the complexes formed between the composition of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01089-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and the active residues of Peroxiredoxin 5 have negative binding energies, which may explain the potent antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract. The band energies of the stable complexes range from −8.06 to −2.01 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. According to the molecular docking results, the amino sugar 13 showed the lowest binding energy (−8.06 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>), and thus, the highest antioxidant activity was well fitted into the binding cavity of human peroxiredoxin 5. This amino sugar forms five strong hydrogen bonding with amino acids ALA A42, THR A44, THR A147, GLY A46, and CYS A47 at distances of 2.04, 2.88, 2.54, 3.11, and 2.81Å, respectively (
