<p>Virus fluorescence labeling was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019c</xref>). Purified SGIV particles were incubated with dye Cy5 at room temperature for 2 h with gentle vortexing. The unbound dye was removed and washed by three high-speed centrifugations at 42,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 1 h. Cy5-labeled SGIV (Cy5-SGIV) pellets were suspended in PBS and passed through 0.22-μm-pore-size filters and examined by transmission electron microscopy.
