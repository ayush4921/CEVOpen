<p>The cells and the culture medium in each well were collected for total RNA extraction. Total RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA with ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). SGIV infection was identified by detecting SGIV MCP and viral envelope protein (VP19) transcripts with RT-qPCR, as previously described (
