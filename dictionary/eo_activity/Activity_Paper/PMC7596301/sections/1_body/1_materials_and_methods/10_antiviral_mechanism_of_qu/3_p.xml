<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into the host cells were further analyzed by LSCM. For live-cell fluorescent imaging, GS cells in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes were infected with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) at 4°C for 30 min. After having been washed twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 28°C for 2 h. GS cells incubated with Cy5-SGIV only (MOI = 1) served as the control group. After having been washed with serum-free, phenol-red-free medium, their fluorescence was further detected by LSCM.</p>
