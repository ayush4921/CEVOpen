<p>GS cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 28°C for 24 h and then incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) in 100 μl L15 medium at 28°C for 48 h. Normal GS cells without quercetin incubation served as the control group. Then, 10 μl of CCK-8 solution (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was added to the cells at 28°C for 4 h. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured by the ELISA plate reader (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Results are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.</p>
