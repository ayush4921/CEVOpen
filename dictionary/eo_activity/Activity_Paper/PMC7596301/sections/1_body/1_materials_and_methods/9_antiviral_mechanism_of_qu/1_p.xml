<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were first analyzed by RT-qPCR. GS cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at 28°C for 24 h. Quercetin (50 μg/ml) was incubated with GS cells at 4°C for 30 min. The culture supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed twice with L15. Cells were incubated with SGIV (MOI = 0.1) at 4°C for 30 min and then washed twice with L15. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 12 hpi were collected for total RNA extraction and SGIV infection detection by RT-qPCR. GS cells infected with SGIV only (MOI = 0.1) served as the control group.</p>
