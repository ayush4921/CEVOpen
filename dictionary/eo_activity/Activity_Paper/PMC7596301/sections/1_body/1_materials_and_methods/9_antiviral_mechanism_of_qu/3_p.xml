<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were further analyzed by LSCM. For live-cell fluorescent imaging, GS cells in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (Cellvis, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China) were incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min. Then, Cy5-labeled SGIV (Cy5-SGIV, MOI = 1) was added to the cells at 4°C for 30 min. After having been washed with serum-free, phenol-red-free medium, their fluorescence was detected by LSCM. GS cells infected with Cy5-SGIV only (MOI = 1) served as the control group.</p>
