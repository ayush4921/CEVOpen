<p>Medicinal plants have been applied to treat numerous diseases for thousands of years and are being increasingly used in aquaculture (

Medicinal plants are known as “green medicine,” with some advantages over chemically synthesized medicines: (1) medicinal plants provide eco-friendly compounds for replacing antibiotics, (2) medicinal plants are used in different forms, including aqueous extracts, ethanol extracts, and active ingredients, which could serve as immunostimulants to prevent and control pathogens; furthermore, medicinal plants at different concentrations and through different ways, such as injection or immersion or oral administration, could cause various levels of immune stimulation, (3) medicinal plants have positive effects on cultured fish, including increasing digestive enzyme activities, stimulation of growth, weight gain, early maturation, and meat quality, and (4) medicinal plants could obviously inhibit pathogens (bacteria, virus, and parasite) and medicinal plants with immunostimulatory and antiviral properties applied in aquaculture have attracted increasing attention (

There have been about 300 flavonoids and more than 20 triterpenoids isolated from licorice, which possess many pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, antiviral, and antitumor activities (
