<p>Fish cell lines serve as alternatives to experimental animals and have been widely used to evaluate the toxicity (

The cytoskeleton is an interconnected network of filamentous polymers and regulatory proteins composed of different types of actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. The cytoskeleton is responsible for cell shape, whole-cell motility, and cell organelle motility, thus playing an important role in various cell functions. Cytoskeleton defects, including alterations in microtubule stability, in axonal transport, and in actin dynamics, have been characterized in diseased cells (

Spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection could induce the collapse of the cytoskeletal fiber system, ring-shape structures, and filament depolymerization (
