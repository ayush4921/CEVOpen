  <p>Quercetin at working concentration exhibited no cytotoxic effects. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Grouper spleen (GS) cells were incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) for 24 h and observed under a light microscope. GS cells incubated with quercetin kept a normal growth. Scale bar: 100 μm. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The cell viability of GS cells was incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) using the CCK-8 solution. Quercetin (50 μg/ml) displayed no significant cytotoxic effects. 
   <italic>NS</italic> indicates no statistical significance. 
   <bold>(C–E)</bold> Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-vimentin, anti-cytokeratin, and anti-fibronectin antibodies were applied to observe the cytoskeleton. Compared with cells in the control group, the cytoskeleton of cells incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) was kept normal. Scale bar: 50 μm.
