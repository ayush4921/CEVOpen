  <p>Inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into host cells. 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> The inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into host cells were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Test group: SGIV-infected cells at 0–2 hpi treated with quercetin; control group: SGIV-infected cells without quercetin treatment. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 12 hpi were collected for RT-qPCR analysis. The levels of viral MCP 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and viral envelope protein 
   <bold>(B)</bold> gene expression in the test group were lower than those in the control group. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into host cells were proven by flow cytometry analysis. After having been incubated with Cy5-SGIV [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1] at 4°C for 30 min, the cells were treated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 28°C for 2 h. Cells infected with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) alone served as the control group. The cells in each group were then digested in protease K and collected for flow cytometry analysis. Compared to the control group, the fluorescence signals of Cy5 on cells of the test group decreased obviously. It proved that quercetin had inhibitory effects on SGIV invading into host cells (

   <bold>(D)</bold> Quercetin’s effects on SGIV invading into host cells were further identified by LSCM. The LSCM observation results were consistent with the flow cytometry results, which showed that the fluorescence signals of Cy5 in the cells of the test group decreased obviously. Scale bar: 50 μm.
