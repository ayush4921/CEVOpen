  <p>Inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV replication in host cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Test group: SGIV-infected cells at 2 hpi treated with quercetin at 28Â°C for 10 h; control group: SGIV-infected cells without quercetin treatments. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The levels of viral MCP and VP19 gene expression in the cells of test groups decreased obviously. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV replication in host cells were proved by virus titer analysis. Compared to the control group, quercetin could significantly reduce virus titers. It suggested that SGIV replication in host cells could be inhibited by quercetin (
