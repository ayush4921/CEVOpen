  <p>Quercetin had damaging effects on SGIV particles. GS cells incubated with quercetin-treated SGIV served as the test group, and cells infected with SGIV alone served as the control group. Compared to the control group, the levels of viral MCP 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and viral envelope protein 
   <bold>(B)</bold> gene expression in the test groupâ€™s cells were lower than those in the control group. It indicated that quercetin had damaging effects on SGIV particles (
