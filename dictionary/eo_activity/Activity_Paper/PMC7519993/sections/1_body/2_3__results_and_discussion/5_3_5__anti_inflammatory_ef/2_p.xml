<p>Carrageenan-induced paw edema is due to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. The cyclooxygenase enzyme is directly involved in inflammation through prostaglandin production while lipoxygenase indirectly causes an inflammatory response [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, the anti-inflammatory power of methanolic and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> can be explained by an inhibitory action exerted on cyclooxygenases. The inhibition of cyclooxygenases may be due to the richness of methanolic and ethanolic extracts in polyphenolic constituents. Polyphenols prevent the formation of prostaglandins that cause inflammation [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Tannins and flavonoids also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect through their ability to inhibit the production of 5 proinflammatory mediators such as lipoxygenase, prostaglandins, cyclooxygenase, serotonin, histamines, and cytokines such as IL-8, TNF-
