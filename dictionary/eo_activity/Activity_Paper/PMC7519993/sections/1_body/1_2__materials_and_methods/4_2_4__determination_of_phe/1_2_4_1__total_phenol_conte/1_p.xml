<p>The total content of polyphenol is determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent protocol as described by Nounah et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. First, 0.5 mL of the extract is mixed with 2.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent diluted 1/10 with distilled water. Then, 4 mL of 7.5% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (w/v) is added, followed immediately by incubation for 30 min at 45°C. The spectrophotometric reading at 760 nm is taken against a blank. The calibration curve is performed with gallic acid at concentrations between 2.5 and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The total content of phenols is expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of extract (mg GAE/g E).
