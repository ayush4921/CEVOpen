<p>The acute toxicity study of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> extracts is evaluated on adult rats in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 423 guidelines [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. After a fasting period of 3-4 h, the body weight of each animal is measured to determine the dose to be administered orally, expressed as mg extract per kg body weight. The animals are arbitrarily divided into three groups of six rats (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). The first and second groups receive methanolic and ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> at doses of 300 and 2000 mg/kg, and the third group (control group) is given distilled water (control vehicle) orally. Signs of toxicity evaluated are general behavioral symptoms, changes in body weight, ingestion of water and food, respiration, convulsions, and mortality. They are assessed systematically for each group during the first few hours and then 14 days after treatment. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) is determined according to the protocol described in guidelines 423 [
