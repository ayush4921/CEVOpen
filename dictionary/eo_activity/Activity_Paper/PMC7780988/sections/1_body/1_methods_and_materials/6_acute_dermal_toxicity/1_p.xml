<p>Following the procedures elaborated in the OECD guideline number 434, the acute dermal toxicity testing was performed.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Accordingly, ten albino female rats (Rattus albus) (weight: 200–300g, age: 8–12 weeks) were selected and grouped randomly into five rats each for the test and control groups.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> After acclimatization of the rats for one week, the back furs of the rats were shaved and the 10% w/w extract ointment at a limit dose of 2000 mg/kg was applied to establish the acute dermal toxicity. Therefore, one rat was used initially to look for the development of any skin irritation or gross behavioral changes in the first 24 hours. Following this, the 10% w/w extract ointment was applied to the additional four rats and they were monitored for the development of any overt signs and symptoms of toxicity in the next few days up to the 14th day.
