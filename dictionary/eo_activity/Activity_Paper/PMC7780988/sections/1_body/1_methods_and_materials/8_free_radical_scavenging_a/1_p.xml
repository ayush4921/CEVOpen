<p>The antioxidant activity of the crude extract was determined by using diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay based on the methods described by Braca et al.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Different concentrations of 1 mL of the crude extract ranging from 12.5 to 200Âµg/mL were added to 3 mL of a 0.004% methanolic solution of DPPH. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm after 30 minutes, and the percent inhibition of DPPH was calculated. The percentage of free radical scavenging potential was determined by the formula: (A0- A1)/A0* 100, where A0 is the absorbance of the control and A1 is the absorbance of the extract/standard.
