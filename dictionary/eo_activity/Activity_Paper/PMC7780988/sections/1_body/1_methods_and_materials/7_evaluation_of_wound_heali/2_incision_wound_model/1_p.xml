<p>The animals were anesthetized as described in the excision model section and then, a 3 cm length, a linear- paravertebral incision was made through the full thickness of the skin on either side of the vertebral column at a distance of 1 cm from the midline. The incised skin was stitched with black braided silk (no. 00) at a 1cm interval.

The suture was removed on the 8th day, and the tensile strength was measured by using a constant water flow method on the 10th day using diethyl ether anesthesia.
