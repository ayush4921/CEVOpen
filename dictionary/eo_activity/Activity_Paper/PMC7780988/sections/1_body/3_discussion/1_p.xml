<p>Traditionally, the fresh or dry leaves of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> are crushed and tied onto the wound for its wound healing effect. Since the direct application of the extract into the affected part does not have a significant purpose for the intended time, ointment preparation of the extracts is essential to produce a prolonged wound healing effect. Besides, the addition of hard and white soft paraffin during the formulation of ointment base provides an occlusive barrier for moisture whereas wool fat and cetostearyl alcohol (thickeners) are used for the ointment stabilization effect.

 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This study, therefore, investigated the antioxidant and wound healing activity of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> leaf extract. Accordingly, the crude extract produced a promising antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent fashion and the maximum DPPH scavenging activity (74.85%) was seen at 200 Âµg/mL concentration.
