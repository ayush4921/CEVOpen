<p>In the incision model, a significant increase in tensile-strength was revealed in both 10% (by 36.80%) and 5% (by 32.23%) w/w extract ointments, as compared to their negative controls. The increase in tensile strength is associated with an increase in collagen production and maturation, matrix deposition, and cell migration, which are attributable to the potent antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities of the bioactive constituents as explained in various studies.
