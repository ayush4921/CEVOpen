 <italic>vulgare</italic> (OVV) (Kesan-Edirne, Turkey) and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic> hirtum</italic> (OVH) (Ermenek-Karaman, Turkey) were analysed by Sarikurkcu et al. for their inhibitory properties against the tyrosinase enzyme, which is responsible for melanin biosynthesis. The chemical composition of OVH was carried out by gas GC-FID and GC-MS techniques. The most abundant components were linalool (96.31%) and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene (1.27%). The anti-tyrosinase activity of the EOs was spectrophotometrically measured and the results were expressed as kojic acid equivalents (mgKAEs/g oil). 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> was the most potent inhibitor with 45.60 mg KAEs/g oil when compared to OVV (8.30 mg KAEs/g oil). It was reported that linalool-rich essential oils could inhibit [
