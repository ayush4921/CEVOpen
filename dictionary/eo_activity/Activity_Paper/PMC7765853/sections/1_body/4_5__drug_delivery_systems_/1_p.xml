<p>Due to its multiple pharmacological activities, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09653-f003">Figure 3</xref>, as reviewed above, but especially due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects, oregano essential oil can be used as natural alternative to synthetic drugs, being a promising candidate for therapy of various conditions with microbial, inflammatory and tumor etiology [

Although, nowadays oregano essential oil is frequently used in traditional medicine and several “Do It Yourself” recipes are available, there is a lack of pharmaceutical preparations containing this essential oil mainly because, like other volatile oils, its incorporation into pharmaceutical topical dosage forms, especially hydrophilic ones, being confronted to technological limitations. These constraints are determined by the hydrophobic, volatile, and reactive nature of oregano essential oil bioactive components [
