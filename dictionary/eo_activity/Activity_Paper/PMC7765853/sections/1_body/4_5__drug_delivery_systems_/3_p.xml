<p>Taleb et al. reported the development of a pharmaceutical oil-in water (O/W) nanoemulsion for dermal delivery of OEO to improve its poor water solubility and, thus, extending the application of OEO in aqueous formulations with antimicrobial activity useful in acne treatment. In this study, OEO was selected as active ingredient of the nanoemulsion, because among all tested EO, it exhibited the highest antimicrobial effect against acne-causing bacteria in vitro [

The obtained O/W nanoformulation presented a low size distribution indicated by a particle size of 39.54 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.285, and remained clear and stable for four weeks at ambient temperature, without any signs of cloudiness, creaming, or phase separation. Following in vivo epicutaneous application of the proposed OEO nanoemulsion on a standardized acne mouse model, both inflammation and bacterial load decreased significantly and the tissue healing was superior in comparison with the 2% erythromycin solution used as a positive control. Authors suggested that antibacterial effects of OEO, like those of other essential oils [
