<p>Relevant literature pertaining to antimalarial plants and their use in management of malaria and malarial symptoms in Kenya were sourced from Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Scientific Electronic Library Online from November 2019 to February 2020 following procedures previously used [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The searches were performed independently in all the databases. Key search words such as malaria, vegetal, traditional medicine, ethnobotany, alternative medicine, ethnopharmacology, antimalarial, quinine, chloroquine, antimalarial activity, antiplasmodial activity, malaria management, and Kenya were used. All publishing years were considered, and reports with information on antimalarial or medicinal plants in Kenya were carefully screened. Thus, references contained within the returned scientometric results were assessed concerning their inclusion in the study, and further searches were carried out at the Google search engine using more general search terms, to broaden the search, as follows: words: malaria, plants, plant extract, vegetal, vegetal species, vegetal extract, traditional medicine, alternative medicine, complementary therapy, natural medicine, ethnopharmacology, ethnobotany, herbal medicine, herb, herbs, decoction, infusion, macerate, concoction, malaria fever, malaria incidence, and Kenya were used. The last search was done on 15
 <sup>th</sup> February 2020. The search outputs were saved wherever possible on databases, and the author received notification of any new searches meeting the search criteria from Science Direct, Scopus, and Google scholar. For this study, only full-text original research articles published in peer-reviewed journals, books, theses, dissertations, patents, and reports on antimalarial plants or malaria phytotherapy in Kenya written in English and dated until February 2020 were considered.
