<p>Export of indigenous medicinal plants bring substantial foreign exchange to African countries such as Egypt [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], South Africa [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Despite the success of traditional practices and abundance of indigenous medicinal plants (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), antimalarial plants research in Kenya stops mostly on ethnobotanical surveys, with extensions limited to evaluation of crude extracts from plants against 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A gap is evident with regard to research geared towards identifying and isolating plant bioactive compounds and establishing the efficacy and safety of medicinal plants through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using human 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay involving higher animal models and randomized clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For example, the toxicity of 16,17-dihydrobrachycalyxolid isolated in 
 <italic>Vernonia brachycalyx</italic> has been reported to be due to its ability to inhibit the proliferation of phytohaemmaglutinin-treated human lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. A median inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 7.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml was reported, which is comparable to the median concentration obtained in the antiplasmodial assay by Oketch-Rabah et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To assess whether observed antiplasmodial activities are due to a specific or a general toxicity effect, the experimental selectivity index (SI) needs to be calculated for extracts and only a few studies in Kenya has attempted this [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is worth noting that there is always a variation in the degree of toxicity depending on the sensitivity of the animals, tissue, or cells used, type of extract, nature of the test substance, dose, and mode of administration. In this study, 38.8% (54/139) of the total plants were evaluated for their toxicities. Of these, 41 showed low cytotoxicity with LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Some of these plants such as 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic>, 
 <italic>Flueggea virosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>Schkuhria pinnata</italic> fortuitously showed good antimalarial activity. On the contrary, extracts of some plants used for malaria treatment with good activity are potentially toxic, for example, dichloromethane leaf extract of 
 <italic>Microglossa pyrifolia,</italic> methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Uvaria acuminata</italic> (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.37 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and petroleum ether leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina.</italic>
