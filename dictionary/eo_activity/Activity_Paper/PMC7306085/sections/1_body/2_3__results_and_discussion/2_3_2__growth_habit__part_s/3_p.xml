<p>Antimalarial remedies in Kenya are prepared by different methods. These include decoctions (70.5%), infusions (5.4%), ointments and steaming (1.3%), and roasting (0.3%). Preparation of antimalarial remedies from dry parts of one plant or several plants and ashes by using grinding stones was reported [

Fresh solid materials are eaten and chewed directly upon collection or after initial pounding/crushing. Dry plant materials are smoked and inhaled. These findings corroborate observations in other countries [
