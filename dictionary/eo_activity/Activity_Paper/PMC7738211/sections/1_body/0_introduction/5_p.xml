<p>Now-a-days, emergence of multiple drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic organisms, and corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are global concern (Ghosh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lakshmi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wahedi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) in addition to numerous obstacles encountered on delivery to the site of microbial infection. Many researchers are engaged to overcome these situations (Awual, 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Laws et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Matin, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sharavanan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, there is urgent need for establishment of new chemotherapeutic agents with novel mode of action to combat with these MDR organisms, and SARS CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2). In this regard as well as our continuous effort to find novel drugs (Matin,

 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Matin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) we report herein the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial efficacy of several uridine-based esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> with different aliphatic and aromatic chains against eleven pathogens, molecular docking against lanosterol 14α-demethylase (3LD6), 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (1R51) and corona virus (SARS CoV-2) main protease (Mpro; 7BQY) along with prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS). Also, attempts have been taken to optimize some acylated uridine derivatives to investigate their physicochemical behavior on the basis of DFT approach with cytotoxicity, and ADMET properties.
