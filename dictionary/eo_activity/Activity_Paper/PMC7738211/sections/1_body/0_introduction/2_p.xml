<p>Uridine (
 <bold>1</bold>), a natural and necessary nucleoside, is one of the four basic components of ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is a structural element of many bioactive compounds, and it has crucial role in the pyrimidine metabolism of the brain. Uridine and its nucleotide derivatives may also have an additional role in the function of the central nervous system as signaling molecules (Dobolyi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It has anti depression activity, asthmatic airway inflammation, hepatocyte proliferation (Carlezon et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Uridine has sleep-promoting and anti-epileptic effects, might affect mood, improves memory function and influences neuronal plasticity (Siegel et al., 2017). Uridine, sometimes, has been recognized as playing a role in preserving and enhancing hepatic mitochondrial function in the face of challenge by certain liver toxins (Banasch et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In addition, uridine (
 <bold>1</bold>) and some of its biological derivatives behave as antimetabolites, when their extracellular concentrations are higher than those physiological levels (Strasser et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al.,
