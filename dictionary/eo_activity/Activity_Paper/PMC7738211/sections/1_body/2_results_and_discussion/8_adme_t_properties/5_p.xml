<p>In the present study, we have checked the CYP enzymes, particularly isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, inhibitory activities which are responsible for about 90% oxidative metabolic reactions. Inhibition of CYP enzymes will lead to inductive or inhibitory failure of drug metabolism. These inhibitions of compound 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>â€“
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> were found similar to that of the standard drugs (
 <xref rid="t0009" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). In addition, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) revealed no violation with these uridine esters. PAINS are chemical compounds that often give false positive results in high-throughput screens. PAINS tend to react nonspecifically with numerous biological targets rather than specifically affecting one desired target. Many studies indicated the acute toxic effects of medicines on non-targeted organisms, and hence, the MTT, MTS and Resazurin assay methods are used to check the cytotoxic concentration of any new molecule (synthetic or natural) which gives an idea about the maximum nontoxic dose of the drug molecule. We hope to conduct such studies for the more drug related validation of these promising uridine compounds.
