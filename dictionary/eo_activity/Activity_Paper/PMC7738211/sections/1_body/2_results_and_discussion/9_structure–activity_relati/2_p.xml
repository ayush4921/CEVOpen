<p>It was observed that the most of the potential antifungal drugs (fluconazole; itraconazole; voriconazole; terbinafine) are designed to deter the activity of CYP51A1 enzyme to synthesize essential ergosterol (Matin, Chakraborty, et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Matin, Roshid, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). On the basis of our study, it could be thought that the effective uridine esters
