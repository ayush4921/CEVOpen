<p>Estimation of the feasible binding geometries and interactions between drugs and active site of proteins (Matin, Bhattacharjee, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Matin, Bhuiyan, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) is obtained from molecular docking (Ghosh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Molecular docking score of esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> along with standard antibiotic ampicillin (AMP) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. We calculated docking score (binding affinity) of 
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold>, as these chlorobenzoyl compounds showed promising antifungal activities, with lanosterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1) and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (1R51) while all the uridine esters were considered for COVID-19 main protease (7BQY). In addition, other uridine esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>12</bold> expressed, in average, somewhat lower docking score than 
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold> against CYP51A1 and 1R51.
