<p>It was evident from predication 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for uridine esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> showed 0.16 &lt; Pa &lt; 0.35 for antibacterial and 0.38 &lt; Pa &lt; 0.53 for antifungal. This clearly indicated that these compounds were more prone against fungi as compared to that of bacterial pathogens. Also, incorporation of mesyl groups, as in compound 
 <bold>6</bold>, totally abolished antifungal potentiality of uridine. Addition of aliphatic acyl chains (C2 to C16, compound 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>–
 <bold>12</bold>) increased antifungal activity (Pa = 0.526) of uridine (
 <bold>1</bold>, Pa = 0.421), whereas attachment of chloro-substituted benzoyl groups did not enhance reasonably (
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>, Pa = 0.389–0.436). We have also calculated anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant property of these compounds. Thus, PASS predication showed 0.46 &lt; Pa &lt; 0.67 for anti-carcinogenic and 0.13 &lt; Pa &lt; 0.43 for antioxidant, which indicated that the uridine esters were more potent as anti-carcinogenic agents than that of antioxidant properties. Interestingly, the results as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, antifungal and anti-carcinogenic properties of uridine esters with saturated aliphatic chains (
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>–
 <bold>12</bold>) were found more promising than the sulphonyl ester (
 <bold>6</bold>) or chloro-substituted benzoyl derivatives (
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>). These results are in agreement with our previous study for monosaccharide esters (Matin, Chakraborty, et al.,
