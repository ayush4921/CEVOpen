<p>Web-based PASS (

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Initially, structures of the uridine esters were drawn, and then, converted into their SD file formats which were used to predict biological spectrum using PASS online software. This program is designed to anticipate a plethora of biological activities with 90% accuracy. PASS results are designated as Pa (probability for active compound) and Pi (probability for inactive compound). Being probabilities, the Pa and Pi values vary from 0.000 to 1.000 and in general, Pa + Pi ≠ 1, since these probabilities are calculated independently. Only the activities with Pa &gt; Pi are considered as possible for a particular drug. The PASS prediction results were interpreted and used in a flexible manner, viz. (i) when Pa &gt; 0.7, the chance to find the activity experimentally is high, (ii) if 0.5 &lt; Pa &lt; 0.7, the chance to find the activity experimentally is less, but the compound is probably not so similar to known pharmaceutical agents and (iii) if Pa &lt; 0.5, the chance to find the activity experimentally is less, but the chance to find a structurally. So, the predicted activity of spectrum of a drug is known as its intrinsic property.
