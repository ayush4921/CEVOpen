<p>The 3D crystal structure of main protease of COVID-19 (7BQY), lanosterol 14α-demethylase (3LD6/CYP51A1) and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (1R51) was obtained in pdb format from online protein data bank (PDB) database (Lucido et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). All hetero atoms, inhibitors and water molecules were erased using PyMol (version 1.3) software packages. Energy minimization of the protein implemented by Swiss-Pdb viewer software (version 4.1.0) (Matin, Chakraborty, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Matin, Hasan, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Matin, Roshid, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The optimized structures were subjected for molecular docking study against 7BQY, CYP51A1 and 1R51 considering the protein as macromolecule and uridine esters as ligand. Finally, rigid docking simulation was performed by PyRx software (version 0.8) targeting the active site with the center grid box size 48.8375, 65.6838, 59.1841 Å for 7BQY; 61.8544, 61.1656, 70.6697 Å for 3LD6; and 58.4699, 69.9558, 58.3507 Å for 15R1 along 
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic> and 
 <italic>z</italic> directions, respectively. After docking, Accelrys Discovery Studio (version 4.1) software was utilized to analyze and visualize the docking results (Wahedi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Docking results are basically calculated as binding affinities of ligand-protease and reported in kcal/mol unit.
