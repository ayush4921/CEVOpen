  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed for a population-based survey on medicinal plants. The data were collected (May 2018 to May 2019) using semi-structured face-to-face interviews in independent pharmacies, hospital centers and primary care health centers in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. The survey had 18 multiple choice and open-ended questions. Quantitative indices were calculated: Fidelity Level (FL), Use Value (UV) and Informants Consensus Factor (ICF). Chi-square test was used for data analysis.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">Five hundred forty-three people were interviewed. The majority of the participants (89.6%) have used medicinal plants to treat health disorders in the past 12 months, mainly for digestive problems, sleep disorders and central nervous system diseases. A total of 78 plants were recorded, being 
   <italic>Matricaria recutita</italic>, 
   <italic>Valeriana officinalis</italic>, 
   <italic>Tilia</italic> spp. and 
   <italic>Aloe vera</italic> the most used. The highest UV was found for 
   <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> (UV 0.130) followed by 
   <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (UV 0.097) and 
   <italic>Vaccinium macrocarpon</italic>. (UV 0.080). The highest FL values were for 
   <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp. (FL 90.47%) for respiratory conditions and, 
   <italic>Matricaria recutita</italic> (85.55%) and 
   <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> (84.09%) for digestive problems. The highest ICF corresponded to metabolism and depression (ICF = 1), pain (ICF = 0.97), insomnia (ICF = 0.96) and anxiety (ICF = 0.95). Participants mostly acquired herbal medicines from pharmacies, herbal shops and supermarkets. Some side effects (tachycardia, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms) and potential interactions medicinal plants-drugs (

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Many inhabitants of the Autonomous Community of Madrid currently use herbal products to treat minor health problems. The most common consumer pattern are young women between 18 and 44 years of age with higher education. In order to confirm the pattern, further research should be focused to investigate current uses of medicinal plants in other Spanish regions.</p>
