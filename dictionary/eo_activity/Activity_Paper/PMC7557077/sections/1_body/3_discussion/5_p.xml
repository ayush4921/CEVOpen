<p id="Par41">It is necessary to emphasize that some of the medicinal plants consumed by the population of the Autonomous Community of Madrid are considered as threatened/vulnerable/endangered by the IUCN Red List. These plant species include in this Red list are 
 <italic>Aesculus hippocastanum</italic> (vulnerable), 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic> (least concern), 
 <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> (endangered), 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (endangered), 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> (least concern), 
 <italic>Rhamnus purshiana</italic> (least concern) and 
 <italic>Tilia cordata</italic> (least concern). Particularly, those plant species classified as least concern are not considered to be at threat from extinction and, the future conservation actions are aimed at controlling agriculture practices and include an international legislation. However, 
 <italic>Aesculus hippocastanum</italic> is classified as vulnerable because this plant species suffer from severe defoliation by the invasive insect pest 
 <italic>Cameraria ohridella.</italic> The conservation actions consists on 
 <italic>Cameraria ohridella</italic> control and research, ex situ cultivation and to reduce human impacts. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> and 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> are endangered plant species. The main threats to 
 <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> are pests (i.e. 
 <italic>Hypothenemus hampei</italic>), diseases (i.e. Coffee Berry Disease), deforestation (mainly in Ethiopia) and climate change (i.e. high temperatures). There are several conservation actions for 
 <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> such as ex-situ conservation and, education and awareness programs. Finally, 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> is threatened because its logging and wood harvesting. The conservation action for this specie has been widespread in cultivation. It is therefore important that investigations with these species follow the guidelines “IUCN Policy Statement on Research Involving Species at Risk of Extinction” that guarantee the increase and survival of these plant species, bearing in mind that the conservation of these research sources is of clear scientific interest, and in the case of our study, of great therapeutic interest [
