<p id="Par39">Regarding medicinal plants, it was unconcluded that it was higher than the one estimated for other Spanish cities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The main reasons for this finding are the consumer’s perception of efficacy and safety as well as the easy access. In this study, the most common consumption pattern of medicinal plants is young women, between 18 and 44 years of age, with higher education. There is statistically significant differences in consumption frequency related to gender respondents, being higher in women (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0,010) and even more often than those ≥65 years (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0,001)]. This pattern, contrasts with studies performed in other parts of Europe where the frequency of consumption is higher in older people rather than in younger people [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These differences may lie in the area where study was conducted, economic level and consumer trends. Particularly, the Autonomous Community of Madrid has the highest Gross Domestic Product per capita in Spain. In addition, it is one of the Spanish regions most influenced by urbanization and where there is not such a strong connection to traditional use of medicinal plants as in other areas of Spain. Furthermore, there is a growing trend, especially amongst younger people with higher educational level, to use natural products to succeed a healthy lifestyle and mentality [
