<p id="Par45">Currently, there are a paucity of robust data on interactions between medicinal plants and conventional medicines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, it has been found that certain plants can lead to therapeutic inefficiency or drug toxicity. There is evidence of interactions for 
 <italic>Hyperycum perforatum</italic> L. with digoxin, indinavir and cyclosporines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> L. Mant. Pl. can increase insulin elimination or interfere with omeprazole [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, and in relation to the medicinal plants, that are more consumed concomitantly in this study, there are evidences of pharmacodynamics interactions between 
 <italic>M. recutita</italic> and lormetazepam, 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> and alprazolam, and 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> and lormetazepam, increasing hypnotic effect of these benzodiazepines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The clinical effects of the interactions depend on patient (age, genetic and pathologies), medicinal plants (species, dose and duration) and concomitant medication (dose, activity and posology) making it difficult to detect interactions if health personnel do not know its use.
