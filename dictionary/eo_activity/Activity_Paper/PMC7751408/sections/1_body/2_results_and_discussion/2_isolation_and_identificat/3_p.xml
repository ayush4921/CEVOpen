<p>The 16S rDNA V1-V9 region amplified by PCR was sequenced, and subjected to the homology searches using NCBI BLAST analysis. The results revealed a 99% identity with different species belonging to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> genus, and the strain was named 
 <italic>Staphylococcus caprae</italic> NCU S6. The phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) showed that the strain NCU S6 was the most closely (89%) related to 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> strain DSM 20608. The gram staining of NCU S6 showed gram positive. Biochemical approaches, including catalase, coagulase and novobiocin tests, were used to identify the Staphylococcus genus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>, all three 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains instantly produced lots of bubbles, indicating catalase positive. 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> NCU S6 was found to be coagulase-negative and sensitive to novobiocin (radius of inhibition zone ≤10 mm). The reference strains, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (negative control) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 (positive control) were coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative respectively, and both exhibited obvious resistance on novobiocin agar plate (radius of inhibition zones ≥18 mm). The results have shown that NCU S6 strain belonged to 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> species which were not pathogens.
