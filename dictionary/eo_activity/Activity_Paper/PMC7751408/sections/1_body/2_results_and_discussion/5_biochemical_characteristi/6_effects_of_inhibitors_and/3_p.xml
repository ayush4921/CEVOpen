<p>The stability of lipases in the presence of detergents is the premise of being good washing additives in commercial detergents. In addition, surfactants can stimulate lipases in molecular bioimprinting, and play important roles in multifunctionality and various properties of enzymes

 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the non-ionic detergents slightly improved lipase activity. The non-ionic detergents did not weaken the hydrophobic interactions within the protein and damage the lipase

 </xref>. In addition, bile salts, such as sodium cholate, an universal commercial biosurfactant as a reducing agent in aqueous solutions slightly restrained the activity at 1 or 10â€‰mM, as the lipase still retained above 80% of initial activity. These findings were similar to a previous study showing that the bile salts did not restrain the activity of
