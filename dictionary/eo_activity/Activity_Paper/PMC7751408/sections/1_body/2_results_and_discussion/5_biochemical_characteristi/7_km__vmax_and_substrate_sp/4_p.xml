<p>Among the tested natural oils, the canola oil was hydrolysed to a higher degree by SCNL at a high specific activity (220.00 U/mg). The canola oil contains less than 2% erucic acid and less than 30 mM glucosinolates, and has a relatively low level of saturated fat (≤7%) and a high content of polyunsaturated fats, such as linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid (formally called 9,12,15-all-cis-octadecatrienoic acid). α-linolenic acid is an unsaturated omega-3 fatty acid available in many plant oils. The activity of SCNL was strong for natural oils with medium-chain to long-chain fatty acids [C
 <sub>6:0</sub>–C
 <sub>16:0</sub>]. Among them, both olive oil (184.80 U/mg) and rice bran oil (176.69 U/mg) contain long unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid. These results were in accordance with a previous report
