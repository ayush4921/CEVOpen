<p>Temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the reaction rate of enzyme catalysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>, the lipase was active in the wide range of temperatures from 10 to 60 °C. The maximum hydrolytic activity was found at 40 °C, with the relative activity and specific activity of 100% and 503 U/mg respectively. The optimal reaction temperature was lower than the lipase from

 </xref>. Activity analyses of the lipase at temperatures from 10 to 60 °C for 240 min showed that the remaining activity at 40 °C was at the highest level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref>). Only the extremely high temperatures, such as 50 or 60 °C, significantly inhibited the lipase activity, and prolonged incubation may rapidly inactivate the lipase. The highest remaining activity was at 40 °C for 80 min, and the lipase activity decreased with an increase of culture period. The decrease may be because the molecular structure of the enzyme was irreversibly changed, which may have altered the configuration of the active site, thereby decreasing interaction of the lipase with substrates
