<p>The effect of organic solvents on the stability of the lipase was investigated by mixing different organic solvents (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with the enzyme in Buffer A at 10, 30, or 50% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for 1 and 28 days. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm, and the control group (without organic solvents) was also prepared in Buffer A. The residual activity of the lipase was measured under standard conditions, samples were withdrawn periodically and the final concentrations of organic solvents were less than 3% (
