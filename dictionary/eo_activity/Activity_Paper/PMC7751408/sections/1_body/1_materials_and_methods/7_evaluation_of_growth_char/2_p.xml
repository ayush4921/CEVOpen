<p>After culturing the purified single strain in medium A (50 ml) overnight, the inoculum at 8% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) was transferred into medium B (50 ml). The 5 days-incubation was carried out in an orbital shaker at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Then, the absorption value of fermentation medium at 600 nm was measured every 3 h by using TU-1950 Double-Beam UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Beijing, China). The growth characteristics of the strain were recorded as time-OD value curve. Meanwhile, the fermentation medium was taken out every 3 h and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min to get the supernatant for lipase activity measurement.
