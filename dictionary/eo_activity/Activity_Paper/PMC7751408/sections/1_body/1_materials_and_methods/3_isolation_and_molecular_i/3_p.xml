<p>The bacteria were characterised by morphological, biochemical and molecular techniques. The biochemical tests, including coagulase test, novobiocin (5 μg/piece) sensitivity test and catalase production test, were carried out to discriminate staphylococci

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 were used as standard strains. The isolate was further identified by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. Then the genomic DNA of NCU (Nanchang University) S6 was obtained from colonies by protease K cleavage method and amplified as described previously
