<p>Additionally, we observed the effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate in HeLa cells nuclei after 24â€‰h of treatment. The cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye, which emits fluorescence when bounds to DNA. The treated HeLa cell nuclei mostly showed homogenous dye lighting without clear dye aggregation in comparison to the control cells (
