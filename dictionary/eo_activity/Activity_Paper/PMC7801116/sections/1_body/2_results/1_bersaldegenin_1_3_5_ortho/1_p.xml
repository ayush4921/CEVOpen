<p>HeLa cells were treated with the compound for 24 h and the obtained results clearly indicate that bersaldegenin is a strong inducer of the cell death. The monitoring of cell behaviour in continuous and real-time manner by RTCA system allowed to observe the reduction of HeLa cells viability after treatment with the compound. The concentrations of bersaldegenin above 0.1 µg/mL caused decrease in the cellular profiles on RTCA graph (

 <sub>50</sub> value of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate (0.55 µg/mL), calculated in our previous study (Stefanowicz-Hajduk et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), indicated significant cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells. This effect changed with the compound dose and incubation time (

 <sub>50</sub> value of vinblastine sulphate, used as a positive control, was 4.55
 <sup>−03 </sup>µg/mL.
