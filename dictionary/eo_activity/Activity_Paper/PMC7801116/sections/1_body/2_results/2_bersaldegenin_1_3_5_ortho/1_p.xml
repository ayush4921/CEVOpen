<p>To estimate the effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells, we treated the cells with different concentrations of the compound. After 24 h, we analysed the cells by flow cytometry and observed significant increase in amount of ROS positive cells above the compound concentration of 1.0 µg/mL. The percentage of ROS (+) cells were 4.52 ± 0.5, 7.39 ± 0.59, 8.84 ± 0.22, 15.18 ± 0.55, 23.21 ± 1.68% for 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL, respectively (
