<p>The analysis of genes expression in HeLa cells treated with the compound (1.0 μg/mL) showed that the higher expression was observed for BCL2A1 (Bcl-2-Related Protein A1), BIK (Bcl-2-Interacting Killer), CASP3 (Caspase 3, Apoptosis-Related Cysteine Protease), MCL1 (Myeloid Cell Leukaemia Sequence 1), NFKBIA (NF-Kappa-B Inhibitor Alpha), NFKBIB (NF-Kappa-B Inhibitor Beta), NFKBIZ (NF-Kappa-B Inhibitor Zeta), PA15, PMAIP1 (Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate-Induced Protein 1), RELB (RELB Proto-Oncogene, NF-KB Subunit), TNFRSF10 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 10), and TNFRSF10B (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 10 b) genes. The expression of these genes was at least two times higher in comparison to the control sample (0.05% DMSO). The genes – BCL2A1, BIK, and NFKBIZ were the most up-regulated. We also observed down-regulation for 24 genes which expression was at least two times lower than in the control sample (

The genes – CASP6 (Caspase 6), CASP9 (Caspase 9), NOD1 (Nucleotide Binding Oligomerization Domain Containing 1), CRADD (CASP2 and RIPK1 Domain Containing Adaptor with Death Domain), FADD (Fas-Associating Death Domain-Containing Protein), TNFRSF1A (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 1 A), IKBKE (Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Kinase Subunit Epsilon), and PYCARD (Caspase Recruitment Domain-Containing Protein 5) were the most down-regulated.
