<p>In bufadienolide compounds family, determination of cellular mechanisms leading to cell death was done with cinobufagin. The compound was tested on human multiple myeloma (MM) U266 cells and caused pro-apoptotic effects through ROS-mediated activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways and the activation of caspase-3 in the cells (Baek et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also in other studies, cinobufagin caused ROS overproduction, decreased MMP in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The compound induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activation of caspase-3, chromatin condensation, DNA degradation and inhibition of the AKT/mTOR signalling pathway in the tested cells. Next, gamabufotalin induced autophagy and activation of p38 MAPK pathway in human glioblastoma cell line U-87 (Yuan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Bufalin induced ROS overproduction, reduced MMP, activated caspases-9/-3 and DNA damage in human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 (Wu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
