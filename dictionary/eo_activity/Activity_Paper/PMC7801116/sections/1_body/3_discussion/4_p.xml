<p>DNA damage plays a crucial role in cell homeostasis and is associated with NF-kappa-B (NF-кB) family factors which regulate physiological and pathological processes. These proteins are located in the cytoplasm and are associated with a family of inhibitors of NF-кB proteins (IкBs). After stimulation, IкB undergoes degradation in a proteasome, and the free NF-кB translocates to the nucleus and regulates genes transcription (Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). NF-кB activation depends on activity of these inhibitors and can occur in response to DNA damage. Induction of synthesis of NF-кB inhibitors antagonises NF-кB activity and prevents prolonged NF-кB activation (Sun et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Chiao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). In our study, we show that DNA was damaged in HeLa cells treated with the bersaldegenin and this may be associated with NF-кB pathway. The obtained gene analysis revealed very significant overexpression of NF-кB inhibitors genes (NFκBIZ, NFκBIB, and NFκBIA) and downregulation of IкB kinases family genes. However, further studies evaluating the role of these factors in the cell death pathway need to be performed.
