<p>To monitor HeLa cell viability and proliferation we used the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analyzer Dual Plate (RTCA DP, ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described in our previous study (Adamska et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Briefly, the cells were seeded in E-plates 16 (ACEA Bioscences) at densities of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. After 24 h, bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate was added to the cells at a concentration range of 0.1–20.0 µg/mL for 24 h. Additionally, DMSO – as a solvent of the compound, was added to HeLa cells (a control sample) at a concentration of 0.25% (v/v). Vinblastine sulphate was used as a positive control. The RTCA software v. 1.2.1. calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. All the experiments were performed in duplicate, in three independent repeats (n = 6).
