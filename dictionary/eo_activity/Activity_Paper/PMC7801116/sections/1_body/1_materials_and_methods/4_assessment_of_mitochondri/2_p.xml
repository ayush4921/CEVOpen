<p>To determine the effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate on oxidative stress production in HeLa cells, we treated the cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) with the compound at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL for 24 h. The DMSO concentration in a control sample was 0.25% (v/v). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were stained with Muse Oxidative Stress Kit (Merck Millipore), according with the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples were analysed by Muse Cell Analyzer. The experiments were repeated three times, independently.
