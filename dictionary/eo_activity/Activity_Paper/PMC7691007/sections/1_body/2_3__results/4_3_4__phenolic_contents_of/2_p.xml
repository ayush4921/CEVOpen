<p>The total flavonoid contents of the extracts varied according to the extraction solvent, the phenological stage, and the host plant on which 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> grows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Thus, this class of phenolic compounds was best extracted with methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. Hexane and water extracted the lowest, regardless of the phenological stage and the host plant. However, for 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> collected on 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic>, the total flavonoids were better extracted by ethyl acetate, and their contents were significantly different from those of methanol and ethanol extractions, respectively. Overall, the flavonoid levels of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> were significantly higher during fruiting, especially when extracted with ethyl acetate and to a lesser extent ethanol and methanol regardless of the plant host on which 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> grows.
