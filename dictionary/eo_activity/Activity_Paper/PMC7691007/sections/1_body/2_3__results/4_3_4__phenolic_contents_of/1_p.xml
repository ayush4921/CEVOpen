<p>The phenolics contains in extracts were determined using a standard calibration curve (Supplementary material). The evolution of the phenolic contents of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> as a function of the solvent, host, and phenological stage is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The total phenol contents were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher with ethyl acetate, followed by hexane at all stages of development of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> and on all hosts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). Water was the worst solvent for extracting these compounds, while methanol and ethanol had globally comparable effects. With hexane and ethyl acetate, the total phenol contents increased significantly during flowering and during fruiting of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> grown on 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> and on 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>. With the other solvents, the general tendency was a decrease of the phenol content, the levels of total phenols being higher when 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> was harvested from 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic>.
