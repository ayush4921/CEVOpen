 <italic>(2) Determination of the Total Antioxidant Capacity</italic>. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of extracts was measured with the phosphomolybdenum method according to Hossain and Shah [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] protocol adapted for 96-well microplates. The phosphomolybdate reagent solution was prepared freshly by mixing 50 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (0.6 M), 50 mL of Na
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> (28 mM), and 50 mL of (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub>Mo
 <sub>7</sub>O
 <sub>24</sub>4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (4 mM). The calibration curve was established with ascorbic acid (0–50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The phosphomolybdate reagent (150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added to 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extracts or ascorbic acid. The blanks were constituted by mixing 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of phosphomolybdate reagent solution and 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DMSO. The microplate was incubated in a waterbath at 80°C for 90 min, then cooled down to room temperature. The absorbance was read at 695 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of plant extracts was derived from the calibration curve of ascorbic acid and expressed as equivalent of ascorbic acid.
