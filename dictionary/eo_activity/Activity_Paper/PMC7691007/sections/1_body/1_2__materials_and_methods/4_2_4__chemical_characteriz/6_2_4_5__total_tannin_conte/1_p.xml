<p>Total tannin contents (TTC) were assayed according to the Gupta and Verma [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] protocol adapted for 96-well microplates. The calibration curve was established with tannic acid (0–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Briefly, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.1 M FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (in 0.1 N HCl) was added to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the plant extract or tannic acid, followed immediately by addition of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 0.008 M of K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> (in distilled water). The volumes were adjusted to 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L with 140 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of distilled water followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark room temperature for 10 min to allow color to become more stable. The blank was prepared by replacing the extract or tannic acid with distilled water. The absorbances were read at 720 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. The amount of tannin in the plant extracts was derived from the calibration curve and expressed as mg of tannic acid equivalents per g of dry extract (mg TAE/g).
