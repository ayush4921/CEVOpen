<p>All assays were performed in triplicate. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, and when differences were observed, the means were compared two by two using the Waller–Duncan test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Each dependent variable (yield, TPC, TFC, TfnC, TTC, TAC, FRAP, DPPH, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition) was compared in the three groups of independent variables (phenological stage of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>, host, and extraction solvent). The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Pearson correlation was used to search for the link between the different dependent variables at 5% and 1% thresholds. For these analyses, we used SPSS 25 software for Windows.
