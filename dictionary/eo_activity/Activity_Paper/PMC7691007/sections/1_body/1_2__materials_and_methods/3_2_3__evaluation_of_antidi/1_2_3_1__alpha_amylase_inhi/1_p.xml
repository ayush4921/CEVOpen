<p>The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory effects of extracts were determined using the DNSA method as described by Kazeem et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] adapted for 96-well microplates. The DNSA reagent was freshly prepared by dissolving 1 g of DNSA and 30 g of potassium sodium tartrate in 40 mL of distilled water, after which 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of NaOH (2 M) was added, and then, the total volume was adjusted to 100 mL with distilled water. This was performed under magnetic stirring on a 40°C hot plate. Aliquots of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase solution (0.5 mg/mL) were added to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of varying concentrations (3.25–800 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of the extract or acarbose (2 mg/mL in DMSO 1%). The microplate was preincubated at 37°C for 5 min, after which 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1% starch solution in sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) was added and then further incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was stopped by adding 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DNSA reagent. The microplate was then placed in a waterbath at 85°C for 10 min to allow the reaction between DNSA and maltose from the hydrolysis of starch. This reaction was then stopped by placing the microplate in an ice waterbath for 3 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of distilled water. A negative control was prepared using the same procedure replacing the extract with DMSO solution (1%). The absorbances were read at 540 nm using an Elisa Bio-Rad PR 4100 microplate reader. The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity was calculated as percentage inhibition of starch hydrolysis:
