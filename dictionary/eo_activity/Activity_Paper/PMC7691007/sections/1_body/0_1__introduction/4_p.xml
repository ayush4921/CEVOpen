<p>The present work aimed to study the influence of certain factors, in particular, the phenology of the plant, the extraction solvent, and the nature of the host of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> on the phytochemistry, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties of the extracts of this parasitic plant. This study should generate preliminary data for a possible standardization of extracts of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> as an antioxidant phytomedicine to fight oxidative stress associated with the many disease conditions that are currently being managed locally with the plant.
