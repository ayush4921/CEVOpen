 <p>The chemical profile of 
  <italic>Teucrium polium</italic> L. (
  <italic>T. polium</italic>) methanolic extract was tested using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-LCMS). Disc diffusion and microdilution assays were used for the antimicrobial activities. Coxsackievirus B-3 (CVB3) and Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were used for the antiviral activities. 
  <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> (ATCC 12472 and CV026) and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 were used as starter strains for the anti-quorum sensing tests. Isoprenoids are the main class of compounds identified, and 13R-hydroxy-9E,11Z-octadecadienoic acid, valtratum, rhoifolin, sericetin diacetate, and dihydrosamidin were the dominant phytoconstituents. The highest mean diameter of growth inhibition zone was recorded for 
  <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (19.33 ± 1.15 mm). The minimal inhibitory concentrations were ranging from 6.25 to 25 mg/mL for bacterial strains, and from 6.25 to 25 mg/mL for 
  <italic>Candida</italic> species. The 50% cytotoxic concentration on VERO (African Green Monkey Kidney) cell lines was estimated at 209 µg/mL. No antiviral activity was recorded. Additionally, 
  <italic>T. polium</italic> extract was able to inhibit 
  <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 motility in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the tested extract was able to inhibit 23.66% of the swarming and 35.25% of swimming capacities of PAO1 at 100 µg/mL. These results highlighted the role of germander as a potent antimicrobial agent that can interfere with the virulence factors controlled by the quorum-sensing systems.
