<p>Taken together, the obtained results showed that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract is a rich source of undescribed bioactive molecules in the 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic> genus obtained using the HR-LCMS. Our findings highlighted the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract from the Hail region, Saudi Arabia, against a large collection of clinically/environmentally important pathogens. 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract was able to inhibit the motility of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, reducing its virulence. These findings support the use of this plant in folk medicine as a source of bioactive molecules acting on several human disorders. Further analyses are needed to correlate between the obtained results with the phytochemical composition of organic extract from germander aerial organs.
