<p>Previous reports have underlined that methanolic extract from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> showed biological activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mainly the antibacterial activity was exhibited against Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of aerial partsâ€™ methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> is directly linked to their phytoconstituents and contingent by the activity of their chemical compounds and their proportion in the extract. Many studies evaluated the antibacterial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The essential oils, aqueous, and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> exhibited high antibacterial activity, against both Gram-negative and positive bacteria and antifungal properties [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Recently, El Atki et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] examined the antibacterial activities of the essential oils of two Moroccan 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> L. subspecies. Moreover, Ghojavand et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], synthesized green nanoparticles from the stem and flower of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and investigated their antifungal activity. In fact, previous studies demonstrated that methanolic extract exhibited high antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Comparing the efficacy of our extract to ampicillin, we found that it is more highly active than a commonly used antibiotic against 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> ATCC 29245, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853. Previous study conducted by Mosadegh et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] demonstrated that aqueous extract from 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> exhibited antibacterial activity but not any antifungal properties. Tabatabaei et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] demonstrated that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extract showed antibacterial properties against infectious microorganisms in vitro, notably against Gram-positive strains.
