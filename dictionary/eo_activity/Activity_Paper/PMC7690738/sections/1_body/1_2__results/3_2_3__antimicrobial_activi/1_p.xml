 <xref rid="plants-09-01418-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> illustrated the results of antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> aerial parts methanolic extract against nine Gram-negative and three Gram-positive bacteria using disc diffusion assay. The results revealed that the methanolic extract exhibited a wide antibacterial spectrum, against tested bacteria with the inhibition zone diameter fluctuant from 6 to 20 mm. Our results showed various degrees of the inhibition. In fact, very high antibacterial activity was recorded against the clinical isolates 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (strain 146) and 
 <italic>S. pyogens</italic>. A high activity level was recorded against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> ATCC 29245, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (environmental strain, pf8), and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> (clinical strain, 115). Moderate activity was obtained against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 27736, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> MDR (clinical strain, 136), and 
 <italic>S. paucimobilis</italic> (clinical strain, 144). Low activity was recorded against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> (environmental strain, 3), and 
 <italic>S. sciuri</italic> (environmental strain). The results of the minimal bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration (MBC/MIC) ratios interpreted using the scheme of antimicrobial substances showed that 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> aerial parts methanolic extract acts like a bacteriostatic agent for all tested bacteria except against 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic>, against which it is bactericidal.
