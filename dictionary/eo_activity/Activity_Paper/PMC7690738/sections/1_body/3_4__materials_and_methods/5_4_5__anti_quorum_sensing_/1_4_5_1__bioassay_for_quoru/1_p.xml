<p>The ability of the tested extract to inhibit the production of violacein by 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> strains (ATCC 14272 and CV026) was assayed using the methods described by Noumi et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Serial dilutions of the sample (MIC, MIC/2, MIC/4, MIC/8, and using LB broth as the diluent) were tested against 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> CV 026 and the assay plates were incubated at 30 Â°C for 3 days. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Inhibition of quorum sensing was calculated using the protocol described by Zaki et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] and activity is interpreted using the following scheme: a quorum sensing inhibition zone &lt; 10 mm was considered moderate activity and when the QSI zone &gt; 10 mm it was designated a potent effect.
