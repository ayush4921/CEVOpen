 <italic>Kaempferia parviflora</italic> Wall. ex Baker 
 <italic>(Zingiberaceae</italic>) is an herbaceous plant native to Thailand. It has strengthening and stimulating properties. Due to the high content of methoxyflavones, this plant demonstrates antioxidant properties in vitro. Methoxyflavones (flavones with an attached methoxyl group) are the main components of the plant (there are three of them: 3,5,7,3′, 4′-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF), 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), and 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (TMF)), which are most often studied. Kaempferosides—unique components of 
 <italic>Kaempferia parviflora</italic>—are not considered active ingredients. 
 <italic>Kaempferia parviflora</italic> rhizomes have been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity due to the high content of biologically active phenolic and methoxyflavone compounds [

 <italic>Kaempferia parviflora</italic> have a variety of biological active properties. Flavone (5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone and 5,7-dimethoxyflavone) inhibits viral protease, flavonoids inhibit 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Rhizomes prepared in the form of alcohol or water decoction are prescribed for the treatment of various diseases [
