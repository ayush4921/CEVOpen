 <sub>50</sub> of the venom (0.05 mg/kg/mL dissolved in 2 mL of normal saline) was put in test tubes 2–9.0.2 mL of bovine citrated plasma was added to all the test tubes. Test tube 2 serves as the venom control. 0.2 mL of each 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract partitions (300 and 600 mg/mL
 <sup>−1</sup>dissolved in 1 mL of normal saline) and 0.2 mL of polyvalent anti-venom was added to test tubes 3–9 respectively. Then 0.2 mL of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> was added to all the mixtures and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and clotting time recorded.
