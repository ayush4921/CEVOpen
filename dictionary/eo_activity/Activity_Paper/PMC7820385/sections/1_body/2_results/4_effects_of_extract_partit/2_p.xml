<p id="p0150">The activities of SOD and CAT as well as MDA levels in serum (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and brain (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) of untreated envenomed group were significantly higher compared to normal control. The level of Nrf2 recorded in the sera and brain tissues of normal control group were significantly (P˂0.05) higher compared to untreated and anti-venom treated groups whereas Nrf2 expression recorded in sera and tissues of untreated and anti-venom groups were significantly (P˂0.05) lower compared to groups treated with extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic>. However, among groups treated with extract partition of 
 <italic>M. oleifera,</italic> groups treated with 300 mg/kg of N-hexane partition and 600 mg/kg of ethanol partition recorded the least and highest Nrf2 expression on sera and tissues respectively (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). Groups treated with antivenom and various extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> had significantly lower SOD, CAT and MDA levels compared to untreated group. Across groups treated with extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera,</italic> groups treated with 300 and 600 mg/kg of ethanol partition recorded the lowest enzymes activities in sera and brain.
