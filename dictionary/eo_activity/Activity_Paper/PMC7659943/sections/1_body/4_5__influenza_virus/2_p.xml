<p>Influenza virus belongs to Orthomyxoviridae family (RNA viruses), which includes seven genera (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Isavirus, Quaranjavirus, and Thogotovirus) [

 <xref rid="B170-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma caused mammalian flu. There are 18 various hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 11 various neuraminidase (NA) subtypes [

 <xref rid="B172-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Subtypes are named by combining the H and N numbersâ€”e.g., A(H1N1), A(H3N2). On the other hand, influenza B viruses are classified into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria [

 <xref rid="B174-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. This genetic pattern imitates the altered nature of the antigenic properties of these viruses, and their following outbreak depends upon various factors [

 <xref rid="B175-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Influenza B virus was supposed to have a weaker rate of antigenic progression than A and to cause milder sickness than A in the past [
