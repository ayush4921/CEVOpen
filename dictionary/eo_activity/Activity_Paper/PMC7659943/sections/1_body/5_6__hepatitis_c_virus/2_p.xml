<p>Hepatitis C virus belongs to the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is a small enveloped virus with single-stranded genomic RNA with two embedded viral glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="B221-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]. In the perisinusoidal space (between hepatocyte and a sinusoid), the lipo-viral particle is attached to the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte by virtue of a variety of receptors such as proteoglycans, LDL receptor, CD81, and claudin 1. After the endocytosis, the M2 proteins allow a pH-dependent fusion with the lysosome and the protons to move through the viral envelope, causing the uncoating and release of the viral RNA. Then, the viral replication proteins recruit membranes from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to form the closely ER-associated “Membranous web”, which is the site of viral replication. Afterward, the viral particles will remain in the nucleus or move to the cytosol, where they are translated into viral proteins via the Golgi apparatus. In addition, the viral proteins sometimes are brought back into the nucleus, where they bind with viral RNA and later form new viral genome particles [
