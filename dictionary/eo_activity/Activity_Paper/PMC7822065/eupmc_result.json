    "In discovery of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) with improved anticancer potency, structural modification was performed on the previous derived indole-3-butyric acid derivative. Among all the synthesised compounds, molecule <b>I13</b> exhibited high HDAC inhibitory and antiproliferative potencies in the <i>in vitro</i> investigations. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of <b>I13</b> against HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC6 were 13.9, 12.1, and 7.71 nM, respectively. In the cancer cell based screening, molecule <b>I13</b> showed increased antiproliferative activities in the inhibition of U937, U266, HepG2, A2780, and PNAC-1 cells compared with SAHA. In the HepG2 xenograft model, 50 mg/kg/d of <b>I13</b> could inhibit tumour growth in athymic mice compared with 100 mg/kg/d of SAHA. Induction of apoptosis was revealed to play an important role in the anticancer potency of molecule <b>I13</b>. Collectively, a HDACI (<b>I13</b>) with high anticancer activity was discovered which can be utilised as a lead compound for further HDACI design."
