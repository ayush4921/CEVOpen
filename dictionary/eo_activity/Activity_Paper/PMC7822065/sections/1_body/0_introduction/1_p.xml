<p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes involved in the deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins including transcription factors, Hsp90 and tubulin

 </xref>. The two families are the zinc dependent class I, II, and IV, and the nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD) dependent class III. Class I HDACs contain HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8, and class II HDACs are subdivided into IIa (HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9) and IIb (HDAC6 and 10). Class III HDACs, as a separate family, are a group of NAD dependent silent information regulator 2-related proteins (known as sirtuins, sirt1-7). Class IV HDAC, HDAC11, is structurally different from either class I or class II HDACs.
