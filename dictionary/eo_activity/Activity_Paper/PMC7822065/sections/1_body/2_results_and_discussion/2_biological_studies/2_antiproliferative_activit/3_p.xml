<p>A series of tumour cell lines including the lung cancer A549, Calu-3, SPC-A-1, H322, H1299, breast cancer MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, colon carcinoma LoVo, Colo205, ovarian cancer A2780, SKOV3, gastric cancer MKN45, pancreatic cancer PNAC-1, leukemic K562, and multiple myeloma OPM2 cells were cultured for the antiproliferative assay of active compound 
 <bold>I13</bold>. In the present study, molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> could inhibit the growth of both solid and haematologic tumour cell lines (
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Against most of the tested cell lines, 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited improved inhibitory activity compared with SAHA. In the antiproliferative test against A549, H1299, MCF-7, LoVo, Colo205, and MKN45 cells, 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited less potency than SAHA. Remarkably, in inhibition the growth of A2780 and PNAC-1 cells, molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> was revealed to be 5.9-fold (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.6 μM), and 5.6-fold (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.17 μM) more active than SAHA with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 27.3 μM and 6.57 μM, respectively. The antiproliferative activity of molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> was considered to be restricted by the poor enzyme inhibitory selectivity. Enhancement of selectivity could be a useful strategy to improve the anticancer activity of this group of HDACIs.
