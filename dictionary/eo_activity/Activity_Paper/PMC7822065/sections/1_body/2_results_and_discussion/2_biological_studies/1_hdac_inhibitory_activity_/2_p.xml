<p>To evaluate the isoform selectivity of the most active molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold>, HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were selected for the screening (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The result revealed that 
 <bold>I13</bold> could effectively inhibit the activity of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC6 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 13.9, 12.1, and 7.71â€‰nM, respectively. Compared with SAHA, and the class I HDAC inhibition selective MS275, 
 <bold>I13</bold> did not show inhibitory selectivity of a specific HDAC isoform or a particular class. Considering the high potency of 
 <bold>I13</bold> against HDAC6, selective HDAC6 inhibitor might be derived by further structural modification of 
 <bold>I13</bold>.
