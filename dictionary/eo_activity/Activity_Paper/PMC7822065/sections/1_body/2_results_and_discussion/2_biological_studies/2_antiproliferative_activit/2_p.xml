<p>The hydrazide molecules showed reduced activity in the enzyme inhibitory assay. Therefore, only the most sensitive cell line U266 was used for the test of hydrazide derivatives. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the hydrazide compounds did not exhibit improved antiproliferative activity than the corresponding molecules with hydroxamic acid ZBG. Among the hydrazide series, molecules with -propyl substituted R
 <sub>2</sub> showed good inhibitory potency. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compound 
 <bold>I1e2</bold>, 
 <bold>I3e2</bold>, 
 <bold>I10e2</bold>, and 
 <bold>I13e2</bold> were 0.64, 0.48, 0.74, and 0.71 μM, respectively, compared with SAHA (0.88 μM).
