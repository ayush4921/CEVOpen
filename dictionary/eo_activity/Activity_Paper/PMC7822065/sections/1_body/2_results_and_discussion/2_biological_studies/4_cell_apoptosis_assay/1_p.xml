<p>Apoptosis which is a form of programmed cell death maintains the healthy survival/death balance in human cells. Increasing apoptosis rate could be utilised as a strategy for the treatment of cancer. To further evaluate the effect of 
 <bold>I13</bold> on apoptosis, flow cytometry analysis was performed by staining HepG2 cells with annexin V-FITC/PI. The results revealed that both 
 <bold>I13</bold> and SAHA treatment induced HepG2 cell apoptosis in a dose dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). After treatment with difference doses of 
 <bold>I13</bold>, the ratio of apoptotic cells was 11.56% and 33.55% at dose of 0.2 and 0.8 µM, respectively, compared with SAHA (11.09% and 13.96% at concentration of 0.2 and 0.8 µM, respectively). It is indicated that induction of cell apoptosis makes contributions to the antitumor effect of 
 <bold>I13</bold>.
