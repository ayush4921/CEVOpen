<p>4-(1-Benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-butyric acid (
 <bold>I2a</bold>). To a solution of NaH in DMF, were stirred under Ar
 <sub>2</sub> and 0 °C. After 30 min, the benzyl bromide was slowly added. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The residue was acidified with saturated citric acid, and then extracted with EtOAc (3 × 20 ml). The organic layer was combined, washed with brine (3 × 20 ml) dried over MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, and evaporated under vacuum. The desired compound 
 <bold>I2a</bold> was derived by crystallisation in EtOAc as powder. HRMS
