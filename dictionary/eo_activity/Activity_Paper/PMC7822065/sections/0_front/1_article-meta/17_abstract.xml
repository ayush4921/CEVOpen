 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>In discovery of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) with improved anticancer potency, structural modification was performed on the previous derived indole-3-butyric acid derivative. Among all the synthesised compounds, molecule 
  <bold>I13</bold> exhibited high HDAC inhibitory and antiproliferative potencies in the 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 
  <bold>I13</bold> against HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC6 were 13.9, 12.1, and 7.71 nM, respectively. In the cancer cell based screening, molecule 
  <bold>I13</bold> showed increased antiproliferative activities in the inhibition of U937, U266, HepG2, A2780, and PNAC-1 cells compared with SAHA. In the HepG2 xenograft model, 50 mg/kg/d of 
  <bold>I13</bold> could inhibit tumour growth in athymic mice compared with 100 mg/kg/d of SAHA. Induction of apoptosis was revealed to play an important role in the anticancer potency of molecule 
  <bold>I13</bold>. Collectively, a HDACI (
  <bold>I13</bold>) with high anticancer activity was discovered which can be utilised as a lead compound for further HDACI design.
