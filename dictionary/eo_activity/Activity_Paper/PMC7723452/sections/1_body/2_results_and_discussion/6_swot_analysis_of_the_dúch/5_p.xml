 </bold>: A considerable threat identified is the necessity for funding to develop the database and support research into its content. The Meitheal DÃºchas Transcription Project is reliant on volunteers to transcribe the material. In addition, there is a threat of lack global awareness to this ethnographic resource, thus no visibility to international scholars resulting in only a small number of researches utilizing the material.
