<p>Transcripts, although classified into different topics, cannot be searched by a specific term within a topic of interest, such as “folk medicine.” Therefore, the retrieved transcripts from full-text searching comprise citations in contexts other than medicinal uses and the volume of the retrieved transcripts prevented manual exclusion of irrelevant transcripts. Such functionality would enable more research opportunities and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of archival research.</p>
