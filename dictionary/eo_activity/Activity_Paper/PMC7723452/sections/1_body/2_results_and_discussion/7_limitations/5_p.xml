<p>The in-built “Find” function of the database can retrieve transcripts containing the search term(s) entered. When a single term, e.g., “tea,” is entered, a huge volume of transcripts is retrieved. However, if more than one term is entered, the database only retrieves transcripts with the exact terms in the exact order. For instance, searching “
 <bold>tea cure</bold>” will retrieve “Fresh strawberry leaves made into 
 <bold>tea cure</bold> sore mouths and throats,” but not “A 
 <bold>cure</bold> for sore eyes is to wash them with cold 
 <bold>tea</bold> without any milk or (hot) sugar and they will get alright” since the two terms are apart in the transcript.
