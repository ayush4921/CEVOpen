<p>Dock: The “Dock” plant described in the SMC is more difficult to identify. As there are several different 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> species in Ireland that are historically referred to as dock for various medicinal purposes, there is no way of establishing what species of 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> the contributors are referring to in the SMC, or if they are all referring to the same. The two most used species are 
 <italic>Rumex obtusifolius and R. crispus</italic>. For the purpose of this study we have labeled all references to “Dock” as 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> spp. Most entries recommend 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> spp. for treatment of a “nettle sting.” 
 <italic>R. obtusifolius</italic> is the species widely known for the ability to ease the sting of a nettle (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jackson, 2014</xref>). However, the nature of this analysis did not allow for interrogating the data to such an extent to extract the different uses for different species of 
 <italic>Rumex</italic>. 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> spp. is indigenous to Europe and 
 <italic>R. obtusifolius</italic> has been introduced to many other parts of the world, including Africa, and North and South America (
