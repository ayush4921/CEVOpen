<p>The normalized number of transcripts both unrefined and manually filtered to medicinal uses, citing the top three plants in Roscommon and Wexford are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>. Notwithstanding that the transcripts have been indexed by topic, searching within a topic of interest, such as “folklore medicine,” is not an available function of the digital archive. Therefore, manual data extraction was employed to exclude irrelevant transcripts.
