<p>On the homepage of the website, a panel incorporated with multiple functions is presented in the middle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The website can be read in either Gaeilge or English and such language preference could be made on the panel. Below the language buttons, there is a link that leads to details about the Meitheal Community Transcription Project; therein the voluntary opportunity to sign up and participate is also described. As of 8 February 2019, only 30% of the Irish pages and 43% of the English pages have been transcribed (
