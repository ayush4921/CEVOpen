<p>Citral (3,7-dimethyl-2-6-octadienal) is a racemic mixture composed of geranial (trans-citral, citral A) and neral (cis-citral, citral B) isomers, which are acyclic and monounsaturated aldehydes naturally occurring in many citric fruits, as well as in other herbs or spices [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Citral has become a raw material of great importance due to its characteristic lemon aroma and has been used as a flavoring ingredient in the food, perfumery and cosmetic industries [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Citral showed fungicidal activity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. strains isolated from denture wearers after 2 hours of exposure and caused major morphological changes [

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] demonstrated a strong antifungal activity of citral against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains via mechanisms other than cell wall biosynthesis or ergosterol complexation. Thus, citral can be considered a promising candidate for the development of novel antifungal leads.
