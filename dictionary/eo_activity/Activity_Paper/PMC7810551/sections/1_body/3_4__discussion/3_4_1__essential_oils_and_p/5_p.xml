 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, popularly known as cinnamon, is a very common spice that has been used by different cultures around the world for several centuries. It is obtained from the bark and leaves of trees of the genus 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic>, a perennial tropical plant that has two main varieties, namely, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia.</italic> In addition to its culinary uses, in native Ayurvedic medicine, cinnamon is used as an alternative to treat respiratory, digestive, and gynecological diseases [

 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> bark are trans-cinnamaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and linalool, which represent 82.5% of the total EO composition [

 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> EO, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, reduction of cardiovascular diseases, and increase of cognitive function [
