<p>A systematic screening of the articles was performed by two independent examiners according to the following inclusion criteria:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Biological activity: clinical effects of an EO-containing formulation on denture stomatitis or oral candidiasis in in vitro or clinical trials. Primary outcome of interest: antifungal activity of the EO and/or isolated constituent based on their MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration). Secondary outcome of interest: reduction in CFUs (colony-forming units) after treatment with the EO-containing formulation leading to remission or cure of infection. Tertiary outcome of interest: cure or reduction in the size and number of erythematous lesions upon treatment with the EO-containing formulation.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Plant material and chemical elucidation: chemically characterized EO and/or their isolated constituents from aromatic plants.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Study design: in vitro studies and phases I, II, III or IV clinical trials. Sample size and study power (at least 80%) should be adequate to determine accurate statistical inferences.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Methodological quality: accuracy of methods and outcomes; internal and external validity; for clinical trialsâ€”high quality standards.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Language: articles written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. Examiners agreed that in cases of inconsistence, the final verdict on which articles should be included would be reached by consensus.</p>
