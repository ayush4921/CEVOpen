<p>Randomized controlled trials of herbal interventions were analyzed based on the CONSORT guidelines [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Jadad scale [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was used to check study validity and methodological quality (randomization, blinding, and loss of follow-up). Based on these requirements, clinical studies were assigned scores ranging from 0 to 5, in which a score &lt;3 was indicative of poor quality.
