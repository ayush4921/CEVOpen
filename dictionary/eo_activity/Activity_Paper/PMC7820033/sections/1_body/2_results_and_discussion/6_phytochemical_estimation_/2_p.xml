<p id="p0110">Polyphenols are naturally occurring secondary metabolites comprising of various classes of compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, phytoestrogens etc.) found in abundant in fruits, vegetables, cereals and beverages [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. There is strong evidence that consumption of foods containing high amount of polyphenols can be effective against a number of diseases including asthma, infection, aging, heart diseases and cancer [

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Phenolic compounds exert strong antioxidant activity due to the presence of hydroxyl groups and conjugated ring structure that contribute to their ability to scavenge free radicals. Among different classes of polyphenols, flavonoids are the most potent scavengers against most oxidizing molecules [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Another group of compounds, directly linked with antioxidant activity, is the tannins that are also widely distributed in almost every plant and have a great impact on human health [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The three date cultivars were found to be rich in these groups of phytochemicals that can render strong antioxidant potential. Results revealed that Safawy date contains the highest phenolic content (101.66 mg GAE/g) while Sukkari date has the lowest amount (39.01 mg GAE/g) among the three date extracts. The flavonoid content followed the same trend, i.e., Safawy &gt; Ajwah &gt; Sukkari (78.6, 71.6 and 61.0 mg QE⁄g, respectively). This order of phenolic and flavonoid content in the date extracts are in harmony with the results found in free radical scavenging assays. However, in terms of tannin content, Sukkari was found to be superior than Safawy and Ajwah date cultivars (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results found in this study deviate by a significant and noticeable amount from previously published studies regarding the antioxidant potential of dates [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which could be due to a number of factors involved such as difference in cultivars, soil conditions, ripening stages, storage conditions, extraction process and method of analysis.
