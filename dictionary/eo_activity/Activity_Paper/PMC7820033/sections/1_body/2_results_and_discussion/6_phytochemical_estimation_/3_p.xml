<p id="p0115">Furthermore, we analyzed the linear regression equations to study the association of these antioxidant components with the results found in antioxidant assay and the values of correlation coefficient (R) are given in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Nine R values ranging from 0.789 to 0.994 were observed when the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from the three radical scavenging assays were plotted against TPC, TFC and TTC. These high values of R suggest that the antioxidant activities of the three date cultivars might be a result of their phenolic, flavonoid and tannin content since these phytoconstituents are the main antioxidant principles found in natural sources.
