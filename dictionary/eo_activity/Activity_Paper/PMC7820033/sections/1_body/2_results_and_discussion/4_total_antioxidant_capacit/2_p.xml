<p id="p0100">Total antioxidant capacity is a sensitive way to evaluate antioxidant activity of plant extracts which is, to some extent is contributed by the phenolics, flavonoids and other reducing compounds present in the extract [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this project, the total antioxidant activity of the date extracts were investigated by the phosphomolybdenum method, based on the reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(V) (a green phosphate complex with a maximal absorption) which is measured spectrophotometrically at 695 nm and the results are expressed in terms of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Total antioxidant capacity of the date cultivars can be ranked as Safawy &gt; Ajwah &gt; Sukkari (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 88, 119 and 193 μg/mL) while IC
 <sub>50</sub> of standard ascorbic acid was 12.30 μg/mL. Our previous study [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as present study finds considerable amount of polyphenols in the date extracts and the difference in their amounts can be directly linked to the observed activity since the total antioxidant capacity is directly proportional to the amount of polyphenols present in the extract [
