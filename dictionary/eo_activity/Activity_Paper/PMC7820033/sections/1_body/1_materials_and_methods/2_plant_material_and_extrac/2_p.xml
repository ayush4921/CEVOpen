<p id="p0045">The dried ripe dates were purchased from the local date market in Al Madinah, Saudi Arabia and identified by taxonomists at Bangladesh National Herbarium where a voucher specimen (DACB 41158) has been submitted for future reference. The dried dates were mashed with the help of a blender and soaked in ethanol with periodic sonication. The extracts were filtered and dried using rotary vacuum evaporator at 45 °C to get semisolid masses. The extracts were further freeze dried to get the dried extracts. For easy identification, pictures of the date are provided along with the article (
