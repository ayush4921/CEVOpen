<p id="p0080">Chemical composition of the three date cultivars was analyzed by chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation was done using a Waters Nano Acquity UPLC system equipped with a reversed phase analytical column of 75 μm i.d. × 150 mm, 1.7 μm particle size (Waters QTOF Micro fed by a Waters NanoAcquity UPLC, Waters Corporation, Milford, USA). Column oven temperature was maintained at 35 °C and flow rate was set at 0.3 μL/min throughout the experiment. Water and acetonitrile, each containing 0.1% formic acid, were used as mobile phase A and B, respectively. The injection volume was 2 μL with a run time of 75 min. The linear gradient program was set as follows: 0 min, 95% A; 0–70 min, 5–95% B; 70–75 min, 95% B. The UPLC was hyphenated to a Waters QTOF micro mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode. The nebulization gas (nitrogen) was set to 500 l/h at 350 °C; the cone gas (nitrogen) was set to 50 l/h, and the source temperature to 100 °C. The capillary and cone voltages were set to 3100 and 35 V, respectively. The MCP detector voltage was set to 4300 V. The QTOF micro MS acquisition rate was set at 0.5 s with inter scan delay of 0.1 s. Argon was used as collision and spray gas. Full scan data acquisition was performed, scanning from
