 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Briefly, 1 mL solution of extract or standard (ascorbic acid) was mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of potassium ferricyanide (1%). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 50 °C followed by the addition of 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10%). The upper portion of the mixture (2.5 mL) was separated after centrifugation. Then 0.5 mL of distilled water, and 0.5 mL of ferric chloride solution (0.1%) was added to it and kept at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance was measured at 700 nm against a blank solution.
