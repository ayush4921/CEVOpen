<p>Shilova et al. (2006) performed a study using green and black leaves EtOH extracts of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> and examined the oxygen uptake rate in a gasometric system with 2,2â€²-azobisisobutyronitrile-initiated oxidation of isopropylbenzene. The green leaves showed the most pronounced antioxidant effect [

 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> followed by their DPPH assay with the post-chromatographic derivatization of TLC plates. The increasing order of the free-radical scavenging activity was found to be gallic acid &gt; arbutin &gt; ellagic acid &gt; hydroquinone &gt; ascorbic acid [

 <italic>B. ciliata</italic> rhizomes was performed. The MeOH extract exhibited a better antioxidant activity [
