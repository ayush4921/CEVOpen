<p>The MeOH-water extract from rhizomes of 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> have been reported to impede the in vitro replication of influenza A virus. Pre-treatment of cells with 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> extract was effective in the preventing virus-mediated cell-destruction by repressing viral RNA and protein synthesis. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> leaf supplemented with lectins reduced the virus-induced (HSV strain L2) cytopathogenic effect up to 95% [
