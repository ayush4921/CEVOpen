<p>Almost all of the aforementioned nine 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species possess antibacterial activity. In a study by Sajad et al. (2010), the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> whole plant extract was analyzed based on the diffusion method. Different concentrations (10, 25, or 50 mg/mL) of the aqueous, EtOH and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> rhizomes exhibited antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. Aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-25-05555" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The extract concentration of 50 mg/mL was found to be most effective and was similar to that of the ciprofloxacin-antibiotic (25 Âµg/mL). These results show that 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> possess significant antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-25-05555" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. It is reported for 
 <italic>B. ciliata</italic> that compared to leaf extracts, the root and rhizome extracts exhibit much higher antibacterial activity. The MeOH rhizome extracts of 
 <italic>B. scopulosa</italic> were tested on eight different bacteria(s) using the agar-well diffusion assay method. It was concluded from the bacterial susceptibility test that both Gram-ve and +ve bacteria are susceptible as evident from the zone of inhibition that ranged from 13 to 15 mm. However, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were found to be vulnerable, as they were considerably inhibited at a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-05555" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In a similar study, the 
 <italic>B. scopulosa</italic> MeOH extract was tested for its inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, through zone-inhibition assay. It was interesting to note that the inhibitory impact on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was stronger than that on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
