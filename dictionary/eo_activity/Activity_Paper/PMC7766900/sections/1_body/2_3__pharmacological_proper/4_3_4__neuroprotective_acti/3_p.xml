<p>Covalent combination of naringenin with lipoic acid results in the generation of a novel compound, namely “VANL-100”. The in vitro and in vivo models of ischemia/reperfusion have exhibited neuroprotection at very low concentrations of 2 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> µM (100-fold more potent). The reason could be the increased capability of nerve cells in the presence of “VANL-100” to hunt down free radicals [
