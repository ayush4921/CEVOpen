<p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide [

Mutations of DNA, caused by any exogenous stimulus or an endogenous anomaly, in normal cells can result in the uncontrolled division of cells, leading to tumor development and progression. Chemotherapeutic agents appear to exert anti-cancerous activity by assisting in cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the devastating effects of the chemotherapy on the living system are colossal; i.e., every healthy cell and primarily rapidly dividing cells, including gastric mucosa, hair follicle, and bone marrow cells, are deleteriously affected in this process, which restricts their normal functioning [

On the other hand, therapeutically active plant-derived products/components are considered minimally toxic while having significant pharmacological attributes [
