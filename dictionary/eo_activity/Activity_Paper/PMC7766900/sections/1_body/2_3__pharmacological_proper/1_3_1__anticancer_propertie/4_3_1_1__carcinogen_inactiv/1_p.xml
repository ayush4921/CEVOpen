<p>Human enzymes make a significant contribution to the metabolic conversion of pro-carcinogens into active carcinogens. This transformation is largely executed via cytochrome P450. Naringenin antagonizes this conversion and therefore prevents carcinogenesis and damage to the cells [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Naringenin is also known to inhibit the activity of enzyme aromatase (CYP19), which leads to a decrease in the biosynthesis of estrogen. The anti-estrogenic effects so produced may prove to be of significant anti-prostate- and anti-breast-cancer potential [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In estrogen-dependent breast cancer, naringenin has exhibited inhibitory effects on estrogen synthetase enzyme (aromatase), which is involved in the biosynthesis of estrogen, thereby reducing cancer-promoting stimulatory effects of estrogens [
