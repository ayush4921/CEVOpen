<p>Naringenin causes carcinogen inactivation by upregulation of the Uridine 5’-diphospho glucuronosyltransferase, QR, and GST that help in the removal of carcinogens in the body. By inhibition of CYP19, it helps to control breast and prostate cancer. It has anti-proliferative properties exhibited by downregulation of ROS and ODC, and signal transduction enzymes like PTK, PKC, and PIP3 decrease the unwanted proliferation of cells. Naringenin causes cell cycle arrest in G and S phases in cancer cells by inhibiting cyclin, and CDK helps to control leukemia. The increase in caspase, cytochrome, and BAX and the downregulation of BCL2 in mitochondria are caused by naringenin, and the inhibition of ERα-dependent mitogenic signaling cascades activation (e.g., phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT) or by induction of ERα-dependent p38 kinase activation causes pro-apoptotic activities in cancer cells. Naringenin exhibits its angio-inhibitory effect by decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VGFG) and downregulating the TGF-β pathway, thereby decreasing metastasis and invasion in pancreatic cells.</p>
