<p>Presently, natural products have drawn attention because of their potent antimicrobial activities and fewer side effects than chemically synthesized compounds. Natural products are considered safe and are advantageous over antibiotics because of the lesser chances of drug resistance associated with them. It is less likely for bacterial strains to develop resistance against a compound of natural origin because of their multiple mechanisms of action on bacterial cells. Natural products exert their antibacterial activity by interaction with the bacterial membrane and disruption of its integrity, inhibition of enzymes necessary for bacterial membrane synthesis, anti-biofilm activity, or inhibition of auto inducer-mediated cellâ€“cell signaling [
