<p>Naringenin is activated by interaction with serotonin (5-HT4) receptor antagonists, which in turn increase the colonic contractions, enabling the process of gastric emptying [

The possible reason may be the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and decline in expression of target molecules by naringenin [
