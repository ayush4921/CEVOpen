<p>Additionally, involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARÎ³ in NF-kB and MAPK signaling in drug-induced renal toxicity in a rodent model has been reported [
 <xref rid="B151-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Moreover, a marked reduction in levels of interleukin-8, serum creatinine level, and nitric oxide [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] level and reduced GPx activity after naringenin administration in gentamicin-treated rats have been reported [

Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with the release of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and IL-8, which are the kidney damage biomarkers. KIM-1, a glycoprotein, acts as a receptor for phosphatidylserine present on the cells undergoing apoptosis for phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="B153-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>], while IL-8 is an endothelial-derived cytokine responsible for oxidative burst and chemotaxis of neutrophils at the site of inflammation or injury. Immunohistochemical examinations of naringenin-treated tissues have shown significant downregulation of different biomarkers, including VEGF, iNOS, and caspase-9; in contrast, there is enhanced expression of survivin in the renal tissue [
 <xref rid="B152-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Survivin is an anti-apoptotic factor that suppresses apoptosis by either inhibiting activation of caspase-9 [
 <xref rid="B154-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] or by preventing cytochrome-c release via inhibition of Fas/Fas ligand stimulation [
