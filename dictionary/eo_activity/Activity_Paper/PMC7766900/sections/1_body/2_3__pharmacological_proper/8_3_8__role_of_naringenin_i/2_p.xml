Further, naringenin inhibits the inflammatory response in the respiratory tract initiated by microbial products involving pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1, NF-kB, and TNF-a. Naringenin inhibits the degradation of IkB that is bound to the p50/p65 subunit of NF-kB and thereby inhibits NF-kB activity [
