<p>We have investigated the degrading activity of IDE for some NPs, which have been demonstrated to lower the nociceptive threshold, functioning as anti-opioids, as well as inhibiting insulin release from the pancreas. The reported results clearly indicate that IDE is capable of degrading both NPAF and NPFF at specific cleavage sites. Moreover, our results indicate that the degradation of the two NPs is differently affected by the presence of insulin. Indeed, while NPFF degradation is slowed down by the presence of the full-length insulin, the degradation of the longer NPAF is unaffected by the presence of the intact hormone, whereas generation of shorter insulin fragments produced by the action of IDE is responsible for the inhibition of the NPs degradation at longer incubation times. We explain this difference in the inhibitory role of insulin towards the two NPs by considering their different length, and thus structure, which very likely is the cause of a different affinity for the enzyme. An SPR investigation to confirm such hypothesis will be the subject of future work.</p>
