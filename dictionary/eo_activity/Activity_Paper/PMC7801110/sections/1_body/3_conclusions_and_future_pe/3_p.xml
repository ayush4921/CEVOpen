<p>Finally, we have also demonstrated that NPAF, but not NPFF, plays an activatory role on the degradation of insulin by IDE in a site-specific manner, favouring the action of the enzyme mainly at the B13â€“14 insulin cleavage site. Once again, this result demonstrates the pivotal role of IDE in the interplay between NPs and insulin metabolism, giving a molecular insight into the link between type 2 or type 1 diabetes and pain transmission and pain threshold
