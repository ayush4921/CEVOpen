<p>Opioids are involved in the physiological control of numerous functions of the central nervous system. On the other side, some endogenous NPs, called anti-opioids, participate in the homeostatic system and have the function to contradict the effects of opioids

 </xref>. Particularly, some NPs are generated from the NPFF precursor (pro-NPFF(A)): the NPFF (FLFQPQRF) and the NPAF (AGEGLSSPFWSLAAPQRF), also known as morphine-modulating species. They are members of the FMRF-amide family, which is the largest and most diverse family of NPs known. All peptides are sharing the C-terminal-RF amide sequence

 </xref> but their mechanism of action is largely unknown. AF and FF peptides can oppose the acute effects of opioids and their elevated concentrations in the brain may be responsible for the development of tolerance and dependence to opioids. Indeed, NPAF and NPFF lower the nociceptive threshold, attenuate morphine analgesia, inhibit stimulated insulin and somatostatin release from the pancreas, exert anorectic properties, inhibit colonic bead expulsion time, regulate body temperature, increase mean arterial blood pressure, control aldosterone release and adrenal blood supply
