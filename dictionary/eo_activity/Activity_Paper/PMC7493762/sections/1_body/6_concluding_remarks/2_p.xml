<p id="para0055">The potential beneficial effects of SLns on MetS´s risk factors discussed in this review clearly demonstrate that these substances represent remarkable compounds with a diversity of molecular structure and biological activity. These beneficial effects include normalization of blood glucose levels, improvement of blood lipid profiles, anti-inflammatory activity, improvement of insulin sensitivity and normalization of blood pressure. The underlying molecular targets mediating these effects have not been completely understood. Regardless of that, it can be noticed that at least six molecular targets or pathways could explain the effect of SLns on components of MetS: (a) inhibition of α-glucosidase; (b) inhibition of TLR4 signaling; (c) inhibition of NF-κB pathway; (d) dual PPARα/γ agonists; (e) AMPK agonist activity and (f) regeneration and revitalization of the remaining β cells.</p>
