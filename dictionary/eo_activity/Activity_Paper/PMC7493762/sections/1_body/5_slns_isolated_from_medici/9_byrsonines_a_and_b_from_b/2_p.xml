 <italic>Byrsonima crassifolia</italic> (Malpighiaceae), commonly known as “nanche”, is a tropical tree widely distributed in Mexico, Central and South America. This tree is commonly harvested, both for its edible fruit and for its health benefits (

 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">Duarte, 2011</xref>). In folk medicine, the fruit or bark infusion have been used as hypoglycemic remedy (
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Andrade-Cetto and Heinrich, 2005</xref>) and according to ethnomedicinal reports, the antihyperglycemic activity of hexane and chloroform extracts from fruits and seeds of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> in STZ-induced diabetic rats was reported (
 <xref rid="bib0099" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Gutierrez et al., 2010</xref>). The phytochemical analysis of antihyperglycemic extract from the seed of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> revealed that byrsonines A (
 <bold>14</bold>) and B (
 <bold>15</bold>) (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ), two dimeric guaianolides, are responsible for the antioxidant, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities (
 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">Gutiérrez and Ramirez, 2016</xref>). In particular, it has been proposed that the antihyperglycemic activity of these compounds may involve both pancreatic and extra pancreatic mechanisms, based on the observed increase in serum insulin level and the reduction of hepatic glucose output via decreasing glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity and increasing glucokinase activity (
 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">Gutiérrez and Ramirez, 2016</xref>). Although the mechanisms underlying the antihyperglycemic activity of 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> have not been completely explored, this effect could likely be ascribed to the activation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of the AMPK pathway in the liver regulates glucose homeostasis by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and downregulating the expression of gluconeogenic genes, including G6Pase gene expression. Targeting AMPK by natural products demonstrated considerable success in lowering blood glucose levels (
 <xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, more experimental research is needed to substantiate this claim.
