<p id="para0052">Animal experiments show considerable toxicity after the application of artemisinin family (neurotoxicity, embryotoxicity, genotoxicity, hemato- and immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and allergic reactions), but large clinical studies and meta-analyzes did not show serious human side effects, although proper monitoring of adverse effects in developing countries may not be a trivial task. There is a paucity of large-scale clinical trials adequate to detect rare but significant toxicity. The lesson learned from animal and human studies is that long-term availability rather than short-term peak concentrations of artemisinin cause toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">Efferth and Kaina, 2010</xref>). Thus, the observation of the toxicity of artemisinin derivatives in animals, but not in humans, is most likely due to different pharmacokinetic profiles after different routes of administrations.
