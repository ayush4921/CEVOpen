 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) is a cadinanolide endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone originally isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisa annua</italic> Linn in 1972 (
 <xref rid="bib0126" ref-type="bibr">Tu, 2016</xref>). Nowadays, 
 <bold>18</bold> and their derivatives are part of the protocols for malaria treatment (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Bridgford et al., 2018</xref>). Experimental studies have also established their effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and vascular protection agent (
 <xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Efferth, 2017</xref>). Regarding to vascular protection, 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al. (2020</xref>) demonstrated that oral administration of artemisinin (
 <bold>18</bold>) effectively alleviated inflammatory response (MCP-1, IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α), elevated macrophage autophagy, suppressed foamy macrophage transformation, and thereby inhibiting atherosclerotic plaque formation in high-fat diet treated ApoE
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. In addition, 
 <bold>18</bold> has been discovered to be a potential therapeutic agent for ameliorating type 1 diabetes because of its ability to promote the conversion of pancreatic glucagon-producing α cells to insulin-secreting β cells in rats (
 <xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the widespread application of artemisinin as an anti-malarial drug could contributed to the selection of resistant strains of the etiologic agent 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, thus its use to combating non-communicable human diseases would raise the risk for this selection and lead to an important drug resistance development. Some authors have suggested that unless necessary, artemisinin (
 <bold>18</bold>) should be replaced by other therapeutic agents for the treatment of versatile types of human diseases (
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">Dong-Sheng et al., 2017</xref>).
