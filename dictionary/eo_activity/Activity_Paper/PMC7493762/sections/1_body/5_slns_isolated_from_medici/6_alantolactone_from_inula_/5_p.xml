<p id="para0034">Besides the effect on adipocytes, alantolactone (
 <bold>6</bold>) can also act in skeletal muscle and liver cells. In this context, the compound 
 <bold>6</bold> inhibits IL-6-induced insulin-stimulated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle through blockade the activation of STAT3 and the abnormal expression of TLR4 (

 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>). In L02 cells, alantolactone (
 <bold>6</bold>) also inhibits oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation trough regulating the apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) expression partly by decreasing the activation of STAT3 (
