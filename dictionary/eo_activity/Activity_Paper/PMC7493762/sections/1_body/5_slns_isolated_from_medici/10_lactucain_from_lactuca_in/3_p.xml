 <xref rid="bib0058" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, there are no evidences about the possible mechanism of action and no further research has been made about this compound. As mentioned before, dimeric SLns could show an important activity in components of MetS derived from their double α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone ring. Because of its hypoglycemic properties and chemical structure, 
 <bold>16</bold> is also a candidate to further studies that analyze deeply its effect in blood glucose levels and some other MetS´s components. No 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity studies on luctucain C (
 <bold>16</bold>) have been reported to date.
