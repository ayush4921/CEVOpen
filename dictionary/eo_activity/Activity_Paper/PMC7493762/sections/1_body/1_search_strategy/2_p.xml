<p id="para0006">An electronic literature search was conducted on SLns with hypoglycemic and/or hypolipidemic effects and isolated from plants used in traditional medicine for the same purposes. The search was done in databases of Google Scholar, Science Direct, and SciFinder until June 2020 using the keyword sesquiterpene lactones and following terms: metabolic syndrome, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and medicinal plants. Additional information was identified from references located in the retrieved articles. Although many SLns were screened in some of the studies, only those considered active by the authors are included in this review. The plants included in this review were selected based on their ethnomedicinal records. For each species, the currently accepted name in the online “The Plant List” database has been checked and the reported name has been replaced with the current one. Compound class, plant source, biological activity and important aspects related with MetS are summarized in the
