<p id="Par30">Sixty-four taxa were recorded as traditional Myanmar medicinal plants in the selected literature on traditional Myanmar medicine, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In these publications and studies, 57 taxa were recorded in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 21 in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and 15 in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Appendix B). Comparing the local health knowledge recorded in the present study and the records of these previous selected publications and studies, the local health knowledge of 35 taxa was similar to the records in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 17 taxa in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and five taxa in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Nevertheless, forty-seven taxa were not recorded in the three selected studies but were still used as healthy vegetables by local people.
