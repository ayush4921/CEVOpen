<p id="Par27">In total, 2361 URs were obtained from 277 informants. Twenty-five taxa had more than 100 URs, while nine had just one UR. The top five species with the highest UR and UV values were mango (
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic>, UR = 504, UV = 1.819), chili (
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>, UR = 455, UV = 1.643), okra (
 <italic>Abelmoschus esculentus</italic>, UR = 380, UV = 1.372), water spinach (
 <italic>Ipomoea aquatica</italic>, FC = 310, UV = 1.119) and cucumber (
 <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>, UR = 273, UV = 0.986). The RFC results were slightly different from the FC and UV results. Chili, eggplant (
