<p id="Par43">Among the taxa recorded, 57 species were also noted as medicinal plants by Defilipps and Krupnick [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], of which 35 species had functions similar to those noted in the results of our study. Likewise, 22 species and 15 species were found in common with the herbal book edited by the Ministry of Health Department of Traditional Medicine of Myanmar in 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and with the results of Kyaw Soe and Tin Myo Ngwe in 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], respectively. All of the vegetables collected from the wild are used for both food and traditional medicine [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These species are common in the natural vegetation of central Myanmar. In traditional Myanmar medicine, 
 <italic>Dregea volubilis</italic>, the most commonly used wild species, is used to treat multiple diseases, such as indigestion, dyspepsia, dysentery, diarrhoea and insomnia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The functional compounds of the species are a group of dregeosides that have effective anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> can treat symptoms of insomnia and forgetfulness, according to the informants. In traditional Myanmar medicine, 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is used to treat memory impairment, oliguria and eye diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. A modern study found that an extract of the species had effective anti-Alzheimer’s disease properties [
