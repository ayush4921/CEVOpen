<p id="Par44">Even the most common vegetables worldwide, such as 
 <italic>Solanum melongena</italic> and 
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>, which had the highest RFC values in the present study, are used in particular ways for health care by local people. The informants claimed that 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic> is a good tonic for treating weakness, and 
 <italic>B. rapa</italic> is used to treat cancer and skin infection (external use). Previous studies have shown that these vegetables contain some functional compounds with effective properties for human health [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. For example, glucosinolates, a group of effective compounds found in 
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>, have many potential functions, such as anti-microbial, anti-cancer and anti-parasite properties [
