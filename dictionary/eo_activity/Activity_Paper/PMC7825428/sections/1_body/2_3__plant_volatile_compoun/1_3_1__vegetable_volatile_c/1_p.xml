 <xref rid="B132-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Nonetheless, lower concentrations of volatile compounds must be considered, because one compound could be lower than 1µL/L but odour active. In pepper, the “sweetness”, “spicy”, “floral”, and “herbal” characteristics are caused by a mixture of volatile compounds—(
