<p>Flavonoids are largely distributed in vegetables and they have been studied mainly because of their potential health benefits as antioxidants and chemopreventive agents [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, until now no recommended daily intake of these compounds has been established mainly because the composition data are incomplete, the biological activities are not well determined, and especially because the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic data are inconclusive. Emerging science from some studies suggests that flavonoid-rich diets may lower the risk of some diet-related chronic degenerative diseases [

Numerous dietary phenolic compounds are antioxidants able to quench ROS and toxic free radicals formed from the peroxidation of lipids and, consequently, have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Flavonoids are recognised as preventing the production of free radicals by chelating iron and copper ions to directly scavenge ROS and toxic free radicals and inhibit lipid peroxidation, which may damage DNA, lipids, and proteins, linked to ageing, atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases [
