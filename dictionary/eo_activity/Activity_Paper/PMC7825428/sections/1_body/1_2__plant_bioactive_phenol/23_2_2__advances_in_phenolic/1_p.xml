<p>As plant bioactive phenolic compounds have received increasing attention in recent years [

 <xref rid="B116-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], the research concerning their biosynthesis, biological activities, extraction, purification processes, and chemical characterisations are of the utmost interest. New analytical strategies, such as Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Mass spectrometry (MS), have demonstrated their use in the identification of new molecular structures and characterisation of plant phenolic profiles [

 <xref rid="B118-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] focused on most recent advances in plant phenolic research such as the functional characterisation of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids; the evaluation of pre- and postharvest treatments to increase the phenolic concentrations of different plants and the chemical characterisation of the phenolic profiles from different plants, and the evaluation of their bioactivities. Therefore, the development of analytical methods for exploring qualitative or quantitative approaches to analyse these bioactive phenolic compounds, in different plants, is essential. Sample preparation and optimisation of the extraction process (solid–liquid extraction, ultrasound-assisted extractions, microwave-assisted extractions, supercritical fluid extraction) are essential for achieving higher accuracy of results [

 <xref rid="B121-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. According to Swallah et al. [
 <xref rid="B122-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] it is difficult to choose a universal method for the preparation and extraction of phenolic compounds from different plants, as they have different polarities, molecular structures, concentrations, hydroxyl groups, and several aromatic rings involved. Their analysis can be carried out by using different methods such as spectrophotometry, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and near-infrared spectroscopy, which are required to develop rapid, sensitive, and reliable methods [

 <xref rid="B124-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Another challenge is the analysis of polymeric phenolic compounds, as their polydispersity results in poor resolution and detection, an example of which is proanthocyanidins, which have polydisperse structures for which method development is needed; consequently, characterising the unknown phenolic is one of the main challenges in the research on plant polyphenols [
