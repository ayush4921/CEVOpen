<p>The hydroxycinnamic acids (C
 <sub>6</sub>-C
 <sub>3</sub> derivatives) are more abundant than the hydroxybenzoic acids. The four most common hydroxycinnamic acids are ferulic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and sinapic acid. These acids are frequently present in plants in the combined forms such as glycosylated derivatives or esters of tartaric acid, shikimic acid, and quinic acid rather than in the free form. Hydroxycinnamic acids are recognized as powerful antioxidants playing an essential role in protecting the body from free radicals. Several hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and sinapic acid, present strong antioxidant activities by inhibiting lipid oxidation and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
