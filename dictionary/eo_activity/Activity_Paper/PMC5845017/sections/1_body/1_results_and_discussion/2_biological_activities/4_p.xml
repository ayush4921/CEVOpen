<p id="Par13">The equivalence between the therapeutic effect on cancer cell lines and the toxicological effect on target human organs is an important criterion of the applicability of an anticancer compound. Therefore, we conducted toxicological studies on the V79–4 cell line (lung fibroblast cell line derived from Chinese hamsters) to determine the safe concentration range of polygonumins A. This test has been widely used to evaluate general cytotoxicity and target organ toxicity

 </sup>. The results indicated a loss of viability of V79–4 fibroblasts at concentrations above 50 µg/ml following approximately 24 hours of exposure. Thus, the compound is approximately 10 times as toxic towards cancer cells and normal cells at these concentrations, as it is at its therapeutic concentration.
