<p>PON1 is a glycoprotein Ca2+-dependent ester hydrolase, which is synthesized in the liver and is found in HDL in human serum, consisting of 355 amino acids [43]. PON1 is an enzyme with paraoxonase, arylesterase, and lactonase activities that can react with a wide variety of substrates [44]. The three-dimensional structure of a hybrid mammalian recombinant PON1 variant obtained by directed evolution (rePON1) was recently determined providing the first structural information about this hydrolase family, and this structure was named 1V04 [45]. The biological activity of synthesized zinc and gallium phthalocyanine complexes (1) and (2) against hCA I, hCA II, and PON enzymes was attempted to be elucidated by molecular simulation method. Secondary chemical interactions between the amino acid residues of the 4WR7, 5AML, and 1V04 target proteins and the complexes studied were also investigated. In the coupling studies, the estimated free energy of the binding values and the binding modes of the target proteins and metal complexes is given in Table 2 and Figure 5, respectively. According to the docking results in Table 2, the inhibition activities between the complexes and the target proteins, the gallium complex (2) is greater than the inhibition activity of the zinc complex (1). Gallium complex is located in the symmetry cavity of the 4WR7 target protein. Since the gallium complex contains chlorine atoms, it contains a halogen bond in the secondary chemical interaction type. The halogen bond occurs between the chlorine atom bound to the gallium metal and the Gln92 amino acid residue. Also, the gallium complex is in polar interaction with the target protein.</p>
