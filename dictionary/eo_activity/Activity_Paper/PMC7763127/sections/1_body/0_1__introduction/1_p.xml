<p>Phthalocyanines (Pcs), an important family of porphyrinoid complexes, have many applications such as gas sensors [1], solar cells [2], liquid crystals phases [3,4], electrochromic materials [5], and photosensitizer [6–9] in photodynamic therapy (PDT). For these applications, the photophysical and photochemical features of phthalocyanines can be fine-tuned by the introduction of various substituent groups. It is also known that the physical and chemical properties of the complex depend significantly on the nature of the metal atom coordinated to the phthalocyanine ring [8,10,11]. The lack of water solubility of phthalocyanines limits their use in many areas. Also, water solubility is very important for cancer treatments because the complexes are injected into the patient’s bloodstream with a hydrophilic system [12]. Water-soluble phthalocyanines continue to attract attention to their interactions with DNA and their ability to trigger DNA photodamage by accumulating in many cancer cells. Sulfonate, carboxylate, and phosphorus groups can be used from anionic substituents to the macrocyclic ring by various intermediates or directly attached to the phthalocyanine complexes. In particular, the binding of sulfonic acid groups to the phthalocyanine ring has two important effects: they increase the effectiveness of their antitumor properties [13], and by inducing the repulsion of phthalocyanine rings, they become water-soluble as monomers [9,12,14]. Also, in the literature, gallium and zinc metal complexes of the phthalocyanines are examined due to their superior antitumor properties [13]. Thus, these phthalocyanines are beneficial to PDT and various biological applications.</p>
