<p>The structural CAs and SCEs were analyzed both in the presence as well as in the absence of ethanol extract from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic>. This plant was chosen because it contained a range of terpenoids (e.g. andrographolide), which are reported to induce differentiation of cancer cells. Furthermore, the plant extract has been reported to exert a broad-range of antiproliferative activity on a variety of cancer cell lines including Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 breast cancer cell lines, colon, cervical, prostate cancers, and leukemia (

The lymphocyte cultures treated with different concentrations of EAP (50 âˆ¼250 mg/mL) did not show any significant changes in CAs and SCEs. In addition, the genotoxic effects of CPA were significantly reduced in lymphocytes co-treated with CPA+EAP. These results substantiate that 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> is non mutagenic and has a protective effect against CPA induced genotoxicity.
