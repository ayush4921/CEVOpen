<p>The amount of total phenolic content of EAP was determined according to the method of 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Singleton et al. (1999)</xref> with slight modifications. One hundred microliter of extract (concentration 20 Î¼g/mL) was mixed with 0.2 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 2 mL of distilled water, and 1 mL of 15% sodium carbonate solution. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, optical density (OD) values were measured at 765 nm using UV-visible spectrometer. A calibration graph was plotted using different concentrations of gallic acid (on 
 <italic>x</italic> axis) as standard and their corresponding OD values (on 
 <italic>y</italic> axis). The total phenolics were extrapolated from the graph and expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE) per g of extract, dry weight.
