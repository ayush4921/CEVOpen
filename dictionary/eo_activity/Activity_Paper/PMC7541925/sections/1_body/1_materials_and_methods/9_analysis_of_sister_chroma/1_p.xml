<p>For SCE analysis, the lymphocyte culture was set up as follows: Briefly, 0.5 mL blood sample was added to a sterile culture vial containing 5 mL RPMI-1640 medium supplemented 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (3 μg/mL), tightly corked and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, the lymphocytes were treated individually with different concentrations of EAP (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/mL), CPA (100 μg/mL) alone, and co-treated with CPA+EAP (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/mL). The normal controls (untreated cultures) were also run simultaneously. The culture vials were incubated for 48 h. The cultures were exposed to colchicine (0.06 μg/mL) for 1 h before harvesting. Hypotonic treatment with potassium chloride and fixation were done in the same way as described earlier for CA. The slides for microscopic observation were processed according to the method described earlier by
