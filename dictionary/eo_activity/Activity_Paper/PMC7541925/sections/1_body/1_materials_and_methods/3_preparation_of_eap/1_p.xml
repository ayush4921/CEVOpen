<p>The extract was prepared using methods described by 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Stefanović et al. (2015)</xref> with slight modifications. The powdered plant material (leaves) was extracted by maceration with ethanol. Plant material (50 g) was soaked with 500 mL of ethanol for 24 h at room temperature and then filtered. The residue from the filtration was extracted again, twice, using the same procedure. The filtrates obtained were combined and then evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator at 40°C. The extract was stored in sterile tubes at 20°C until needed.
