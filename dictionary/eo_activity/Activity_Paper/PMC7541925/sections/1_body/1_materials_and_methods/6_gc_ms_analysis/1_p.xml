<p>Powdered plant material (5 g) was soaked in 95% ethanol overnight and then filtered through a Whatman no. 41 filter paper. Two grams of sodium sulphate was added to the filtrate to remove traces of water and the filtrate is then concentrated by bubbling nitrogen gas into the solution. GC-MS analysis of the extract was performed using a Perkin Elmer GC Clarus 500 system and Gas Chromatograph (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) interfaced to a mass spectrometer equipped with an Elite-5MS fused silica capillary column (30×0.25 mm I.D.×1 mm d
 <sub>f</sub>, composed of 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl poly siloxane). For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV was used. Helium gas (99.999%) was used as the carrier at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min and an injection volume of 3 μL was employed (split ratio of 10:1). Injector temperature 250°C; ion-source temperature 280°C. The oven temperature was programmed from 110°C (isothermal for 2 min) with an increase of 10°C/min to 200°C, then 5°C/min to 280°C ending with a 9 min isothermal at 280°C. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV, a scan interval of 0.5 s, and fragments from 45 to 450 Da. The relative percentage amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total areas. Software adopted to handle mass spectra and chromatograms was a TurboMass version 5.2.0 (PerkinElmer, Inc.). Interpretation on mass-spectrum GC-MS was conducted using the database of National institute Standard and Technology (NIST) having over 62,000 patterns. The spectrum of the unknown components was compared with the spectrum of known components stored in the NIST library and the molecular weight and structure of the components of the test materials were ascertained.
