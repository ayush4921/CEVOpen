<p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are responsible for regulating the immune system by suppressing T-cell function and inhibiting liver inflammation. Through interaction TRPV1 receptor, CBD is shown to activate MDSCs, thereby inhibiting inflammation and hepatitis in a murine model [

In a concanavalin A model of acute hepatitis in mice, Hegde and colleagues report that CBD was able to reduce ConA-induced inflammation by inhibiting the production and release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, and protect the mice from acute liver injury [
