<p>The 
 <italic>Tillandsia</italic> L. genus is made up of approximately 650 species and belongs to the Bromeliaceae family endemic to North and South America and the Caribbean. Pineapples, although of a different genus (
 <italic>Ananas</italic>), are also of the Bromeliaceae family. These species differ in growth habit, trichrome distribution, type of fruit, seed, leaflet, photosynthesis, type of pollinator, and its epiphytes [

 <italic>T. recurvata</italic> has been used in traditional medicine to treat kidney inflammation (Bolivia), rheumatism, ulcers and hemorrhoids (Brazil), menstrual disorders (Mexico), eye infection (Uruguay), and Leucorrhea (USA). Most species of the 
 <italic>Tillandsia</italic> L. genus are epiphytes on trees, inert substrates, rocky slopes, phone wires, electricity lines, or may survive independently in soil. It should be noted that 
 <italic>Tillandsia usneoides</italic> (L.) L. (“Spanish Moss”) and 
 <italic>T. recurvata</italic> (“Ball Moss”) are not mosses but, instead, are angiosperms—produces flowers. The primary compounds in Tillandsia genus are triterpenoids and sterols (51%), flavonoids (45%) and cinnamic acid (4%). Lowe and colleagues discovered Dicinnamoyl-Glycerol Esters in the ball moss plant, with both anti-cancer and anti-HIV properties (US patent #US8907117B2) [
