 <italic>A. sativum</italic> is a member of the onion genus, 
 <italic>Allium</italic>. It is another spice that is traditionally used in fundamental dishes around the world, but has also been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. It has a wide therapeutic window as an antiviral, antioxidant and antibacterial against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and is antiprotozoal against 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> [

Anecdotal and scientific data also confirm garlic’s therapeutic efficacy against diabetes, cancer, free-radical damage, atherosclerosis, heavy metal intoxication and hyperlipidemia. Garlic produces many bioactive compounds including flavonoids, enzymes, fructo-oligosaccharides, Maillard reaction products, and organosulfur compounds like S-allylcysteine, diallyl polysulfides, alliin, vinyldithins, allicin (diallyl thio-sulfinate), allyl methyl thiosulfinate, and ajoene [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00607" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These are responsible for garlic’s wide therapeutic window, including as an antiviral against 
 <italic>influenza A</italic> and 
 <italic>B, HSV-1</italic> and 
 <italic>HSV-2</italic>, common cold, and viral pneumonia among other respiratory viruses [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00607-f014">Figure 14</xref> is a graphical representation of the conversion of organosulfur compounds in garlic. Organosulfur compounds demonstrate antiviral activity via inhibition of various stages of the general virus life cycle including viral attachment, entry and multiplication [
