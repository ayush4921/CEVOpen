<p>Viral infections like the human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), herpes simplex virus (HSV), respiratory viruses like; rotaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), influenza A virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) that causes the human coronavirus (COVID19), tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C viruses, malaria, yellow virus fever (YVF), human papilloma virus (HPV), dengue-virus type 2 (DENV-2) and coxsackie virus all represent a significant global burden. In modern Western medicine, natural preventative and therapeutic alternatives are increasingly gaining attention because of greater accessibility to medicinal plants, and the possibility that they may have fewer and less adverse side-effects, are safer, and have potentially greater therapeutic efficacy than synthetic drugs. These make natural alternatives more desirable as novel drug therapies. Interest in phytoantivirals has also been renewed because of the increasing global burden of viral infections, particularly those that are newly emerging, and increasing antiviral resistance among viral strains against conventional synthetic antivirals drugs like Acyclovir and Ganciclovir.</p>
