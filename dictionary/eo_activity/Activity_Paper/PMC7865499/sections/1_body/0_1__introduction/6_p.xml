<p>Despite the increasing clinical research on phytoantivirals, there is need for more rigorous screening of more plants to identify new phytochemicals. Further research is required to determine the efficacy, dosage standards, optimum extraction methods/solvents, cytotoxicity/hepatoxicity, pharmacokinetics, molecular mechanisms of action, phytoantiviral screening methods, and drug interactions for many phytoantivirals.</p>
