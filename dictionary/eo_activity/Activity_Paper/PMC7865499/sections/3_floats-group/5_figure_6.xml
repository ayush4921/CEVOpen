  <p>A possible antiviral mechanism of DTS in an infected cell. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK ERK1/ERK2 pathway) is a signaling pathway that is responsible for the transduction of protein components (chemical signals, transcription factors), MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K), and a final kinase, MAP kinase (MAPK), leading to the functioning and regulation of multiple cellular processes like cell proliferation, cell growth, and cell survival. A dysregulation of this pathway or any of its components typically has pathological consequences [

   <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00607" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It has been proposed that some pathological conditions are characterized by increased phosphorylation of kinases [
   <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00607" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], possibly resulting in over-proliferation of cells. Dibenzyl trisulfide (DTS) is shown to inhibit the MAPK ERK1/ERK2 pathway in cancer- and (possibly) virally infected cells via dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, ultimately resulting in apoptosis of the cell [
