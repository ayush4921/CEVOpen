<p>Moreover, rational drug design highlights the possible binding mode of these compounds towards the key anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets. These data could be useful to suggest structural chemical modifications to improve the in-silico binding affinity. We expect scientists to perform relevant experimental studies to provide new derivatives within COVID-19 prevention and treatment, starting from the appropriate and most promising natural scaffolds.</p>
