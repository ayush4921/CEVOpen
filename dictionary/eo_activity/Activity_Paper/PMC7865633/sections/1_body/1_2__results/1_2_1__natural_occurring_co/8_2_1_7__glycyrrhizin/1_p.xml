 <bold>Glycyrrhizin</bold>, an active component of liquorice roots, was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Combining high throughput screening (HTS) and computational approaches, for terpene-based compounds, it was analyzed the likelihood of Glycyrrhizin to insert between SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex. In detail, it is worth noting that Glycyrrhizin recognized Asn501, Gln498, Gly496, Tyr449, Tyr453, and Glu484 by means of hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts with Tyr489, Phe456, and Leu455 [

Other glycyrrhizin involvements could be summarized as follows: (1) targeting S-RBD-ACE2 complex, (2) controlling pro-inflammatory cytokines, (3) preventing the accumulation of the intracellular ROS, (4) controlling thrombi, (5) preventing the fast production of airway exudates, and (6) persuading endogenous interferon against SARS-CoV-2 [
