 <sub>50</sub> values were not still calculated. Despite the encouraging results of these natural compounds, in vitro steps were halted. Some drawbacks probably related to the extraction of these compounds from plants or the chemical synthesis difficulties did not permit further biological investigations. Recently, in-vitro study revealed that neohesperidin could inhibit infected Vero E6 cell [
