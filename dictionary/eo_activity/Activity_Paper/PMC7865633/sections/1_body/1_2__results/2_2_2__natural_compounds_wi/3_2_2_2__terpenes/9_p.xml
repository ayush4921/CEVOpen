<p>In addition to the activity against ACE2, the binding affinity of triterpene derivatives and steroid-based compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was explored. The 
 <bold>ursodeoxycholic acid</bold> formed two hydrogen bonds with Phe140 and Ser46 residues, while Met49, Met165, Cys145, and Leu141 residues participated in hydrophobic interactions that enhanced stability of the protein-ligand complex. These in silico results showed that ursodeoxycholic acid had potential viral inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and human ACE2 protein, but further experimental validations are needed to confirm their biological activity [
