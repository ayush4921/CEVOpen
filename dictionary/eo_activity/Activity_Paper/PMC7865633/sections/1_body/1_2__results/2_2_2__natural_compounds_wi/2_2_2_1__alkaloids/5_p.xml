 <bold>Schizanthine Z</bold> and 
 <bold>schizanthine Y</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f013">Figure 13</xref>) were able to recognize the protein through the interaction with Tyr164 and Tyr173 residues; meanwhile, 
 <bold>schizanthine Y</bold> engaged an additional hydrogen bond with Tyr168. The in-vitro experiments are highly recommended [
