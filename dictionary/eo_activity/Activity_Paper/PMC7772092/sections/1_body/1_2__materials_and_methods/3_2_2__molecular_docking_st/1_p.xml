<p>The docking interactions were studied with the help of the Maestro v. 11.5 (Schrödinger Inc., New York, NY, USA) on a Mac workstation. The study was done to identify the possible binding interactions of selected ligands with the active site of the receptor. The ligand structures of the dataset were prepared by the LigPrep module of Maestro v. 11.5 [23,24]. Ligands were assisted by grid-based molecular docking to bind in more than one possible conformation. The protein structure was prepared using the protein preparation wizard (preprocessed, optimized, and minimized) in Maestro v. 11.5 [25]. The protonation and tautomeric states of amino acids were adjusted to match a pH of 7.4. Grid generation was done using the receptor grid generation module of Maestro v.11.5 [26]; 0.25 Å, scaling factor, and 1.0 Å, partial charge cut off for van der Waals radius were applied. Docking was carried out using XP (extra precision) mode. Glide molecular docking was utilized for the evaluation of binding interactions and ligand flexibility. Binding energies were calculated in kcal/mol. XP Visualizer was used for the analysis of the specific ligand–protein interactions. The compounds with the highest docking scores in negative and good interaction profiles were the most active compounds against the target receptor protein [27–29]. The 2D interaction diagrams of rilpivirine, elvitegravir, and designed compounds are mentioned in Table 4.</p>
