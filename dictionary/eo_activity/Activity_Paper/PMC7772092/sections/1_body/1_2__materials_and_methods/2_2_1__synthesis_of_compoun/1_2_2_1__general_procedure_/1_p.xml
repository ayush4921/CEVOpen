<p>POCl3 (6.9 mL,74.07 mM) was added by drops via a dropping funnel to DMF (1.09 mL, 14.81 mM) at 0–5 °C; the mixture was stirred for 5 min. Acetanilide (1 g, 7.40 mM) was then added to the reaction mixture and the resulting solution was refluxed for 9 h at 90 °C. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then poured into crushed ice and stirred. Precipitate appeared at once, and was filtered, washed with water, and dried. The crude compound was then purified by column chromatography [19].</p>
