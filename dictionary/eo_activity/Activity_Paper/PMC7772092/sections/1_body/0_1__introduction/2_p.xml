<p>HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme specifically synthesizes double-stranded DNA from single-stranded viral RNA and is an important target for anti-HIV drug development. In the early 1990s, potent HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) with significant clinical activity were developed. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are leading drugs in the treatment of HIV-1 infections [2]. NNRTIs are capable of reducing the viral reservoirs in the brain due to their high lipophilicity because of the absence of sugar molecules in their structure. Currently, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combination therapy is used for the treatment of HIV to avoid the development of resistance against a single drug, but it also causes psychiatric and neurological side effects [3]. Hence, there is a dire need for novel anti-HIV agents with fewer side effects.</p>
