<p>Quinoline derivatives were designed concerning the structures of standard anti-HIV drugs and synthesized via chalcones as intermediates. The synthesized compounds were characterized by physicochemical and spectral means. Molecular docking studies were performed on the synthesized compounds for their HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity by using elvitegravir and rilpivirine as standard drugs; promising results were obtained. Compound 4 was found to have the highest affinity towards the reverse transcriptase protein (docking score = –10.67). In general, quinoline derivatives containing pyrimidine moiety (4–8) showed higher docking scores than those possessing pyrazoline moiety (9–14). SAR studies of the synthesized compounds were also performed based on their docking scores, which revealed that in the case of pyrimidine derivatives, a phenyl ring with an electron-withdrawing bromo group and a free amino group (attached to the pyrimidine ring) showed better binding affinity. In the case of pyrazoline derivatives, naphthalene attached to the pyrazoline ring showed better results compared to the p-Br-phenyl ring. Substitution of the phenyl ring attached to the N atom of the pyrazoline ring with halogen atoms at p-position showed better results compared to that at the m-position; substitution with the bromo group showed better binding affinity than chloro and fluoro groups. Thus, based on the docking results, we can say that the synthesized compounds have the potential to serve as important leads in the discovery of new NNRTIs.</p>
