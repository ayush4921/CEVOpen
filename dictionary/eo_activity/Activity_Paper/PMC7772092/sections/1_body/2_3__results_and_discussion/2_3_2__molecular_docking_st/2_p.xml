<p>The docking profile demonstrated that all of the proposed ligands displayed a defined and strong binding affinity for the reverse transcriptase, as indicated by their docking score values. From 2D and 3D interaction diagrams of elvitegravir (Table 4, Figure 5), it was found that standard inhibitor binds to the target site; showed hydrogen bonding interaction with LYS 101, ILE-180, and LEU-100 and docking score (–8.57). The standard drug rilpivirine also showed hydrogen bonding with LYS 101; its docking score was –8.56 (literature value = –7.61) [33]. The designed compounds fit best in the allosteric site of HIV reverse transcriptase. Compounds 4–8 showed better docking scores than standard drugs (rilpivirine and elvitegravir), whereas the docking scores of designed compounds 11–13 were comparable with the standard drugs. In series 1, compounds 4, 5, and 7 exhibited the best docking scores (–10.67, –10.38, and –10.23, respectively) and displayed hydrophobic interactions with TRP229 and hydrogen bond interactions with LYS 101. Compounds 6 and 8, containing a phenyl ring attached to the phenyl amino group, exhibited slightly high docking scores (–10.19 and –9.96, respectively). Compound 6 showed hydrophobic interactions with TYR 188 and PHE 227, whereas compound 8 showed hydrophobic interactions with TYR 188 only. The lower docking score of compound 6 compared to compound 8 was due to the presence of a p-Br-phenyl moiety in compound 6 in place of a p-tolyl moiety at the fourth position of the pyrimidine ring. In series 2, the only member (compound 14) containing a naphthalene ring attached to the fifth position of the dihydropyrazole ring had the best docking score (–9.34), which was lower than those of both standard drugs; this compound showed hydrophobic interactions with TYR 188 and TRP 229. Compound 11 demonstrated pi-pi interactions witha docking score (–8.76) which was lower than those of both standard drugs. Compound 12 exhibited a docking score (–8.51) comparable to those of both standard drugs. The only difference between compounds 11 and 12 was the presence of p-Br-phenyl and p-F-phenyl in these compounds, respectively. The result suggested that compounds 9, 10, and 13 came up with higher docking score values than both standard drugs.</p>
