<p>The currently used approach is focused on weight reduction and physical activity. However, it has been reported that polyphenolic extracts from various plants may positively influence different features of metabolic syndrome and control hyperlipidemia in people with obesity, by directly influencing the activities of metabolic enzymes [

Indeed, anti-inflammatory drugs such as Naproxen, Celecoxib, and Indomethacin are harmful for the digestive system and can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach ulcers [

Alternatively, plants and their products have been used as drugs for thousands of years, and the recently renewed interest in researching effective drugs with less adverse effects has provided a definitive stimulus for the development of natural product chemistry.
