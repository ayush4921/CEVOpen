<p>The group IB phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub> gene has previously been associated to human obesity and diabetes [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] because of the catalytic activity of its encoded enzyme, which liberates lysophospholipids. The absorption of these lysophospholipids promotes insulin resistance and tissue lipid deposition [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It has also been reported that group IB phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub> deficiency protects against high-carbohydrate diet-induced hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Remarkably, the secretion of this enzyme predominantly during the gastrointestinal digestion suggests that oral administration of inhibitors may be a viable option for a potential therapy to suppress obesity and diabetes [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], hence the importance to discover new natural group IB PLA
 <sub>2</sub> inhibitors.
