<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the inhibitory effect of ethanolic extract is found to be ~2 to 3 times higher than that obtained with aqueous extract which could be related to elevated phenolic and flavonoids content of ethanolic fractions of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> that inhibit enzyme activities more specifically compared to aqueous extract, as previously described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, such as the case of digestive lipolytic enzymes (lipases and phospholipases, 
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), the inhibitory effect of the two extracts was more pronounced than those obtained with positive controls, which were acarbose for 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase and allopurinol for XO.
