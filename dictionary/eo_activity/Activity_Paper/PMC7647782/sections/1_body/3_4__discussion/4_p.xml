<p>Metabolic syndrome is one of the greatest threats to global health, especially because it increases the probability of developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, and includes conditions such as obesity, atherosclerosis, and hypertension, or a combination of these metabolic abnormalities [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. People with syndrome should consume limited quantities of carbohydrates to maintain a balanced metabolism, which makes the inhibition of dietary carbohydrate digestion a logical target for pharmacological intervention, to reduce energy intake through gastrointestinal mechanisms. One of the effective solutions is to delay the glucose absorption through inhibition of key carbohydrate producing digestive enzymes. The major source of carbohydrates in the diet comes from starch, which is firstly hydrolyzed in the mouth by salivary amylase and thereafter by pancreatic 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, producing disaccharides, which will be broken down to glucose by 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase in the intestine. Another biocatalyst, which is not considered a digestive enzyme but plays an important role in various forms of vascular injuries, is XO. It has previously been reported that the inhibition of the enzyme activity may exert beneficial effects on impaired vascular function associated or not with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, our purpose is to find a new natural, plant-based drug that could at the same time block XO activity and retard glucose absorption through the inhibition of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes such as 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase to prevent metabolic syndrome.
