<p>Data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrated that the inhibition of trypsin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>) and chymotrypsin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>) by ethanolic or aqueous extracts is limited, and complete inhibition was not achieved at the concentrations used (0 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) compared to positive control. This finding is supported by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values presented in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. BBI had the higher inhibitory effect on trypsin activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 11.5 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, followed by ethanolic extract with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 84.1 ± 2.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and by aqueous extract with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> higher than 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The same result was obtained with chymotrypsin, which lost its IC
 <sub>50</sub> at a concentration of 10.8 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL compared to 77.5 ± 1.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for ethanolic extract and a value higher than 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for aqueous extract.
