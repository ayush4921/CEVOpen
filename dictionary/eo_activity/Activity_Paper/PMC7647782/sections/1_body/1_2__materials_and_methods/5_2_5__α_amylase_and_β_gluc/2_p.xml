<p>The 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase activity was determined by measuring the 4-nitrophenol 
 <italic>α</italic>-D′glucopyranoside (4-NPGP) product. A 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>L sample of 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase was preincubated for 2 min at 37°C with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> aqueous and ethanolic extracts or with a positive control (Acarbose) at a concentration range of 0 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Then, the mixture was incubated with color reagent NPGP (180 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) for more 15 min at 37°C. The colorimetric test contained 10 mM of potassium phosphate buffer, 5 mM of 4-NPGP, and 2 IU of 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, at pH 6.9. The activity was evaluated by measuring absorbance at 405 nm with a microplate reader. The same equation used to measure 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase activity was used to measure that of 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase.
