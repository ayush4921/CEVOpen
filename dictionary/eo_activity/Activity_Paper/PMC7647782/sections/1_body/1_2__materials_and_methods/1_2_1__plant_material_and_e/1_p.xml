<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> (KSU No. 19378) were collected from individuals of the Al-amariah region (North of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 24°48′35.1
 <sup>″</sup>N 46°25′34.1
 <sup>″</sup>E, in 2007), then were identified and confirmed by Dr. Mona S. Alwahibi. After washing in distilled water, the leaves were air-dried for 3 days at room temperature (25°C) until use. A portion of ground plant material (20 g) was macerated and homogenized with 200 mL of distilled water or 70% ethanol for 24 h at ambient temperature. Thereafter, the homogenate was filtered through a Buchner funnel and centrifuged for 15 min at 5.000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was concentrated using rotary evaporator, then transferred into 100 ml beaker and left for 4 days on laboratory bench to dry properly and stored at 4°C until use.
