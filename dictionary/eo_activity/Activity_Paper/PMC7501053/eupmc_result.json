    "Thiazolidin-4-one has been known as a powerful moiety present in various approved medications. Thiazolidin-4-ones are amongst the most effective and actively explored fields of current antimicrobial and antiviral chemotherapy that portray broad spectrum and potent activity. The wide range of medicinal properties of thiazolidin-4-one related drugs encourages the medicinal chemists to synthesize a significant variety of new medicinal substances. Microwave induced organic reactions earned substantial coverages in recent years due to many advantages such as ease of work, cost-effectiveness, short reaction time and excellent yield. Microwave radiations provide a substitute for traditional heating by incorporating energy to the reactions. The usage of microwave irradiation has contributed to the emergence of innovative ideas in chemistry, as energy absorption and propagation in microwave irradiation is entirely dissimilar to the traditional heating method. In synthetic chemistry, microwave heating is a rapidly growing area of research. This review cover organic synthesis of thiazolidin-4-one analogues via the use of microwave irradiation as an effective technique and the antiviral and antimicrobial action of thiazolidin-4-one based compounds. Graphical abstract Image 1 Highlights • Introduction to microwave-assisted synthesis along with benefits and applications.• Microwave irradiation based synthetic routes of various thiazolidin-4-one derivatives.• Ativiral and antimicrobial activity profile of thiazolidin-4-ones prepared by MW irradiation."
