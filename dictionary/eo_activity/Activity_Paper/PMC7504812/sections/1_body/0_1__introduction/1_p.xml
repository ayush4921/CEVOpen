Moreover, due to population growth, aging, and increased prevalence of key risk factors, this figure is expected to rise in the coming years. According to the same report, different from other parts of the world, cancer death (7.3%) is higher than cancer incidence (5.2%) in Africa. This is mainly attributed to lack of adequate health care facilities as well as professionals, lack of early cancer detection system, and poor access to chemotherapeutic treatments. Due to these and other factors, including socio-economic conditions, the majority of the population of Africa has relied on traditionally used medicinal herbs and/or plants as a monotherapy or in combination with clinically approved anticancer drugs.
