<p>Vinblastine (

 <bold>31</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04032-f004">Figure 4</xref>) are one of the most effective bis-indole vinca alkaloids as anticancer drugs, isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This is one of the most precious anticancer plants indigenous to Madagascar. Previously, approximately 30 bis-indole alkaloids and over 60 monomeric indole alkaloids have been isolated from the aerial parts and roots of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] isolated three new cytotoxic dimeric indole alkaloids (
 <bold>32</bold>–
 <bold>34</bold>) along with other five known compounds from the whole plant of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> collected from China (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04032-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among the isolated compounds, leurosine (
 <bold>36</bold>) showed the most potent cytotoxic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.73 ± 0.06 µM. Furthermore, the isolated three new compounds (
 <bold>32</bold>–
 <bold>34</bold>) also showed potent cytotoxicity against triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.97 ± 0.07 µM to 7.93 ± 0.42 µM. Another alkaloid, cathachunine (
 <bold>40</bold>), also showed a promising cytotoxic activity against HL-60 by inducing an intrinsic apoptotic pathway [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. On the other hand, the monoterpenoid indole alkaloids vindoline and catharanthine, isolated from Malaysian 
 <italic>V. roseus</italic>, showed weak cytotoxic activity against HCT 116 [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Furthermore, colchicine (
 <bold>41</bold>), isolated from the seeds of 
 <italic>Gloriosa superba</italic>, demonstrated moderate activity against six human cancer cell lines (A549, MCF-7, MDA-MB231, PANC-1, HCT116, and SiHa) [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].
