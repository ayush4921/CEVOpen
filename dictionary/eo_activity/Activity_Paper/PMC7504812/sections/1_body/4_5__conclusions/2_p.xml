<p>Generally, the ecological variation has a huge impact on the biosynthesis, yield of active constituent and biological potency of secondary metabolites produced by plants of similar species from different geographical regions. Thus, Ethiopian anticancer plants might have novel active constituents to fight cancer, based on traditional medical use, than those collected from other regions due to their unique geographical location and inherent climatic condition of the diverse landscape. Unfortunately, these valuable plant resources are disappearing rapidly due to climate change, rapid urbanization, agricultural land expansion, and artificial deforestation; therefore, Ethiopian flora is facing a great challenge, and thus it is high time to examine the anticancer plants systematically with the aim to carry out chemical and biological invesigations, as well as clinical trials on promising anticancer plant extracts based on ethnopharmacological knowledge.</p>
