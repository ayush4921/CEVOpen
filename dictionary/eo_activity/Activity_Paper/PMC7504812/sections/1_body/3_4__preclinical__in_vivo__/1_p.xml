<p>Preclinical studies generate data on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties of lead compounds, which will later be used to select better molecules for clinical trials. Assessment of the findings of preclinical in vivo animal studies supports the traditional use of plants to manage cancer in Ethiopia (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04032-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Despite the preclinical efficacy data, there are no clinically significant anticancer agents isolated from traditionally used Ethiopian plants. Moreover, there are also no clinical trials conducted on anticancer plants that are collected from Ethiopia. Among reviewed phytochemicals only ursolic acid, secoisolariciresinol (
