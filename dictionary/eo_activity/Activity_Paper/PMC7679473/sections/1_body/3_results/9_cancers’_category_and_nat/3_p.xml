<p id="p0160">The consistency of the use-reports within each cancer category was evaluated numerically using the informants’ consensus factor (C
 <sub>IF</sub>). There was a great agreement amongst informants about ethnomedicinal utilizations of plant species for specific cancer with F
 <sub>IC</sub> values ranging between 0.50 and 0.91 revealing high homogeneity in the reported cancer types (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The obtained higher values reflect the important number of use reports for each particular cancer type i.e. breast (F
 <sub>IC</sub> = 0.91, UR = 675), colorectal (F
 <sub>IC</sub> = 0.90, UR = 563), stomach (F
 <sub>IC</sub> = 0.89, UR = 393), liver (F
 <sub>IC</sub> = 0.86, UR = 352), lung (F
 <sub>IC</sub> = 0.89, UR = 346) and esophageal (F
 <sub>IC</sub> = 0.70, UR = 133). However, the medicinal importance index values ranged from 1.92 to 10.38; the higher values were recorded respectively for breast cancer (IMI = 10.38), colorectal (IMI = 9.38), lung (IMI = 8.87), stomach (IMI = 8.73), liver (IMI = 7.04). However, the lower values were recorded for oral (IMI = 2.76), bone (IMI = 2.45), pancreas (IMI = 2.37) and neck cancer (IMI = 1.92) (
