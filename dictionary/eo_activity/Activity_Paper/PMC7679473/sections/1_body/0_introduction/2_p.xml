The incidence of cancer is increasing in Algeria and the accessibility to health care is difficult due to the insufficient number of oncologists, the serious lack of adapted medical facilities designated for diagnosis and treatment and the incomplete health care framework in the country. Regrettably, the number of cancer centers is insufficient to cover the populations of the whole country (48 departments or wilayas). Therefore, underprivileged families mainly from rural areas and cancer sufferers living away from those cities must travel, in some cases till 1.500â€¯km, via inadequate or even non-existent means of transport to reach these centers. There is also a strong gender bias in cancer treatment as some diseases like breast and cervical cancers are taboo. Besides, the therapeutic efficiency of the conventional treatments is low and often insufficient to eradicate this disease (
