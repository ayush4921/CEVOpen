<p>Their extraction was performed with water, 70% ethanol, 96% ethanol and methanol. The most complete extraction of all flavonoids is achieved with 70% ethanol. Scutellarin is present in all samples with the highest amount in plant material of S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(M) (4350 µg/g) and S. 
 <italic>altissima</italic>(M) (4219 µg/g) followed by S. 
 <italic>altissima</italic>(B) (3263 μg/g) and S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(A) (3075 μg/g). Baicalin is contained in four of the five samples and its amount varies in a very wide range from 363 to 605 µg/g in S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(M) and S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(A) to 23,125–31,250 µg/g in S. 
 <italic>galericulata</italic>(P) and S. 
 <italic>altissima</italic>(M). Wogonoside is found in the plant material of all studied species of 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> from 419 to 2827 µg/g, as well as wogonin, but in small quantities. However, wogonin is not found in S. 
 <italic>altissima</italic>(B). Baicalein is found mainly in S. 
 <italic>galericulata</italic>(P) (1047 µg/g) and in S. 
 <italic>altissima</italic>(M) (288 µg/g). Verbascoside is present in the aerial part of S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(A), S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(M) and S. 
 <italic>galericulata</italic>(P) and is best extracted with methanol.
