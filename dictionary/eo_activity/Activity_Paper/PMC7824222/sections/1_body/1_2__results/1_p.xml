<p>In the present study, a comparative research has been performed of the amounts of secondary (polyphenols and flavonoids) and primary (organic acids and carbohydrates) metabolites in the aerial part of three species of 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> growing in four lowland regions of Southern Bulgaria as follows: 
 <italic>Scutellaria altissima</italic> from the areas of Mezek(M) and Bachkovo(B), 
 <italic>Scutellaria albida</italic> from Mezek(M) and Asenovgrad(A) and 
 <italic>Scutellaria galericulata</italic> from Parvenets(P). It is known that the biological activity of plants of this genus is mainly due to the phenolic compounds synthesized by them [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00045-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents our results, which show that there is a correlation (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.96) between the obtained amounts of total polyphenols and total flavonoids. The total polyphenolic content varies from 1353.1 ± 33.6 in S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(A) to 3498.5 ± 61.6 mg GAE/100 g dry 
 <italic>wt</italic> in S. 
 <italic>altissima</italic>(M), and the total flavonoid content from 162.0 ± 4.3 to 747.2 ± 5.8 mg QE/100 g dry 
 <italic>wt</italic> in S. 
 <italic>albida</italic>(A) and in S. 
 <italic>galericulata</italic>(P), respectively. The amounts of individual flavonoids characteristic of the genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> and extracted with different solvents are given in
