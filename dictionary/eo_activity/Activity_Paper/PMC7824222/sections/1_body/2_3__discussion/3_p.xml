<p>It turns out that while there is plenty of information about the secondary metabolites in the plants of the genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic>, there is not much data about the primary metabolites in them. Olennikov et al. isolate and characterize polysaccharides from the aerial part of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> Georgi, in which they prove galactose, arabinose and glucose [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, they determine their antioxidant activity by two methods—β-carotene bleaching assay and the DPPH method. There are reports in the available scientific literature of free radical scavenging ability of polysaccharides from fungi, plants and algae [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hernandes-Marin and Martinez confirmed this ability in their theoretical study on some mono-(d-glucose, d-fructose), di-(sucrose, maltose) and trisaccharides (1-kestose, 6-kestose, raffinose) [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our study sheds light on the carbohydrate content of 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> genus plants growing in Bulgaria. We find the monosaccharides glucose, fructose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose and the disaccharides sucrose, cellobiose in a very wide concentration range (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00045-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Fructose is present in the largest amount in 
 <italic>S. albida</italic>(M), galactose—in 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(B) and glucose—in 
 <italic>S. albida</italic>(A). According to a study by Park et al., they are extremely important for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. They investigated the optimal carbohydrate source in hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> infected with 
 <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic> strain and proved that 150 mM sucrose in the culture medium increases the production of baicalein, fructose causes the greatest accumulation of baicalin and galactose—of wogonin [
