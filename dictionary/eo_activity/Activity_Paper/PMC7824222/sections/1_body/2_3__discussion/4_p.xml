<p>It is important to know the composition of carbohydrates and organic acids, which are consumed directly, as infusions of plants can be easily prepared at home. As for the content of organic acids in the plants of the genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic>, again the data are only for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. Chirikova et al. monitor the accumulation of organic acids during the vegetation of the plant. They identified tartaric, citric, malic, malonic, succinic and fumaric acids in the aerial part of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> Georgi and found that citric acid predominates and is detected in all phases of plant development [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The largest amount citric acid we find in 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(M). In contrast, we also determine the amounts of quinic, oxalic, α-ketoglutaric and ascorbic acids. 
 <italic>S. albida</italic>(A) contains the most succinic and quinic acids −4.8 and 2.9 %, respectively, and they have the largest contribution to the total amount of organic acids of 9.4% in it. It is highly likely that the ascorbic acid contained in 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(M) and 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(B) contributes to the pronounced AOA of these two species.
