<p>The genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> belongs to one of the most widely used in traditional medicine and is the subject of many phytochemical studies of the plant family Lamiaceae. About 350 species are known to be common in East Asia, Europe and North America [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> is one of the most well-known and best-studied species, the roots of which have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for millennia [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other species of this genus have also been used by many cultures for treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis, inflammatory diseases, and have shown sedative, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anxiolytic, insecticidal, and antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This activity has been proven to be mainly due to secondary metabolites, which are synthesized by plants for a protective purpose [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such are flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], phenolic acids [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], phenylethanoid glycosides [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and terpenes (neo-clerrodanes [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], iridoids [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) and act both individually and in combination. However, information on the composition of primary metabolites (sugars, organic acids, tocopherols [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] responsible for the development of the plants themselves is scarce. Organic acids are involved in several biochemical pathways, including energy production and formation of precursors for aminoacid biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mono- and oligosaccharides, with low molecular weight, and their derivatives display a major role in the structure and function of the living cells [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They have been shown to affect primary and secondary metabolism, development and gene expression [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In their study, Park et al. demonstrated the influence of various carbohydrate sources on the type and amount of flavonoids accumulated in hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The main group of biologically active compounds is undoubtedly the flavonoids and their glycosides [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are natural antioxidants which act by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and chelating transition metal ions [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is well documented that oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of a large number of human diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, ischemia, neuropathological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as the aging process [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and natural antioxidants are being considered as prospective therapeutic agents.
