 <p>Until now, the interest to plants from genus 
  <italic>Scutellaria</italic> in Bulgaria has been focused mainly on the terpenes in them. The purpose of this study is to enrich the information on the composition of the Bulgarian 
  <italic>Scutellaria</italic> species in terms of both polyphenolic content as well as primary metabolites such as mono-, oligosaccharides and organic acids. An aerial part of three 
  <italic>Scutellaria</italic> species growing in four low mountain regions of Southern Bulgaria was used. The flavonoids scutellarin, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, luteolin, chrysin and a caffeoyl phenylethanoid glycoside-verbascoside have been identified via HPLC in different extracts from 
  <italic>Scutellaria altissima, Scutellaria albida</italic> and 
  <italic>Scutellaria galericulata</italic>. The antioxidant activity of the extracts has been evaluated. The 
  <italic>Scutellaria altissima</italic> from Mezek and 
  <italic>Scutellaria galericulata</italic> from Parvenets we studied, which are the richest in flavonoids (represented mainly by baicalin, scutellarin and wogonoside), show the highest Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity. Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity of 
  <italic>Scutellaria albida</italic> from Mezek and 
  <italic>Scutellaria altissima</italic> from Bachkovo is the most pronounced, probably due to the content of scutellarin and luteolin and chrysin, respectively. Antioxidant activity of aqueous, methanolic and 70% and 96% ethanol extracts were also determined by the electrochemical method.
