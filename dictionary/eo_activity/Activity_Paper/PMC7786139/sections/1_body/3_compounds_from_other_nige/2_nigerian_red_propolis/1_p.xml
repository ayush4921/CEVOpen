<p>We have previously reported on the efficacy of Nigerian red propolis (NRP) in rats experimentally infected with 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Treatment with NRP at 400 and 600 mg/Kg/day resulted in significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced parasitaemia and improved blood parameters (higher PCV and HBC) and weight gain compared to a DMSO treated control group (Nweze et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This prompted further investigation into the active compounds in NRP. The ethanol extract of NRP yielded antitrypanosomal compounds, most of which were flavones and flavonoids (Omar et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The MIC against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> was determined for three of the compounds: medicarpin, 
 <bold>85</bold> (3.12 μg/mL); pinocembrin, 
 <bold>86</bold> (12.5 μg/mL), and propolin D, 
 <bold>87</bold> (3.12 μg/mL) and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined for the remaining compounds. The most active of these were 8-prenylnarigenin (
 <bold>88</bold>), macarangin (
 <bold>89</bold>), and vestitol (
 <bold>90</bold>), with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM of 6.1 ± 0.1, 7.8 ± 0.1, 8.3 ± 0.1 μg/mL, respectively. Other compounds with significant antitrypanosomal activity included calycosin (
 <bold>91</bold>; EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM = 10.0 ± 0.44 μg/mL), 6-prenylnaringenin (
 <bold>92</bold>; EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM = 11.4 ± 0.34 μg/mL), and riverinol (
 <bold>93</bold>; EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM = 16.24 ± 0.24 μg/mL). Interestingly, none of the compounds showed cross-resistance to pentamidine and melarsoprol but 
 <bold>93</bold> was significantly more active against two multi-drug resistant strains (3.6 and 2.5-fold, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Omar et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), from which either the TbAT1/P2 (Carter et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) or the HAPT1/AQP2 drug transporter (Alghamdi et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) had been deleted (for the structures of compounds 
 <bold>84</bold>–
 <bold>93</bold>, see
