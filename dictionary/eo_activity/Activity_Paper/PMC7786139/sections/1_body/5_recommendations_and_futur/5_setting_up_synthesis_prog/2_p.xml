<p>Most of the natural compounds are structurally and stereochemically complex, making their chemical synthesis routes difficult, and often non-feasible in terms of cost/yield. For such compounds, the alternative to chemical synthesis will be synthetic biology. The use of the synthetic biology approach requires: (1) identification of the biosynthesis pathways and the genes encoding the enzymes for every step in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite (natural compound) in the native organism, (2) heterologous assemblage of the pathway in a suitable microorganism, which is achieved by cloning and transformation of all the genes into the surrogate microorganism, (3) establishment of a fermentation technology for the large-scale culture and production of the product, and (4) a standardized large-scale purification method for the produced secondary metabolite. Recently, the antimalarial terpenoid artemisinin, which is natively produced by the plant 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, has been partially produced in yeast and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> through synthetic biology, yielding quantities as high as 25 g/L of culture (Tsuruta et al., 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Paddon et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Another interesting example of synthetic biology is the complete biosynthesis of noscapine in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Noscapine is a potential anticancer drug that is natively derived from the opium poppy plant, 
 <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic>. Engineering 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by introducing 10-gene clusters from opium poppy, which encodes 30 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine resulted in the heterologous production of the compound with a yield 2.2 mg/L (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
