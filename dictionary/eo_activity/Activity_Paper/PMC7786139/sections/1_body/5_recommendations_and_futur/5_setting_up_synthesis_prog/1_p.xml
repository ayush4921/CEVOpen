<p>Except for compounds 
 <bold>84</bold>–
 <bold>93</bold>, which were isolated from Nigerian propolis, the remaining compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>83</bold>) enumerated were isolated from plants (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and as expected, the final yields are very low. Environmental concerns and low yield are major hurdles for drug development efforts using natural products from plants because large amounts of compounds are usually required, particularly at stages 2 and 3. Moreover, even after approval of a final drug, it would be hard to envisage a good business model built on a product whose supply is reliant on its isolation from plants in very small quantities—especially since the cost per treatment for NTDs must necessarily be low. Thus, in many cases the crux of a profitable and sustainable drug development plan for plant products may be to be able to establish a process for its large-scale production independent of the native plant. Above, we have already highlighted the ease of synthesis as one of the shortlisting criteria for progressing natural compounds down the DDP, and efforts should be initiated to establish economically viable synthesis routes for the selected candidates. To the best of our knowledge, so far only compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (fagaronine) has an established chemical synthesis procedure (Rivaud et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and funding of natural compounds synthesis research should be part of the national scientific strategy of Nigeria.
