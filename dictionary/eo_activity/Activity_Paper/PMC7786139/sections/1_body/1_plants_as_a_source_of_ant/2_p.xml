<p>Some of the natural compounds that have been isolated from plants include alkaloids, phenolics, terpenes, saponins, and quinones, and their derivatives (

In addition to the direct usage of natural products from plants (phytomedicines or pure drugs), the scaffolds of many of these compounds have been successfully modified to produce pharmacologically more complex or semi-synthetic active molecules. They can also be used as taxonomic indicators for the discovery of new drugs; others can be used as models for designing lead molecules. Antique wisdom is the basis of modern medicine and a significant base of future medicines and therapeutics. Examples of well-established plant-based anti-protozoal drugs currently in use today are quinine and artemisinin, which are used for the treatment of malaria.
