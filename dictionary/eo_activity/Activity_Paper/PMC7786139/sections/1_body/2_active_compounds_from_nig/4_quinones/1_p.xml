<p>The common feature among quinones is the presence of two carbonyl groups in a six-membered unsaturated ring (carbonyl groups can also be on adjacent rings). They are classified into three main groups: benzoquinones which have two carbonyl groups in a benzene ring (Q1), naphthoquinones, which have two carbonyl groups on one of the rings in naphthalene (Q2) and anthraquinones, which are derivatives of anthracene (Q3) (

Quinones have been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities (El-Najjar et al.,
