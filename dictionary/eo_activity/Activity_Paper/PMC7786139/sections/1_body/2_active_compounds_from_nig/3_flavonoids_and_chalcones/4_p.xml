<p>The crude methanol extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Cajanus cajan</italic>, a member of the family Fabaceae used for its antimalarial properties, nevertheless had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of just 53.5 μg/mL against the multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> K1 strain 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, its ethyl acetate fraction yielded cajachalcone, 2′,6′-dihydroxy-4-methoxy chalcone

 <sub>50</sub> of 2.0 μg/mL (7.4 μM) (Ajaiyeoba et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The relatively simple structures of these flavonoids and chalcones, which lack chiral centers, should enable a systematic exploration of their structure-activity relationships (for the structures of compounds
