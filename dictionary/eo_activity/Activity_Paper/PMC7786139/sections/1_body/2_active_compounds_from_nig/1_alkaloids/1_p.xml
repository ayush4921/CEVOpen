<p>Alkaloids are a structurally diverse class of secondary metabolites whose key feature is a basic nitrogen (nitrogen in a negative oxidation state) in a carbon ring. They are classified according to their principal C-N skeleton into pyrroles (A1), pyrrolines (A2), pyrrolidines (A3), pyrrolizidines (A4) indoles (A5), pyridines (A6), pyrimidines (A7), piperidines (A8) quinolines (A9), isoquinolines (A10), quinolizidines (A11), tropanes (A12), imidazoles (A13) (
