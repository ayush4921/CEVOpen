<p>Glycosides have one or more sugar moieties bonded through the anomeric carbon to a non-sugar group. The glycosidic bond can be carbon (C-glycosides, e.g., mangiferin, 
 <bold>G1</bold>), oxygen (e.g., Luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide, 
 <bold>G2</bold>), sulfur (in thioglycosides e.g., Sinigrin, 
 <bold>G3</bold>) or nitrogen (in glycosylamines e.g., adenosine, 
 <bold>G4</bold>) (

The sugar moiety is called the glycone and may contain one or more sugar groups, while the non-sugar group is the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. According to their glycone moieties, glycosides are grouped into glucosides, fructosides, ribosides, glucuronides (glucuronnoside). Classification can also be based on the orientation of the glycosidic bond, α-glycosides have their glycosidic bond below the plane of the cyclic sugar moiety (glycone) e.g., methyl-α-Dglucopyranoside, 
 <bold>G5</bold>, whereas when the glycosidic bond lies above the plane of the glycone a β-glycoside is formed e.g., methyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 
 <bold>G6</bold> (

Classification of glycosides can also be based on their aglycone moieties e.g., steroid (cardiac) glycosides, coumarin glycosides, anthraquinone glycosides, saponins etc. The medicinal properties of glycosides have been exploited extensively for the treatment of heart diseases and as antibiotics, for example streptomycin, kanamycin and neomycin (Kren and Martinkova,
