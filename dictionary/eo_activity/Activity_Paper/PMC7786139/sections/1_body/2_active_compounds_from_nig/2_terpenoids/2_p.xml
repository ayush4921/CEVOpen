<p>The methanol extract of Jatropha multifidi, known as coral bush, which is in fact used in Nigerian folk medicine for the treatment of parasitic infections as well as cancer (Gill, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), yielded 3 closely related macrocyclic lathyrane diterpenoids: 14-deoxy-1β-hydroxy-4(4E)-jatrogrossidentadione 
 <bold>(26)</bold>, the saturated 15-deoxy-1β-hydroxy-4(4E)-jatrogrossidentadione 
 <bold>(27)</bold> and the unsaturated 15-deoxy-1β-hydroxy-4(4E)-jatrogrossidentadione 
 <bold>(28)</bold> (Falodun et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The compounds showed particular promise for their antileishmanial activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 11.9, 4.69, and 4.56 μg/mL, respectively, showing that the oxidation state of the oxygen on the cyclopentene ring is likely to be important for high activity. The authors state that traditional healers have used the plant successfully against leishmaniasis. The compounds possessed virtually no activity against chloroquine-sensitive 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> D6, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s &gt;7 mg/mL, and poor activity against a panel of bacterial and fungal pathogens, thus confirming specific activity against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and perhaps other kinetoplastid parasites (Falodun et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
