<p>In this review, we present an overview of some of the most important antimalarial, antitrypanosomal, and/or antileishmanial compounds that have been isolated from medicinal plant materials collected in Nigeria. An extensive internet-based search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using appropriate combinations of the keywords “antimalarial, antitrypanosomal, antileishmanial, plant, natural product, extract, compound, and Nigeria.” The last search was carried out on October 10, 2020 and only compounds with elucidated structures and reported half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≤50 μg/mL or μM were included. References lists of included and related studies were also screened visually to identify further relevant studies. Beyond evaluating the antiprotozoal utility of these natural drugs, the aim is to identify the current limitations in natural product drug discovery in Nigeria and elsewhere, recommend a way forward, and encourage further studies that would identify the actual translation of the best leads into new antiprotozoal chemotherapies, which are sorely needed.
