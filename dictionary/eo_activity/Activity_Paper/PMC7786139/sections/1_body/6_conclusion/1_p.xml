<p>Over the years, the bioactivity of extracts from Nigerian flora has been established, thus validating the widespread use of herbal medicine in that part of the world. Bioactivity-driven fractionation efforts have now identified candidate drug leads in some of these plants, including potential antiprotozoal agents. However, the number of pure compounds isolated and investigated is still low, despite the thousands of preliminary studies showing promising activity of plant extracts. Furthermore, the translation of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-protozoal activity of the already identified phytochemicals into 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> preclinical studies has also been slow. While the challenges affecting the development of these natural compounds are numerous and complex, they can be surmounted by concerted collaborative and multi-disciplinary efforts, especially when underpinned by a national strategy and the establishment of a natural compounds repository to enable it. This will facilitate competitive bids for international funding, enable synergy between academia and pharmaceutical companies and not-for-profit organizations, and would bridge many gaps in scientific infrastructure. Thus, while investment in research in developing countries like Nigeria is indispensable, coordination within the country is essential for the development of international collaborations. Nigeria has the raw materials and resources as well as the drive and the talent in their scientific community, now is the time to translate these into valuable pharmaceutics that benefit its population.
