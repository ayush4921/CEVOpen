  <title>Background and Aim:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> is a highly valued plant, widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is reported to have a wide range of medicinal uses. This study was designed to explore the ameliorative potential of 
   <italic>M. charantia</italic> methanol leaf extract in alloxan-induced diabetic animal model with a particular focus on the liver.

  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>Hepatoprotective effect of methanol leaf extract of 
   <italic>M. charantia</italic> was assessed in alloxan-induced toxicity in 50 rats divided into five groups (A-E) (n=10). Group A normal control, Group B was toxicant group, and Group C animals received glibenclamide treatment while Groups D and E received extracts at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses, respectively. The experiment lasted for 28 days. Histopathological changes, blood glucose level, and serum enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, oxidative status and caspase-9, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were evaluated.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>Extract-treatment caused a decreased blood glucose level, markers of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>). Treatment of rats with leaf extract of 
   <italic>M. charantia</italic> resulted in increased levels and activities of protein thiols, non-protein thiols, glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase indicating its antioxidant potential. The liver section revealed mild distortion of the hepatic architecture compared to the toxicant group, while decreased expressions of caspase-9 and IL-1β in extract-treated groups was observed.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>The plant extract exhibited antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects, thus showing its hepatoprotective property.</p>
