<p>Histologically, significant hepatic injury characterized by hypertrophic and necrotic hepatocytes, collapse of the central veins, widespread inflammatory cells infiltration round the central vein, and loss of cellular boundaries were observed in the untreated diabetic group. Our finding agrees with the work of Bilal 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, in rats supplemented with MLEMC (200 and 400 mg/kg), the extent of hepatic lesions was ameliorated relative to the lesions seen in untreated rats. The administration of MLEMC reduced liver pathological conditions, suggesting that the plant has the ability to enhanced regeneration.
