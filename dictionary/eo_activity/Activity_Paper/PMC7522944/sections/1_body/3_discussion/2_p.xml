<p>Increased activities of these enzymes as seen in alloxan-induced diabetic-untreated rats in this study corresponds to the extensive liver damage induced by the toxicant (alloxan). In this study, the elevated serum activities of hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) were significantly reduced by MLEMC treatment. This may be due to stabilization of plasma membrane as well as repair of damaged hepatic tissue [
