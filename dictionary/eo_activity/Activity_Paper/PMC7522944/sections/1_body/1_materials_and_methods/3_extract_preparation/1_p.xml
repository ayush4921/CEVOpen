The identification and authentication of the plant were performed at the Department of Botany, University of Ibadan with Voucher Specimen Number (UIH-22563). The voucher specimen was maintained at the Herbarium of the Department of Botany, University of Ibadan. The leaves were dried at room temperature (27±2°C) and pulverized to a fine powder using an electric blender. The powder (400 g) was soaked and extracted in 90% methanol (1L) using Soxhlet extractor for 3 days until complete extraction. The filtrate was filtered using Whatman no 1 filter paper and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness by a rotary evaporator (Yamato, Rotary Evaporator, model-RE 801, Japan) at 190-220 rpm and 40-50°C for 24 h under reduced pressure to give amorphous solid mass [
