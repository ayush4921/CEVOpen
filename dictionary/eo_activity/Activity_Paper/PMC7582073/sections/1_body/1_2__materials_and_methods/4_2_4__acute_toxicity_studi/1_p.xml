<p>The single-dose acute oral toxicity study was evaluated following the recommendations by OECD Guidelines (425) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Acute toxicity studies were carried out in Swiss albino mice, weighing 20–30 g each one, using a single dose, which administered orally. Thirty-six mice, divided into 6 groups, were designed for the study of acute toxicity via the oral route. Each group of 6 mice (3 males and 3 females) received, respectively, a single oral dose of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 g/kg body weight of HS extract, while the control group was treated with distilled water. The general behavior of mice and signs of toxicity were observed continuously for 1 h after the oral treatment and then intermittently for 4 h and thereafter over a period of 24 h [

 <sub>50</sub> value was determined according to Dragstedt and Lang method described by El Allaoui [
