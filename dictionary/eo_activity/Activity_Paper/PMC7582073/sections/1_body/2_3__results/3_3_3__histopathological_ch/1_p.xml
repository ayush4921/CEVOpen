<p>Normal histology of rat kidneys (glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and blood vessels) was found in the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>), and the group treated subacutely with 500 mg/kg dose of the HS extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). However, the histopathological observations demonstrated that a few minor or slight abnormalities were noted in the histoarchitecture of the kidneys from the groups G3 and G4 (1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg) including a reduction of glomerulus cells (red triangle), a loss of tubular cellular components (black arrow), an expansion of the Bowman space (black star), and distortions in the epithelial membrane of the Bowman capsule (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(d)</xref>).
