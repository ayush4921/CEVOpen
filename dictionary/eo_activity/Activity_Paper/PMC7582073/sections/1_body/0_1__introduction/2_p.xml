 <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> or 
 <italic>Hammada scoparia</italic> (Pomel) belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is locally known as “
 <italic>Rremt</italic>” in Morocco. It is a common herb amongst practitioners, herbalists, and users. This popular plant is widely used as a decoction, infusion, or cataplasm to treat various ailments. It has frequently used in the treatment of hypertension, cutaneous neoplasms, dermatitis, diabetes, food poisoning, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, scabies, injury healing, indigestion, stomachache, gastroenteritis, and cold [

Pharmacological studies have shown that the plant has antimicrobial, antioxidant activities, larvicidal activity, cytotoxic and antimalarial activities, molluscicidal activity, anticancer properties, reno-protective, and hepatoprotective effects. Furthermore, a recent study suggested that HS extract could possibly restore the altered neurological capacities and antioxidant power in rats [

 <italic>Hammada articulata</italic> ssp. scoparia. A thorough study of this plant material has now led to the isolation of eight minor alkaloids and one flavonoid. Several alkaloids, including four isoquinolines (isosalsoline, salsolidine, dehydrosalsolidine, and isosalsolidine), one isoquinolone (N-methylcorydaldine), tryptamine, N-omega-methyltryptamine, and one beta-carboline (tetrahydroharman), have been extracted for this plant [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another analysis of the flavonoid-enriched extract from HS by LC-UV-MS/MS indicated the presence of isorhamnetin–xylose–galactose, quercetin–xylose–rhamnose–galactose, and quercetin–glucose–rhamnose (rutin) [
