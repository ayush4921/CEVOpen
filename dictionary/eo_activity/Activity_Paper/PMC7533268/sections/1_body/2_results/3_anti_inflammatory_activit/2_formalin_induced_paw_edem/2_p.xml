<p>The maximum percent of edema inhibition in all test doses of the extract was observed at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day of observation with the respective values of 69.46%, 74.83%, and 79.87% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>) and the effect at this time was found to be dose dependent. Inter group comparison among the different doses of the extract showed statistically significant different effect in 100 mg/kg versus 400 mg/kg at the 1
 <sup>st</sup> (p &lt; 0.01), 2
 <sup>nd</sup> (p&lt;0.05), 3rd (p &lt; 0.05), 5
