<p>The second model used was the hot plate test, in which the supra-spinal nociception and the involvement of central antinociceptive mechanism were detected.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since the paws of mice are very sensitive to heat at temperatures which are not damaging the skin, the central antinociceptive mechanisms of the extract were detected by introducing the mice to the constantly heated plate and by observing the reaction times, namely jumping, withdrawal, and licking of the paws. The time until these responses occured was prolonged after administration of centrally-acting analgesics.
