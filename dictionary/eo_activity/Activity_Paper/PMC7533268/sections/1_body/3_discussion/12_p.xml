<p>In the present study, acute inflammation was induced by sub planar injection of carrageenan (1%v/v in normal saline) in the left hind paws of the mice. Following the induction of carrageenan, an acute localized inflammation was induced through sequential release of various endogenous inflammatory mediators. The release of these endogenous mediators was biphasic. The early phase (0 and 2.5 h) after carrageenan induction is mainly mediated by the release of histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin. These mediators are attributed for inflammation by increasing vascular permeability in the damaged tissue surroundings. The late phase which is sustained by the overproduction of COX-2 and its pro-inflammatory PGs product, with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutrophils), took place 2.5–6hrs post carrageenan induction.

 <sup>2-</sup>) and hydroxyl radicals (OH
 <sup>−</sup>), nitric oxide (NO) which play an important role in the development and progression of acute inflammation.
