<p>Acetic acid-induced writhing test was selected to detect the peripheral analgesic activity of the extract. Because of its sensitivity and ability to detect antinociceptive effects of natural products and test compounds at dose levels which remains inactive for other methods, acetic acid-induced writhing test is a well recommended model for screening the peripheral analgesic potentials of test compounds.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid causes irritation and stimulation of the peritoneal cavity that triggers the synthesis and release of various endogenous inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, bradykinin substance P, and PGs.
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These various endogenous inflammatory mediators elicited chemical-induced visceral pain which is characterized by constriction of abdominal muscles together with the extension of the forelimbs and elongation of the body. That is why the acetic acid-induced writhing test is considered as a model of visceral pain.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This model has also been associated with increased level of PGE and PGF
 <sub>2</sub>a. Increasing PG levels within the peritoneal cavity enhances inflammatory pain by increasing capillary permeability and activating primary afferent nociceptors.
