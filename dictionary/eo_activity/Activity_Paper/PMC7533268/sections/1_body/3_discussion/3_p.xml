 <italic>Echinops kebericho</italic> extract at all doses employed (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly (p &lt; 0.01, and p &lt; 0.001) showed peripheral analgesic activities by reducing the number of writhing with the respective values of 31.01%, 48.43%, 57.84% as compared with the negative control. These findings confirmed that the peripheral analgesic activity of the extract increased from the lower dose (100 mg/kg) to the higher dose (400 mg/kg) in dose dependent manner. The increase in analgesic activity with increasing doses of the extract might be attributed with an increase in concentration of phytoconstituents that possess analgesic activity with the maximum dose.
