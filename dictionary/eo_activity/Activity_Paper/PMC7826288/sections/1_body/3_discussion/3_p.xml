<p>Compaction and decompaction of a telomere are essential for chromatin during cell division (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Instead of nucleosomes, shelterin proteins play a critical role in organizing a single telomere (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In this work, both force–extension and force–jump assays reveal that a TRF1 dimer can compact a single human telomere by interacting with two targeting sites separated far apart. The distance between two sites can be as far as 2784 bp, suggesting that TRF1 can quickly condense a human telomere by forming large loops. At a stretching force of 2–8 pN, we found that TRF1–DNA complex ruptured in tens of seconds, revealing that TRF1 has a large time window for interfering telomere activities, e.g. replication, transcription, and DNA damage responses (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Our bottom-up method of single telomere compaction assay allows us to dissect the condensation event by adding shelterin subunits one by one, providing a new strategy to investigate how shelterin proteins protect chromosomes from a perspective of mechanics and kinetics.
