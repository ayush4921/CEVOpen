<p>Meanwhile, we found that non-telomeric sequences can dramatically affect the interactions between TRF1 and a telomere. Both dissociation time and binding probabilities of TRF1 on an artificial telomere drop to form valleys around the positions of non-telomeric sequences. This finding helps to explain the reason why a human telomere contains continuous repeats of TTAGGG motifs without interruptions and why mutations in TTAGGG repeats form a well-isolated region of subtelomere. Our finding also suggests that non-telomeric linker sequences in artificial telomere constructs should be under careful consideration when interpreting the data. Instead of making artificial telomeric dsDNA constructs by conventional methods with plasmids, we have directly obtained the single human telomeres from cells, which thus provides non-biased results in studying the TRF1â€™s compacting function.</p>
