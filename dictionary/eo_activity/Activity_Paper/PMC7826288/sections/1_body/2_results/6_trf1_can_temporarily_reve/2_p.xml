<p>Upon the blockage of TRF1, forces experienced by the DNA fork can fine-tune the dynamics between double-stranded and single-stranded conformations. During the process of strand separation at a testing force of 15.7 pN and [TRF1] = 10 nM, the DNA equilibrates between locally forward and backward states (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, bottom). The overall time is longer at the backward state than that at the forward state. When the testing force increases to 15.8 pN by 0.1 pN, the telomeric DNA shows equally distributed time for the two states of forward-backward equilibrium (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, middle). A testing force of 16 pN, 0.2 pN stronger than 15.8 pN, tunes the time to be longer at the forward state than that at the backward state (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, top). The interplay among TRF1, telomeric DNA, and forces reveals that TRF1 plays a role in telomere strand separation, a scenario frequently happening in, e.g.Â replication, transcription, and DNA-damage responses.
