<p>To quantitatively examine how TRF1 compacts a single human telomere, we performed force–jump assays using magnetic tweezers. We modulated forces at four levels, a resting force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>rest</sub>), a testing force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub>), a high force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub>) and a maximum force (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) (Materials and methods, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). At 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>rest</sub> = 0 pN, double-stranded telomere DNA can randomly coil in the buffer, allowing TRF1 protein dimers to bind for compaction. At 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> = 2–8 pN, the telomeric complex of protein–dsDNA ruptures, releasing the compacted dsDNA. Strong forces of 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>high</sub> = 10 pN and 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> = 20 pN further extend the dsDNA to assure the full extension of a single telomere. We repetitively run the protocol to probe the telomere compaction events at [TRF1] = 10 nM. Because we prepared single telomeres from K562 cells, extensions at a specific force are different among single telomeres, indicating the varied lengths of telomeres from independent chromosomes. By comparing telomeric extensions with or without TRF1, we directly observed rupture events of TRF1–telomere complexes in force–jump assays (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> versus C).
