<p>We next performed force–extension measurements of TL using single-molecule magnetic tweezers. Biotin and digoxigenin modified telomeres form affinity interactions with streptavidin-coated superparamagnetic beads and anti-digoxigenin antibody covered glass, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, cartoon). By modulating the strength of a magnetic field, magnetic tweezers can exert forces on the beads, hence the single human telomeres. In a force–ramp mode, we stretched and relaxed the single telomeres with a loading rate of ±4 pN/s. TL responds to forces as a function of the WLC (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). We can thus employ the WLC model-assisted single-molecule ruler to precisely measure the length of individual telomeres (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55–59</xref>), which is in contrast to the rough estimation used by conventional methods of gel electrophoresis or fluorescence analysis (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60–62</xref>). Force–extension traces of single telomeres are distinct in length, quantitatively revealing how TL varies among chromosomes. The TL distribution measured by force–extension assays centers at 2.5 ± 0.9 kb (mean ± SD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1975) (Equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We performed terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis, a golden standard of TL measurements, as a control for our single-molecule method (Materials and methods). We prepared the terminal restriction fragments using the same set of enzymes as above. The TRF analysis revealed the TL of K562 cells to be 2.7 ± 2.3 kb (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Our single-molecule TL measurements are consistent with the results by TRF analysis and that in the literature (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). We thus established a method to manipulate single human telomeres mechanically.
