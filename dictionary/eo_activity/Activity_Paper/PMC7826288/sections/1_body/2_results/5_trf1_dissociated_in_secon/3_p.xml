<p>Furthermore, we analyzed the binding probabilities of TRF1 along a stretch of telomeric dsDNA upon strand separation. The distribution of TRF1 binding probabilities shows three domains along the telomeric dsDNA (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). The domain boundaries are around the positions of non-telomeric sequences, 79th bp and 142nd bp, as mentioned above (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). From the upstream to the downstream, domain I-III reveals a unidirectional decrease of TRF1 binding probabilities, which may be explained by the asymmetrical scenario of strand separation. The fork-like DNA hairpin construct has two flanking dsDNA handles for mechanical manipulation. The nonspecific binding of protein on dsDNA handles has a rate exceeding the diffusion-limited

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). During the target search, TRF1 can bind dsDNA handles nonspecifically and laterally diffuse along dsDNA until it finds on a target site (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Fork handles of dsDNA may thus attract TRF1 and provide a local pool of proteins, which causes the unidirectionally decreased binding probability along the telomeric hairpin stem.
