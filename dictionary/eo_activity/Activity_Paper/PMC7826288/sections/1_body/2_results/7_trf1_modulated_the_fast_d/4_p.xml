<p>Interestingly, we found that TRF1 makes the dwell time at the backward state 8.7 s shorter at

 <sub>1/2</sub> = 14.7 pN than that without TRF1 (Figure

 <sub>1/2</sub> = 14.7 pN and [TRF1] = 10 nM than that without the protein (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>, right). Around the forces generating evenly distributed extension of two states, the modulation effect of dwell time at the DNA fork by TRF1 is more evident than that at forces giving severely biased extension distributions. The results above reveal that TRF1 can locally modulate the dynamics of DNA fork upon partial strand separation, which generates time windows for enzyme activities (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>).
