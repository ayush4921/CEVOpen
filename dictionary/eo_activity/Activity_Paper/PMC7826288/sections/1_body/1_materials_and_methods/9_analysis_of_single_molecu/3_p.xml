<p>Using a step-fitting algorithm (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), we measured the pausing time at a specific position in traces of strand-separation assays. For hopping traces from constant-force assays, we used an algorithm of hidden Markov modeling (HMM) to obtain states of positions and corresponding time durations (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Because data were collected at a minimum of 100 Hz, we only took the pausing time &gt;20 ms considering the Nyquist frequency.
