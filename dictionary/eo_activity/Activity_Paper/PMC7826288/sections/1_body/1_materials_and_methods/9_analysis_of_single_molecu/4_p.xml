<p>To measure the pausing positions when unfolding a hairpin construct in strand-separation assays, we performed zero-correction for each trace by subtracting the bead height where the hairpin fully opened at the force of 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub>. After zero-correction at 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub>, the resulting change in extensions represents the length of ssDNA released while unfolding a hairpin. In a histogram for the extension of each trace, peaks at specific extension indicate the blockage of hairpin opening due to TRF1 binding.
