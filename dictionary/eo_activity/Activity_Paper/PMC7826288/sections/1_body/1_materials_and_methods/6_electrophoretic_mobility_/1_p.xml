<p>We prepared a telomeric dsDNA for Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) from two oligodeoxynucleotides, GTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAG and FAM-CTAACCCTAACCCTAAC, which contain two TTAGGG sites. Two oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed at an equal molar ratio, heated to 95°C for 30 seconds, and slowly cooled down to 25°C in 2 h. In a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.0063% Tween-20, we titrated 10 nM of the telomeric dsDNA with TRF1 from 0 to 200 nM (Dimer concentration). The reaction underwent 30 min on ice. We then loaded 20 μl of the reaction mixture to 5% PAGE gel, which ran at 4°C and 50 V for 100 min in 1× TBE (Tris–borate–EDTA) buffer. We took the gel images at 495 nm illumination in an imaging system (PXi9, Syngene, UK). Image analysis was done in ImageJ (NIH Image, US).</p>
