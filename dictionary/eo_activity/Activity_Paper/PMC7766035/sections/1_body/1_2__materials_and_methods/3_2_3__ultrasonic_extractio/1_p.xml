<p>The technology for obtaining and concentrating the bioactive products of the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass was developed based on the principles of the disintegration of cell structures using ultrasound waves. The device used for extraction was a Hielscher ultrasonic processor (Hielscher UIP1000hdT Berlin, Germany), with a sonotrode of 40 mm diameter, 1000 Watts, 20 kHz, and adjustable amplitude (amplitude ratio 1:0.7). Before the extraction experiments, the ultrasonic processor was calibrated to find the power consumption of the equipment. During the sonication process, this value was automatically deducted from the gross energy consumption, thus allowing the net power delivered to the extraction medium to be found. During the experiments, the samples were placed in an ice bag with continuous magnetic stirring to maintain a low sample temperature. After completion of the extraction, the samples were vacuum filtered and then centrifuged (2500Ã— 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min). A rotary evaporator (Heidolph Hei-VAP Core, Schwabach, Germany) was used for water and alcohol elimination from the supernatants. The remaining water and alcohol residues from the samples were subjected to the lyophilization process.
