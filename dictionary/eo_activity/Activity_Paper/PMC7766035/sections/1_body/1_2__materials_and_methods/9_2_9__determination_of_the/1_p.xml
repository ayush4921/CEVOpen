<p>The flavonoid content was measured according to the method described by Delcour and Varebeke [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and quercetin was used for the analytical curve. The results are expressed as milligrams of quercetin equivalent per gram of dry matter of mushroom extract (mg QE/g DM). After an incubation period of 10 min, the absorbance was read at 640 nm. The total phenolic contents of the extracts were calculated using Folinâ€“Ciocalteu reagent, following the method of Velioglu [
