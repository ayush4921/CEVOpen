<p>Because of the previous experiments that revealed high antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> extract obtained using an ethyl alcohol concentration of 80%, we wanted to further check the possible effect on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase to achieve multitarget action for the treatment of AD. 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01889-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> reports the levels of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase after treatment with the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extracts compared with those for galantamine. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01889-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, all extracts showed mild butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The 80% alcohol extracts of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> demonstrated higher inhibitory activity, giving inhibition percentages of up to 53% against AChE and 49% against BChE at 1 mg/mL.
