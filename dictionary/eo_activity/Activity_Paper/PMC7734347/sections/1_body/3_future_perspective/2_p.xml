<p>The bioavailability of bioactive molecules from genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> also has limited investigation. On the basis of the study by 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2015)</xref>, the use of 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> extract showed improvement on 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> iron absorption and storage protein, which might be related to its rich phytoactive ingredients. Although the traditional uses of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> are supported by scientific evidence, the processing, and application or consumption methods by the public may alter the phytochemical profile, thus leading to pharmacological effect variations. Herbal combination is possible to provide better effects or benefits in developing therapeutic drugs. The study by 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Sari et al. (2015)</xref> showed that the combination of 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> (Burm. f.) Ness and 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> could be a potential candidate for the development of an antidiabetic agent. The optimum therapeutic effect could be attributed to the combination of the potent hypoglycemic effect of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and the potent antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic>. Hence, further studies on the therapeutic effects of the combinations of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species with other medicinal plants are potentially producing more effective disease remedies. However, the potential issues of herb–herb and herb–drug interactions should be given due consideration, and further studies are needed to ensure no adverse interactions in polypharmacy and polyherbacy conditions.
