 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic>. The potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> are suggested as follows: modulation of inflammatory cytokine production, inhibition of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and NO production, inhibition of cellular inflammatory-related parameters, and inhibition of inflammation on animal models. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, the several potential anti-inflammatory signaling pathways of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> are PI3K/Akt, Nrf2, PPARγ, GSK3, NF-κB, and MAPK.
