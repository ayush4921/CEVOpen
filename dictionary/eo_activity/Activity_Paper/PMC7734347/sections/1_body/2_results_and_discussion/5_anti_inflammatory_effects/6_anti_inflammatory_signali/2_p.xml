<p>Upon cellular induction, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) generate lipid products that recruit cytosolic protein kinase B (Akt) to cellular membranes for Akt activation. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) is a serine/threonine kinase that facilitates Akt phosphorylation. The activated Akt detaches from the plasma membrane and translocates through the cytosol to the nucleus for further downstream reactions (

 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> lyophilized powder in the diet of a diabetic mice model significantly induced the mRNA and protein expression of Akt and PI3K (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, a mice model with 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> lyophilized powder in its diet also exhibited significant induction of the mRNA and protein expression of PDK-1 (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). By Akt-mediated phosphorylation, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was able to inactivate GSK3 (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Salazar et al., 2006</xref>), where GSK3 has been determined as one of the mechanisms that phosphorylate and degrade Nrf2. In turn, Nrf2, a transcription factor, will be upregulated and will ultimately lead to the production of downstream cytoprotective protein expression (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cuadrado et al., 2018</xref>). GSK3 acts as the central regulator of the inflammatory response to bacterial infections and other insults. Hence, inactivation of GSK3 by the phosphorylation of GSK3β has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in the control of bacterial-driven inflammatory diseases (

 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> was correlated to the increased phosphorylation of liver GSK3β (Ser9), which inhibited the activities of GSK3 (

 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> lyophilized powder diet increased GSK3β phosphorylation in a diabetic mice model (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> treatment showed anti-inflammatory potential through the induction of the Nrf2 protein level in murine hepatocytes and in a mice model (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2019</xref>). Akt activation is also essential for the transcriptional activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), a nuclear receptor that inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines and directs the differentiation of immune cells toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Tyagi et al., 2011</xref>). 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract in diet significantly induced 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> PPARγ mRNA expression (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2019</xref>), and 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> lyophilized powder diet increased 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatic protein expression of PPARγ (
