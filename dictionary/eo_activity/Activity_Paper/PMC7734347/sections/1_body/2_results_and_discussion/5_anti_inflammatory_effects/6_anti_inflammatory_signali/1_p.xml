<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) consist of three signaling pathways: ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, which mediate fundamental cellular processes by regulating immunomodulatory cytokine expression (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kaminska, 2005</xref>). 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> extract possessed an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting p38 mRNA expression both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Pai et al., 2019</xref>). The isolated compound from 
 <italic>G. nepalensis</italic> extract, 3,5
 <italic>-</italic>dicaffeoylquinic acid ethyl ester, exhibited inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK in cardiomyoblasts (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> treatment also inhibited the protein expression of p-JNK in murine hepatocytes and in a mice model (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2019</xref>). NF-κB represents a family of inducible transcription factors that activate the transcription of various pro-inflammatory genes (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). The NF-κB signaling pathway had been proposed as a potential mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> through the inhibition of the p-IκBα protein, nucleic p65 protein levels, translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nuclei, and DNA-binding activity of the NF-κB nuclear protein (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). To complement the study by 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2013)</xref>, two studies demonstrated that the 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> aqueous extract was able to inhibit NF-κB mRNA expression in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Pai et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, 
 <italic>G. pseudochina var. hispida</italic> extract caused the inhibition of NF-κB activation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 41.96 μg/ml in HeLa cells (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon et al., 2010</xref>). Successively, quercetin 3-rutinoside, which was one of the isolated compounds from 
 <italic>G. pseudochina var. hispida</italic> extract, showed a strong NF-κB inhibitory effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.1 ± 0.1 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon and Heinrich, 2011</xref>). 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> extract and its marker compounds of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and 
 <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acid also inhibited RelB S573 (protein transcription factors of NF-κB family) translocation into the nucleus of keratinocytes (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Sukadeetad et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> lyophilized powder at 10% of diet inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). In a randomized controlled study, NF-κB phosphorylation in the lesions treated with 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> ointment was inhibited (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rerknimitr et al., 2016</xref>).
