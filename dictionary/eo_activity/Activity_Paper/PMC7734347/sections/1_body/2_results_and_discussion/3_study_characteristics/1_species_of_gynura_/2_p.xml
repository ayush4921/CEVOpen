<p>Identical plant species might exhibit phytochemical or bioactivity variations that can possibly be attributed to intrinsic factors (age of the plant and part of the plant used) and extrinsic factors (geographical climate, nature of soil, season, and processing methods). The study conducted by 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Muraina et al. (2008)</xref> proved that the same plant extract from two different geographical locations varied in their phytochemical contents, cytotoxicity, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> and 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> extracts derived from plants originating from Nanjing were shown to possess higher free-radical-scavenging activities as compared to other same species extracts from different China origins (

 <italic>Gynura</italic> are crucial to gain regulatory approval of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> preparations as nutraceuticals or therapeutic drugs. Standardization of a drug can be used as a confirmation of its identity, quality, and purity throughout all phases of its cycle (
