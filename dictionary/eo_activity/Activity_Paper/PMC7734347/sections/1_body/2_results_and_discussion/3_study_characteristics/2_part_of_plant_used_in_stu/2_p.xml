<p>However, the use of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> requires extra caution on toxic risk because of the presence of hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids which was determined in the leaves of 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon and Heinrich, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Sukadeetad et al., 2018</xref>) as well as the aerial part of 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> and 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Hepatic injury caused by genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> has been reported in few other studies. By daily administration of the root of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> at 1.0 g extract/kg for 40 successive days, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, also called hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS), was induced in the mouse model where liver fibrosis-related factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines were upregulated (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The mouse model in which a 30 g/kg decoction of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> dried rhizome was administered by gavage in the morning for 30 days showed features of HSOS, including increased weight ratio of the liver and body, serum transaminase, bilirubin, decreased albumin (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), bulging abdomen, a large number of clear ascites, floating bowels, jelly omentum in the abdominal cavity, and congested and swollen or contracted and hard liver with a grainy surface and blunt edges (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). The potential markers of hepatotoxicity induced by the decoction of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> dried rhizome are verified in the animal model as differential metabolites of arginine, creatine, valine, glutamine, and citric acid, which are involved in the regulation of multiple metabolic pathways, primarily amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Qiu S. et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> dried rhizome also caused liver injury by dysregulating mitochondrial ROS generation through the SIRT3-SOD2 pathway (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> were proven to contain large amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, including senecionine, which were responsible for the impaired bile acid homeostasis in the animal model orally administered 1.0 g/kg BW 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> extract for 48 h (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, any contraindications caused by long-term consumption of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> must be determined prior to the commercialization of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> products. Appropriate clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal efficacy and minimum toxicity of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic>. The application of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> must be closely monitored in term of doses and qualities, especially the species with reported cases of hepatotoxicity.
