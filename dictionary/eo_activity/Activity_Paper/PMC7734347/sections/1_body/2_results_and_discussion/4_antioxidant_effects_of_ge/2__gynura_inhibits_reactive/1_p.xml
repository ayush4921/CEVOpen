<p>At physiological concentrations, ROS is involved in many cellular activities, including gene transcription, signaling transduction, and immune response. However, overproduction of ROS can result in oxidative damage to biomolecules, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, which is the underlying cause of various diseases (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Inhibition of ROS production using 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extracts was determined in human HaCaT keratinocytes at 50 μg/ml (inhibitory effect comparable to 200 μg/ml vitamin C) (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and in murine hepatocytes at 80 and 160 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2019</xref>); that of 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (huvec) at 1–4% v/v (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2015</xref>), in adrenal gland pheochromocytoma in a concentration dependent manner (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), and in liver-injured mice at 0.25 and 0.5% diet (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2017</xref>); and that of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> for zymosan = 2.63 ± 0.89 μg/ml; IC
 <sub>50</sub> for PMA = 1.41 ± 0.63 μg/ml) in polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) neutrophils. The compound isolated from 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> extract, 8,8′-(ethene-1,2-diyl)-dinaphtalene-1,4,5-triol, possessed ROS inhibitory effect upon the activation by PMA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.13 μM) and zymosan (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.05 μM). At the same time, rutin, which was also isolated from 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> extract, inhibited the ROS activated by PMA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.08 μM) and zymosan (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.13 μM). Both isolated compounds from 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> showed a higher antioxidant effect than the positive control aspirin (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Yuandani et al., 2017</xref>). One of the compounds isolated from 
 <italic>G. nepalensis</italic> extract, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid ethyl ester, showed an inhibitory effect on intracellular ROS production in cardiomyoblasts at a concentration of 0.78 μM and above (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). In nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, the interaction of the hydroxyl radical (HO•) with the nucleobases of the DNA strand will produce 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a predominant form of a free radical-induced oxidative lesion, which is a critical biomarker of oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Valavanidis et al., 2009</xref>). 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> diet (5 and 10%) showed the inhibition of the hepatic 8-OHdG level in a diabetic mice model (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> also improved the plasma TAS in rats with induced oxidative stress (
