  <p>A schematic illustrating the proposed signaling pathways of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of 
   <italic>Gynura</italic> species. The antioxidant effects of 
   <italic>Gynura</italic> are manifested by the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suppression of lipid peroxidation, modulation of enzymatic antioxidant production or activities, and modulation of glutathione-related parameters. The reported anti-inflammatory effects of 
   <italic>Gynura</italic> are modulation of inflammatory cytokines and molecule production as well as inhibition of cellular inflammation and inflammation in an animal model. The potential anti-inflammatory signaling pathways of 
   <italic>Gynura</italic> include the induction of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling pathways as well as the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Dark blue arrow lines indicate activation, dark blue perpendicular lines indicate inhibition, green tick indicates induction by 
   <italic>Gynura</italic> species, and red cross indicates suppression by 
   <italic>Gynura</italic> species.
