<p>The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and has quickly become a serious threat to public health [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since the initial cases were reported in Wuhan, China, the virus has quickly spread globally, affecting more than 200 countries. As to date, over 20,046,642 cases have been identified with more than 734,525 deaths being reported [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, that primarily target the human respiratory system. The viruses have been shown to cause disease in both animals and humans [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Coronaviruses have either a round or elliptical form with an approximate diameter of 60–140 nm [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, of which there are four subgroups: alpha (α), beta (ß), gamma (γ) and delta (δ). Of these subgroups, ß-coronaviruses tend to cause the most severe disease and fatalities in human populations [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Over the past two decades, two highly pathogenic ß-coronaviruses have been identified in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) from 2002 to 2003, and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Based on its genomic structure and phylogenetic relationships, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has also been identified as a ß-coronavirus. The coronavirus genome is comprised of approximately 30,000 nucleotides and is enclosed in a lipid envelope. A typical coronavirus contains around six open reading frames (ORFs) within its genome. Two-thirds of viral RNA, mainly located in the ORF 1a/b, encode for 16 non-structure proteins. The rest of the virus genome encodes for structural and accessory proteins associated with the virus [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10 and 11, these include a spike (S) protein, an envelope (E) protein, a membrane (M) protein, as well as the nucleocapsid (N) protein [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The N protein is bound to the virus single-positive strand RNA and allows the virus to hijack host cells. The N protein also coats the viral RNA genome and has also been shown to play an important role in viral replication and transcription. The M protein is thought to act as a central organiser for coronavirus assembly and is also the most abundant protein on the viral surface. The E protein is a membrane protein composed of approximately 76 to 109 amino-acids, and the protein plays an important role in virus–host cell interaction and virus assembly [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite displaying similarities with the other human ß-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 possesses many differences in its genomic and phenotypic structure which greatly influences the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 [
