<p>Furthermore, a study conducted by Rasool et al. looked at the activity of aqueous extracts of ginger and garlic on anti-avian influenza virus H
 <sub>9</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>, in chick embryos. Results obtained showed that the aqueous extract of ginger exhibited antiviral activity at 10, 15, 20 and 25%, whereas in the case of garlic, antiviral activity was observed at 15, 20 and 25%. Moreover, MTT assays revealed that both plants displayed cytotoxicity, which was in a dose-dependent manner; however, extracts of ginger exhibited lower cytotoxicity in comparison to ginger. From this study, it can be concluded that aqueous extract of ginger showed great antiviral activity against H
 <sub>9</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> and was less cytotoxic to cells with a cell survival rate of more than 50% [
