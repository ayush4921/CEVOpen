<p>The spike of Prunella vulgaris, also known as Prunellae Spica, is often used for the prevention and remedy of various diseases, in traditional Chinese medicine. Prunellae Spica contains various bioactive compounds within its chemical composition including triterpenes, flavonoids, phenolic compounds and carbohydrates. These compounds have been associated with a variety of protective effects such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, immunosuppressive activity and anti-HIV activity [

In regard to Prunellae Spica antiviral effects, one study was successful in isolating a novel partially sulphated polysaccharide with a molecular weight of around 32 kDa (PSP-2B), from aqueous extracts of Prunellae Spica. PSP-2B is mainly composed of the sugars arabinose, galactose and mannose, with small amounts of uronic acids and glucose. In the same study, the antiviral effects of Prunellae Spica against herpes simplex virus (HSV) were investigated. Researchers found that PSP-2B strongly demonstrates activity against HSV, with an IC50 of approximately 69 and 49 μg/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. At the same time, when the concentration of PSP-2B was increased in a gradual manner to 1600 μg/mL, no cytotoxicity was observed. The results for this study further demonstrate the great antiviral potential that Prunella has against viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and raises the questions whether similar effects could be demonstrated on viral infections such as COVID-19 [
