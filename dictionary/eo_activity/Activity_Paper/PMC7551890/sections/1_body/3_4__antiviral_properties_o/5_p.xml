<p>A potential candidate against the SARS-COV-2 virus may be 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> (IO), also known as the chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. IO has been widely used in traditional medicine to facilitate breathing in Asia and even some parts of Europe, as the mushroom has been known to cause a reduction in nasopharyngeal inflammation [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It has been suggested that 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> mushrooms possess a powerful enzymatic system and a strong system of defence, due to their parasitic mode of life [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Extracts from this fungus have been used for its antitumor, antioxidant, hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, water extracts from IO have traditionally been used as a source of bioactive compounds that exhibit cytostatic and cytotoxic effects, and this has led to the manufacturing of such compounds in the form of a nontoxic aqueous extract called Befungin. Insight into the connection between chaga mushroom and its antiviral effect has been proven to be promising [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A study demonstrated the effect of 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> polysacharides in cats with feline viruses including feline calcivirus, feline herpesvirus 1, feline influenza virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline panleukopenia virus. Inhibition of RNA viruses and DNA viruses in all the five viral subtypes was observed [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Suppression of the infectivity of pandemic influenza virus was also noted in mice and it was observed that this mushroom is comparable to Tamiflu, an antiviral drug that inhibits viral reproduction [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-12-02573" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Additionally, another study looked at the antiviral effect of 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> against (HSV and found that the aqueous extract derived from 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> (AEIO) led to an overall reduction in HSV infection in Vero cells. This study also elucidated the anti-HSV mechanism of action, as it found that AEIO had the ability to inhibit viral-induced membrane fusion, thus acting against the early stages of HSV viral infection. Consequently, the results showed that aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> were able to successfully prevent HSV-1 entry by directly acting on viral glycoproteins, which in turn prevented membrane fusion. Currently, the treatment for HSV infection is a nucleoside analogue antiherpetic. However, increasing resistance to these drugs has resulted in a need to develop alternative treatments. This study has highlighted that the mechanism of action for AEIO is different from that seen in nucleoside analogue antiherpetics and thus provides an alternative treatment to overcome the developing resistance [
