 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> has a long history as a medicinal plant with diverse therapeutic applications. The present study data revealed 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> as rich source of antioxidants that play vital role in controlling the imbalance between reactive oxygen species and bodyâ€™s ability to detoxify free radicals to repair the damage. The extracts and concentrations against selected bacterial strains showed significant antimicrobial activities. Due to the minor cytotoxicity the dates can be used as herbal medicine. The extracts of the selected varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> i-e Ajwa and Khalas showed excellent inhibition potential against bacterial biofilm, hence successful antibiofilm agent inhibiting the growth of bacterial biofilms. FTIR provided an excellent mean to visualize the chemical composition of different Date palm varieties. It would be worthwhile embarking on an intensive scientific experimentation and investigation on this apparently valuable medicinal plant and to promote its large-scale utilization.
