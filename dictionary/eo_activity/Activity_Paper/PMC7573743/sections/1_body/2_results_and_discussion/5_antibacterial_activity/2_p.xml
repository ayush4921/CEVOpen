<p>The study results showed significant antibacterial activities of the tested varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> against both the tested bacterial strains namely 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>B. Subtilis</italic>. Largest inhibition zones (mm) and lower MIC values (Âµg/mL) indicate higher antimicrobial activities of the sample. In present study, ethanolic extract of both Ajwa and Khalas exhibited largest inhibition zones and lowest MIC values against 
 <italic>B. Subtilis</italic> whereas lower inhibition zone against 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic>. These activities of extracts against microorganism is because of their chemical constituents due to which extracts chemically react with cell membrane or cell wall of bacteria entering into the cell and destroy their cellular proteins and DNA structures.
