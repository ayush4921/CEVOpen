<p>Proximate analysis determines the nutritional value of test samples and the contents of primary nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The results of the proximate analysis of tested varieties of 
 <italic>P. dactylifera</italic> i-e Ajwa and Khalas are given in 
 <xref rid="table1-1559325820962609" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The results of present study indicated that Ajwa has higher moisture content (15.80 ± 0.46%) than Khalas (13.81 ± 0.3%). Percent crude fat content and crude protein were found higher in Khalas compared to their contents in Ajwa. Ajwa has higher total carbohydrate content than Khalas. Total ash is a measure of the presence of inorganic compound in the sample. Lower value of acid-insoluble ash is indicative of the presence of a small amount of non-physiological components like silica and silicates. Higher value of acid-soluble ash showed larger amount of acid soluble compounds like oxalates, carbonates, phosphates, and oxides, respectively. Ajwa has lower ash content which showed that Ajwa has lower inorganic compounds. The high nutritive value suggests that 
 <italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic> can be used as formulation in various dietary supplements.
