<p>The advantage of using DPPH radical scavenging assay to evaluate the antioxidant potential is its more stable radical than hydroxyl or superoxide radicals. The DPPH assay usually involves a hydrogen atom transfer reaction. The decrease in absorbance of DPPH caused by antioxidants is due to the reaction between antioxidant molecules and the radicals, which results in scavenging the radical by hydrogen donation. This is visualized as a discolouration from purple to yellow. The results indicated that the antioxidant activity of this plant extract was equivalent to 97.67 ± 0.07% and 81.84 ± 0.11% radical inhibition 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for Ajwa and Khalas, respectively. These effects proposed that scavenging capabilities of various extracts of Date palm was dependent on the concentration against DPPH. So, DPPH scavenging potential increases by increasing the quantity of various extracts of Khalas and Ajwa.
