<p>The antioxidant potential was determined adopting the method which was reported previously by Nenadis et.al and Youssef et.al [

Briefly, 200 µL of samples at various concentration ranging between (1–100,000 μg/mL) and 3.8 mL of 60 µg/mL of DPPH methanol solution were mixed with each other. The mixture representing the reaction was maintained in the dark for 30 min at room temperature then the absorbance at 517 nm was measured. Quercetin was used as a positive control. DPPH•: free radical scavenging activity was assessed using the equation presented below:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = [Ac − As/Ac] × 100,</disp-formula> where Ac: absorbance of control; As: absorbance of sample.
