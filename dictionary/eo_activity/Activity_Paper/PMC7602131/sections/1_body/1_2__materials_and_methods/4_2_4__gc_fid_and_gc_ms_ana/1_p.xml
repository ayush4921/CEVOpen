Varian 3400 (Varian GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for GC analyses with OV-5 fused bonded column (Ohio Valley, OH, USA) and a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) for quantitative determination of the components. Mean of 3 independent runs was used to calculate areas under the peaks (AUP) using an SRI Instrument (Torrance, CA, USA) and the total area was considered as 100%.
