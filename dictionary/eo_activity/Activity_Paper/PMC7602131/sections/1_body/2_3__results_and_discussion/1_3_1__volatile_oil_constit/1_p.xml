<p>The essential oils from 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> flower heads were comparatively studied using both GC/FID and GC/MS analyses. The aromatic essential oil from 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> flower heads has a blue color (0.16% 
 <italic>v/w</italic> yield), whereas the aromatic oil from 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> flower heads is greenish blue (yield 0.18% 
 <italic>v/w</italic>). GC profiling revealed the presence of 89 metabolites representing 91.70 and 98.98% of the total essential oil composition of 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> flower heads, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01460-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Sixty-four compounds were tentatively identified in 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> with camphor (36.69%) as the major constituent followed by isoborneol (7.64%), α-terpinene (5.73%), and caryophyllene oxide (5.46%). For 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> fifty-five compounds were determined; similar to 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> camphor (14.56%) represented the prevailing compound followed by curcumene (10.50%), 
 <italic>τ</italic>-eudesmol (8.92%), pentacosane (8.65%), borneol (7.95%) and copaene (5.61%) (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01460-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The major constituents present in both oils are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01460-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Apparently, oxygenated monoterpenes, represented mainly by camphor predominate in both oils. Moreover, monoterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes exist in considerable amounts in the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic>, but in minor abundance in 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> oil. In contrast, monoterpenes form only 2.18% of the total identified oil components of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> essential oil. The differences in the composition of both oils were further illustrated using the heat map analysis, which is a type of graphical cluster analysis to better visualize the differences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01460-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The conditional formatting was applied using color code for each value. Dark grey coded for “non-detected compound”, green “for low levels content” from 0.01 to 0.9% meanwhile red coded from 1 to 8%, and blue for compounds showing % above 8%. Noteworthy to mention that the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from the flowers of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> growing in Nigeria is quite different; its main constituent of the volatile oil is 
 <italic>cis</italic> chrysanthenyl acetate (21.6%) followed by octadecanoic acid (19.5%) and borneol (15.5%) [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the essential oil obtained from the Korean 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> flower heads revealed nearly the same major constituents in which camphor represents the major component [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This greatly highlighted the impact of geographical distribution on the volatile oil compositions.
