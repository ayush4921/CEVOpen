<p>The antioxidant activity was assessed using DPPH, HRS, and SORS assays. The essential oils obtained from the flower heads of 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> revealed substantial antioxidant potential with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.21 and 2.59 mg/mL, in the DPPH assay, respectively, 1.90 and 2.89 mg/mL in HRS assay whereas they showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.40 and 5.92 mg/mL in SORS assay, respectively (

The antioxidant activity can be interpreted by the synergistic interactions between all of the essential oil components in addition to their action as pro-oxidants. Inhibition of free radical chain reaction, destruction of peroxides, prompt clearance of free radical and hydrogen are familiar among the mode of action of many essential oils and thus could be the probable mode of action by which the tested oils exerted their effect.
