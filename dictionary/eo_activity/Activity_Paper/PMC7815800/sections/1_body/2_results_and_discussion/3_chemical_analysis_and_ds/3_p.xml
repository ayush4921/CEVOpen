<p id="p0125">DS is viewed as one of the significant factor influencing the structure and bioactivities of polysaccharide. DS is utilized to quantify the level of hydroxyl substituted by the sulfated group which is evaluated by BaCl
 <sub>2</sub> - gelatin method. The sulfur content in polysaccharides was determined by SO
 <sub>3</sub>-Pyr method and the DS method. A general sulfation and reaction mechanism is shown in
