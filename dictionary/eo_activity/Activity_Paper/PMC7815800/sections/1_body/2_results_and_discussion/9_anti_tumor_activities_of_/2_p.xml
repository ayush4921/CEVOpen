<p id="p0205">Earlier reports indicate that the introduction of sulphate groups into polysaccharides may alter its physicochemical characteristics and chain conformation, so the sulfation of polysaccharides is beneficial to enhance the antitumor activity (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative activities of P3a and SP3a against HeLa cells and Jurkat cells was examined, and its inhibitory effect was dose-dependent, ranging from 10-320 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A and B). The inhibitory effects of P3a and SP3a on HeLa cells were 63.83% and 70.52% at 320 μg/mL respectively. The inhibitory effect at 320 μg/mL on P3a and SP3a of Jurkat cells was 63.83% and 71.34% respectively. The IC50 values of P3a are 141.86 μg/mL and 192.10 μg/mL, while the IC50 values of SP3a on HeLa and Jurkat cells are 136.03 μg/mL and 178.50 μg/mL. The inhibition rates of cisplatin on HeLa and Jurkat cells were 81.77% and 78.42%, respectively at 100 μg/mL, and the IC50 values at were 43.74 and 45.10 μg/mL, respectively. Compared with P3a, SP3a displayed relatively high inhibitory activity on Jurkat and HeLa cells, showing that the anti-tumour nature of P3a can be improved through sulfation modification. In this study, the increase in antiproliferative activity may be due to the decrease in the molecular weight of SP3a after sulfation. Sulfated polysaccharide derivatives of

 <italic>Tricholoma lobayense</italic> Heim (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>) exhibited higher anti-tumour activity against Caco-2, HepG2 and HeLa cells, respectively. Besides, compared with these three sulphated derivatives of edible fungal polysaccharides, SP3a has considerable advantages in terms of cytotoxic activity. The sulfated polysaccharide enhances the anti-tumour activity and has potential applications as a natural anti-tumour agent but the anti-tumour mechanism of SP3a remains unclear.
