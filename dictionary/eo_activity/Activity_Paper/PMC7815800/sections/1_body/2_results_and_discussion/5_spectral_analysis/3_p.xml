<p id="p0155">The characteristic strong broadband near 3425/3358 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> point to the presence of O–H stretching, which indicates that there are strong intermolecular and intramolecular interactions between polysaccharide chains (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> C and D). The peak around 2922/2935 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is due to C–H tensile vibration (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the presence of more acidic hydroxyl groups (present in SO3H), a decrease in O–H tensile peak strength was observed in SP3a, resulting in a higher dissociation of this group. Compared with P3a, two new absorption peaks at about 1299 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 803 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was found in the spectrum of SP3a which belongs to S–O (asymmetric stretch) and C–O–S (symmetric stretch) respectively. The peaks around 800-850 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be used to infer the location of sulfate radicals in sulfated polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). FTIR spectroscopy successfully confirms the sulfation process through the presence of the sulfate group in SP3a. Similar results have found in other sulfated polysaccharides (
