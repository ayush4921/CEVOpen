<p id="p0040">Sulfation was performed according to a procedure reported by 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2003)</xref>. The P3a (200 mg) was mixed with dimethylformamide (40 mL, 25 °C, stirred for 30 min) and about 400 mg of sulfur trioxide pyridine (SO
 <sub>3</sub>-Pyr) complex was supplemented, and heated to 80 °C (3 h), and then brought down to 25 °C using a cooling bath and made to neutral pH using sodium hydroxide solution (4 M). Further, it was dialyzed against distilled water at 4 °C for five days by changing the water two times a day. The resulting solution was collected, lyophilized to attain the sulfated derivative (SP3a) and stored at 30 °C for further analysis. The sulfation experiment is reproducible as it was performed multiple times on a small scale.
