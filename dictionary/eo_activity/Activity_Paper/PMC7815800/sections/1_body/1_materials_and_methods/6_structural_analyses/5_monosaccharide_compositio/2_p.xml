<p id="p0075">GC-MS instrument is utilized to determine the monosaccharide configuration of P3a and SP3a. The sample (10 mg) was hydrolyzed with trifluoroacetic acid (2 mL, 2 M) at 120 °C for 2 h. The hydrolysed sample was then reduced by NaBH
 <sub>4</sub>, derivatized with 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), and acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C (1 h). The resulting sugar alcohol acetate was analyzed on a Perkin-Elmer Clarus 690 AQ8 autosampler GC-MS instrument equipped with a PDA detector and an RTX-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 μm thickness). Derivatives were separated at a ratio of 20:1 with 1 μL injection at a flow rate of 1 mL/min of helium. The temperature program starts at 65 °C (hold for 2 min), increases at a rate of 20 °C/min to 180 °C (holds for 2 min), and then increases at a rate of 5 °C/min to 280 °C for 10 min. Derivatize standard monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, arabinose, mannose, fucose, ribose, rhamnose, xylose, glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid) under the same conditions, and compare standard monosaccharides. The retention time and mass spectrometry determine the composition of monosaccharides from the library.
