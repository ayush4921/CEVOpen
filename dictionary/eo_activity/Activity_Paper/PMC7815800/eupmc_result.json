    "The acidic fraction (P3a) of <i>Pleurotus eous</i> was successfully sulfated by sulphur trioxide-pyridine complex method. The effect of sulfate modification (SP3a) on the structure, physicochemical properties and <i>in vitro</i> biological activity of P3 was studied. The structural characteristics were established by UV absorption, FT-IR, HPGPC and GC-MS. Biological studies were carried out, such as <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-tumour and antibacterial activities. The sulfation process changed its physicochemical and biological characteristics. Compared with P3a, the molecular weight of SP3a is reduced. P3a and SP3a are composed of galactose, xylose, arabinose with different molar percentages. Sulfated derivatives have strong antioxidant and anticoagulant properties. Compared with P3a, SP3a showed obvious cytotoxicity to Jurkat and HeLa cells. SP3a showed a higher inhibition zone for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This article demonstrates that sulfation is an effective way to enhance biological activity, especially SP3a is a promising candidate for bioactive macromolecules and has great potential for industrial and biomedical applications."
