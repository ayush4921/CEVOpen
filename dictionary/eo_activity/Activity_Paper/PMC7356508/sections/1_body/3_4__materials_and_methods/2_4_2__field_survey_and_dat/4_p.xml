<p>Different interviews and inquiry methods were followed, according to Martin [

 <xref rid="B84-plants-09-00759" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]: (a) informants were asked to freely list all plants of a certain ethnobotanical interest, with special attention to plants used for medicinal purposes (free listing); (b) healers and shamans were accompanied on their excursions in search of medicinal plants and followed during the healing ceremonies and herbal remedies preparation (walk-in-the-woods and participant observation). Some difficulties have been found in interviews with shamans because of the belief that revealing the medicinal properties of a plant deprives it of the therapeutic efficacy; (c) samples of plants were shown to the informants, asking them to identify species of ethnobotanical interest (specimen display); (d) small groups of people were interviewed about their ethnobotanical knowledge using the specimen display method (group interviews).
