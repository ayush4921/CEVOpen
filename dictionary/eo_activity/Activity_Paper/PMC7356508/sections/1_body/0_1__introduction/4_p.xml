The data highlight most quoted species in the treatment of specific pathologies, as shown by ethnobotanical indexes. In addition, we have also recorded some unusual uses of medicinal plants and original recipes, as well as the use of species that have never been reported in previous ethnobotanical studies from Central Nepal. The valorisation of folk medicine can promote a sustainable development of the natural resources in these rural areas.
