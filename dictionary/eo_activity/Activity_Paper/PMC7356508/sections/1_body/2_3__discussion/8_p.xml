<p>Another interesting use was reported for 
 <italic>Rhaphidophora glauca</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00759-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), an aroid liane native to the subtropical and warm temperate Himalayan regions. The juice obtained from the aerial parts was administered to women to improve pregnancy. Similar uses are reported for related Indian species such as 
 <italic>R. hookeri</italic> whose stem juice was indicated for pregnant women [

 <italic>R. pertusa</italic>, that showed luteolytic, oestrogenic, and follicle-stimulating activities in cattle and buffaloes [

 <italic>Rhaphidophora</italic> species, i.e., the treatment of bone fractures in human and cattle [
