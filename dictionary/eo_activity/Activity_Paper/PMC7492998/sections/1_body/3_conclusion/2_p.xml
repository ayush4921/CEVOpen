<p id="p0180">To summarize, our findings indicate that MEBJ possesses moderate cytotoxic properties with remarkable activity on the central nervous system leading to sedative and anxiolytic effects. These activities were thought to be due to the presence of phenol and flavonoid contents perceived through our experiments. Besides, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests suggest that the extract holds significant potentiality on inhibiting alpha-amylase enzyme as well as offering a notable percentage of clot lysis activity. Additionally, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> evaluations of the identified compounds from MEBJ, three compounds, namely fisetin, quercetin, and cymaroside, might be responsible for the activities mentioned earlier as they exhibit effective binding to the target receptors. Overall, the observed potentialities can make this plant as a prospective candidate for the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the bioactive constituentsâ€™ mechanisms of in an animal model with a dose-response study.
