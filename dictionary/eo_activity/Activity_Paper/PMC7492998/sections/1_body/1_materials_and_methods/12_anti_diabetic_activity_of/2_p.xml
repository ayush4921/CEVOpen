<p id="p0090">The alpha-amylase inhibitory test method was used to assess the anti-diabetic potential of MEBJ [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A solution was prepared by combining 0.3 mL of alpha-amylase solution, 0.3 mL of extract solution (various concentrations) and 0.6 mL of phosphate buffer and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C temperature. Later, 0.4 mL from test solution was added to a sample test-tube consisting of 3 mL of starch and 2 mL phosphate buffer. The mixture was further incubated for 45 min at 37 °C temperature. After incubation, the test solution (0.1 mL) was taken and added with iodine solution (10 mL), which was vortexed for the complete mixture. Finally, the absorbance was recorded at 565 nm. Percentage of inhibition was figured out using the formula given below.
 <disp-formula id="ufd2">% of inhibition = [(A
  <sub>0</sub>-A
  <sub>t) control</sub> – (A
  <sub>0</sub>-A
  <sub>t) sample /</sub> (A
  <sub>0</sub>-A
  <sub>t) control</sub>] × 100
 </disp-formula>where A
 <sub>0</sub> and A
 <sub>t</sub> are the values of absorbance at zero time and at the end time of incubation respectively.
