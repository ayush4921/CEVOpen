<p id="p0145">The hole board test is another valuable paradigm to evaluate the anxiolytic response of mice under unfavorable conditions. The reluctance of the head dipping tendency is regarded as anxiogenic behavior of mice, whereas spontaneous exploration of visiting holes (head dipping) indicates the anxiolytic nature of plant extract [

The number of head dipping was noted 34.2 ± 1.85 for 200 mg/kg and 48.8 ± 1.6 for 400 mg/kg, while standard drug (diazepam) increased the head dipping to 68.2 ± 1.53. Therefore, the results from EPM and HB tests suggest that MEBJ possesses potential anxiolytic activity.
