<p id="p0125">In order to assess the action of plant extract on the central nervous system, perception of locomotor activity is considered to be a remarkable method [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Locomotion of an experimental animal in a new environment represents its motor activity, and a downfall in the locomotor performance indicates CNS depressant action [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Because during active locomotion, excitatory feedback is supplied by sensory afferent neurons to spinal interneuron and motor neuron in regards to muscle constriction [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This feedback pathway is further inhibited by GABAergic interneuron through an allosteric moderation of GABA receptors and thus induces CNS depressant effect [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. As reported by many researchers, open field and hole cross tests are the classic animal models to evaluate the instinctive activity of experimental mice [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In our study, the locomotor performance of each mouse has been decreased significantly due to the administration of high dose (400 mg/kg) of MEBJ at both open field and hole cross tests. In the open field test, MEBJ (200 and 400 mg/kg) exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in the movements of experimental animals during the total observation period (at all intervals over 120 min) (

Throughout the experiment, the exploration of mice was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced to 29.8 ± 1.07 and 20.6 ± 1.43 for 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively, in compared to the control (64.4 ± 1.08). In contrast, the number of movements for the standard drug (diazepam) was recorded at 13.2 ± 0.8.
