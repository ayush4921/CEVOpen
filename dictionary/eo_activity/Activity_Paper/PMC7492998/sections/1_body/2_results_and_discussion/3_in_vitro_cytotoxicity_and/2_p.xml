<p id="p0120">Although many phytochemicals possess extensive biological and pharmacological activities, some of the chemicals may contain mutagenic or genotoxic properties [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Hence, in favor of safe and effective treatment, it is of great importance to focus on toxicity evaluation [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. One of the efficient tests for preliminary assessment of crude extract toxicity is brine shrimp lethality assay [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In our study, the cytotoxicity test of MEBJ exhibited an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 224.7 μg/mL, whereas the LC
 <sub>50</sub> of standard drug vincristine sulphate was 39.25 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). According to the criteria of Clarkson [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the outcomes from the brine shrimp lethality test revealed that the extract possesses moderate toxicity. Additionally, many studies have indicated a significant correlation between the results of the brine shrimp lethality test and acute toxicity test [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As an alternative bioassay technique, oral acute toxicity test in mice is conducted for further verification of the toxic profile of plant extract. During acute toxicity assessment of MEBJ, no animals showed any sign of physical, behavioral or neurological changes, allergic reactions, or mortality at the highest dose of 4000 mg/kg. Therefore, the extract is safe in mice model up to the mentioned dose. Accordingly, these results signify the feasibility of the plant extract for further evaluation of its pharmacological potentials.
