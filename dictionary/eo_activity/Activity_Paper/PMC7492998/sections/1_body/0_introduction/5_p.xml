<p id="p0025">Nevertheless, the plant has many beneficial traditional practices, as yet, no scientific investigation has been carried out to explore its effects against neuropsychiatric disorders (anxiety and insomnia), and for anti-diabetic and thrombolytic properties. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate the anxiolytic, sedative, anti-diabetic, and thrombolytic properties of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>B.Â javanica</italic> leaves (MEBJ) in different experimental and computational models. In addition, a computational study (molecular docking, pharmacokinetics (ADME) and toxicological properties) was performed to reveal the mechanism(s) of the observed pharmacological activities and also to know its safety and drug-likeliness properties. The overall workflow is represented in
