  <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> (“myrtle”) and 
  <italic>Asphaltum punjabianum</italic> (“shilajeet”) are a medicinal plant and a long-term-humified dead plant material, respectively. We studied their antibacterial and anticandidal activities against 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The activities of the aqueous extracts of the studied materials were measured using agar-well diffusion methods. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of treated microbial cells was conducted to identify affected proteins. The results showed both antibacterial and anticandidal activities for the myrtle extract (ME), while the shilajeet extract (SE) showed antibacterial activity only. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed against 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> among the microbes tested; therefore, it was taken as the model for the proteomic analysis to identify the antimicrobial mechanism of ME and SE using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Upregulation of expression of 42 proteins and downregulation of expression of 6 proteins were observed in 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME, whereas 12 upregulated and 104 downregulated proteins were detected in 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with SE, in comparison with the control. About 85% of identified expressed proteins were from the cytoplasm and 15% from microbial cell walls, indicating the penetration of extracts inside cells. A higher percentage of expressed proteins was recorded for enzymatic activity. Our findings suggest that the major targets of the antibacterial action were proteins involved in the outer membrane, oxidative stress, and metabolism. Our data might reveal new targets for antimicrobial agents.
