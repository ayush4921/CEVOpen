<p>Using an ecofriendly material to suppress microbial growth is a promising approach with no expected environmental impact and could be a great solution to treat microbes resistant to antibiotics. Different studies have shown the action of the myrtle extract (ME) and shilajeet extract (SE) against bacteria and fungi. Variation in the ability of extracts against the microbes studied was observed and indicated that 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most sensitive microbe (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> has also shown higher sensitivity than some Gram-positive microbes when the essential oil of myrtle was investigated.

 </sup> The leaf extracts of myrtle have shown antibacterial and antifungal activities against some pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains.

 </sup> Antifungal activities against 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic> species, 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> species, 
 <italic>Curvularia</italic> species, 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, and 
 <italic>Helminthosporium</italic> species have been noted for methanolic extracts of shilajeet.

 </sup> However, the aqueous extract of shilajeet used in the present study showed no anticandidal activity, suggesting that its efficacy is highly dependent upon the extraction method and microbial species tested. The activity of an aqueous extract of myrtle leaves against test microbes was linked to its chemical composition (e.g., flavonols, terpineol, acetate, linalyl, linalool, cineol, and tannins).

 </sup> Such components might be involved in different mechanisms against microbes, such as cell-wall and cytoplasmic-membrane degradation, alteration in fatty acids and phospholipids, impact on genetic materials, and protein translation.

 </sup> Furthermore, the effect of SE could be related to its composition of benzoic acids and fulvic acids.

 </sup> The latter are leading factors in the increase of membrane permeability, which enhances disturbances in cell osmolarity and, hence, cell lysis.
