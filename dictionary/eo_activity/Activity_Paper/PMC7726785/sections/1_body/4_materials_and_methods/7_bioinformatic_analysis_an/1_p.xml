<p>Network analysis was carried out by importing the quantitative data into the STRING v11.0 (
 <uri xlink:href="https://string-db.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://string-db.org/</uri>) online software; this software aids in determining the functions and pathways that are most strongly associated with the protein list by overlaying the experimental expression data on networks constructed from published interactions. Functional classification involved classification of the identified proteins into different categories according to their molecular function and the biological processes in which they are involved using the PANTHER classification system (
