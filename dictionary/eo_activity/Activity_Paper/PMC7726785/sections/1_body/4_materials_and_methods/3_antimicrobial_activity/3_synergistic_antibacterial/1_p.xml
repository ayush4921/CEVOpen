<p>The synergistic effect of the aqueous extracts was determined upon mixture with antibiotics (bacitracin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and cefixime). The synergistic potential of aqueous extracts as well as bacitracin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and cefixime as standard antibiotics was determined against

 </sup> The bacterial strains were cultured fresh on NB media (Becton Dickinson, Sparks Glencoe, MD, USA). The aqueous extracts (1 mg/mL) and standard antibiotics [bacitracin (10 μg/mL), ciprofloxacin (10 μg/mL), tetracycline (30 μg/mL), cefixime (5 μg/mL)] were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, applied to each microbial plate, and sonicated for 15 min at room temperature. The synergistic activity of the mixture of aqueous extracts/antibiotics was evaluated after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in terms of inhibition zones around the filter paper disks (millimeters).
