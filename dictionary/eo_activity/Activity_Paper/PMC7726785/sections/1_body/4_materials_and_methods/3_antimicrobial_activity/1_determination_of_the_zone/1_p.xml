<p>The antimicrobial ability of aqueous extracts was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method.

 </sup> Mueller–Hinton Agar (20 mL) was poured into sterilized Petri plates and maintained at room temperature. Then, 0.2 mL of each test strain (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was cultured in nutrient broth (NB) for 24 h to prepare “bacterial lawns.” Four agar wells (4 mm) were prepared using a sterilized cork borer and filled with each extract. The reference negative control was sterile distilled water. Plates were incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C for bacteria and for 48–96 h at 28 °C for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. After the incubation period, plates were examined for extract activity as evidenced by inhibition zones around the well as a clear area.

 </sup> The diameter of each inhibition zone was measured (millimeters), and the mean value for each plate was recorded in three replicates for each microbe.
