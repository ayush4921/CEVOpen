<p>Statistical analyses involved uploading 2D-DIGE gel images into progenesis “Same Spots” software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK), which were then analyzed applying an automated method for spot detection. Independent direct comparisons were made between SE-treated, ME-treated 2, and control 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> groups, and fold differences and p-values were calculated using one-way ANOVA. All spots were prefiltered and manually checked before applying the statistical criteria (ANOVA test, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and fold ≥ 1.5). PCA was carried out on log-transformed spot data. Furthermore, a heatmap was created using Heatmapper, a freely available web server
