 </sup> Spotting was carried out onto a MALDI target (384 MTP Anchorchip; 800 pm Anchorchip; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) from a mixture of tryptic peptides (1 pL) derived from each protein. MALDI-MS(/MS) spectra were recorded using an UltrafleXtreme TOF mass spectrometer with a reflector voltage and a detector voltage of 21 and 17 kV, respectively, as reported.
