<p>Our study explores the underlying mode of action and the response of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> against toxic effects of ME and SE. 2D-DIGE for extract-treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> indicated that the major systems in the antibacterial mode of action were proteins involved in the outer membrane, oxidative stress, and metabolism. Our data might reveal new targets for antimicrobial agents. Generally, the synergistic effect of extracts with antibiotics might help in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.
