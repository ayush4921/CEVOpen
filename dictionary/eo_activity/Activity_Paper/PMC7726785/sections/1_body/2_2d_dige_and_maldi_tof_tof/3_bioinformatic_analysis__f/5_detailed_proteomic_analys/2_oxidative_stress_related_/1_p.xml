<p>Nine stress response-related proteins were identified. Of these, the expression of four was upregulated and the expression of one was downregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME, while others were not affected. The expression of nine proteins was downregulated and the expression of one was downregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with SE (

 </xref>). The direct interaction between plant extracts and their chemical compositions with the membranes of bacteria has been documented and leads to damage to cell components due to ROS generation as a result of oxidative stress.

 </sup> Stress conditions (e.g., antimicrobial treatment) can lead to changes in protein expression.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
 </sup> Therefore, the expression of some proteins was upregulated, which might have been an attempt to overcome the stress conditions. An adaptive response appears following some antimicrobial applications [e.g., nanoparticles (NPs)], which leads to membrane damage and ROS production.

 </sup> The level of the chaperone protein ClpB, polyribonucleotide nucleotidyl transferase, stringent starvation protein A, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was increased and might have been a defensive mechanism against such antimicrobial agents. Bacteria can produce some antioxidant enzymes for detoxification and maintaining cell growth.

 </sup> This phenomenon might explain the increased expression of SOD in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME, but in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with SE, the SOD expression was downregulated. The SOD expression has been shown to be upregulated as a response to stress conditions, such as high temperature, in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>.

 </sup> Furthermore, the combined activity of catalase and peroxidase is an attempt to degrade H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> that might be formed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in response to stress conditions.

 </sup> In 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME, increased catalase activity and increased peroxidase activity were noted in contrast with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with SE. Furthermore, DNA-binding proteins can “wrap” and stabilize DNA and, hence, protect them from denaturation as a response to stress conditions.

 </sup> Such a protein was upregulated, indicating that its expression might be a tendency of the treated microbes to protect their DNA from being damaged as a result of ROS enhanced by extract application. The expression of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F has been shown to be upregulated in 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as a response to oxidative stress.

 </sup> Different patterns of protein expression were observed in our study, indicating different responses for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with different extracts. Such a response indicates that different biological components present in the different test extracts might contribute to the different antimicrobial effects. The expressions of some stress-related proteins were not changed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME. These data suggested that ROS generation was not enhanced in substantial quantities, which helped the cell to regulate the expression of the responsible genes to react against ROS. Interestingly, the same proteins were identified from different locations, but different responses were observed, indicating that the effect was dependent upon the location.
