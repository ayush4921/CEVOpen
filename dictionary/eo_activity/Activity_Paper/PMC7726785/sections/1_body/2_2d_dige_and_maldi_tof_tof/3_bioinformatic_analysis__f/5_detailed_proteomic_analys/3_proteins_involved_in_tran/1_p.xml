<p>Under stress conditions such as antimicrobial agents, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> produces ROS, and many proteins are induced to help the cell adapt to such stress conditions. Because of changes in environmental conditions and stress, rapid changes in proteins occur to adjust cell development in response to unfavorable conditions.

 </sup> In our study, 22 proteins involved in protein synthesis were detected showing different patterns, including 7 expressed proteins (5 upregulated and 2 downregulated) in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME. However, all 22 proteins were expressed (7 upregulated and 15 downregulated) in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with SE. Such expressed proteins were responsible for protein translation. The same proteins were detected from different locations and showed different expression patterns (
