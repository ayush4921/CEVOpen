<p>The expression of the four proteins identified to be involved in ATP synthesis was downregulated in SE-treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and no effect was noted in ME-treated microbes (

 </sup> However, the expression of these three subunits was downregulated, suggesting that the intracellular level of ATP was reduced in response to treatment with SE. However, upregulation of the expression of ATP synthase in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> exposed to an alkaline pH and cadmium has been observed,
