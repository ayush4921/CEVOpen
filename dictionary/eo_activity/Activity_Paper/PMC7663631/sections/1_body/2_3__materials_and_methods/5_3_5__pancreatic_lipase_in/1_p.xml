<p>Pancreatic lipase inhibitory potential of extracts was determined to assess the in vitro antiobesity properties. Plant extracts were added to porcine pancreatic lipase (dissolved in 0.01 M of Tris-HCl buffer) followed by addition of olive oil mixed with gum Arabic. The gum Arabic was used to homogenize the mixture of olive oil with water contents of sample. A well-established method was adopted to determine the pancreatic lipase inhibition of plant extracts [

The resultant solution was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C for completion of reaction followed by addition of 2 mL of substrate. Resulting mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min time period. The ethanol and acetone (1:1) were added to reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The 0.02 M NaOH was used as titrant to neutralize free fatty acids till the pH reached to 9.4. The % inhibition of enzyme activity was calculated.
