<p>An already reported AlCl
 <sub>3-</sub>based method was used to quantify total flavonoid contents (TFC) of extracts [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The plant extracts were dissolved in methanol and 200 µL of this dilution was taken for sample preparation. A reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 0.5 M NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.10 mL), 0.3 M AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.15 mL) and 30% MeOH (3.4 mL) followed by addition of 200 µL of prepared methanolic extract. After 5 min stay at room temperature, 1 mL of 1M NaOH was mixed with the reaction mixture and absorbance was noted at 510 nm spectrophotometrically. TFC were quantified by utilizing a flavonoid rutin (standard) and findings were reported as milligrams of rutin equivalent per gram dried extracts (mg RE/g DE).
