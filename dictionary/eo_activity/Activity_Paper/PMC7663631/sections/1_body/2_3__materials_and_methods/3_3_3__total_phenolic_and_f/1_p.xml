<p>A previously established method was used to determine total phenolic contents (TPC) of the tested extracts with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. For this purpose, extracts were dissolved in methanol and 200 ÂµL of this extract fraction was mixed with FC reagent. The obtained mixture was left to rest for 5 min time period. After 5 min stay, the contents were mixed with 4mL of 20% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>. After an incubation period of 90 min at ambient temperature, the samples were subjected to absorbance measurement at 750 nm wavelength. The result of TPC was expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per gram (mg GAE/g).
