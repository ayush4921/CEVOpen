 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], compound (
 <bold>14</bold>) was identified as nortrachelogenin 5′-
 <italic>C</italic>-β-glucoside. In negative ionization mode compound (
 <bold>15</bold>) gave the deprotonated molecular [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at

 <sub>30</sub>O
 <sub>15</sub> [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In MS/MS spectrum this compound showed a characteristic fragment at 285, may be due to successive removal of hexosyl (loss of 162) + rhamnosyl (loss of 146) moieties from parent ion. Therefore, metabolite (
 <bold>15</bold>) was tentatively identified as isovitexin-3″-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucopyranoside. Compound (
 <bold>16</bold>) (eluting at retention time = 9.66 min) exhibited deprotonated [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 447. The MS/MS spectrum of this compound yielded the fragments at 429 may be due to neutral loss of water molecule. Moreover, the aglycone fragment at 285 (base peak) indicated the loss of a hexose moiety from precursor ion that generated a fragment ion at 256, consistent with kaempferol, as described previously [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>16</bold>) was therefore identified as Kaempferol-3-

 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside. Compound (
 <bold>17</bold>) recorded at retention time of 10.80 min, with a deprotonated [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 431, was identified as kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside according to MS/MS data and the data from reported literature. In mass spectrum of this compound the presence of a prominent fragment at 269 indicates the elimination of a glucosyl moiety (loss of 162) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Compound (
 <bold>18</bold>), eluting at the retention time of 10.82 min was identified as luteolin 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-(6″-acetyl)-glucopyranoside. It produced a deprotonated ion at

 <italic>z</italic> 489 (C

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The precursor ion was further fragmented into product ion peaks at 447 and 285, produced by possible cleavage of C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>2</sub>O (loss of 42) and acetyl-hexose (loss of 204) units. Compound (
 <bold>19</bold>) (retention time of 11.32 min) was assigned as a derivative of heptanone. The tentative identification of this compound was carried out based on the comparison of its MS/MS data with that reported in previous literature [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Compound (
