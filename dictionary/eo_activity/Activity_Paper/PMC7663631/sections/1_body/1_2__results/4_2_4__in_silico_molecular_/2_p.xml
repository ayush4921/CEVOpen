<p>The three dimensional binding pose of all compounds superimposed on orlistat and interaction plots between phytochemicals and enzyme are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04935-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Many significant interactions of docked phytochemicals with lipase were observed. Binding poses of most potent phytochemicals (based on binding energy) illustrate many similarities with the binding profile of orlistat. Orlistat shows hydrogen bonds with two key residues of active site, i.e., TYR114 and PHE77 and hydrophobic interactions with many other residues including most important amino acid SER152. Myricetin which have high binding affinity with lipase with binding energy of −15.1097, also revealed to have strong hydrogen bonds with TYR114, PHE77, however it has hydrogen bonds with three other amino acids HIS151, ALA260, ARG256 that makes more stable protein–ligand complex. Isomangiferin having highest binding energy was hydrogen bonded with TYR114, HIS151, SER152, ALA259, it was also able to interact with several hydrophobic interactions that included HIS151, ALA259, PHE215, ALA260, ILE78, ARG256, LEU264. The activity of pancreatic lipase (PDB No: 1LPB) is maintained by the catalytic triad (His263, Ser152 and Asp176 residues) present in active pocket of enzyme. Furthermore, Ser152 is the most important residue for lipolytic activity and any chemical modification of SER152 can demolish the activity. Therefore, a compound that can bind with triad, particularly with SER152 can inhibit lipolysis. Among phytochemicals identified in leaf extract, isomangiferin, kaempferol-3-

 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, isovitexin-3″-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucopyranoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside made strong hydrogen bonds with SER152. High binding affinities and interaction with key residues speculated that these plant based compounds can contribute significantly to pancreatic lipase inhibition activities.
