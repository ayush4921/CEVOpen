<p>The molecular docking analysis provided an insight of structural interaction playing deep inside the enzyme active site pockets. The findings elucidated the role of terminal hydroxyl groups and oxygen to develop H-bonding with amino acid residues of enzyme to produce energetically favorable conformations [

 <sc>d</sc>-(6′’-acetyl)-glucopyranoside were detected in current study. The identified compounds were found to have favorable binding affinity even better than orlistat (positive control) and proved as excellent chemical markers to inhibit the activity of pancreatic lipase enzyme which may be a helping tool for drug development.
