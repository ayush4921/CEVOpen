<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of pancreatic lipase inhibition were compared, and it was noted that all extracts showed considerable inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity. However, the statistical analysis signified 60% ethanolic extract as most effective and potent source for pancreatic lipase inhibitors (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The porcine pancreatic lipase inhibition by extracts of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> was moderately effective than findings of previous works [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was evident from the findings of current research that there was a direct relationship between polyphenol contents, antioxidant activity and pancreatic lipase inhibitory properties of leaf extracts of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic>. Therefore, 60% ethanolic extract being most potent may be a rich source of some lipase inhibitory agents to mitigate or reduce the intensity of obesity.
