<p>The inhibition of pancreatic lipase routes to reduce the lipids digestion and resultant fatty acid absorption through intestine. This phenomenon can be improvised by incorporating natural products and ingredients in foods for antiobesity traits. The inhibition of pancreatic lipase shown by plant extracts was likely ought to presence of secondary metabolites. The structural features of secondary metabolites or phytochemicals have the ability to bind with the amino acid residues of proteins to restrict their functions [

Therefore, pancreatic lipase can be inhibited through blocking of functional residues. The phytochemicals as chemical markers may have potential to induce conformational changes in enzyme structure to inhibit its activity. The role of phytochemicals is pivotal in lipase inhibition and the identification of compound is highly needed in this regard. A study reported the antiobesity role of
