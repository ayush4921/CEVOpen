<p id="Par37">Indigo naturalis has clear antiviral activity, as dose Radix Isatidis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Neuraminidase (NA) is a necessary enzyme for replication of the influenza virus. At present, blocking the function of neuraminidase is recognized as an effective way to treat influenza presently. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are commonly used neuraminidase inhibitors, which commonly used to prevent and treat influenza. Therefore, our research team developed a biological assay to characterize the antiviral activity of indigo naturalis by determining the inhibitory rate of neuraminidase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The neuraminidase-based bioassay was high-throughput and simple, and could be used for evaluation and quality control of indigo naturalis.
