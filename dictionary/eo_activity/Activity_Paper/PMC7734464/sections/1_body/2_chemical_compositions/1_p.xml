<p id="Par27">Although inorganic substances in indigo naturalis occupy the majority, organic substances are main active components. The organic components can be divided into the following categories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Besides, organic composition ratio of indigo naturalis may not be exactly the same, which depended on the source of stems and leaves.
