<p id="Par44">Indole alkaloids, especially bisindole nuclear alkaloids, have been widely concerned in the field of anti-infection due to their special structure, strong analogues, high selectivity and low side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Indigo naturalis is rich in indole alkaloids, and the anti-virus research of indigo naturalis mainly focuses on indigo and indirubin. Influenza virus is the pathogen of influenza, especially influenza A virus is easy to mutate, causing a worldwide pandemic [

Indirubin could reduce activation of the chemokine regulated on, the expression of normal T cell and the secretion of influenza virus A/NWS/33- infected H292 human epithelial cell line. And this inhibitory effect was also observed as well as influenza virus B/Lee-infected cells [

Indigo and indirubin have strong killing activity against Japanese encephalitis virus, which may be related to block virus attachment. Especially indirubin has a strong protective effect on lethal Japanese encephalitis virus model [

 <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-coronavirus in dose dependence, which can induce the hydrolysis of replication enzyme polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins [
