<p id="Par43">Indigo naturalis and its active components have good antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The antimicrobial assays in 
 <italic>vitro</italic> suggested that the ethyl acetate extract of indigo naturalis could remarkably inhibit gram-positive bacteria (methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and mildly inhibit noncutaneous fungal pathogens of onychomycosis (
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For these bacteria, tryptanthrin has better antibacterial activity than indigo. It could suppress the growth of pathogens by intercalating into bacterial DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Indigo can cause extensive oxidative damage so as to host cell death by promoting superoxide production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the absence of light, indigo can have antibacterial effects on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 240 µm). Interestingly, in the presence of light, a lower dose of indigo (MIC/2) can show antibacterial effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Indirubin can also inhibit 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin. This mechanism may be interrelated to the inhibition of NorA efflux pump in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Indigo is the isomer of indirubin, but there is no related research on its inhibition of NorA efflux pump.
