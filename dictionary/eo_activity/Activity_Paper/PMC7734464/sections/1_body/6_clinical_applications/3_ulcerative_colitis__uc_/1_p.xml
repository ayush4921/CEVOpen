At the same time, there are also adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal reactions, liver injury and pulmonary hypertension, but there is no death (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In order to further research the safety of indigo naturalis in treating UC, a follow-up survey was carried out in 877 patients using indigo naturalis. It was found that 91 patients (107 cases) had adverse reactions, including 40 cases of liver dysfunction, 21 cases of gastrointestinal symptoms, 13 cases of headache and 11 cases of pulmonary hypertension. Liver dysfunction is mildly reversible. Surgery is required in 40% of patients with intestinal adhesions. After stopping the treatment, pulmonary hypertension could heal itself without any death [
