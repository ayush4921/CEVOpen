<p id="Par55">In recent years, indigo naturalis has been widely used in the treatment of leukemia, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and other diseases, as well as been recognized by experimental research and clinical observation. However, it seems that indigo naturalis lacks accurate dose-response relationship research and direct clinical big data to guide clinical application, especially its safety. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out clinical observations with randomized controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center and large sample, which is conducive to the further development and clinical application of indigo naturalis. Additionally, it should speed up the development of indigo naturalis preparation to be convenient for the clinical application and improve the safety of indigo naturalis.</p>
