<p>DPPH radical scavenging array is a spectrophotometric quantitative method based upon the reaction between the antioxidant compounds in the extracts samples and DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> reagent in an alcoholic solution 2 mL (at different concentrations) of both CHME and CHT extracts were added to 2 mL of a 0.1 gL
 <sup>−1</sup> DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> methanol solution. After 30 min in a thermostatic bath at 40 °C, the variation of the absorbance was measured at 517 nm (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.997). The percent of DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> scavenging ability was calculated as follows: DPPH scavenging ability % = (A control − A sample/A control) × 100, where A control is the absorbance of DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> radical + methanol (containing all reagents except the sample) and A sample is the absorbance of DPPH radical + sample extract. The percentage of DPPH decrease was quantified in Trolox equivalents (TE). The DPPH radical scavenging activity of C. intybus extracts was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (µg/mL). IC
 <sub>50</sub>(half maximal inhibitory concentration) value relates to the antioxidant capacity; if IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 50 µg/mL, the samples have good antioxidant capacity, if IC
 <sub>50</sub> is contained within the range of (50–100) µg/mL, the antioxidant capacity of the extracts is moderate and if IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≥ 200 µg/mL the samples have low to negligible antioxidant capacity [
