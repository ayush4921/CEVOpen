<p>Our phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> tincture found an important concentration of polyphenols, especially flavonoids and cichoric acid. These phenolic compounds are largely involved in the antioxidant activity of the extracts with better results in the in vivo experiments than in vitro. Studies found in literature, comparing the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant effects of a vegetable extract, have revealed that some extracts manifest antioxidant activity both in vitro and in vivo, but for some extracts, the in vitro activity does not correlate with the in vivo antioxidant capacity. This can be related to the possible differences between the chemical structure of the phenolics, the free radicals used in the in vitro methods, and the complexity of the physiologically substances that produce oxidative effects in the organism of the animal [
