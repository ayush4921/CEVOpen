<p>Taken together, these results showed that 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> tincture has antioxidant effect in ISO-induced MI by reducing the oxidants and increasing the antioxidants. Moreover, the oxidant reduction is not associated with lipoperoxides and NO reduction. These results are important because systemic oxidative stress reduction decrease the risk of systemic complications in MI. Because myocardium is an organ that is vulnerable to oxidative damage due to the lack of antioxidant systems, systemic oxidative stress reduction may diminish the myocardial injury during MI [
