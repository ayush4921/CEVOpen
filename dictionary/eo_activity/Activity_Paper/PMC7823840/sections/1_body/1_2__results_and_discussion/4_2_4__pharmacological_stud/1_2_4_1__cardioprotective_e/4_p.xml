<p>Oxidative stress was evaluated systemically by global tests, such as TOS, OSI and TAC, and by specific tests, such as MDA, SH and NOx (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00064-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). When evaluation oxidative stress, in ISO group there was an important reduction of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and a significant increase of total oxidative status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI). CHT reduced the oxidative stress by a slight increase of TAC (
 <italic>p</italic> ˂ 0.05) and a significant decrease of TOS and OSI (
 <italic>p</italic> ˂ 0.001). The decrease of malondyaldehide (MDA) levels made a small contribution (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) to oxidative stress reduction. The concentrations of total nitrites and nitrates (NOx) and total thiols (SH) were not influenced by any CHT dilutions.
