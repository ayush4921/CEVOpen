<p>Phenolic compounds are considered of major relevance in the total antioxidant capacity for a lot of medicinal plants. The chemical structure of the phenolic compounds, (more exactly the number of available hydroxyl groups) and their concentration are related to the antioxidant capacity of the extracts. The mixture of phenolic compounds present in extracts can determine different supplementary effects such as synergistically, additively or antagonistically actions, that influence the total capacity of the extract to neutralize free radicals. Both phenolic acids and flavonoids are known as antioxidant compounds, but their ability depends not only on the quantities but on the chemical structure also [
