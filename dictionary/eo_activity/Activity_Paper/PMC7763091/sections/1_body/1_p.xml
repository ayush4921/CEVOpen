<p>Professor Dieter Schinzer had his initial training in organic synthesis with eminent mentors (Professors Manfred Reetz, Clayton Heathcock and Ekkehard Winterfeldt). Despite his wide research interests in organometallic chemistry (especially silicon, tin and manganese), synthetic methodology and medicinal chemistry, Dr. Schinzer is first and foremost a devoted natural product chemist. In 1997, his research group was among the first to achieve the total synthesis of epothilones. His interest in medicinal chemistry led him to be a founder and Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) of Molecular Links Sachsen-Anhalt GmbH (MOLISA, Berlin, Germany) in 2002. He has been instrumental in developing several European COST research consortia under the general umbrella of Bioactive Natural Product synthesis. He also served as the Chairman of the COST Domain Committee for Chemistry and Molecular Sciences from 2006 to 2009. Within these activities, Professor Schinzer initiated a highly successful series of ”ESF-COST High-Level Research Conference Natural Products Chemistry, Biology and Medicine” held at Acquafredda di Maratea, Italy. This issue highly reflects the atmosphere in those meetings.</p>
