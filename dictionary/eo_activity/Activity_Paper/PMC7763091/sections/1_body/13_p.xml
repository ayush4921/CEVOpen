<p>The vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction (VMAR) is a powerful transformation as it allows the synthesis of larger carbon frameworks containing a double bond between the carbonyl and hydroxy functionalities. The reaction efficiently generates two new stereocenters. The review by Cordes and Kalesse [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] gives a comprehensive introduction to this important transformation. A pedagogically sound introduction gives the reader adequate understanding to follow the ensuing examples. Both enantioselective and diastereoselective variants of the reaction are discussed using a number of examples from natural product syntheses.
