<p>Mucosin is a C
 <sub>20</sub>-compound related to arachidonic acid. It was isolated in 1997 from the Mediterranean sea sponge 
 <italic>Reniera mucosa</italic>, and the structure of its methyl ester was elucidated by spectroscopic means. Stereocontrolled total synthesis by the authors of the present paper showed that the proposed structure was incorrect. In this paper, Nols√∏e et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] consider different biosynthetic pathways from arachidonic acid to mucosin, including both concerted and stepwise processes. The authors conclude that mucosin does not share its biogenetic origin with polyketide marine natural products containing the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-bicyclo[4.3.0]non-2-ene core but is derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids through a different route.
