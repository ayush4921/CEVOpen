<p>The Pictet–Spengler reaction (PS) is an efficient versatile synthetic method for the construction of privileged pharmacophores including tetrahydroisoquinolines and tetrahydro-β-carbolines. The review by Calcaterra et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] highlights the developments within a five-year period (2011–2015) in great detail (313 references, 89 Schemes). The review covers applications in total synthesis of complex alkaloids, in combination with chiral catalysts as well as for the generation of libraries of compounds in medicinal chemistry. The PS reactions in combination with ring closing metathesis, isomerization, Michael addition, and gold- or Brønsted acid-catalyzed N-acyliminium cyclizations are covered, as well as Ugi multicomponent reactions. Syntheses of peptidomimetics, synthetic heterocycles, and natural compounds are covered, and finally, the enzymatic versions of PS are described for biosynthesis, biotransformations, and bioconjugations.
