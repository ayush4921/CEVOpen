<p>Of the three types of opioid receptors (µ, δ, κ), the κ-opioid receptor is considered especially interesting as its activation produces analgesia with minimal physical dependence. The Hudlicky research group has a long history of investigating chemoenzymatic synthesis of morphinans. In this paper [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], they describe an efficient synthesis of (+)-10-keto-oxycodone with a total of 14 operations and an overall yield of about 2%. The absolute stereochemistry was secured via a whole cell fermentation with 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JM109 (pDTG601A) enzymatic dihydroxylation of phenethyl acetate to the corresponding 
 <italic>cis</italic>-cyclohexadienediol. Subsequent reactions were involved an intramolecular Heck cyclization, samarium iodide mediated pinacol type coupling, and a CAN-mediated functionalization to give a key azidonitrate.
