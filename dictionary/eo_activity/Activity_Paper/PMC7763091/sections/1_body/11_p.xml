<p>Enantioselective synthesis of complex bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals has gained importance especially within the last four decades. During the past two decades, organocatalytic reactions have become prominent, and the review by Wang [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] details those achieved using chiral secondary amine catalyzed reactions of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Friedel Crafts reactions, Michael additions (in their oxa, aza, and normal versions), hydrogenation reactions, and cycloadditions (cyclopropanations, epoxidations, Diels-Alder reactions including IMDA, [3 + 2]- and [3 + 3]-cycloadditions) are covered with extensive examples. Finally, asymmetric organocatalytic cascade reactions are highlighted in the synthesis of a lignan compound and several alkaloids. Impressive examples are highlighted, such as the shortest asymmetric total synthesis of frondosin B, industrial scale asymmetric total synthesis of MK-0974, organocascade and collective asymmetric total syntheses of strychnine, and other indole alkaloids. Significant challenges remain, however, for instance in the industrial scale application in enantioselective drug synthesis.
