<p>Articular cartilage is known to lubricate the ends of bones, thus, changes in articular cartilage can ultimately result in osteoarthritis. We further observed, via H&amp;E staining, that injection of STZ leads to a decrease in the thickness of the femoral articular cartilage, lower chondrocyte numbers, and increased tidemark roughness. Some reports explained the cartilage becomes hypocellular in the late stages of osteoarthritis (Hwang and Kim 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In line with our results, Xu et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed the roughness of tidemark increased with loss of chondrocyte and irregular arrangement in the osteoarthritis mice. These findings together indicate the progression of osteoarthritis-like disorder in diabetic rats. Indeed, the osteoarthritis-like consequences have been reported in T1DM and T2DM rats (Onur et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; King and Rosenthal 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Activation of oxidative stress is thought to be partially responsible for these changes. However, this hypothesis warrants further investigation. Of interest, thicker calcified cartilage with chondrocyte hypertrophy was observed in the DFD rats. Permuy et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) showed that thickened articular cartilage and chondrocyte hypertrophy is a distinctive feature of the early stages of osteoarthritis in animal models. Several studies reported that inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy represents a therapeutic target to slow down further osteoarthritis progression (Yahara et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesised that 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment is effective in delaying the pathogenetic progression of osteoarthritis in diabetic rats.
