<p>The present studies have also indicated that there is a close relationship between bone health and fatty acids profile. The DC and DMET rats with histological and biochemical evidence of bone loss and osteoarthritis-like disorder showed a significant decrease in total bone 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 PUFA and an increase in 
 <italic>n</italic> − 6: 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 ratio (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). These changes, however, have greatly improved following 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment. Recent work by Longo and Ward (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) has shown that a high intake of 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 PUFA was possible to increase BMD and reduce the risk of fragility fracture. Previous works also demonstrate that 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 PUFA supplementation may have a protective effect on bone metabolism by decreasing bone resorption markers (Griel et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Indeed, the BMD was much higher (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and the DPD was much lower (
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) in the DFD rats compared to other animals treated with STZ. This finding lends additional evidence to further support the potential of 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment against bone loss in STZ-treated rats.
