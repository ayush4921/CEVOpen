<p>The histological section of normal rat femur showed a network of bone trabeculae at the distal femoral metaphysis which separated by bone marrow spaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A1)</xref>). It was also found that osteocytes were surrounded by their lacunae in the bone matrix. As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C1)</xref>, a normal healthy articular cartilage was observed on the distal femur of NC rats in which the calcified cartilage layer is flanked by an undulating tidemark. Conversely, the DC rats displayed a sparse and thinner trabecular structure of the cancellous bone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A2)</xref>) along with a paucity of cells in the proliferative zone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B2)</xref>). The thickness of the cortical layer and articular cartilage was phenotypically decreased in the DC rats. Strikingly, it was observed that the bone trabeculae were more orderly arranged and bone matrix density increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B4)</xref>) in the DFD rats. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(D4)</xref> also showed that less cortical erosion was found following 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> treatment. However, the DFD rats were associated with thicker calcified cartilage with chondrocyte hypertrophy.
