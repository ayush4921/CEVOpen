<p>Additionally, ADME properties of the most active compounds were determined in various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays including solubility, lipophilicity, permeability, metabolic stability and binding to plasma proteins. Five compunds from benzothiazole series (
 <bold>5c–5e, 5 g, 5 h</bold>) showed moderate to good kinetic solubility, in general good metabolic stability and high binding to plasma proteins. They are also characterised by low permeability and could be classified as P-gp substrates.
