<p>A suspension of 6-cyanobenzothiazole 
 <bold>1</bold> (4.0 g, 25 mmol) in 50 ml of dry 2-methoxyethanol was cooled to 5 °C and saturated with dry gaseous HCl. The flask was stoppered and stirred at room temperature for 4 days. Excess of HCl was removed from the suspension with a stream of nitrogen and the reaction mixture was poured into diethyl-ether. The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with diethyl-ether and dried under reduced pressure over KOH. The intermediate imidoyl-ether dihydrochloride was suspended in 100 ml of abs ethanol and 1,3-propylenediamine (10.5 ml, 125 mmol) added under nitrogen atmosphere.
