<p>Tested compounds (final concentration of 1 µM, 0.1% DMSO), as well as testosterone and propranolol as positive controls and caffeine as negative control were incubated in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) for 60 min at 37 °C with liver microsomes (human and mouse) in the absence and presence of the NADPH cofactor. The NADPH generating system was prepared in phosphate buffer and consisted of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP, 0.38 mM), glucose-6-phosphate (1.49 mM), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.5 U) and magnesium chloride (0.1 mM). Aliquots were taken at different time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min) and reaction was terminated by addition of a MeCN/MeOH (2:1) mixture, containing diclofenac as internal standard. Samples were then centrifuged (at 4500 rpm, at 4 °C, for 30 min) and resulting supernatants were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> half life (t
 <sub>½</sub>) was determined from the slope of the linear regression of ln % parent compound remaining versus incubation time. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> intrinsic clearance, expressed as µl/min/mg liver, was determined from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> half life (t

 <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatic clearance was determined from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> intrinsic clearance assuming 52.5 mg of protein/g of liver and using constant values for liver weight/body weight [g/kg] (25.7 for human, 87.5 for mouse) and liver blood flow (LBF) [ml/min/kg] (21 for human and 131 for mouse).
