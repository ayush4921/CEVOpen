<p>The structures of all newly prepared amidino substituted benzimidazole/benzothiazole derivatives were confirmed by means of 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectroscopy. NMR analysis based on the values of chemical shifts and H–H coupling constants in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H spectra confirmed the structures of compounds. Furthermore, 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR chemical shifts were consistent with the suggested structures. Also, IR spectroscopy was used for the monitoring of Pinner reaction due to the synthesis of main precursors 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3.</bold>
