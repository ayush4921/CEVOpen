<p>ADME results are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (active compounds) and 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> (non-active compounds). To avoid mistake in our conclusion, that some compounds are active in 3 D because such cell cultures are more similar to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions and that this is advantage in implementation of 3 D assay, we should excluded possibility that active compounds are active due to better ADME properties (especially solubility, and lipophilicity) in comparison to non-active compounds. Therefore, we profiled active and non-active compounds and see that ADME properties are the same for all tested compounds. In general, no significant difference was observed in ADME profile for these two set of compounds.
