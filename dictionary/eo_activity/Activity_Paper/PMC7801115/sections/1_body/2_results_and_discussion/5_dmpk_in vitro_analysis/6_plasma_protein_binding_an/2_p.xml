<p>Test compounds showed different range of binding to proteins of human and mouse plasma. In general, lower binding is observed in the group of inactive compounds, what could probably be explained by their lower lipophilicity (with exception of 
 <bold>6 g</bold>). 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6 b</bold>, 
 <bold>5 b</bold> and 
 <bold>6e</bold> are characterised by low binding in both species, with fraction bound (% Fb) between 54.3 and 75.1%. Compounds 
 <bold>6c</bold>, 
 <bold>6d</bold> and 
 <bold>6f</bold>, are characterised by moderate binding in both species, with fraction bound (% Fb) between 80 and 95%. 
 <bold>5d</bold> showed moderate binding in human plasma, with fraction bound of 94.7% and high binding in mouse plasma (% Fb= 96.0). On contrary, remaining compounds 
 <bold>5c</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, 
 <bold>5 g</bold> and 
 <bold>5 h</bold> in both species and 
 <bold>6 g</bold> in human plasma are characterised by high binding, with fraction bound between 95 and 99%. In addition, 
 <bold>6 g</bold>, one of the most lipophilic compounds, shows even higher binding, i.e. very high binding in mouse plasma, with fraction bound of 99.7%. All test compounds are stable in both human and mouse plasma (&gt;70% after 4 h incubation). These results are in accordance with recovery values obtained in PPB experiment.
