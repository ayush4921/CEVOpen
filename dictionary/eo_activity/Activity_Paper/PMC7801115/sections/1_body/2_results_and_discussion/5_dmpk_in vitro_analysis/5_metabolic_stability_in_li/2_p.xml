<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolic stability, expressed as predicted 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatic clearance (% of liver blood flow, LBF), of selected compounds was investigated in human and mouse liver microsomes. Following incubation in liver microsomes majority of compounds are classified as stable molecules in both species and have low predicted 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> clearance values (&lt;30% LBF). As exceptions to this, compounds 
 <bold>5e</bold> and 
 <bold>6 g</bold> (in mouse liver microsomes) and 
 <bold>6a</bold> (in both species) are characterised by moderate clearance (30–70% LBF). Compounds 
 <bold>6d</bold>, 
 <bold>6e</bold> and 
 <bold>6f</bold> are characterised by high clearance (&gt;70% LBF) in mouse liver microsomes.
