<p>Other tested compounds showed very low activity or were not active at all. As we mention before, viability of cell (MTS assay) is a measure of the living cells whereas proliferation (BrdU) test is a measure of cell division (or proliferation rate). All active compounds (
 <bold>5c–e, 5 g, 5 h and 6a</bold>) showed strong activity in BrdU assay on NCI-H358 cell line, in comparison with MTS assay for the same cell line, meaning that compounds have promising antiproliferative effect with lower cytotoxicity potency. As we describe previoslly, cell grown in a 3 D environment support their natural 3 D physical shape and viable cells in the proliferating stage are mainly on the outer layer due to higher exposition to the medium

 </xref>. We assume that low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in 3 D format assays for some active compounds are consequence of more exposed outer layer of proliferative cells on spheroids. Nevertheless, the proliferating rates cells in sferoids is depend on cell types, number of cells in inoculum, conditions in which cells are cultured but above of all is depend of cell line sensitivity and suscetability to antitumor drugs.
