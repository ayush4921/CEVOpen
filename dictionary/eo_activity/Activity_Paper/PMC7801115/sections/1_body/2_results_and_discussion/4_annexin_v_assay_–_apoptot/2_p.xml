<p>Mechanism of action of most active compounds in antiproliferative assay, benzothiazole derivatives 
 <bold>5c</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold>, 
 <bold>5 g</bold>, 
 <bold>5 h</bold> and one benzimidazole derivative 
 <bold>6a</bold>, was tested. As shown on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, all active compounds have similar mode of action on A549 cell line as standard compound doxorubicin, which is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic that binds to nucleic acids by specific intercalation of the planar anthracycline nucleus with the DNA double helix. These results are in line with proposed chemical structure of novel amidino substituted benzimidazole/benzothiazole derivatives that suggest possible intercalation to DNA because of the structural similarity of benzimidazole scaffold with naturally occurring purines. Similar results were obtained for other cell lines tested (not shown).
