<p>In addition to the previously reported hypotensive, vasorelaxant, cardiodepressant [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and antioxidant effects [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract showed tracheorelaxant activity. Specifically, our study demonstrated that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> possesses a tracheorelaxant effect against increasing concentrations of ACh (0.3 nM to 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). SRE could act directly via cholinergic receptors localized on the cells of the tracheal smooth muscle [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and exert its effects through cholinergic mechanisms, possibly mediated by calcium channel blockade [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
