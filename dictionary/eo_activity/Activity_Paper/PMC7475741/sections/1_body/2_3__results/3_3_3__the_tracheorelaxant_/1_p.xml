<p>In the next series of experiments, the tracheal rings were treated with 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract after their muscle was precontracted by carbachol (also known carbamylcholine, CCh), high (80 mM) K
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The cumulative concentration of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (0.3–2 mg/mL) significantly reduced high CCh- and K
 <sup>+</sup>-evoked tracheal contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Specifically, the cotreatment of rabbit tracheal rings with CCh and 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract resulted in significant decrease in the muscle contraction effect in rabbits as compared with CCh alone, reaching the statistical significance at 0.5 mg/mL of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract-induced relaxant effect was more pronounced in higher 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract concentrations precontracted with CCh.
