<p>The plant material (the shoot system) from SR was manually picked in Albania during 2018, free of any dust particles, and shade-dried away from strong winds. Subsequently, it was grinded to coarse powder by the grinding machine. The plant material was then soaked in 80% aqueous ethanol solvent for 24 h with occasional/continuous shaking. The material was passed through the filter paper. The filtrate was carefully concentrated by an evaporator under pressure. The dried extract was transferred into containers and kept in the refrigerator at 4°C for their future use. Different dilutions of the crude plant extract from the stock were made fresh on the day of the experiment.</p>
