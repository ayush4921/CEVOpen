<p id="Par30">The total flavonoid content of NLE extract was determined as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Briefly, a mass of 100 μg of different concentration of NLE extract was placed in a 96 well plate, 2% aluminium chloride was added to each well and incubated at room temperature. Absorbances were then read at 420 nm. Total flavonoid was evaluated as quercetin equivalent (mg/ml).
