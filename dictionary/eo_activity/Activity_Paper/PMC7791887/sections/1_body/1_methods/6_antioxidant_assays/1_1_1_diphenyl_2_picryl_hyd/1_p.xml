<p id="Par33">The DPPH assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Briefly, different concentrations of NLE extract were made by threefold serial dilutions starting from an initial concentration of 20 mg/ml. The test samples (100 μL) were added in triplicates to 100 μL of DPPH in well plates and gently shaken. The plate was covered with a foil and incubated in the dark, at room temperature, for 20 min. Absorbances were then read at 517 nm. The amount of sample required to react with one half of the DPPH was expressed as the relative amount of the positive control, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), that reacted. Antioxidant activity of samples was expressed as DPPH radical scavenging by the formula:
