<p id="Par41">Cell culture and treatment were performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Jurkat, MCF-7 and Chang liver cell lines, provided by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, were cultured in EMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and all cells were maintained at 37 °C, 100% relative humidity, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 95% air, and culture media changed twice a week. The cells were subcultured when they reached 80% confluence. For the treatment of adherent cells (MCF-7and Chang Liver cells), well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well were seeded with 100 μl of cell suspension and incubated for 24 h. The extract concentrations ranged from 62.5 to 1000 μg/ml and curcumin (positive control) from concentrations of 0 to 36.84 μM were then added to the cells and incubated for 48 h. For the treatment of suspension cells (Jurkat), 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>cells/well were seeded and varying concentrations of the extract (62.5 to 1000 μg/ml) and curcumin (0 to 36.84 μM) were added in the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>.
