<p id="Par40">Rats were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into citrate tubes under sterile conditions. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was determined as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Briefly, the Westergren pipette was gently inserted into the citrate tube, and by capillary action, the anticoagulated blood rose to the 0 mm mark to the top of the pipette. The pipette was placed into a stand and fixed in a vertical position for 1 h. The sedimentation rate was then measured in mm/h by reading from the calibrations on the pipette.
