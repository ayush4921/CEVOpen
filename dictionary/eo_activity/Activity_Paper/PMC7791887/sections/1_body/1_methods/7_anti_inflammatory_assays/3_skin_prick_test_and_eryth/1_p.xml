<p id="Par39">The skin prick test was performed, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Briefly, rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 5 each and sensitized (group 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) or not (group 1) by intraperitoneal and subcutaneously injections of albumin (OVA) emulsified in aluminum hydroxide on days 1 and 7. Group 1 (non-sensitized control) and group 2 (OVA-sensitized control) received distilled water orally. In contrast, groups 3, 4 and 5 were pre-treated with daily oral administration of NLE extracts (100, 250 and 500 mg/kg bw) and group 6 with intraperitoneal administration of hydrocortisone succinate (4 mg/kg bw) over 8 days, from day 1. On day 9, two separate areas on the skin of all rats were shaved using a blade and the prick test was carried out on all rats by subcutaneous injection of histamine. The time for the appearance of the swelling was noted and the wheal diameters were recorded for all rats at 1 h and 2 h after histamine injection. The average skin oedema was calculated for each group and expressed as a percentage of the OVA-sensitized control. Percentage of skin oedema relative to that of OVA-sensitized control for each group was calculated according to the formula:
