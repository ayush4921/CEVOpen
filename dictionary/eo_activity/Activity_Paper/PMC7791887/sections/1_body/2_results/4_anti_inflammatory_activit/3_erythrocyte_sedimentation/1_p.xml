<p id="Par50">Control rats sensitised by ovalbumin showed a significantly increased ESR (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) when compared to the non-sensitized rats. Ovalbumin-sensitized rats treated with increasing doses of NLE exhibited a dose-dependent decrease of the ESR. However, this NLE-induced decrease of ESR was significant at 250 and 500 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01 respectively). Also, ESR was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01) in rats treated with hydrocortisone when compared the control sensitised rats (see Fig.
