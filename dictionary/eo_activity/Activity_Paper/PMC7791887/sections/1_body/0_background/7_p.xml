<p id="Par26">Secondary metabolites found in plants that have been shown to be pharmacologically active include flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, glycosides and sugars, among others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The World Health Organization therefore recommends systemic determination of heavy metal content and maximum permissible levels of some heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic, and lead) in raw consumable plant materials [
