 <p>(2-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-3-(1
  <italic>H</italic>-indol-1-yl)-1-(1,2,4-1
  <italic>H</italic>-triazol-1-yl)propan-2-ol (
  <bold>8 g</bold>), a new 1,2,4-triazole-indole hybrid molecule, showed a broad-spectrum activity against 
  <italic>Candida,</italic> particularly against low fluconazole-susceptible species. Its activity was higher than fluconazole and similar to voriconazole on 
  <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (MIC
  <sub>90</sub> = 0.25, 64 and 1 µg/mL, respectively), 
  <italic>C. krusei</italic> (MIC
  <sub>90</sub> = 0.125, 64 and 0.125 µg/mL, respectively) and 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MIC
  <sub>90</sub> = 0.5, 8 and 0.25 µg/mL, respectively). The action mechanisms of 
  <bold>8 g</bold> were also identified as inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis and phospholipase A2-like activity. At concentration as low as 4 ng/mL, 8g inhibited ergosterol production by 82% and induced production of 14a-methyl sterols, that is comparable to the results obtained with fluconazole at higher concentration. 
  <bold>8 g</bold> demonstrated moderate inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2-like activity being a putative virulence factor. Due to a low MRC5 cytotoxicity, this compound presents a high therapeutic index. These results pointed out that 
  <bold>8 g</bold> is a new lead antifungal candidate with potent ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition.
