<p>Cytotoxicity of compounds was studied with human fibroblast (MRC5). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-aldrich) supplemented with 10% foetal bovin serum (Sigma-aldrich). Drugs were tested at three concentrations (100, 10 and 1 µM) in triplicate. After a 96 h-incubation time cytotoxicity was measured on the Fluorolite 1000 (Dynatech, France) after a 4-h incubation time with Uptiblue
 <sup>®</sup> (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Inhibitory concentration 50 is a mean of triplicate values. A toxicity index was determined as follow: IC
 <sub>50</sub> against MRC5/Geometric mean of the MICs against
