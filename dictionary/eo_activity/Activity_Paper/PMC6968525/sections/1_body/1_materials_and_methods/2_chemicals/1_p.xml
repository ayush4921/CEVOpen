 <bold>8 g</bold> was dissolved in DMSO to prepare a stock solution at 10 mg/mL. This stock solution was diluted in RPMI 1640 for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment. For 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, to avoid injecting DMSO, compound 
 <bold>8 g</bold> was prepared in 0.5% Tween 20-sterile saline solution. Fluconazole and voriconazole (Pfizer) were obtained from Mycobiotics. Stock solutions were prepared in water and DMSO, respectively, at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.
