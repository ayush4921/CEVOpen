 <italic>In vivo</italic>, compound 
 <bold>8 g</bold> confirmed its antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In a systemic candidiasis model, it was as effective as fluconazole to allow mice survival. In addition, the modification of the initial administration protocol (the same dose three-times a day instead of twice a day) gave a complete protection. This second protocol also highlighted the importance to spread out the daily dose of 
 <bold>8 g</bold>, thus providing 24 h of protection against a systemic candidiasis.
