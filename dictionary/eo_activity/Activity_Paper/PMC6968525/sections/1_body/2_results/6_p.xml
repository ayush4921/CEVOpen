<p>Two fluconazole-resistant strains (CAKR7, MIC ≥ 64 µg/mL and CAGL2 MIC ≥ 64 µg/mL) were treated with 4 µg/mL fluconazole and no effect on sterol profile was observed. However, when CAKR7 and CAGL2 strains were treated with 
 <bold>8 g</bold> at the same dose, a significant diminution of ergosterol content was observed (25% to 47%) as well as an accumulation of lanosterol or obtusifoliol. As for CAAL93, a production of 14α-methyl-sterols was observed: eburicol, 14α-methylfecosterol and 14α-methylepisterol. Toxic 14α-methyl-diol was even detected for CAGL2 (23%). Modifications in sterol profiles after treatment with 
 <bold>8 g</bold> confirmed the blockage of 14α-demethylase (ERG11) by this compound.
