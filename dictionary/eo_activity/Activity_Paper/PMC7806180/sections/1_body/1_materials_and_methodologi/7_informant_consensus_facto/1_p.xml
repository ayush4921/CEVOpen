<p>Informant consensus factor was calculated for every category or group of diseases to determine the consensus value of informants on the reported ethnomedicinal uses for the group of diseases and later on various infirmities were categorized in different groups. ICF was calculated by the following formula:

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. This maximum value in ICF is one (01), if experimental values are one or near to one then it means that reported plant species are prevalently used by major part of the local communities confirming their authenticity regarding the ailments’ cure. If ICF value is zero (0) or near to zero then it confirms that local people randomly use the plant (s) to treat the cited infirmity [
