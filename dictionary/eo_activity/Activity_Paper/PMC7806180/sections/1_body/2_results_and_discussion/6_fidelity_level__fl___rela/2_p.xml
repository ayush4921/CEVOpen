<p>The informants provided ethnomedicinal data of 150 plants and on basis of relative priority level (RPL) 33 important diseasesâ€™ groups and highly medicinal plants of the area were prioritized in matrix form (
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). There is strong correlation between number of informants describing the particular plant species and number of usages as ethnomedicine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243151.g008">Fig 8</xref>) and there is also significant relationship between the number of informants citing the particular plant to cure a particular disease as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243151.g009">Fig 9</xref>. It is known that number of uses increases when number of informants rises because of correlation coefficient factor r = 0.10. For example, if one plant species is cited by more 25 or more informants as ethnomedicine; the number of its relative popularity level (RPL) is ranked as raised and RPL is determined as percentage of (I
 <sub>u</sub> /25) assigned score one (1) if cited or mentioned by the half or more number (12) of total informants (25) for any disease treatment and it is ranked as popular (P). If any plant is cited by less than 12 informants then RPL value will be ranked as unpopular (UP) (Amjad 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). The marginalized values between P and UP of the plant is point where if informants number is increased then number of medicinal uses per plant species does not rise. These two tools of ethnobotany are commonly used for determination of commonly use-ness in the local area for cure of diseases.
