<p>The protocol of “popular (P) and unpopular (UP)” demarcates plants into main two categories with reference of their cure potential for a specific disease. Out of one hundred and fifty medicinal plants; 33 plants species were selected for FL, RPL and ROP indices and highest RPL value (1.00) was found for 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> L., 
 <italic>Morus macruora</italic> Miq., 
 <italic>Justicia adhatoda</italic> L., 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> (L.) Pers., and 
 <italic>Ajuga bracteosa</italic> Wall ex Benth. each (

The high RPL values of these plant species may be referred to their significant medicinal potential and similarly the awareness and reliability of the local people on these medicinal plants. These findings are in consistent with past studies about the medicinal plants of different areas of the Pakistan [
