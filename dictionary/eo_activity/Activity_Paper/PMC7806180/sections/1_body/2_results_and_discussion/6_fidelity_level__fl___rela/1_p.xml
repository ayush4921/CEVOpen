<p>The fidelity level (FL), relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order of priority (ROP) indices were determined for 33 most predominant plants having highly medicinal values occurring in the study area (
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). FL of the plants ranged between 70% to100%; in which 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> L. had 100% FL which was used to cure hypertension, hyperlipidemia; 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> (L.) Pers. had FL of 100%, 
 <italic>Solanum surattense</italic> Burm.f. had 100% FL and these were used to cure gonorrhea, fever and least values of FL (70%) were explored for 
 <italic>Nerium oleander</italic> L. which was used to cure stomachache, skin rashes in local therapeutics. High values of FL indicates the prevalence of specific disease(s) in the local area and common use of the medicinal plants for curing these diseases [
