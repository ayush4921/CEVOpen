<p>The third quantitative index Rank order priority (ROP) was used for validation and confirmation of medicinal qualities of the plants reported by indigenous communities of Samahni area. This index is correlated with FL &amp; RPL and it may be assigned the name of correction factor, primarily used when FL values are different from RPL. The RPL and FL values along with ROP are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. It was explored that ROP values ranged between 24â€“100 and out of thirty three species of plants 26 species had more than 50 values of ROP. The highest ROP (100) was found for 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Flacourtia indica</italic> (Burm. f.) Merill., followed by 
 <italic>Morus macruora</italic> Miq. (with 97.0 ROP value) which were reported to be used to cure hypertension and hyperlipidemia and cough, chest infection, respectively. The least ROP value (24) was found for 
 <italic>Eruca sativa</italic> L. The higher ROP values than 50 means that these plants were predominantly used in local therapeutics and TEMs in the study area. The plant 
 <italic>Justicia adhatoda</italic> L. had ROP of 89 and was used to treat diabetes and bacterial infections, while 
 <italic>Solanum surattense</italic> Burm.f. with ROP of 92 was used to cure gonorrhea and fever. These findings were inlined with previous research works conducted on ethnomedicinal studies in different regions of Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and world [
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The low ROP of some reported plants in this study indicate that either these plants might be not easily available in the area or people use these plants less due to certain unknown reasons. This demands to do further ethnopharmacological and conservation work in the area to protect and conserve these medicinal plants which will also assist in documentation and preservation of bioculture and traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of the indigenous communities.
