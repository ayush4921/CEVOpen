<p>In this parameter, drug development prospective and potential of the medicinal plants (MPs) is calculated by using formula of relative importance of plants (RIP) which is based on its relative pharmacological (reh. Ph.) properties of a species and body systems (BS) cured. Moreover, the multiple use of these MPs as agricultural products (agro-uses) with trade potential was also determined to prove their multiple-use, popularity and financial impact on life of local communities of the study areas (
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The studies revealed that ethnopharmacological potential was described by using RIP which ranged between: 20.4 to 90.8. The highest RIP (90.80) was found for 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> A. Juss. with good number of agro-uses and its seeds and bark were sold in local markets and used in herbal therapeutics by indigenous practioners. Followed by 
 <italic>Justicia adhatoda</italic> L. with RIP (90.4) and 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> L. having RIP: 88.3 while least RIP value (20.4) was found for 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers. It was determined that MPs having less RIP values means that these plants have less medicinal or ethnopharmacological uses in TEMs in the study area. The other plants like: 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> L. (RIP:80), 
 <italic>Terminalia arjuna</italic> L. (RIP: 83.3), 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> DC. (RIP:79.6), 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> Lam. (RIP:87.8) and 
 <italic>Morus macruora</italic> Miq. (RIP: 79.2) depicted that these have high popularity in indigenous medicinal therapeutics and they can be declared are potential plants species for further ethnopharmacological pharmaceutical analysis to discover drug for infirmities treatment at larger scale. These findings are congruent with previous works [
