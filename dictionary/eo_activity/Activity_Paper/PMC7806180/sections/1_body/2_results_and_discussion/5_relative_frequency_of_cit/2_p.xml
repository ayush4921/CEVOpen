 <italic>Rhynchosia minima</italic> (L.) DC. (0.97 value) and 
 <italic>Loranthus longiflorus</italic> Desr. (0.95 value) as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The higher values of index of UV determines that plants species are extensively used by the indigenous people for curing of different ailments. This is indication of popularity of the local medicinal flora in local culture. The plants which have low value of UVI confirms that these are less available in the area or those have less ethnomedicinal uses in the area. These findings are comparatively similar with previous studies of different areas of Pakistan. It has been reported that 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (L.) Dunal. as used for cure of rheumatism, tumors, 
 <italic>Ziziphus nummularia</italic> was used for treatment of stings and skin allergies. It is stated that 
 <italic>Solanum surratense</italic> has many TEMs uses in local culture of the study area. Similar findings had been found in other studies of previous publications that the plant was known very medicinal in many traditional ethnomedicines [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Another plant 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> had also very effective TEM uses in local communities of the study area to cure sex and pregnancy problems [

 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> is very important medicinal species being used in local folklore phytonyms and these findings are in congruent with past works [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. High values of RFC and UVI for these and other medicinal plants proved that these plants were prevalently known as medicinal plants of the area.
