    "Shiraia bambusicola has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for a long history. Its major medicinal active metabolites are perylenequinones, including hypocrellin A, elsinochrome A and so on. At present, the fermentation yield of perylenequinones is low, and its complex biosynthesis and regulatory pathways are still unclear. In this study, nitric oxide, as a downstream signal molecule of hydrogen peroxide, regulates the biosynthesis of perylenequinones. Exogenous addition of 0.01Â mM sodium nitroprusside (nitric oxide donor) can promote perylenequinones production by 156% compared with the control. Further research found that hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide increased the transcriptional level of the biosynthetic genes of hypocrellin A. The results showed that nitric oxide is involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of perylenequinones in Shiraia bambusicola as a signal molecule. In the future, the yield of perylenequinones can be increased by adding exogenous nitric oxide in fermentation."
