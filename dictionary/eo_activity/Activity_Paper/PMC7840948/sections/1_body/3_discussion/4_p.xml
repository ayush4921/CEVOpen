 </sup>. In this study, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment can induce an increase of cytosolic NO content. In cPTIO + H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment, cPTIO could significantly inhibit the increase of PQs induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, while in CAT + SNP treatment, CAT could not significantly inhibit the increase of PQs content induced by SNP. These results suggested that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO signalling pathways are closely related in the progress of increasing PQs yield, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> may act as an upstream signal molecule of NO. This is in agreement with the finding that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> may act upstream of NO production in

 <sub>2</sub> fixation

 </sup>. Fungi can use nitrogen sources qualitatively or quantitatively through complex regulatory mechanisms. In order to further verify the role of NO in regulating PQs biosynthesis and speculate the possible mechanism, the following experiments were carried out. Different nitrogen sources such as NaNO
 <sub>3</sub>, (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, Gln, NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> and no nitrogen sources were added to the culture medium to detect the effect of different nitrogen sources on the yield of PQs. Under the condition of 28 °C and 150 rpm for 80 h, the results showed that the content of PQs in the medium supplemented with NaNO
 <sub>3</sub> was higher than that in the medium supplemented with (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and Gln, while NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> showed toxic effect on the growth of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, and the absence of nitrogen source was not conducive to the growth of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). It is speculated that compared with (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and Gln, NaNO
 <sub>3</sub> is more easily metabolized to NO

 </sup>. There are several sites of action of NO in organisms, including catalase, oxyhaemoglobin, iron-sulphur enzymes such as aconitase and NADH dehydrogenase. Nanomolar NO concentrations inactivate or inhibit critical enzymes, including aconitase, affecting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
 <sup>

 </sup>. The previous RNA-Seq data showed that the gene encoding citrate synthase was down-regulated while the gene encoding ATP-citrate lyase was up-regulated in the high-yielding HA strain
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. It catalyzes the decomposition of citric acid to acetyl CoA and oxaloacetic acid, and acetyl CoA is the precursor of PQs biosynthesis. Therefore, we speculate that NO may affect the TCA cycle by binding to aconitase, resulting in the release of more precursors of PQs biosynthesis.
