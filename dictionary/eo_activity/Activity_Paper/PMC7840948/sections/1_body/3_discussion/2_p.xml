<p id="Par22">Many studies on the regulation of various physiological and developmental processes of plants by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> had been carried out, but fewer studies were on the regulation of secondary metabolisms of fungi. Deng et al. reported that hypocrellin production was improved by nearly 27% and 25% after 72 h incubation with 10 mM and 20 mM H

 <sub>2</sub>, respectively

 </sup>. Herein, we found that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> can participate in the biosynthesis of PQs by exogenous addition. The production of PQs can be significantly increased by using 0.01 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and the growth of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> can be significantly inhibited by high concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. It likely reflecting that the overload of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> caused the self-protection mechanism, and the higher dose significantly inhibited the liquid fermentation of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>, causing damage to the cells and reducing the amount of mycelium. NO has different effects on the production of secondary metabolites in different species. Liu et al. showed that the increase in NO levels alleviates heat stress-induced ganoderic acid accumulation, while the cross-promotion between NO and Ca

 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>

 </sup>. In this study, NO was able to significantly increase the PQs production as a signal molecule. It is speculated that NO may regulate the PQs biosynthetic genes through a series of complex signal transduction mechanisms, but the specific regulation mechanism remains to be studied.
