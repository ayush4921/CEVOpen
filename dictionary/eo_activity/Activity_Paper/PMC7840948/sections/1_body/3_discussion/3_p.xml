<p id="Par23">As a kind of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) molecule, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO may cause oxidative stress as external stress, which will lead to the change of PQs content in 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. In order to verify whether H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO affect the production of PQs through oxidative stress or chemical contact, the following experiments were carried out. Solid culture of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> was carried out in dark at 28 °C for 72 h, with different concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO, the colony morphology and growth rate were shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. The colony morphology and diameter size were not significantly different from the control. 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> expressed high tolerance to high concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO on solid medium. The supernatant of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> in liquid culture was filtered using sterile nylon membrane, different concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO were added respectively and cultured. The content of PQs in different media was detected every 24 h. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, the results showed that there was no significant difference in PQs content. These results proved that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO did not affect the accumulation of PQs through oxidative stress and chemical contact.
