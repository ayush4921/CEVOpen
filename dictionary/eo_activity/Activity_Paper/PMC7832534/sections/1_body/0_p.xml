<p>Novel biotechnological approaches that focuses on the utilization of bioactive compounds isolated from endophytes for a broad spectrum of biological potentials, including antibiotics, antiviral, immunosuppressant, antiparasitic, and antifungal activities, have sparked tremendous interest in recent research [
