<p>Sebum plays important physiological roles in human skin. Excess sebum production contributes to the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, and suppression of sebum production reduces acne incidence and severity. Four different experiments were conducted in the course of this study. For comparisons between different experiments, the incorporation of radioactive acetate into extract treated glands was normalized to matched control glands. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These normalized results were plotted and an exponential decay curve was fitted to the data. The point at which 50% reduction in total lipid incorporation (EC50 in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) is reached was calculated for each from the equation parameters (
