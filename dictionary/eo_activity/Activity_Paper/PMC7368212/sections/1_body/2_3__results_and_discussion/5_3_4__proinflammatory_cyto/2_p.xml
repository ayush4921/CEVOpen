<p>LPS-activated human monocytic cell line THP-1 were used here to measure the anti-inflammatory effects of SO and IH extracts which showed in previous experiments significant antibacterial and antisebum activities. LPS-activated human monocytic cell line THP-1 are known to produce various proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6 as well as NO [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The production of IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO by cultured THP-1 was tested in the culture supernatants using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5</xref> shows the dose-dependent inhibition of the LPS-mediated production of nitric oxide (NO). SO, SN, and IH extracts inhibited the NO production by cultured THP-1 in a dose-dependent manner reaching the control levels of untreated cells at a concentration of 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It was found that THP-1 produce detectable amounts of IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> after stimulation with LPS. Maximal TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 concentrations were detectable in the culture supernatants 4 h and 6 h after LPS stimulation, respectively. Therefore, the 4 h and 6 h time points were used to characterize the effects of SO and IH extracts on TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 production by cultured THP-1, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity and release of cytokines like TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is linked with an inflammatory mediator nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is a transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm of every cell and its constitutive activation is linked with 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> infection. The suppression of the cytokines TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> can possibly be due to blocking activation of common transcription factor such as NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B involved in their induction [
