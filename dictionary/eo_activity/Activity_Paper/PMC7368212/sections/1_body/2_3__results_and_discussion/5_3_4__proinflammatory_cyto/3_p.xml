 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 secretion into the culture supernatant of untreated and LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Both plant extracts inhibited the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production in a dose-dependent manner reaching the control levels of untreated cells at a concentration of 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). SO inhibited the IL-6 secretion by about 50% with no effects on the production levels of IL-6 at 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, while no effects were seen after treatment with IH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Saponins from SO enhanced the phagocytic, bactericidal, and adhesion activities of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Optimal conditions of saponin treatment (dose and duration) were determined for mice. Saponins promoted the maturation of human peripheral blood dendritic cells, which was observed by high expression of CD83 (terminal differentiation marker) and CD86 (bone-stimulating molecule) and of HLA-DR and HLA-ABC molecules on the cell membrane. Saponins modulated the production of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> in cultured peripheral blood intact cells. The results help to understand some mechanisms of the effects of saponins extracted from SO on the cellular and humoral factors of innate immunity and demonstrate good prospects of their practical use [
