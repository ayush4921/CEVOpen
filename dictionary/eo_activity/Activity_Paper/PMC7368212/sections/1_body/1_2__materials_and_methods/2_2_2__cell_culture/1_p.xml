<p>The human monocytic cell line THP-1 (ATCC 202-TIB) was obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). These cells express various receptors that are found in normal monocytes and have been used as a model system for inflammatory diseases since four decades. THP-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with a high glucose content (4.5 g/l), supplemented with 10% vol/vol inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml streptomycin. THP-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a cell density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cell/ml and activated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (100 ng/ml) and vitamin D3 (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) for 24 hours. Then, they were treated with the plant extracts (0–250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in a fresh serum-free medium in both the absence and presence of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of LPS.
