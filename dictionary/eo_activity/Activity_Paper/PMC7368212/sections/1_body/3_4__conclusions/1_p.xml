<p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder in which 
 <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> plays a critical role in its development when it overgrows in the pilosebaceous unit. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activity of nine Mediterranean plant extracts separately and in combination for the treatment of acne. This study shows a novel antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory effect of extracts from SO and IH when used as single. A double-blind, randomized, and controlled efficacy study was conducted with 41 facial acne vulgaris patients (ages 18–24). The patients were asked to apply AHC (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27) or placebo (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) on the affected area, two to three times daily for a period of six weeks. This study revealed that the combinations of the SO, IH and SN showed synergistic effects which dramatically halt sebum production from sebaceous glands, combined with highly antiseptic and anti-inflammatory activity, where 54.95% of acne inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions almost disappeared after two weeks of application, 85.3%, after five weeks, and 91.4%, at the end of sixth week. These results suggest that AHC shows favorable antiacne effects through antibacterial and antisebum effects as well as through significant reduction in the number of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions.
