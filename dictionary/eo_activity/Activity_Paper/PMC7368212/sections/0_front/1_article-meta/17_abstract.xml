 <p>The present 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy and safety of nine Mediterranean antiacne medicinal plants. The antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts were evaluated in cells from the immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human monocytic cell line (THP-1) as well as in a double-blind, randomized, and placebo‐controlled trial. Most of the extracts showed no significant cytotoxic effects on HaCaT cells up to 250 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. 
  <italic>Inula helenium</italic> (IH) and 
  <italic>Saponaria officinalis</italic> (SO) inhibited sebum production at 90 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 30 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. The inhibition effect of SO on the growth of 
  <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> was 1.2 times higher than that of chloramphenicol. IH and SO extracts significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced IL-6 and TNF-
  <italic>α</italic> production in THP-1 cells reaching the control levels of untreated cells at a concentration of 250 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. SO, IH, and 
  <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> (SN) extracts inhibited the nitric oxide (NO) production in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these results, an antiacne herbal cream (AHC) was prepared from different portions of extracts from SO, IH, and SN, and its efficacy was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled efficacy study with 41 acne patients, ages 18–24, who were asked to apply AHC (
  <italic>n</italic> = 27) or a placebo (
  <italic>n</italic> = 14) two to three times daily for six weeks. Results obtained indicate that the AHC has unique synergistic effects that halt sebum production, combined with highly antiseptic and anti-inflammatory activity, in which 54.95% (
  <italic>t</italic> = 19.37 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of acne inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions disappeared after two weeks, 85.3%, after five weeks (
  <italic>t</italic> = 14.19 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 91.4%, at the end of the sixth week of application (
  <italic>t</italic> = 5.7 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, SO, IH, and SN as single extracts and in combination as AHC showed significant antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activities 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled antiacne efficacy. Therefore, AHC represents an interesting alternative treatment for acne.
