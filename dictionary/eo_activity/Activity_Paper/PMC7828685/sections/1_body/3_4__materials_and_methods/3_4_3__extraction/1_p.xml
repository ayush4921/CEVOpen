<p>The leathery exocarp peels of 3 fruits of pomegranate were sterilized using 3.0% sodium hypochlorite and then washed with sterile distilled water. The sterilized peels were left to air-dry under a laminar flow at room temperature overnight. Then, 50 g of the dried materials were suspended in 25-mL sterile distilled water and homogenized in plastic-porous bags by using a metal push rod. The suspension was agitated by using a shaker (Digital control 711D, Padova, Italy) for 24 h at room temperature, then was filtered by using a Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> filter paper (Φ 8 cm, 75 GR/M
 <sup>2</sup>) purchased from Sigma Aldrich company (Darmstadt, Germany) and centrifuged at 8944× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 5 °C (IEC-Micromax RF, Thermo, Sparta, USA). Finally, the extract was stored at −20 °C for future use. The supernatant was membrane-filtered (0.45 μm; Minisart, Darmstadt, Germany) and concentrated under reduced pressure at 45 °C. The dried sample was resuspended in distilled water and adjusted at 10 mg/mL.
