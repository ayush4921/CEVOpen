<p>Moreover, our experiments showed that the antioxidant effect was very fast, and it was seemed that there was not an influence of the reaction time on the radical scavenging activity. In fact, L-ascorbic acid also reacted very rapidly with DPPH [

 <sub>50</sub> value was 19.77 Âµg/mL. The available literature reported that different pomegranate peel extracts exhibited various degrees of antioxidant activity [

Thus, the waste products of pomegranate (peel and seed) with high antioxidant activity could be useful as natural preservatives in the food industry [
