<p>The LEP extract was tested for AChE activity using Ellman’s colorimetric method. The results showed a good inhibitory activity with the concentration required for achieving 50% inhibition of the enzyme (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of 133.0 µg/mL. Moreover, at a concentration of 250 µg/mL, the inhibition percentage (99.0% ± 4.1%) was comparable to the used control (galanthamine) (
