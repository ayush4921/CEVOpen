<p>The results of the in vitro antifungal activity assay demonstrated that the LEP extract was less active against 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> compared to the two fungicides used as a positive control (C+ve) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00153-f002">Figure 2</xref>), whereas the LEP extract showed the highest significant fungicidal activity against 
 <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> equal to cycloheximide (0.1 ÂµL/mL). It was also observed that the LEP extract showed the highest significant fungicidal activity against 
 <italic>P. digitatum</italic> compared to both C+ve references (
