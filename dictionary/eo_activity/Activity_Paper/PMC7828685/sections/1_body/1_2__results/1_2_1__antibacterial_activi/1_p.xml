<p>The LEP extract significantly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>X. campestris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. michiganensis</italic> at the two tested concentrations (5 and 10 mg/mL) equal to tetracycline (160 µg/mL) and kanamycin (50 µg/mL), as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00153-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Regarding 
 <italic>B. megaterium</italic>, the higher concentration of the LEP extract (10 mg/mL) showed a promising bactericidal effect slightly lower than kanamycin, whereas the lower tested concentration (5 mg/mL) showed a moderate activity equal to tetracycline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00153-f001">Figure 1</xref>). On the hand, only the higher concentration of the extract (10 mg/mL) showed a significant bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> equal to kanamycin, whereas the lower concentration of the LEP extract (5 mg/mL) showed also a higher bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> than tetracycline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00153-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In general, the LEP extract showed promising antibacterial activity compared to the two tested references, mainly taking the harmful side effects of the use of synthetic antibiotics into account.
