<p>Furthermore, in another study done by Wahab et al., baicalein-rich fraction extracted from 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> leaves was found to attenuate the growth and survival of cervical cancer cells greater than crude extract with less baicalein content by down-regulating the expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins that play a key role in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma tumorigenesis [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. HPV E6 oncoprotein targets p53 tumor suppressor protein and inhibits its roles to initiate DNA repair and apoptosis signalling pathway. On the other hand, HPV E7 protein targets another tumor suppressor protein known as retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and inhibits its roles in regulating cell cycle and stabilizing cell proliferation/cell death balance [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taken together, the downregulation of E6 and E7 proteins and restoration of p53 and pRb proteins by baicalein could be a promising therapeutic approach to block excessive cell growth, a hallmark of cancerous cells. These findings were supported by Zazali et al. which also reported an anti-proliferative activity of methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> against cervical cancer (HeLa cell line) by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via p53-mediated pathway [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They found that 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> methanol extract which consisted of baicalein caused high accumulation of p53 protein in HeLa cells (up to 88.5%) after 72 h treatment at concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> (3.87 Î¼g/mL). It is well known that p53 functions as a transcription factor for genes involve in the regulation of normal cell cycle [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. After 72 h of treatment, the DNA amount of HeLa cells in G0/G1 phase raised up to 99.31% while the DNA amount in both S phase and G2/M phase dramatically reduced to 0.7% and 0.08% only. This indicated that the growth of HeLa cells was impeded at the G1/S checkpoint, causing the interruption of cancer cells to enter the S phase to synthesis the DNA and thus, no excessive cancer cell growth occurred. Furthermore, p53 may also promote apoptosis of cancerous cells. This was proved by the increment of early and late apoptotic cells after 48 and 72 h of treatment with 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract in the study [
