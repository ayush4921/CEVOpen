<p>Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] has reported that 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> root bark extract treated groups showed a better healing pattern with complete wound closure in mice models within 32 days while it was about 40 days in non-treated mice. Moreover, 2.5% methanolic extract treated animals showed faster epithelialization of wound (29 ± 0.3535) than the animals treated with 1% methanolic extract (33 ± 0.2165). This indicated that higher concentration of extract was more effective in wound healing process. The 2.5% methanolic extract also showed signs of advanced healing such as complete restroration of epidermis, well organized and high amount of collagen bundles in dermis and absence of inflammatory cells in fully grown dermis. The hydroxyproline content also was found to increase significantly (29 ± 0.5780) in 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> treated group as compared to the non-treated group (37 ± 0.6123). High hydroxyproline content indicated increased collagen synthesis to facilitate wound healing. The extract also exhibited antibacterial effects against 
 <italic>B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, Streptococcus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> that are commonly found in wound infection.
