<p>Furthermore, besides mimicking the function of acarbose, baicalein also could treat hyperglycemia via the inhibition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) glycation [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. BSA glycation is a complex cascade of reactions in which the protein structure is altered by reducing sugar such as glucose. Glycation rate is commonly increased in diabetes patients due to excess glucose molecules presence in serum. Glycation may result in non-functional proteins and further trigger various signalling pathways leading to insulin resistance and diabetic complications. Moreover, further glycation may result in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which could elevate the risk for beta cell injury and insulin resistance [
