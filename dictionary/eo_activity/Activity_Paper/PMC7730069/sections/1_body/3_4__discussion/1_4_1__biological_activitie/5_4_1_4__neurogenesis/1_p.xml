<p>Neurogenesis is the process by which neurons or nerve cells are generated in the brain via differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Differentiation of NSCs into neurons is induced by basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) activators such as neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) [

 <italic>O. indicum</italic> bark methanol crude extract successfully activated the Ngn2 promoter activity by two-fold, indicating its potential to induce neurogenesis [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Subsequently, the researcher isolated seven major active constituents from the crude extract of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> using an activity-guided approach. The constituents extracted included oroxyin A, chrysin, hispidulin, baicalein, apigenin, baicalin and isoverbascoside. Among these compounds, baicalein showed a two-fold increase in Ngn2 promoter activity at 10 uM which correlated with the biological activities of the crude extract. In brief, their findings clearly highlighted that the neurogenesis potential of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> extract was highly correlated to the baicalein.
