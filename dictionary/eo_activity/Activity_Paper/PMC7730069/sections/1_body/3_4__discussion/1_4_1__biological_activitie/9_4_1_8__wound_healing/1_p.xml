Wound healing is a complex process of homeostasis, re-epithelialisation, granulation, tissue formation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix that takes place by itself under normal condition. However, there are various risk factors such as infection, aging and bad health conditions can affect or delay the healing process. Wound healing is affected by the cytokines secreted by fibroblasts such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) that are required for cell proliferation and formation of new blood vessels in the regenerating wounds [

These cytokines play a major role in wound healing, in which their deficiency has been reported to retard several important aspects of wound healing including inflammation, fibroplasia, synthesis of proteoglycans and collagen, angiogenesis and wound remodeling [
