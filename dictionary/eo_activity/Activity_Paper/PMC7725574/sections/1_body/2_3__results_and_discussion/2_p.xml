<p>There are many advantages of using natural products in drug discovery and development. They represent chemical novelties, and compared with other sources, they can originate lead drug candidates for complex targets. Furthermore, naturally derived constituents possess a chemical diversity unmatched by any synthetic chemical collection, and they can possess bi- and tri-dimensional complex structures, yet be capable of being absorbed and metabolized in the body.</p>
