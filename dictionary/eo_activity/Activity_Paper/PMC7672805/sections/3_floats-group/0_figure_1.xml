  <title>Release of proinflammatory cytokines</title>
  <p>Treatment of J774.1 murine macrophages with PEL (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 µg/ml) (
   <bold>A</bold>), LAT (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 µg/ml) (
   <bold>B</bold>) and PEL 10 µg/ml+LAT 1 µg/ml (
   <bold>C</bold>) in the presence or not of LPS. Black dots represent the release of IL-1β (A
   <bold>–</bold>C) after the single compound treatment, whereas the red dots represent the release of the cytokines in the presence of LPS (0.1 μg/ml). Cells were treated for 24 h. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic>=5). Statistically significant differences were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test.
