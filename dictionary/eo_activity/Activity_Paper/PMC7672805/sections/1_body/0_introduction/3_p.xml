<p>LAT is a nonhemic iron-binding glycoprotein of the transferrin family [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is present in many biological fluids and tissues, particularly in neutrophil granules [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is involved in iron transportation, immune responses, organ morphogenesis and promotes wound healing and bone growth [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has also been described as beneficial to prevent cancer [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and to exert beneficial cardiovascular properties such as lipid reduction, antihypertensive and antithrombotic effects [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, its iron chelating ability underlies its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
