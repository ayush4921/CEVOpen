<p>To assess cell viability, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to medium-free cells post 24 h treatment. DMSO was used to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The formazan concentration was determined by measuring the optical density. The data are presented as absorbance (550 nm) versus treatment.</p>
