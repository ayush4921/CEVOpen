<p>IL-1β is widely described as a proinflammatory cytokine, released after LPS stimulation [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that the combination of PEL+LAT significantly reduced the levels of IL-1β after LPS stimulation. This effect could prompt PELIRGOSTIM as an innovative and hitherto unknown combination, able to attenuate inflammation-related pathways. IL-1β is a critical regulator of the inflammatory response that, according to the activation of the inflammasome complex, its release can promote leukocyte migration with ensuing tissue damage, can promote T-cell survival, can contribute to the polarization of Th1, Th2 and Th17 differentiation. In addition, IL-1β induces IL-6 and/or TNF-α release, participating to the recruitment of other immune cells which phenotype can be endeavored according to the microenvironment [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, our data have the limitation to prove the sole activity of the combination PEL+LAT to reduce IL-1β release, but future studies will be performed by using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models to prove its anti-inflammatory activity. Nevertheless, we believe that the capability of PEL+LAT to reduce the release of IL-1β from LPS-treated macrophages, associated with the reduced oxidant activity, can be of beneficial in inflammatory-based disorders.
