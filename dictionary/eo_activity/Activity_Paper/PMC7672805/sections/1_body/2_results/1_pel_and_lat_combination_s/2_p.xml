<p>The combination of LAT (1 µg/ml) with PEL (10 µg/ml) on LPS-treated macrophages still reduced the levels of IL-1β (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, red dots). Because both PEL (63.65 ± 10.7 pg/ml) and LAT (67.19 ± 13.2 pg/ml) alone were able to reduce the levels of IL-1β in the presence of LPS (115.9 ± 15.4 pg/ml), we compared these levels when both PEL and LAT were added in combination onto LPS-stimulated macrophages. The levels of IL-1β were still significantly reduced when PEL+LAT (52.74 ± 8.5 pg/ml) were added onto LPS-treated macrophages compared to LPS alone (
