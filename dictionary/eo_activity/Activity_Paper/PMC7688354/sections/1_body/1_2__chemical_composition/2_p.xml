<p>The final concentrations of sugar in each fermentation process can vary, which indicates that various factors can regulate the effects, so the metabolism pathway is not usually equal [

Researchers have gotten many new records for the duration of the fermentation process; for example, Jayabalan et al. have gained the growing quantity of acetic acid for the period of the maximum fermentation attention of approximately 9.5â€‰g/L after two weeks [
