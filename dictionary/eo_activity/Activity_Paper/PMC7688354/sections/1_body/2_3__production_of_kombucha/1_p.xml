<p>As stated in previous sections, Kombucha is composed of bacteria and yeast, which produces bacterial cellulose pellicles on the broth. A cellulose pellicle of Kombucha possesses a delicate structure with acceptable purity. It has been used in several forms like a gelling agent, stabilizer, emulsifier, and dispersing factor. Kombucha is receiving considerable attention and being extensively investigated as a novel type of framework due to its high biocompatibility and pliability [

The role of Kombucha in tissue engineering as artificial skin for wounds or scaffold of blood vessels and cartilages has been highlighted during the last years. As Kombucha is nonallergic and nontoxic, it can be utilized in the food industry as dietary fiber and additive [

Kombucha can be prepared through previously fermented broth or fermenting tea with a pellicle, and the favorable temperature of the substrate is 20 to 28Â°C (Under aerobic conditions). Based on the previous literature, it can be stated that the fermentation time can differ up to about two months. Due to differentiation in the duration of fermentation, various tastes and flavors are provided. For example, Kombucha, with long fermentation (60 days), has a slight vinegar taste [

The presence of yeasts in Kombucha verifies the hydrolysis of sucrose to other monosaccharides, and in the next step, yeasts can metabolize them to ethanol. Then ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria. As acetic acid bacteria do not have extracellular hydrolysis enzymes, they are not able to uptake sucrose alone [

They reported that several substrates like wine, herbal tea, green tea, or fruit drink could be used in the fermentation of Kombucha. In some cases, these proposed that substrates are more efficient than conventional tea. The usage of other substrates like thyme, peppermint, and Jerusalem artichoke tuber in Kombucha fermentation was investigated. In terms of Jerusalem artichoke tuber, it has been accepted that the obtained Kombucha is an excellent dietetic product due to the presence of inulooligosaccharides in its structure [
