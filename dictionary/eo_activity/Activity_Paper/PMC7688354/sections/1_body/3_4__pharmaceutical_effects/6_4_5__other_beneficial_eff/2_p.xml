<p>Probiotic microbes are known for their vital role in human health. These microorganisms create a balance in normalizing processes in the gut, intestinal microbiota, and boosting the immune system [

The bacterial cellulose which is obtained in the course of the Kombucha fermentation shows many useful applications in the fields like biopharmaceuticals and food. The tendency of bacterial cellulose to be used in these fields is owing to the high purity and the unique physicochemical activities which are present in the fermented beverage.
