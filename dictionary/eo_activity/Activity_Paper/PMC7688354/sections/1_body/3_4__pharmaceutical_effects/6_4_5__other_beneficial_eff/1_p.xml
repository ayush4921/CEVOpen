<p>There are plenty of declarations about the uses and benefits of Kombucha beverage for health. The pathway of eliminating toxic substances from the organism's body is called the detoxification process. This complex action can be in two forms of medicinal or physiological. As we know, the liver plays a vital role in the body and one of the main tasks of the liver is detoxification. Detoxification function can be effective in cancer prevention action and also facilitates the preservation of the liver. The bacterial acids, enzymes, and the other secondary metabolites generated by microbes during fermentation which were carried out in the preparation of Kombucha enabled body detoxification [

Meanwhile, most of the bacterial acids and enzymes presented in Kombucha resemble the chemical compounds produced through the body for the purpose of the detoxification action. Therefore, incorporating the Kombucha tea into one's diet may lead to the reduction of liver detoxification. Several scientific reports have revealed that this ability mainly belongs to the capacity of binding glucuronic acid to toxic substances which arrived in the human body and also the capability to enhance excretion of these toxic molecules from the body using the cooperation of intestines and kidney [

Mostly, the bacterial components of a probiotic material come from Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus or a combination of these two strains. In this case, there can be a few usual yeast types such as
