 <italic>L. candidum</italic> L., commonly known as Madonna, meadow, or white lily, is a geophyte from the Liliaceae family growing in the wild in several countries of the Middle East. The origin of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> is believed to be in Lebanon and Israel, as well as several parts of Greece [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], thus Israel represents the Southern border of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> distribution and only few populations are found in the Carmel and the Galilee regions. It is considered an endangered species and as such the plants are protected [

 <italic>L. candidum</italic> ecotypes from different locations exhibited genetic variation in morphologic and phenologic traits, as well as in phytotoxicity of their leaf extracts [
