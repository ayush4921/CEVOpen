<p id="Par64">Turku et al. used in silico analytic software to propose compounds for synthesis of orexin (hypocretin) OX1 and OX2 receptor ligands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. As the receptor is involved in the sleep–wake regulation, the antagonists are considered to treat insomnia. Moreover, the agonists are suspected of becoming useful in treating daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy, and certain cancer types. Besides, some ligands can act as potentiators with expected application in orexin receptor activation therapies when the production of endogenous peptides is not fully terminated. In the research, seven potentiators and two weak dual orexin receptor agonists were found. The activity assessment consisted of monitoring Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> response in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells heterologously expressing high densities of human OX
 <sub>1</sub> and OX
 <sub>2</sub> receptors. Calcium ions elevation is considered to be a prominent response to orexin receptor activation. The study confirmed that compounds 
 <bold>57–60</bold> acted as weak orexin receptor agonists, whereas compounds 
 <bold>61–63</bold> potentiated the response to orexin-A on OX
 <sub>1</sub> receptors by 1,4-, 1,6- and 1,3-fold, respectively, at 10 µM. The most critical finding of SAR analysis was the observation that agonism and potentiation are related to the presence of bicyclic aromatic ring moiety substituted with two hydrogen bond acceptors (1-position, benzoyl; 6-position, carboxyl/ester) within 7–8 Å of each other. Moreover, it was found that subtle changes in the structure cause changes in the activity, possibly because the overlapping of binding sites occurs. It seems an interesting research direction, but to even think about the future medical application of mentioned compounds, more experiments are necessary, especially toxicology assessment and pharmacokinetics in vivo.
