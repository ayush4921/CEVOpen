<p id="Par43">Despite photodynamic studies presented above, azulene and its derivatives demonstrated their own potential against viruses and microbes. In the study performed by Peet et al., 18 azulene derivatives were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-HIV-1 assessment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The authors researched the cytotoxicity of the compounds on the U2OS cell line. The least toxic compounds were examined in the first screening phase of the antiviral activity test using HIV-1-based virus-like particles for safe, sensitive, and fast evaluation of the antiretroviral activity. The highest potential was found for 2-hydroxyazulenes 
 <bold>5–7</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which were selected for the second phase of antiviral test to develop the inhibition of infectious HIV-1 virus replication TZM-bl cells. Finally, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was not active against the HIV-1 virus, but azulene derivatives 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> were recognized as active with the best score for 
 <bold>7</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> at 8.5 µM and selectivity index 7. The antiretroviral activities of azulene derivatives 
 <bold>5–7</bold> were explained by the inhibition of reverse transcriptase. However, the authors did not exclude other antiviral mechanisms. Following the obtained results, the azulene derivatives can be considered as potential candidates for the development of antiretroviral agents.
