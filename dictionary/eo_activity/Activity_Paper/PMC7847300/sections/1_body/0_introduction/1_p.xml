Examples of great importance in the animal world are carotenoids and vitamin A, which play a crucial role in numerous highly advanced biochemical processes in the human body. Vitamin A is known for improving many functions, including vision, gene transcription, immunity, hematopoiesis, embryonic development, and reproduction [
