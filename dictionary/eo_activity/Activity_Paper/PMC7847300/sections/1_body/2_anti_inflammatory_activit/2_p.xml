<p id="Par46">Plants traditionally used in medicine, e.g., camomile (
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>) and yarrow (
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>), exhibit an anti-inflammatory effect due to the presence of azulene derivatives. Camomile extract was proved to interfere selectively with the COX-2 pathway similarly to the drug sulindac [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, chamazulene can be recommended as a therapeutic agent for clinical trials against osteoarthritic inflammation. Also, the combinations of azulene derivatives with various molecules reveal attractive anti-inflammatory potential. For example, Nihei et al. studied the efficacy of a combination of sodium azulene sulfonate and L-glutamine to treat oral mucositis caused by anticancer drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Patients using sodium azulene sulfonate L-glutamine suspension as a mouthwash three times a day, reported fewer or less severe cases of mucositis in comparison to a control group. Considering its high level of safety and lack of alternatives available to fight oral mucositis induced by anticancer treatment, this procedure seems to offer the chance for the patients to have a better quality of life while fighting cancer.
