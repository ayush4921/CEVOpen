<p id="Par53">Zhang et al. synthesized another series of azulene derivatives, which present 5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethylazulene conjugated to arylamines

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The antigastric ulcer activity was studied in vivo on 200 Kunning mice with ethanol-induced gastric ulcers. The structure–activity relationship (SAR) of new compounds was investigated in mice which were treated with an oral dose of suspension containing in its composition carboxymethyl cellulose sodium as an additive and tested compounds—test group, omeprazole—drug reference group, precursor guaiazulene sulfate sodium (GAS-Na), and 5% of carboxymethyl cellulose sodium alone—control group. The oral route’s applied dose of suspension was administered in an amount of 0.4 mL/20 g once a day for five consecutive days. Thirty minutes after applying the last dose, mice were given 0.5 mL of anhydrous ethanol orally, and then after a further 30 min, the animals were euthanized. Subsequent gastrectomy allowed for the assessment of ulcerative lesions. The research demonstrated that compounds 
 <bold>32–38</bold> can be considered as promising antigastric ulcer agents. Moreover, a comparison of arylamino-substituted compounds with alkylamino substituted compounds showed advantages of the first group over the second for antiulcer effectiveness. The results of the study gave reason for optimism as some molecules presented the best antiulcer activity with ulcer index values lower than that observed for the reference drug omeprazole.
