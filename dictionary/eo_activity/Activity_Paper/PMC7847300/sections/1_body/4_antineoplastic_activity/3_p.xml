<p id="Par58">Uehara et al. obtained a series of 10 alkylaminoguaiazulene derivatives towards both cancer and normal cells [

Moreover, apoptosis-inducing activity was evaluated by cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and caspase-3 with western blot analysis. It was found that with the increasing length of the alkyl group of alkylaminoguaiazulene derivatives, cytotoxicity increased, whereas the introduction of oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atom into the alkyl group slightly reduced cytotoxicity. Among compounds studied, guaiazulene substituted with morpholine
