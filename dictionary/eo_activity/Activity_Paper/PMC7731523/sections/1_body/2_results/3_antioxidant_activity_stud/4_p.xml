<p>Pyrogallic acid is spontaneously oxidized under weak alkali conditions to form superoxide free radicals and intermediates, and its color varies with superoxide radical content. As shown in

 </xref>, the superoxide anion scavenging ability of the nanoemulsion and suspension was increased in a concentration-dependent manner; at the concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, its maximum scavenging activity was 56.80%, which was obviously better than that of the nanoemulsion (29.15%). Compared with the DPPH and hydroxyl radicals scavenging abilities, superoxide anion scavenging abilities of nanoemulsion and suspension were significantly lower, indicating a moderate superoxide anion scavenging activity.
