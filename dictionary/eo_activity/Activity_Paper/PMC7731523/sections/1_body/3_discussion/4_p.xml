<p>Drug release is the basis for all biological functions, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Drug release model fitting was performed to understand the release pattern [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As shown in 
 <bold>Table</bold> 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
  <bold>2</bold>
 </xref>, the best fitting parameters (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=0.9947, RSS=18.6194, AIC=33.2369) were derived from the Weibull model, and the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release from the nanoemulsion followed this distribution, suggesting that the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release process is continuous and dynamic, simulating the human digestive tract environment. It also indicated that the drug release has a sustained release trend. Ritger–Peppas (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=0.9723, RSS=113.4027, AIC=51.3095) might be similar to the drug released pattern, and its release mechanism might follow the Fickian diffusion (
 <italic>n</italic>&lt;0.45) during the drug release process of the nanoemulsion. In our results, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release of the buckwheat flavonoids from the nanoemulsion was more advantageous than the suspension, which provided a potential possibility for the application of nanoemulsion flavonoids.
