<p>In summary, this study was based on a previous experiment for developing buckwheat flavonoids into a nano-drug delivery system [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We constructed a drug delivery system and investigated its characteristics 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and the drug delivery to animals 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, which provided a theoretical basis for the application of buckwheat flavonoids in clinical practice. Our results demonstrated that nanoemulsion is an effective drug delivery system that can significantly improve the antioxidant activity, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release, and bioavailability compared with the corresponding drug suspension. Nanoemulsion can improve the oral absorption of drugs, promote the dissolution of the poorly soluble drugs, and enhance the bioavailability of drugs.
