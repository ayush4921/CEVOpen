<p>To enhance the antioxidant activity and oral bioavailability of buckwheat flavonoids, a SNEDDS of buckwheat flavonoids was prepared in this study. The preparation and optimization were based on the central composite design response surface experiment, and particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were determined. The study specifically focused on evaluating the antioxidant activity and comparing the oral bioavailability of the nanoemulsion with that of suspension
