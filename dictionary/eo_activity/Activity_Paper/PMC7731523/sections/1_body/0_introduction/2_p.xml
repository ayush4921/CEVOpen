<p>Recently, the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS), a spontaneous emulsification method, has attracted increased attention [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â€“7</xref>], which can improve the oral bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs and bioactive food components [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The system is composed of various components, including oil phase, surfactant, cosurfactant, and water phase. The system has a variety of molding mechanisms, and the ultra-low or negative surface tension is considered as the main reason behind the formation of the nanoemulsion, and appropriate phase composition is important for the stability of nanoemulsion [

 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The diffusion of the cosurfactant from the organic phase into the aqueous phase may also be an important mechanism for the formation of the nanoemulsion [

 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The small particle sizes in a drug delivery system offer many promising advantages, including smaller surface tension and greater stability. The smaller particle size offers a greater interfacial surface area for drug absorption, and the solubility and bioavailability are enhanced. For example, a SNEDDS of resveratrol with the droplet size of 50 nm exhibited better antioxidant capacity and less toxicity than free resveratrol [

 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system can improve the bioactivity of encapsulated components, which can also potentially improve the medicinal and edible values of buckwheat flavonoid.
