 <italic>In vitro</italic> release experiment was carried out by dynamic dialysis of nanoemulsion [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The nanoemulsion and suspension of buckwheat flavonoids were poured into activated dialysis bags (molecular weight cutoff, 8 kDa) and immersed in 50 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 37°C±0.5°C under continuous stirring at 100 rpm. Then, 2 ml of each sample was withdrawn at different time points (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h), and an equal volume of PBS was replenished. The samples were examined by ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV 1200; Shanghai Meipuda Instrument Co., Shanghai, China) at 507 nm using NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>-Al(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> colorimetric method, and the standard curve was A=0.0149C+0.1008 (
 <italic>r</italic>=0.9997). The cumulative release (
 <italic>Q</italic>) was calculated by the following formulas:
