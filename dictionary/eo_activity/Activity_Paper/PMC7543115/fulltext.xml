This study was planned to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of urinile (a herbal drug) for the treatment of gouty arthritis. Allopurinol was used as standard drug (positive control). The study population of 250 volunteers (gouty arthritis patients) were divided into 2 groups as test and control group (n = 125 each). Gouty arthritis patients in test and control group were treated with 300 mg each of urinile and allopurinol, respectively. Clinical symptoms of all the study volunteers were recorded and serum uric acid was determined. Significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) reduction in serum uric acid level toward normal was found in test group individuals. Clinical symptoms of gouty arthritis patients were also improved in test group compared to control group. Results showed that urinile has the potential to decrease serum uric acid level in gouty arthritis patients probably because of its antioxidant potential and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. It can be concluded that the tested herbal drug urinile is more potent in treating gouty arthritis patients and can be used as an effective alternative to the most commonly used allopathic drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>urinile</kwd><kwd>allopurinol</kwd><kwd>gouty arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>October-December 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1559325820946934"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gout is arthritis caused due to the deposition of a type of uric acid crystals called Monosodium Urate (MSU) crystals, usually deposited around or within the joints secondary to chronic hyperuricemia.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1559325820946934" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1559325820946934" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It affects 1 to 2% of adult population in developed countries and possibly increased the prevalence.

The study results showed reduction in serum uric acid concentration from &#x0003e;8 mg/dl to &#x0003c;6 mg/dl in patients treated with urinile. This 18 weeks&#x02019; investigation exhibited that treatment with Urinile essentially decreased the serum uric acid concentration to &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dl in 91% patients. Conversely, the extent of patients reacting to allopurinol was 78%. The findings presented here demonstrate that Urinile has more potential to inhibit xanthine oxidase enzyme than Allopurinol for the management of gouty arthritis. Urate-lowering response to Urinile (300 mg) twice a day was stronger than the reaction to regularly utilized dosages of allopurinol. Keeping up a mean serum uric acid concentration of between 4.5 and 5.0 mg/dl is the ideal range to stay away from a flare of intense joint pain. In our study, when serum uric acid concentration was decreased to &#x0003c;6 mg/ml, the side effects of gouty joint pain were significantly decreased. Our observations are in accordance with the published reports on the use of herbal products to treat gouty arthritis<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1559325820946934" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> that hyperuricemia has a solid relationship with relative danger of death in coronary illness, hypertension, stroke, liver infection as well as kidney failure, showing that elevated serum uric acid is a significant hazard factor for decreased life expectancy.</p><p>A decrease in serum uric acid after Urinile (300 mg) treatment twice a day indicated that it could be used as a uric acid lowering agent. These values supported the need for further research to assess the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. Study findings demonstrated that Urinile has xanthine oxidase inhibitory action. Allopurinol and Urinile (polyherbal drug) was examined for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity at 25, 50, 100, and 200 &#x000b5;g per mL. Allopurinol and Urinile extracts demonstrated a dose dependent XO inhibitory effect with XO inhibitory action of 86% and 88%, respectively. A large number of the patients experienced improvement in manifestations of gouty arthritis within investigation period. In our investigation, Urinile effectively decreased the serum uric acid level without any toxic effects as compared to Allopurinol. Urinile also decreased the gout symptoms like joint pain, tenderness, redness and stiffness of joint. The outcomes of the present investigation exhibited that treatment with Urinile twice per day for 18 weeks adequately diminishes serum uric acid concentration in patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</p><p>Urinile is a polyherbal drug prepared from 4 different medicinal plants extract and all the individual plants extract exhibited significant antioxidant potentials and XO inhibitory activities. On preparing the polyherbal formulations of these plants extract, the synergistic effect of all the included plants extract have much better potential against gouty arthritis than the individual plants extract.

This increased radical scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibition potential is possibly due to the presence of antioxidant compounds like flavonoids and phenolics in medicinal plants. Reduction in serum uric acid and improvement in the clinical conditions in joints of gouty arthritis patients through urinile treatment is an indication of its therapeutic potential against gouty arthritis. It can be concluded that polyherbal formulation (urinile) of studied medicinal plants has the potential against gouty arthritis and can be used for therapeutic purposes which can lead to an increased interest of herbal pharmaceuticals producing clinically safe and efficient herbal drugs. Further studies are required to isolate and characterize the therapeutically bioactive compounds and then large scale clinical trials which will be a step forward toward drug discovery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1559325820946934"><p><bold>Authors' Note:</bold> Saeed Ahmad is no more affiliated with College of Agriculture, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn2-1559325820946934"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-1559325820946934"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1559325820946934"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Saeed Ahmad <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1559325820946934-img1.jpg"/>
