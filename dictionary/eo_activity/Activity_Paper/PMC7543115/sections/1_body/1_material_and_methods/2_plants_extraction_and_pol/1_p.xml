<p>The dried plants materials were crushed to obtain fine powder. The powdered material (500 g of each plant) were soaked in 70% ethanol (1:10) for 72 hours with occasional shaking and stirring. After 72 hours, the extract of each plant was filtered using Whatmann No. 1 filter paper and this extraction process was repeated 3 times to extract maximum bioactive compounds present in plants material. The filtered extract was collected in separate beakers for each plant and evaporated through rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 45 to 50ºC to obtain concentrated extract. Polyherbal formulation i-e urinile tablet was prepared by mixing equal amount of each plant methanolic extract in liquid glucose solution making the tablets of 300 mg weight. The tablets were allowed to dry at 50ºC for 12 hours. Hardness, disintegration and dissolution of the tablets were assessed by hardness test device, disintegration test machine and dissolution test machine, respectively.</p>
