<p>A decrease in serum uric acid after Urinile (300 mg) treatment twice a day indicated that it could be used as a uric acid lowering agent. These values supported the need for further research to assess the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. Study findings demonstrated that Urinile has xanthine oxidase inhibitory action. Allopurinol and Urinile (polyherbal drug) was examined for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity at 25, 50, 100, and 200 Âµg per mL. Allopurinol and Urinile extracts demonstrated a dose dependent XO inhibitory effect with XO inhibitory action of 86% and 88%, respectively. A large number of the patients experienced improvement in manifestations of gouty arthritis within investigation period. In our investigation, Urinile effectively decreased the serum uric acid level without any toxic effects as compared to Allopurinol. Urinile also decreased the gout symptoms like joint pain, tenderness, redness and stiffness of joint. The outcomes of the present investigation exhibited that treatment with Urinile twice per day for 18 weeks adequately diminishes serum uric acid concentration in patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</p>
