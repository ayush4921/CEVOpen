 </sup> The mixture comprising the test solution (50 µL), enzyme solution (0.01 units/mL in 0.1 mM phosphate buffer pH = 7.5; 30 µL) and 0.1 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5; 35 µL). After pre-incubation at 25°C for 15 minutes, the response was started by the expansion of 60 µL of substrate solution (150 mM xanthine). The mixture was then incubated for 30 minutes at 25°C. Optical density at 290 nm was measured using spectrophotometer. One unit of XO was characterized as the measure of enzyme needed to hydrolyze 1 mmol of uric acid/minute at 25°C. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined from the mean values of replicate measurements.
