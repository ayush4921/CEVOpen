<p>From present study, it is evident that polyherbal formulation urinile prepared by combining the hydroalcoholic extracts of 4 different medicinal plants showed increased antioxidant potential and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity as compared to the potentials of individual medicinal plants extract indicating the synergistic effect of urinile. This increased radical scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibition potential is possibly due to the presence of antioxidant compounds like flavonoids and phenolics in medicinal plants. Reduction in serum uric acid and improvement in the clinical conditions in joints of gouty arthritis patients through urinile treatment is an indication of its therapeutic potential against gouty arthritis. It can be concluded that polyherbal formulation (urinile) of studied medicinal plants has the potential against gouty arthritis and can be used for therapeutic purposes which can lead to an increased interest of herbal pharmaceuticals producing clinically safe and efficient herbal drugs. Further studies are required to isolate and characterize the therapeutically bioactive compounds and then large scale clinical trials which will be a step forward toward drug discovery.</p>
