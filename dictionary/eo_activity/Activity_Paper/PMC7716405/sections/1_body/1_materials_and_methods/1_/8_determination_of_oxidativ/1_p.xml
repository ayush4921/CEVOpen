<p>After 2 h of reperfusion, rat hearts were excised to prepare heart homogenates. Prepared myocardial tissues were excised and homogenized (10%) in ice-cold physiological saline solution using a Tissue-Tearor (Bio Spec Products, Inc.). The supernatant was separated from heart homogenates by centrifugation (3,500 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and used for the evaluation of superoxide dismutase (SOD; cat. no. A001-1-2; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), malondialdehyde (MDA; cat. no. A003-1-1; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px; cat. no. A005-1-2; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) and catalase (CAT; cat. no. A007-2-1; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) levels using respective diagnostic kits in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
