<p>IO was collected from Jilin Province, Northeastern China and identified by Professor GuangShu Wang (Jilin University). A total of 2,500 g IO powder was weighed, soaked in 12.5 l distilled water overnight at room temperature and extracted at 80°C for 2.5 h. The supernatant was collected after filtration using three layers of gauze, and the extraction was repeated twice in the same manner. The filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation, dried at 60°C, crushed and passed through an 80-mesh sieve to obtain the preliminary extract. Next, 12.5 l 70% ethanol was added to the preliminary extract obtained from water extraction (extracted at 75°C for 2.5 h). The supernatant was gathered by filtering through three layers of gauze, and the extraction was repeated twice in the same manner. The filtrates were collected and concentrated by rotary evaporation, then dried at 60°C, crushed and passed through an 80-mesh sieve, and 127.9 g IOE was obtained. The extraction rate of IOE was 5.12% according to the following formula: Extraction rate = weight of IOE/weight of IO powder. Meanwhile, the main composition of IOE was assessed using a T-6 Series UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd.). The contents of total flavonoid, total saponin, polysaccharide and polyphenol were calculated using respective standard curves (y=0.0117×+0.0554, R
 <sup>2</sup>=0.9998; y=0.0301×+0.0871, R
 <sup>2</sup>=0.9992; y=16.253×+0.1019, R
 <sup>2</sup>=0.9999 and y=97.266×+0.1984, R
 <sup>2</sup>=0.9996) with the percentage of 1.76, 1.06, 0.57 and 1.07%.
