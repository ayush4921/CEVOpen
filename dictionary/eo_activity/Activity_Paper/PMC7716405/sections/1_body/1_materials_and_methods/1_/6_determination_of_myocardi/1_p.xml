<p>After 2 h of reperfusion, the heart tissues were excised to perform MIS measurements. Five pieces of the left ventricle parallel to the atrioventricular groove were transected, immersed in 0.5% nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) phosphate buffer and stained for 1 min in a 37°C water bath. Normal myocardial tissues were stained dark red, while ischemic myocardial tissues were pale. The ischemic myocardial tissue was excised and weighed. The MIS was calculated as follows: Ischemic myocardial weight/wet weight of the left ventricle ×100%.</p>
