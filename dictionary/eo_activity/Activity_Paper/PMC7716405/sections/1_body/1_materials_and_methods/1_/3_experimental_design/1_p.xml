<p>A total of 150 female rats were randomly assigned into five groups (n=30): i) Non-MI/R sham group (Sham); ii) MI/R group (MI/R); iii) MI/R+IOE 150 mg/kg group (MI/R-IOE150); iv) MI/R+IOE 300 mg/kg group (MI/R-IOE300) and v) MI/R+IOE 600 mg/kg group (MI/R-IOE600). The animals in the treatment groups were intragastrically administered with IOE (150, 300 or 600 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days. The rats of the Sham and MI/R groups were intragastrically administered with 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium for 7 consecutive days. Surgical procedures were performed on rats in the Sham group, but without left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation. In other groups, LAD ligation was performed on the hearts for 2 h and then reperfused for 2 h.</p>
