<p>At day 7, 3% sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection) was used to anesthetize the rats after 1 h of administration. Rat hearts were exteriorized via open-chest surgery. A 6/0 nylon suture was put to make a slip knot around the LAD coronary artery and induce myocardial ischemia. After 2 h of ligation, the ligature was loosened to restore myocardial blood supply for myocardial reperfusion. Rats in the Sham group were subjected to the same procedure, but without ligation. Reperfusion was performed for 2 h. The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 3% sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight). Then, ~8 ml volume of blood was taken from the abdominal aorta of the unconscious rats for painless euthanasia. Death was confirmed when respiratory and cardiac arrest was observed, following which, cardiac tissues were harvested for further experiments.</p>
