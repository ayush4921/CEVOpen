<p>To evaluate the condition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the expression of pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 in ischemic hearts were measured. MI/R injury significantly decreased the expression of pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 compared with the Sham group (P&lt;0.01;

By contrast, IOE increased the expression of pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 in ischemic heart tissue compared with the MI/R group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). The data indicated that IOE protected the heart from MI/R injury via suppressing ER stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
