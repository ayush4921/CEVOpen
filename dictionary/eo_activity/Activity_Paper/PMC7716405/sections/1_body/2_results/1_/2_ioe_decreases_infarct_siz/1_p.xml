<p>NBT staining was used to observe the effects of IOE on the infarction scale. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, the infarct size reached up to 36.42Â±6.67% in the MI/R group. IOE (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg) significantly decreased the infarct size compared with the MI/R group (P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the activities of myocardial enzymes (LDH, CK-MB and AST) were significantly increased following MI/R injury compared with the Sham group, which further caused myocardial injury (P&lt;0.01; 
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). IOE attenuated MI/R injury through inhibiting the activities of myocardial enzymes in MI/R-IOE groups (P&lt;0.01).
