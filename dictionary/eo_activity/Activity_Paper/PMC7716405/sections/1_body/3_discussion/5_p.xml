<p>In conclusion, the present findings showed that IOE pretreatment protected cardiomyocytes from MI/R injury by attenuating oxidative damage and suppressing ER stress-induced apoptosis. IOE may suppress ER stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the PERK/eIF2Î±/CHOP pathway by the activation of SIRT1. Therefore, IO may be a potential therapeutic candidate in cardiovascular diseases.</p>
