<p>Concerning the effect of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin on glucose metabolism, in 2017 Genovese and coworkers investigated its effect on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in L6 rat skeletal myoblasts [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. When administered in the concentration range 0.1–10 μM, the oxyprenylated coumarin increased the glucose uptake by these cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the same time, 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin led to the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Both effects were very similar to those evoked by insulin (0.1 μM) used as the reference drug. It is noteworthy to underline how, also in this case, the unprenylated counterpart, umbelliferone, provided a very weak activity.
