    <bold>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</bold> HPTLC phytochemical profile of 
    <italic>Leonotis leonurus</italic> var. 
    <italic>albiflora</italic> Benth. whole flower extracts, using different solvent concentrations for extraction. Phytochemical extractions were optimized using different concentrations (1, 50%; 2, 75%; 3, 100%, respectively) of either acetonitrile (A) or methanol (M). Mobile phase: chloroform, 10% methanol. Loading volume: 12 µL. pCB-specific compounds were derivatized with fast blue B reagent (dissolved in 0.1%, 1 mM NaOH) under dark conditions. HPTLC plates were captured under visible light following derivatization. A single spot, based on the red–orange colour development (A2; 75% acetonitrile extraction, indicated in the red dotted-line rectangle), was isolated from the HPTLC plate and used for downstream LC–MS/MS analyses.
