<p id="Par17">Phytocannabinoid screening was performed on 10 × 20 cm glass-back plates pre-coated with 0.25 mm silicagel 60 (REF 811213, Macherey–Nagel, Germany). Flower derived-extracts (0.50 mg/μL) were applied to the plates in 2 μL increments and allowed to dry completely before placement into a glass chromatography chamber (Camag, Switzerland), pre-conditioned with the mobile phase, chloroform:methanol (9:1; 30 min). Subsequently, the chromatogram was developed in the dark using fast blue B reagent (0.1% w/v; dissolved in 1 mM NaOH). Based on R
 <sub>f</sub> ranges (comparative to the upper R
 <sub>f</sub> values representing the less polar range of pCBs from Cannabis, under the same chromatographic conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) and change in colour [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]), a single, red–orange compound of interest was scraped from the preparative HPTLC plate and resuspended in 50% (v/v) methanol, prior to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analyses.
