<p id="Par13">Increasing interest from developed economies in the use of TMs has created the second largest global therapeutics market [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The medicinal Cannabis industry is currently one such focal area, largely because of the occurrence of phytocannabinoids (pCBs). As part of a unique class of phytochemicals that interact with the human endocannabinoid system (ECS), the use of pCBs as therapeutics holds promise in the treatment of numerous chronic diseases [

However, many countries still abide by strict regulatory laws pertaining to the commercial growth of Cannabis and, consequently research into pharmacologically relevant products has until recently, been relatively protracted. Since the discovery of pCBs, similar compounds (pCB-like) have been reported in several plant species, beyond Cannabis, that are commonly used in TM practices [
