<p id="Par16">As predicted, Kune speakers were not able to name plant and bird species associated exclusively with marine or coastal environments. These species are omitted from the following analysis. Looking at the data from the point of view of the number of respondents able to name a certain plant species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), it becomes apparent that only 10 of the plants in the stimulus set (around 13%) were known to all respondents. Unlike the previous analysis (i.e. by age), this analysis takes into account the accuracy of respondents’ plant and bird identifications. The responses of the oldest participant are assumed to be the ‘correct’ identifications, as this person is considered to be the most knowledgeable elder in the community. Indeed, several plant species (23, or 30%) were only identified by this respondent, with the others saying that they did not know the names of these species. Thirty-one plant species were known to at least half (6 or more) of the respondents, representing roughly 41% of the stimulus set. Practically all the plants that were known to all respondents are those that are regarded as a food source by Kune speakers (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), many producing fruit that are easily harvested. Important among these are medium to large trees such as 
 <italic>Buchanania obovata</italic> (green plum) and 
 <italic>Terminalia carpentariae</italic> (wild peach), as well as smaller plants such as 
 <italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic> (dodder) and 
 <italic>Nymphaea violacea</italic> (waterlily).
