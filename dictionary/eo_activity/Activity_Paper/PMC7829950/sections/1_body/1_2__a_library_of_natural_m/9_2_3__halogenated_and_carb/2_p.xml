<p>In a study involving the synthesis of dimers of xanthones as bis-intercalators [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], bromohexyloxyxanthones 
 <bold>34</bold>â€“
 <bold>36</bold> were obtained as side products and were investigated for their effect on the in vitro growth of human tumor cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Although for bromoalkoxyxanthone 
 <bold>35</bold> no relevant growth inhibition was observed on all the tested tumor cell lines, the bromoalkoxyxanthones 
 <bold>34</bold> and 
 <bold>36</bold> showed an interesting growth inhibitory effect, higher than the parent hydroxylated xanthones and the target bisxanthones. Although more studies are needed to establish a SAR, results showed that one free hydroxyl group in the bromoalkoxyxanthone scaffold 
 <bold>35</bold> is unfavourable to the growth inhibitory activity. Additionally, X-ray crystallography allowed the structure elucidation of 1-(6-bromohexyloxy)-xanthone (
 <bold>34</bold>) which can be helpful in the future to disclose some mechanistic aspects concerning the binding of 
 <bold>34</bold> to DNA or other putative targets.
