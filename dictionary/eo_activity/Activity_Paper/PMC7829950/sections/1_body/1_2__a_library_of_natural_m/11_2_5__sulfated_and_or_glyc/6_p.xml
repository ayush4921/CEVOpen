<p>A putative in vivo anticoagulant efficacy in mice, with no suggestion of acute side effects, shows the potential of xanthones 
 <bold>58</bold> and 
 <bold>59</bold> to lead a new class of therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. These scaffolds with lesser charge density compared to heparins may be expected to cause minimal cross-reactivity with other proteins. Therefore, these compounds are likely to overcome the bleeding complications and hepatic toxicity owing to their minimal charge density. This family of compounds, with a well-defined composition, are also merited with a feasible synthesis protocol [
