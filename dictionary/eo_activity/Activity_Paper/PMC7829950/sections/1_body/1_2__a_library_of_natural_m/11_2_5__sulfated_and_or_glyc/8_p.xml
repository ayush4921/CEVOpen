<p>Nature uses sulfation mainly to avoid potential toxicity, so synthesis of non-natural sulfated small molecules could be a way in generating new nontoxic bioactive agents. Zosteric acid, which is a 
 <italic>p</italic>-sulfated cinnamic acid derived from the marine seagrass 
 <italic>Zostera marina</italic>, has received much attention as a potential marine antifoulant product (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f014">Figure 14</xref>C) [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The toxicity studies of zosteric acid showed no measurable LD
 <sub>50</sub> for larval fish and an acute toxicity profile similar to table sugar. The marine industry is now facing the phase-out of current persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic biocides that are continuing being released from AF coatings to the environmental, shortening the available alternatives to combat marine biofouling. Developing alternative environmentally friendly and non-toxic AF agents is an urgent demand. The yields of natural compounds from marine organisms are generally poor, hindering their development as AF agents. Moreover, optimizing a microorganism for enhanced production of antifoulant is generally laborious and time consuming. Besides, marine natural products are often structurally too complex to be synthesized on a large scale and are often not compatible with polymer coatings. Synthesis of simple and optimized antifoulants looks like a more sustainable way bringing an opportunity to produce commercial supplies for AF industry without sacrifice natural species. Therefore, in 2017, inspired by the marine zosteric acid molecule, several synthetic sulfated structure-diverse compounds obtained by our group were tested for AF properties [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. New synthetic AF scaffolds were disclosed in this work, namely xanthone 
 <bold>59</bold>, which exhibited effective anti-settlement response towards the most common biofouling species with worldwide representatives, the 
 <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23.19 μM) without causing mortality to this species at any of the tested concentrations (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 μM), in contrast to the commercial eco-friendly AF agent ECONEA
 <sup>®</sup> which showed some toxicity at the higher concentrations tested (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 107.78 μM). For the efficacy level of new eco-friendly alternatives, it is highly recommended therapeutic ratios (LC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>) higher than 15, which is in accordance with the results obtained with this new AF agent. However, while this xanthone 
 <bold>59</bold> was active, other sulfated xanthones did not show notable activity. These results show that the nature of the scaffold plays a role in placing sulfate groups in favourable position for the activity: while xanthone 
 <bold>59</bold> was highly active, a structure related xanthone in which the 
 <italic>O</italic>-linkage was replaced by a triazole linkage, was not active.
