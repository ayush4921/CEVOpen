<p>One of the problems regarding P-gp inhibitors is the pharmacokinetic interactions due to the fact that they can also be substrates or inhibitors of cytochrome p450, that will require the use of a higher dose of the cytotoxic compound to achieve therapeutic success [

As CYP3A4 has wide range of substrates and it is the subfamily of CYP responsible for the phase I metabolism of 50% of drugs administered to humans, a CYP3A4 luciferin-based luminescence assay was performed. The tested thioxanthones interfered with CYP3A4 activity in vitro (inhibitors or substrates), which was in accordance with the in silico prediction. It was found that

 <sub>50</sub> values for CYP3A4 inhibition of approximately 1–2 μM, but the inhibition was almost total for concentrations close to 100 μM [
