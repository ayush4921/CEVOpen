<p>P-gp is an apical membrane transporter whose aim is to protect cells against xenobiotics and cellular toxicants. The overexpression of P-gp confers significant resistance to a wide variety of neutral and cationic hydrophobic chemotherapeutic substrates [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. P-gp inhibitors generally have a logP of 2.92 or higher, a long chain to strengthen the link to P-gp; and at least one protonable nitrogen that can establish ionic and ion-dipole bonds [

Therefore, we concluded that antitumor agents that are P-gp inhibitors by themselves could represent a good first step toward the development of multi-functional drugs called dual-activity agents. Simultaneous modulation of multiple biological targets can be beneficial for the treatment of diseases with complex ethiologies such as cancer. Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in drug design towards the development of multifunctional drugs, which means that a compound can reach multiple targets [
