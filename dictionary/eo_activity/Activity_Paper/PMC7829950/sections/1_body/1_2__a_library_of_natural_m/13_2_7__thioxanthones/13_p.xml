<p>Besides antitumor and ABC transporters inhibition, thioxanthones represent a class of compounds with many other potential and diverse biological activities. As several of these compounds were described as antimicrobial agents, our group decided to also study the potential of some of our in-house thioxanthones to fight biofouling. In this study, significant anti-settlement responses were identified in the presence of thioxanthone 
 <bold>75</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.53 μM) and 
 <bold>86</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.60 μM), concomitantly with low toxicity to mussel larvae (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 μM). Thus, adding to their already known pharmacological actions, these thioxanthones also revealed AF activity. Exposure of plantigrade larvae to compound 
 <bold>75</bold> altered the abundance of proteins involved in major cellular metabolic processes as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, lysosomal protein degradation, or proteins that are constituents of the cytoskeleton. With some of these constitutive proteins having an important role in metabolism and cellular functions, it is possible that 
 <bold>75</bold> affects the metabolism of a broad number of organisms. However, in contrast to AF xanthones described in previous section (2.1, 2.2, and 2.5), thioxanthones 
 <bold>75</bold> and 
 <bold>86</bold> were found to be toxic (100% and 50% mortality at 50 μM, respectively) to
