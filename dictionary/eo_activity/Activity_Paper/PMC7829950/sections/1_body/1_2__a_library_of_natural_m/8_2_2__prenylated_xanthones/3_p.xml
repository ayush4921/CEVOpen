<p>Following, our group used “non-classical” methodologies, namely microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) and heterogeneous catalysis, to optimize the synthetic approach to obtain this group of xanthones. It was also applied the combined method of heterogeneous catalysis with MW irradiation [

 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Heterogeneous catalysis methodology was also used for the first time, in the synthesis of dihydropyranoxanthones. By this method, dihydropyranoxanthones were obtained from hydroxyxanthones, through a one-pot synthesis, in the presence of montmorillonite K10 clay as solid catalyst. The coupling of heterogeneous catalysis with MW irradiation provided a chemical process with several advantages when compared to classical methods, such as enhanced reaction rates, better yields and selectivity to obtain xanthones with an extra dihydropyran ring [
