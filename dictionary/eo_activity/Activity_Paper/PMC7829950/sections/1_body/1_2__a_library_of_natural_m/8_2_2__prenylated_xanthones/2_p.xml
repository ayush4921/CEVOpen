<p>Xanthones with open chain prenyl groups, as well as dihydropyranoxanthones and pyranoxanthones, were firstly obtained by our group through classical synthetic methodologies. Prenylation was carried out from hydroxyxanthones by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Dihydropyranoxanthones were synthesized by cyclization of mono-oxyprenylated xanthones, while the synthesis of pyranoxanthones was achieved by dehydrogenation of dihydropyranoxanthones or using a benzopyran derivative as building block (
