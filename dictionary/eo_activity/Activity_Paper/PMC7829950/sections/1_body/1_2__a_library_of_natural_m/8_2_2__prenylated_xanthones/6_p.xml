<p>In 2009, a rigidification strategy aiming to improve the antitumor activity of previously synthesized dihydropyranoxanthone derivative 
 <bold>13</bold> was applied by our group and pyranoxanthones 
 <bold>16</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold> were obtained by unsaturation strategy applied to the dihydropyran ring of dihydropyranoxanthones 
 <bold>11</bold>–
 <bold>13</bold>, respectively (

 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Moreover, two new 
 <italic>C</italic>-prenylated derivatives (
 <bold>20</bold> and 
 <bold>21</bold>) were synthesized by prenylation of xanthone 
 <bold>19</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, when comparing the effects of the pyranoxanthones 
 <bold>16</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold> on the growth of MCF-7 cells with those of their respective dihydropyran xanthones used as building blocks 
 <bold>11</bold>–
 <bold>13</bold>, it was found that the presence of the unsaturation in the pyran ring was associated with loss of inhibitory activity against MCF-7, suggesting that the rigidification failed to give an improvement of activity. However, 
 <italic>C</italic>-prenylation of the inactive xanthone 
 <bold>19</bold> was associated with the appearance of some growth inhibitory effect against MCF-7 of derivatives 
 <bold>20</bold> and 
 <bold>21</bold> [
