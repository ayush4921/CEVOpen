<p>A first series of 17 analogues of 
 <bold>22</bold> with a linear tetracyclic system and different substituents in ring A were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer), A375-C5 (melanoma) and HL-60 (acute myeloid leukemia) cell lines. A new route, through a benzophenone intermediate was developed for the synthesis of 
 <bold>22</bold> and its 17 analogues bearing different substituents on ring A and different ring D orientation. Some of the newly synthesized compounds (
 <bold>23</bold>–
 <bold>26</bold>) were more active than 
 <bold>22</bold> in the four tumor cell lines tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Particularly, analogue 
 <bold>24</bold> with an 8-diethylamino group at A ring and a 2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydropyrano ring linked to the B ring of xanthone nucleus showed to be the most active in all tested cell lines. In general, like 
 <bold>22</bold>, all synthesized analogues were more active towards the HL-60 tumor cell line, with the most potent compound (
 <bold>23</bold>) having a GI
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.14 µM, lower than the hit compound 
 <bold>22</bold> (GI
 <sub>50</sub> of 23.41 µM). Interestingly, all compounds showed a logKp between 3 and 5 in two membrane models, namely liposomes and micelles, and all tested compounds showed low solubility, being this explained by their high rigidity and planarity [
