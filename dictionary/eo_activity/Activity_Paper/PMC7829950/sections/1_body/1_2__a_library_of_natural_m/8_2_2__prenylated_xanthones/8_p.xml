<p>Considering the disclosed mechanism elucidation for naturally occurring prenylated xanthone α-mangostin and gambogic acid as inhibitors of MDM2-p53 interaction by some of us [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and the promising growth inhibitory activity of 
 <bold>22</bold> in cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], this pyranoxanthone as well as other structure related compounds were submitted to in silico and in vitro studies in order to explore their potential as novel MDM2-p53 inhibitors. The p53 tumor suppressor is a major transcription factor with a crucial role in cell proliferation and death. The activity of p53 is commonly lost in cancers either by mutation in the TP53 gene, or by inactivation due to the overexpression of the main endogenous negative regulator, murine double minute 2 (MDM2). Therefore, restoration of p53 activity by inhibiting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents an appealing therapeutic strategy for many wild-type p53 tumors with overexpressed MDM2 [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>22</bold> was in fact identified as a putative inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction using a yeast phenotypic assay for the screening of inhibitors of MDM2-p53 interaction in association with a yeast p53 transactivation assay [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The activity of 
 <bold>22</bold> as inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction was further validated in human tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 and overexpressed MDM2. Remarkably, 
 <bold>22</bold> mimicked the activity of known p53 activators, leading to p53 stabilization and activation of p53-dependent transcriptional activity. In addition, it increased p21 and Bax protein levels, and caspase-7 cleavage. Computational docking studies allowed predicting that, like nutlin-3a, a known small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction, 
 <bold>22</bold> binds to the p53-binding site of MDM2. With this research line, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction with a xanthone scaffold was identified for the first time, which could be used as molecular probe [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and inspired other researchers to develop new anticancer agents targeting p53 [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Nevertheless, using adequate software (ACD/Labs software, Toronto, Canada) the calculated maximum water solubility of 
 <bold>22</bold> was only 16 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This poor aqueous solubility could be a major drawback for its potential use in therapy. Therefore, drug delivery systems, including nanosphere, nanocapsule and nanoparticle formulations were developed [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Among these, nanocapsules containing poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Mygliol
 <sup>®</sup> 812 were found to be noncytotoxic to MCF-7 cell line and 
 <bold>22</bold>-loaded nanocapsules with an incorporation efficiency of 77% revealed to be more potent than the free compound against cell growth inhibition, which may be related to the enhancement in its intracellular delivery [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. These results suggest that it was possible to enhance the effect of the hit compound 
 <bold>22</bold> through the development of suitable noncytotoxic polymeric nanoparticles. In addition to nanotechnological approaches to optimize 
 <bold>22</bold> previously described, our group has also been involved in the optimization of the potency of this xanthone through a chemical approach. Therefore, 
 <bold>22</bold> was used as the starting point in the search for more potent antitumor agents. To increase the probability of success, the pharmacokinetic behaviour was also considered in this research plan. Accordingly, it was decided to optimize this compound following a multidimensional approach regarding, in parallel, at the activity and physicochemical properties, with the latter being used as a tool to predict the pharmacokinetic behaviour.
