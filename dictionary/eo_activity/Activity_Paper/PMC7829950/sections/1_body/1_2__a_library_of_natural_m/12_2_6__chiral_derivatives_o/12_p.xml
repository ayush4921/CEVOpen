<p>In a study considering macrocyclic antibiotic CSPs for determination of the enantiomeric ratio, to explore the SER and the chiral recognition mechanisms by molecular docking, fourteen new CDXs were evaluated in Chirobiotic T, Chirobiotic TAG, Chirobiotic V and Chirobiotic R under multimodal elution conditions. The best Î± and Rs were achieved on Chirobiotic R and Chirobiotic T CSPs, under normal elution conditions, with Rs ranging from 1.25 to 2.50 and from 0.78 to 2.06, respectively. The chiral recognition mechanisms by molecular docking were able to estimate the resolution for CDXs with a success rate of 92%. The calculations also showed that each macrocyclic antibiotic CSP exhibits rather different binding patterns. The shape and the surface of the chirobiotic CSP, the general chemical structure and not only the position of the stereogenic centers of the CDXs played an important role in the overall retention of the enantiomers by the CSPs [

It was found that their applicability increased considering the complementary profile in enantioselectivity of the different macrocyclic antibiotic CSPs. Higher resolutions were obtained for the CDXs evaluated compared to our previous work [
