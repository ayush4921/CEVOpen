<p>Thirty-one enantiomeric pairs of the synthesized CDXs were evaluated for the in vitro growth inhibitory activity in three human tumor cell lines, A375-C5 (melanoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer) [

 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The obtained results allowed to find active chiral compounds for all the tested cells lines, with some showing cell-type selectivity, and to draw SAR considerations. It was found that the nature and position of substituents on the xanthone scaffold and on the aromatic ring of the chiral moiety had a significant influence in determining the growth inhibitory effect. Another feature that has a decisive role on the growth inhibitory effect was the configuration of the stereogenic center(s). The most active CDXs in all human tumor cell lines were (

 <bold>69</bold>, showed promising inhibitory activity against A375-C5 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however, it is important to point out the high enantioselectivity observed for MCF-7 tumor cell line with (

 <bold>69</bold> showing low inhibitory effect (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 112.3 ± 19.56 μM) and (

 <bold>69</bold> presenting a GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.10 ± 8.49 μM [

 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. In addition, in vitro DNA crosslinking ability was assessed for the active compounds and the results correlated with in vitro cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. It was inferred that a possible mechanism of action may involve induction of DNA crosslinking activity. Nevertheless, other mechanisms cannot be excluded and must be explored in further studies.
