<p>To determine the stereochemistry-activity relationship on the growth inhibitory effects of the kielcorins C-E, chiral liquid chromatography (cLC) methods were developed for their enantioseparation, using polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) and multimodal elution conditions, in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Later, the enantiomers of the kielcorins C-E were efficiently separated on a multimilligram scale using an amylose 
 <italic>tris</italic>-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate CSP [

A solid-phase injection system was developed and combined with a closed loop recycling system to increase the productivity and recovery of the preparative process. The enantiomeric purity was also evaluated being higher than 99%, except for 
 <italic>trans-</italic>kielcorin C (

The inhibitory activity of the racemates C-E as well as of the corresponding enantiomers on in vitro growth of the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 was evaluated and compared. The most evident enantioselectivity was found between the racemate of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorin D (
 <bold>62</bold>) (inactive) and the active enantiomers (+)-
