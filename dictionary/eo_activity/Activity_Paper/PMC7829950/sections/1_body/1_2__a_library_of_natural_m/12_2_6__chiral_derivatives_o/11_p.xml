<p>Different types of CSPs, namely Pirkle type, macrocyclic antibiotic and polysaccharide-based, were considered for quantification of the enantiomeric ratio, to explore the structure-enantioresolution relationship (SER) as well to investigate the chiral recognition mechanisms of the synthesized libraries of CDXs. All explored CSPs were suitable for quantification of the enantiomeric ratio of the majority of CDXs of all synthesized libraries. The resolution of seven enantiomeric pairs of CDXs on (

 <italic>S</italic>)-Whelk-O1 and L-phenylglycine CSPs was systematically investigated using multimodal elution conditions (normal, polar-organic, and reversed-phase) [

 <italic>S</italic>,
 <italic>S</italic>)-Whelk-O1 CSP, under polar-organic conditions, demonstrated a high power of resolution for the CDXs possessing an aromatic moiety linked to the stereogenic center, the enantioselectivity (α) and resolution (Rs) ranged from 1.91 to 7.55 and from 6.71 to 24.16, respectively. The chiral recognition mechanisms were investigated for (

 <italic>S</italic>)-Whelk-O1 CSP by molecular docking and were in accordance with the experimental chromatographic parameters. The simultaneous π-π interactions that may be established by the phenyl group at the stereogenic center as well as the xanthone scaffold with the selector demonstrated to be essential for enantioselective recognition [

 <italic>S</italic>)-Whelk-O1 CSP only in polar organic mode with acetonitrile/methanol (50:50 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) as mobile phase. The values of α and Rs ranged from 1.41 to 6.25 and from 1.29 to 17.20, respectively. Generally, the (
 <italic>R</italic>)-enantiomer was the first to elute. All the enantiomeric pairs were enantioseparated, even those without an aromatic moiety linked to the stereogenic center. The chiral recognition mechanisms by molecular docking were consistent with the chromatographic parameters and elution orders. Several structural requirements were revealed as being important for enantioselectivity: the xanthone tricyclic ring aligned with phenanthryl moiety of the (
 <italic>S</italic>,
 <italic>S</italic>)-Whelk-O1 selector in order to maximize π-π stacking interactions; the aromatic ring of the chiral moiety of xanthone derivatives established π-π stacking interactions with the 3,5-dinitrophenyl group of the selector and H-bonding interactions between the xanthone carbonyl and the NH amide of the selector [
