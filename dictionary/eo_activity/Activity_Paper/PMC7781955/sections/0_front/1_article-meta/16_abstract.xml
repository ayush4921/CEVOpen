 <p>Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. It is clinically divided into two types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. 
  <italic>Populus simonii</italic> distributed in East Asia region including China used as traditional medicine, which is an important medicinal plant for anti-lung cancer activity. The complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
  <italic>P. simonii</italic> was characterized from Illumina pair-end sequencing. The chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>P. simonii</italic> was 156,559 bp in length, containing a large single-copy region (LSC) of 84,825 bp, a small single-copy region (SSC) of 47,561 bp, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 16,494 bp. The overall GC content is 36.70%, while the corresponding values of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions are 34.5%, 30.0%, and 42.0%, respectively. The genome contains 131 complete genes, including 86 protein-coding genes (68 protein-coding gene species), 37 tRNA genes (29 tRNA species), and 8 rRNA genes (4 rRNA species). The neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis showed that 
  <italic>P. simonii</italic> and 
  <italic>P. qamdoensis</italic> clustered together as sisters to other 
  <italic>Populus</italic> species.
