<p>The fresh leaves of 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> were collected from Yanzhou (116°35′E; 35°43′N). Fresh leaves were silica-dried and taken to the laboratory until DNA extraction. The voucher specimen (XXY001) was laid in the Herbarium of First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University and the extracted DNA was stored in the −80 °C refrigerator of the Key Laboratory of Department of Thoracic Surgery. We extracted total genomic DNA from 25 mg silica-gel-dried leaf using a modified CTAB method (Doyle

The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to perform the genome sequence. We used the software MITObim 1.8 (Hahn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and metaSPAdes (Nurk et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) to assemble chloroplast genomes. We used 
 <italic>Populus qamdoensis</italic> (GenBank: NC040868) as a reference genome. We annotated the chloroplast genome with the software DOGMA (Wyman et al.
