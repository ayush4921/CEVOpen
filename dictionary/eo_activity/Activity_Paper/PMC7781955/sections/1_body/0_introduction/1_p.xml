<p>Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. The latter is the most common type of lung cancer pathology. Lung cancer occupies the number one cause of cancer death in the world. Although there have been some advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, there are currently no specific treatment drugs. 
 <italic>Populus simonii</italic> distributed in East Asia region including China used as traditional medicine, which is an important medicinal plant for anti-lung cancer activity, which has persisted largely in an undomesticated state that is highly resistant to different environmental stresses. Most patients with non-small cell lung cancer are not sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, so it is urgent to develop anti-cancer drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity and side effects based on the research of tumor molecular signaling pathways. Natural products are an important source of anti-tumor chemical drugs. Lung cancer refers to a disease caused by environmental and genetic factors, with dementia as the main clinical phase. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> can significantly increase the number of capillary networks and accelerate blood flow, thereby restoring the function of microcirculation. At the same time, it can also reduce plasma lactic acid content and improve metabolic disorders caused by cell hypoxia. It plays an important role for anti-lung cancer activity. Studies have shown that 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> can reduce the content of lipid peroxide and erythrocyte sorbitol, increase the level of superoxide dismutase, reduce the oxidative stress reaction, and has an antioxidant effect. Studies have also found that 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> can improve the role of lung cancer. The mechanism may be: the antioxidant effect of drugs, by restoring the structure and function of nerve cells, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, improving blood rheology, and protecting against ischemia. Damaged neurons improve the pathological response of for lung cancer. Since it contains selaginellin, flavonoids and sumaflavone, it also presented anti-cancer, inhibition of immediate allergic reactions, and antihyperglycemic activities. 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> has high ecological and economic value with high levels of intraspecific genetic diversity. 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> has wide geographic distribution, high intraspecific polymorphism, adaptability to different environments, combined with a relatively small genome size. Consequently, 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> represents an excellent model for understanding how different evolutionary forces have sculpted the variation patterns in the genome during the process of population differentiation and ecological speciation (Neale and Antoine 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, we can develop conservation strategies easily when we understand the genetic information of 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic>. In the present research, we constructed the whole chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> and understood many genome varition information about the species, which will provide beneficial help for population genetics studies of 
 <italic>P. simonii.</italic>
