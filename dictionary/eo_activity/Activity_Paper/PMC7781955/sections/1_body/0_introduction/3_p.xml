<p>The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> (GenBank accession number MT482540) was characterized from Illumina pair-end sequencing. The chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>Populus simonii</italic> was 156,559 bp in length, containing a large single-copy region (LSC) of 84,825 bp, a small single-copy region (SSC) of 47,561 bp, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 16,494 bp. The overall GC content is 36.70%, while the corresponding values of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions are 34.5%, 30.0%, and 42.0%, respectively. The genome contains 131 complete genes, including 86 protein-coding genes (68 protein-coding gene species), 37 tRNA genes (29 tRNA species) and 8 rRNA genes (4 rRNA species).
