<p>We used the complete chloroplast genomes sequence of 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> and 21 other related species to construct phylogenetic tree. The 22 chloroplast genome sequences were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and then the neighbour-joining tree was constructed by MEGA 7.0 (Kumar etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis showed that 
 <italic>P. simonii</italic> and 
 <italic>Populus qamdoensis</italic> clustered together as sisters to other 
 <italic>Populus</italic> species (
