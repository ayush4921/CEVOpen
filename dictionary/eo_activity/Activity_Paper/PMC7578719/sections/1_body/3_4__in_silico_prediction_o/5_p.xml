 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> visualizes the binding pose of seven ligands as the docking results in the respected proteins/gene. Although the binding energy is within the broad range, all ligands occupied the same pocket of human tyrosinase. In contrast, the ligands are divided into three binding clusters in the pocket of the human p53 gene. As happened in human p53, the ligands have two different binding positions in the pocket of glycoside hydrolase.
