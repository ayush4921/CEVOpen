<p>About 80% of the population in the developing countries depends on medicinal plants for primary health care [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Out of 50,000 angiospermic plants used as medicines, more than 600 species are used in Pakistan for curing various diseases [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The family Lamiaceae, also known as Labiatae or mint family, consists of highly valued medicinal plants with cosmopolitan distribution and worldwide source of spices and various extracts [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Within this family, about 236 genera and more than 6000 species are present in which genera 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> provide various taxa [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ethnoecological studies have been carried out by various research studies in Peshawar and adjoining areas [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The plants of this family contain active chemical constituents and secondary metabolites like vitamins and minerals [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> is used as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiuretic, antidiabetic, and anticancer agent [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species possess antioxidant properties because of the presence of active components, such as rosmarinic acid, menthol, carvone, menthone, and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Minerals play a primary role in reproduction, growth, health, and proper functioning of living organisms [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Elemental analysis showed that members of Lamiaceae taxa are rich in macro- and microelements. Phytochemicals are naturally occurring biologically active compounds found in plants, which are liable for health benefits of humans [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The phytochemical screening of various plants of Lamiaceae was carried out by Asghari et al., Cocan et al., and Mahendra and Kakde [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and elemental analysis by Arika et al. and Gogoasa et al. [
