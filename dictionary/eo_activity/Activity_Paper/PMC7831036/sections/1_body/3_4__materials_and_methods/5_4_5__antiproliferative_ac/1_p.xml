<p>The cervical cancer cell line SiHa (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HTB-35™) was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Approximately 5000 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 24 h, the cells were supplemented with the highest antioxidative fraction of 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> (diluted in MiliQ water at a concentration of 2000 µg/mL). From this solution, dilutions were prepared (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.17 µg/mL).
