<p>Analysis in Swiss Target Prediction [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]: The Î²-tubulin models 1SA0, 1FJJ, and 1Z2B were obtained from the Protein Data Bank database (PDB) [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The structures of the flavonoid compounds detected by UPLC analysis were drawn with the Marvin ChemAxon software [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and their energy minimization was calculated with the Avogadro software [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The obtained data were converted into an AutoDock format (pdbqt) [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and the values of the chemical interaction energy for the different binding sites were obtained and visualized with the UCSF Chimera software (available to download at
