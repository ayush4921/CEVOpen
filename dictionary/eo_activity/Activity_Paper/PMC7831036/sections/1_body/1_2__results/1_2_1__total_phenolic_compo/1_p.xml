<p>In the present study, the bio-directed extraction of phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> was carried out through different organic solvents. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00443-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the results of the quantification of the total phenolic compounds in the four crude extracts of hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol, and water. The crude ethanol extract presented the highest concentration of total phenolic compounds expressed in gallic acid equivalents (15.51 GAE mg/g). Therefore, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> was chosen for its subsequent fractionation and studies.
