<p>Based on the pharmacological prediction, the antiproliferative activity of fraction 14 was evaluated against the cervical cancer cell line (SiHa). Fraction 14 showed an antiproliferative effect against SiHa cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentrations of 200–3175 μg/mL were able to inhibit proliferation in 50% of the cells compared to the untreated control. A linear regression analysis of the dose–response curve determined an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 6.78 ± 0.6 μg/mL. The cytostatic drug paclitaxel presented an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.364 ± 0.03 μg/mL.
