<p>A phytochemical study of hydroethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>E. giganteum</italic> (L.) showed the presence of flavonoid derivates (mainly quercetin and kaempferol) and presented significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activities [

 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> showed the presence of flavonoid derivatives, such as kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sophoroside, kaempferol-3,7-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-glucoside, kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sophoroside-4’-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-glucoside, and caffeoylmethylate-4-β-glucopyranoside [

 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> did not show a genotoxic effect, but did, however, show a hypoglycemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes after 90 min of application [
