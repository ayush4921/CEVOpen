 <italic>Terminalia argentea</italic> Mart. is an aboriginal tree growing in various regions of Brazil. Leaf of 
 <italic>T. argentea</italic> Mart. is traditionally used to treat digestion and respiratory-related diseases in Brazil. It has also been reported that the hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of 
 <italic>T. argentea</italic> Mart. has no cytotoxicity in CHO-K1 and AGS cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (

 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. is propagated by seeds and grows almost in all types of soils, however, humid, fertile loam and red lateritic soils are preferred (

 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. is an endemic tree widely found in India and Sri Lanka and used traditionally for cardioprotective and hepatoprotective purposes. In the indigenous medicine system, 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. is widely documented for its use in treating cardiovascular diseases (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>). (2) Arjunolic acid, an oleanane triterpenoid found in the heartwood of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn., has been demonstrated to contribute to the bioactivities of the plant (
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">Toppo et al., 2018</xref>). Also, evidence suggested that 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn., bark administration relieved trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis in an animal model by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine and decreasing oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Cota et al., 2019</xref>). Alcoholic extract from the bark of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn., has been demonstrated to protect against picrotoxin in mice by regulating related genes (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Chandra Sekhar et al., 2017</xref>). The fruit of 
 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. is widely documented for its use in treating diseases such as diarrhea, cough, and scorpion-sting, etc. In India, 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. is used to treat diarrhea based on its antioxidant and antibacterial properties (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2017</xref>). It has been found that extracts of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruits possess antibacterial activity without having cytotoxicity (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Dharmaratne et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study showed that the aqueous acetone extract of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruits attenuate CCl4-induced oxidative stress and liver damage in a rat model (
