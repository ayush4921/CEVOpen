<p>Similarly, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Awotunde et al. (2019)</xref>, evaluated the subacute toxicity of 
 <italic>Terminalia schimperiana</italic> Hochst. ex Engl. &amp; Diels (synonym of 
 <italic>Terminalia glaucescens</italic> Planch. ex Benth.), water extracts in male rats. It was reported that extracts did not have a toxic effect in any organs at doses of 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/kg body weight, nor had any effect on the biochemical parameters of treated rats. Also, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Das et al. (2015)</xref>, reported the acute and subacute toxicity of methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Terminalia citrina</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. leaves in female Sprague rats at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg bodyweight for 28 days. 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. treatment had no significant effect on biochemical parameters like alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, and creatinine, which indicates no detriment of liver and kidney functions. Also, 
 <italic>T. citrina</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. extracts did not affect hematological parameters such as white blood count, red blood cell count, platelet count and hemoglobin content, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and hematocrit content (
