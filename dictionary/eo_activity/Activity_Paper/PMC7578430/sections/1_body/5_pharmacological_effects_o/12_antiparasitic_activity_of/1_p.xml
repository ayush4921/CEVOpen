<p>Parasites, including malaria, are the most significant protozoan disease in the world. In 2018, 228 million cases of malaria worldwide were reported by the World Health Organization. In addition, other parasites such as 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. The present study is focused on the antiparasitic activity of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extract against the important parasites (

  <bold>Table 9</bold>
 </xref>). Camara and team reported antimalaria activity of 
 <italic>Terminalia albida</italic> Scott-Elliot bark extract against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> as 1.5 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Camara et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, an increase in the survival rate of mice infected with the 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> was detected when they were treated with the bark extract of 
 <italic>Terminalia albida</italic> Scott-Elliot (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Camara et al., 2019</xref>) and 
 <italic>Terminalia avicennioides</italic> Guill. &amp; Perr. (
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">Owoloye et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, Mbouna and the team reported that different parts of 
 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> H. Perrier inhibited 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. It has been commented that IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>Terminalia mantaly</italic> H. Perrier leaf, root, and stem were 2.09, 7.01, and 3.63 µg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Mbouna et al., 2018</xref>). It has been reported that 
 <italic>Terminalia superba</italic> Engl. &amp; Diels bark, root, and stem possess antitrypanosomal activity against 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> with MIC ranging from 0.8-1.6 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Antia et al., 2009</xref>). Also, the activity of 
 <italic>Terminalia arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. bark extract against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>, barber’s pole worm, ova, and larva has been documented (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Bachaya et al., 2009</xref>). This study showed that extracts from 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. plant species could be used as alternative agents for the treatment of parasitic infection.
