 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. (2018)</xref>, evaluated the anti-inflammatory capacity of 
 <italic>Terminalia coriacea</italic> (Roxb.) Wight &amp; Arn. (
 <italic>Terminalia coriacea</italic> Spreng.), in albino Wistar rats with an acute and chronic model, carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma, respectively. 
 <italic>T. corriacea</italic> (Roxb.) Wight &amp; Arn. was evaluated at different concentrations (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) by oral administration of the leaf extract. All tested concentrations showed antiinflammatory activity at a dose-dependent manner, which the authors attribute to the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. flavonoids like (97) apigenin, (36) kaempferol, (48) luteolin, (98) myricetin, (35) quercetin, and (118) rutin; which was reflected as a decreased paw volume and wet and dry weights of granulomatous tissue in both models of inflammation (
