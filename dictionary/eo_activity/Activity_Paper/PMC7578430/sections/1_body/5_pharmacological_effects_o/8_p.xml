<p>Bioassay-guided fractionation of

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Latha and Daisy (2013)</xref>, isolated and identified (58) octyl gallate by 1H and 13C NMR, IR, and mass spectrometry. Also, they reported it as the active compound in 
 <italic>T. bellerica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. responsible for its bioactive potential when examined for its antidiabetic potential. An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay showed that (58) octyl gallate at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg significantly reduced plasma glucose in a dose-dependent manner in diabetic mice. However, the plasma glucose of normal rats treated with the highest (58) octyl gallate concentration was not altered, indicating a normoglycemic effect. This may be attributed to improved proinsulin processing and potentiation of insulin secretion and release from Î²-cells. This effect is hypothesized as (58) octyl gallate has been reported as a calcium channel and cAMP modulator (

 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species with antiobesity and antidiabetic potential is given in
