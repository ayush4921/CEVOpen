<p>Also, leaf ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. catappa</italic> L. from Taiwan was reported by 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2019)</xref>, who used HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines to test its antiproliferative effect. The authors evaluated 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts at a concentration of 25, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL. It was shown that 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts have low cytotoxicity and suppress TPA-induced migration and invasion through the inhibition of MMP-9 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, water extracts from 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. from the Republic of Korea reported by 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2016)</xref>, showed antiproliferative potential in HeLa cell lines. The authors state that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts antagonize with the production of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, which may be related to the author’s hypothesis that due to the previously reported antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. This extract may have a role in the inhibition of TNF-induced necroptotic cell death. Moreover, HPLC and UHPLC-MS analyses exhibited that water extracts from 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. were rich in (3) gallic acid (553.79 nmol/mg), (85) geraniin (80.78 nmol/mg), (76) chebulic acid (54.60 nmol/mg), (86) punicalagin (10.48 nmol/mg), (9) chebulinic acid (10.32 nmol/mg), and (53) chebulagic acid (9.24 nmol/mg). These compounds may be related to its necroptotic cell death induction activity (
