<p>Extracts from plants of the genus 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. are a rich source of phytochemicals such as terpenes, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. It is suggested that these molecules are related to the antibacterial, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, and anticancer activity of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> plants. Several reports have associated the ethnopharmacological potential of plant extracts or phytochemicals isolated from medicinal plants and plant foods with their bioavailability. However, as far as our literature research, we did not find bioavailability reports as well as any pharmacokinetic data. Thus, it is unknown if these molecules will exert any bioactivity in humans.
