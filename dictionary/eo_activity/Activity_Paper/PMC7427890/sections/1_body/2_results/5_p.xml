<p id="Par22">The same variables were analyzed concerning the number of species cited. The locality, perception of changes in the landscape, and duration of residence time significantly affected the total number of cited species. The GLM explained 27% of the variation in the total number of species used (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), of which locality explained 77%, perception of changes 15%, and residence time 8%. Longer-term residents and residents, who cited negative or positive landscape changes, cited more species collected than residents who had not observed landscape change over time. The locality also had a significant effect on the number of citations.
