<p id="Par17">To analyze the importance of the plants mentioned in the interviews, we used their frequency of citations and the Smith salience index given by Σ(((
 <italic>Li</italic> − 
 <italic>Rj</italic>)/Li)100)/
 <italic>N</italic>, where 
 <italic>Li</italic> is the size of the free listing, 
 <italic>Rj</italic> is the position (order) of the item in a given free list (
 <italic>Li</italic>), and 
 <italic>N</italic> is the total number of free listings (or the number of interviewees) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. We also considered that the first item of a given list has 
 <italic>Rj</italic> = 0. This index ranges from 0 to 1; species with a value equal to or close to 1 are the species with the highest salience, and species with values close to 0 are the least salient. After assessing the Smith salience index, we calculated if the values differed by chance using a Monte Carlo analysis, following Chaves et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].
