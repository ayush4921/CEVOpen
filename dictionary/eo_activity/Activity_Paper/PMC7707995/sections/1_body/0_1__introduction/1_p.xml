 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is currently classified according to the mode of the emergence of the pathology in familial (10% of cases), also referred as fALS, inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner, and sporadic (90% of cases), also known as sALS, which is not genetically inherited [

Both types of ALS share the most common symptoms, which manifests as muscle weakness, twitching, and cramping, subsequently leading to the impairment of muscles. In the most advanced stages, the symptoms extend to dyspnea, dysphagia, paralysis, and eventual death from respiratory failure within 3 to 5 years after symptom onset [
