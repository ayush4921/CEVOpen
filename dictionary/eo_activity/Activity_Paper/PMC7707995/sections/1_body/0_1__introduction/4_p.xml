<p>Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms and cellular dysfunctions are involved as possible causative factors in the disease. Among these, the following stand out: accumulation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, alterations on RNA processing, glutamate excitotoxicity, apoptosis, protein misfolding and aggregation, autophagy, impaired axonal transport and neurofilament aggregation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Moreover, environmental factors have shown to contribute to the pathogeny, such as alcohol, tobacco, physical activity, chemical exposure and metals, and exposure to radiation [
