<p>Aluminum has been associated with several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ALS; it is suggested that this neurotoxicity may be associated with the fact that aluminum is capable of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

The results revealed that quercetin decreased neuronal apoptosis and decreased the production of free radicals, in addition to obstructing neurodegenerative histological changes induced by aluminum.
