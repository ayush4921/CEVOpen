<p>Zhuang et al. analyzed through mass spectrometry and molecular docking the noncovalent interactions between SOD1 and selected flavonoid compounds, such as quercetin, rutin, naringin, and hesperidin, among others. The study is aimed at identifying which compound has a more prominent capacity to inhibit the aggregation of the apo-SOD1 complex. Through these techniques, the results showed that naringin (26) (
