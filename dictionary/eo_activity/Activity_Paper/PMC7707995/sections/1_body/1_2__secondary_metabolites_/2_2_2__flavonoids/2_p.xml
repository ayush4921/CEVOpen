<p>It is known that processes such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neural apoptosis collaborate with ALS progression; in this sense, Winter et. al. evaluated the effects of strawberry extract enriched with anthocyanin (18) (

The trials showed that at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day, guinea pigs suffered a marked delay of approximately 17 days at the onset of the disease, in addition to an increase in life expectancy of approximately 11 days. Histological analysis exhibited a significant reduction in spinal cord injury when compared to mutant guinea pigs not treated with the extract. For that reason, this study emphasizes that anthocyanins have therapeutic potential for this disease and can evolve to more complex pharmacological tests [
