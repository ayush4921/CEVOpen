<p>A flavonoid known as fisetin (21) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a natural antioxidant, already presented several benefits in some degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Therefore, Wang et al. performed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays on mutant cells (hSOD1G85R and hSOD1G93A) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays with hSOD1 transgenic mice in order to evaluate the efficiency of the compound to SOD1 associated with ALS. Treatment with fisetin improved motor impairment, prolonged life span, and confirmed the neuroprotective antioxidant effects, proposing this flavonoid as a strong drug candidate with therapeutic value for the treatment of ALS [
