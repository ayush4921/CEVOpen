<p>Ginsenosides are saponins found in the medicinal herb 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> that can be classified into three groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) based on structural differences: the protopanaxadiol group (55) (including Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, and Rd), the protopanaxatriol group (56) (as the Re, Rf, Rg1, and Rg2 derivatives), and the Oleanano group (as the Ro variant) (57) [

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Different studies have shown that the components of 
 <italic>Panax L</italic>., especially the ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Re, Rg1, Rg2, and Rg3, have significant therapeutic effects in various neurological disorders such as memory, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, accident stroke, ALS, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Each ginsenoside molecule is potentially effective in the treatment of various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, the biologically active ginsenoside component Rg1 reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytotoxicity by negatively regulating proapoptotic proteins, neutralizing oxidative stress, resulting in neuroprotection of cells treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The ginsenosides present in ginseng have shown the potential to be an excellent compound for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, possibly its neuroprotective effect occurs due to the modulation of neuronal calcium channels. Some studies suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 (58) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), panaxatriol saponin, reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), releases cytochrome c in the cytosol, inhibits caspase3 activity, and lowers nitric oxide production (NO), reducing the level of inducible protein of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in addition to being reported rescue of cellular damage caused by hydrogen peroxide through the negative regulation of the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway, as well as activation of the AKT and ERK1/2 [
