<p>In a model of ALS using a type of lipopolysaccharide-induced rats (LPS), two different doses of madecassoside were tested, 61.1 ± 11.0 and 185.6 ± 18.7 mg/kg/day, respectively. Compared to the control group (mice without madecassoside treatment), madecassoside failed to delay the onset of the disease, but can significantly prolong the mice's survival time by 11.4 and 9.4 days, respectively (

Also, madecassoside inhibits the production of nitric oxide (NO) (a harmless component when present in small quantities, but undesirable when secreted in large quantities), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and additional inflammatory factors in RAW264.7 macrophage cells lipopolysaccharide-induced (LPS) and collagen-induced arthritis in a rat model, which could explain its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect [
