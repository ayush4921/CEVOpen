<p>A preliminary study by Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] with ginseng root showed beneficial effects in an ALS model using SOD1G93A transgenic mice, portraying a delay in disease onset and a prolonged survival rate. This study, combined with the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immunological effects on the CNS reported in the literature, encouraged Ratan et al. [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] to evaluate the effects of the ginsenoside Re (G-Re) (59) (

 <italic>μ</italic>g/g of the compound in symptomatic ALS hSOD1G93A mice. The authors observed that treatment with G-Re reduced the loss of motor neurons and the expression of Iba-1 (ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1), a microglia-specific calcium-binding protein, in the spinal cord of transgenic mice hSOD1G93A, indicating a possible neuroprotective effect. Besides, compared to hSOD1G93A mice of the same age, those treated with G-Re showed a significant reduction in the expression of proinflammatory proteins, like the CD14 protein and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> related to the TLR4 signaling pathway. G-Re administration also led to a decrease in phospho-p38 protein levels related to cell death and had an antioxidant effect by reducing the expression of HO
 <sup>−1</sup>. These results suggest that ginsenoside-Re has a potent antineuroinflammatory effect on ALS, inhibiting the TLR4 pathway.
