<p>Many saponins have been reported for neuroprotection purposes, including madecassoside (52) [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>–
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], ginsenoside (53) [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>–
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], and astragaloside IV (54) [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Saponin's neuroprotection property is not correlated to a single process, but to a spectrum of independent and related processes, which promotes its ability to regenerate the neural network directly promoting cell survival, improving neurite growth, and recovering the activities of axons and synapses. These metabolites can also prevent neuron malfunctions by changing levels of neurotransmitters, receptors, and messengers [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. In this sense, madecassoside (52) is one of the bioactive compounds of the triterpenoid saponins isolated from 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> (L) 
 <italic>Urban</italic>, reported with the potential to protect the degeneration of motor neurons and also increase the longevity of transgenic mice SOD1G93A with ALS [
