<p>A plant of the same genus, 
 <italic>Angelicae gigas</italic>, was evaluated for its antioxidative effect directed to neurodegenerative diseases by Park and collaborators, where the presence of coumarins in this plant has been identified in previous works published by Ryu et al. [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> tests on DPPH and determination of the reducing capacity demonstrated that the ethanol extract showed an EE
 <sub>50</sub> of 31.47 ± 0.68 mg/mL in the elimination of DPPH. The ethanol extract also showed strong antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 43.22 ± 1.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, demonstrating to be more effective in comparison to the aqueous and methanolic extracts, and to the positive control 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol (68.64 ± 5.47 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The initiation and propagation of free radicals in the body can be related to transition metals in which elements such as iron and copper act as powerful catalysts in oxidation reactions. Complementing the tests, metal chelating activity was carried out, which consists of adding different concentrations of the extract, methanol, and FeCl
 <sub>2</sub>. For the ethanolic extract, an accentuated binding capacity with Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> was verified [
