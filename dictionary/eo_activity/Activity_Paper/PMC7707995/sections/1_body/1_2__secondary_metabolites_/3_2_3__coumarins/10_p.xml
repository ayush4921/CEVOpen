 <italic>In vitro</italic> antioxidant activity of these coumarins demonstrated that the elimination of peroxy radicals and the reducing capacity were inferior to the other components of this extract; however, the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) by psoralen was favorable, indicating that this compound can act improving the antioxidant defense mechanism, thus being considered a promising compound for diseases such as ALS [
