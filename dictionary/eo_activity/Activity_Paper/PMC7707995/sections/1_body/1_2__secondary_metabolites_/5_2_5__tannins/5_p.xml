<p>A plant-based multicomponent, called Padma® 28, contains, in addition to other compounds, flavonoids and tannins. It has had its antioxidant activity reported by Ginsburg and collaborators, who also evaluated the neuroprotective activity of the extract in a PC12 neuronal cell strain against the toxins A
 <italic>β</italic>25-35 (10 mM), glutamate (40 mM), MPTB (5 mM), and 3-NP (10 mM). Faced with these neurotoxins, PC12 cells demonstrated reduced mitochondrial dysfunction following Padma 28 treatment, thus decreasing cellular oxidative capacity. The decrease induced by Padma® 28 can be attributed to the direct elimination of reactive oxygen species generated in PC12 cells or by the interference with the generation of hydroxyl radicals [
