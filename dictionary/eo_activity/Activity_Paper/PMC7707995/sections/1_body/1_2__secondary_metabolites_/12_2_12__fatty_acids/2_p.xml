<p>On the other hand, Boumil et al. estimated the impact of omega-3 (

 <italic>Ω</italic>-3 and 
 <italic>Ω</italic>-6 equivalents hastened the pathology and death of motor neurons; however, 10x 
 <italic>Ω</italic>-6 with no change in 
 <italic>Ω</italic>-3 (1 mg/kg) significantly delayed pathology in motor neurons, including preservation of minor motor neuron function during the terminal stage, suggesting that a critical balance of 
 <italic>Ω</italic>-6 and 
 <italic>Ω</italic>-3 may temporarily preserve motor neuron function during the terminal stages of ALS, which could provide a substantial improvement in the quality of life of the affected individuals [
