<p>The lack of studies in the literature performing specific preclinical or clinical tests for ALS and no therapy consolidate to alkaloids despite advantages can be by two main problems, not to easy standardization in batch-to-batch reproducibility and scale-up [

Another possibility is alkaloids-loaded in nanoscale systems to develop new formulation in terms of tissue/organ targeting and BBB penetration as shown in literature [
