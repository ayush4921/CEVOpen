 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When the term “ALS” is added, no articles are found and similar results are observed in other databases (Web of Science, Pubmed, and ScienceDirect). These works always present alkaloids obtained from different sources and evaluate their biocompatibility and antioxidant activity

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The association with ALS always happens in a generalized way because one treatment option to neurodegenerative diseases is using this approach [
