<p>Caffeine is the most studied methylxanthine concerning its effect on neurodegenerative diseases. According to the studies with patients reported above, the consumption of caffeine has shown a protective effect in patients with ALS. On the other hand, there is a lack of evidence on the neuroprotective mechanism of action of this compound, and it is necessary to expand research in this area, using 
 <italic>in silico</italic>, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, not only to elucidate the effect of caffeine on neurodegenerative diseases, but also to investigate new methylxanthines that may show a potential effect on these diseases. So these structures can be explored for the design of new compounds that may be more promising, facilitating the understanding of their possible mechanisms of action.
