<p>Unfortunately, there is still no effective and/or curative treatment for the disease, and the few drugs on the market are intended to only slow the progress of the disease. Among the most promising treatment alternatives, the effectiveness of antioxidants can be highlighted, since the disease is directly related to oxidative stress and cell death. In this context, the relevance of natural products with potential antioxidant action was reported in this review, emphasizing on oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds that are capable of acting in redox balance, attenuating or decreasing the impact of these effects on neuronal and motor cells. Among them, we highlight polyphenols, flavonoids, coumarins, and alkaloids as main metabolites, as well as unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as fatty acids and their esters, which are part of the diet worldwide and are considered promising alternatives. The mechanisms of action associated with the activity of these metabolites are not yet entirely elucidated, but researches point out that natural products capable of regulating redox effects are fundamental for cellular processes, maintaining an appropriate environment for metabolic activities and healthy functioning, as they present, in some cases, low collateral effects and multiple targets. Nevertheless, there are still few studies related to toxic effects, mechanisms of action, and strategies of molecular modifications using these prototypes through total synthesis or semisynthesis, which could lead to further preclinical and clinical trials, and eventual obtainment of safe and effective compounds that can improve the ALS patient's outcome.</p>
