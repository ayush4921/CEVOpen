 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic>, with a rich content on β-glucan polysaccharides, have exhibited wound healing acceleration in experimental rats (

 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> freeze-dried fruiting bodies reduced ulceration as pre-treatment (250 and 500 mg/kg b.w.) in ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats (

 <italic>Sparassis crispa</italic> (&gt;40% β-glucans) at a dose of 1.000 mg/kg b.w. per day, for 4 weeks, significantly accelerated the wound closure through increasing the collagen regeneration, macrophage and fibroblast migration, and wounds epithelialization in STZ-induced diabetic rats (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). The receptors of β-glucans are present in human dermal fibroblasts making these can receive direct signals from glucans promoting wound healing not only by activating macrophages, but also by stimulating fibroblasts (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Kougias et al., 2001</xref>). After β-glucan stimulation, fibroblasts activate two translation factors, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and specific protein-1 (SP-1), and two signaling pathways, NF-κB and nuclear factor-1 (NF-1), to enhance the immune response, hyperplasia and the expression of collagen precursor genes (
