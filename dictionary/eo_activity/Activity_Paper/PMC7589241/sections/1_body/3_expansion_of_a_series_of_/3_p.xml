<p>The products of six reactions displayed antibacterial activity against both replicate cultures: substrate 
 <bold>D1</bold> with co‐substrates 
 <bold>E1</bold> or 
 <bold>E18</bold>; substrate 
 <bold>D7</bold> with co‐substrate 
 <bold>E18</bold>; and substrate 
 <bold>D10</bold> with co‐substrates 
 <bold>E1</bold>, 
 <bold>E6</bold> or 
 <bold>E18</bold>. The combination of 
 <bold>D1</bold> and 
 <bold>E1</bold> had previously been validated during the establishment of the ADS protocols, and therefore the remaining five reactions were scaled up and the products isolated, structurally elucidated and characterised. In each case, quinazolinones products were identified (e. g., 
 <bold>12</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>) which had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 0.016–1 μg/mL (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c and d). The study demonstrated that ADS could enable efficient expansion of the SAR of a series of antibacterials and enabled key features for antibacterial activity to be identified. At the 2‐position of the quinazolinone, a two‐atom linker to a hydrophobic substituent was essential and conformational restriction could be tolerated. At the 3‐position of the quinazolinone, a phenyl ring bearing a 
 <italic>meta</italic> hydrogen donor substituent was required. The study additionally demonstrated the feasibility of ADS with a phenotypic assay and alternative underpinning chemistry.
