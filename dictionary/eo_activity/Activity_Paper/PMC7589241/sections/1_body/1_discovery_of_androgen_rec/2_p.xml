<p>In round 1, twelve α‐diazo amides (
 <bold>A1</bold>–
 <bold>A12</bold>) were harnessed that each incorporated a fragment (4‐cyano‐3‐trifluoromethyl‐phenyl) found in known AR ligands as well as a variable R’ group. It was envisaged that several different cyclisation pathways might be possible to yield products based on alternative scaffolds (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In the reaction array, all combinations of the twelve substrates (
 <bold>A1</bold>–
 <bold>A12</bold>) and three dirhodium catalysts (1 mol%) were investigated in a single solvent (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>; Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, left). The crude products were scavenged to remove metals, evaporated, and screened for agonism of the AR using a FRET‐based assay (total product concentration: 10 μM in 1 % DMSO in pH 7.5 buffer). Four substrates (
 <bold>A1</bold>, 
 <bold>A3</bold>, 
 <bold>A6</bold>, and 
 <bold>A7</bold>), in combination with Rh
 <sub>2</sub>(OAc)
 <sub>4</sub>, resulted in product mixtures with significant activity, and these combinations informed the design of a second reaction array.
