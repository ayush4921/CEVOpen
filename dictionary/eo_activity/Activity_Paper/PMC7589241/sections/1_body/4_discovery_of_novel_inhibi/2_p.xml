<p>An initial array of 154 reactions was performed using seven diazo substrates (
 <bold>F1</bold>–
 <bold>F7</bold>), ten co‐substrates (
 <bold>G1</bold>–
 <bold>G10</bold>; plus no co‐substrate) and two dirhodium catalysts. The diazo substrates and co‐substrates were designed to include substituents, such as phenyl, chlorophenyl and branched/cyclic/fluorinated alkyl groups, that may mimic hot spot residues of p53 peptide. Many of these groups are found in known p53/
