<p>The discovery of bioactive small molecules is an enduring challenge in both medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Lead generation is generally driven by iterative cycles in which series of molecules are designed, synthesised, purified and tested.
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Established lead generation approaches tend be both time‐ and resource‐intensive, in part because a similar investment is made in all molecules, irrespective of their ultimate biological activity. Although automation is widely harnessed within the individual stages of discovery workflows,
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> it is rare for adjacent stages to be integrated, and for all activities (particularly purification) to be performed in parallel and with matched throughput. Moreover, a limited reaction toolkit dominates molecular discovery,
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> which has led to an uneven exploration of chemical space and has tended to focus attention on molecules with suboptimal properties.
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Molecular design hypotheses are typically investigated one‐by‐one, focusing on individual series of closely related molecules that may be prepared using a specific reaction drawn from the standard toolkit. How, then, might diverse chemical space be explored more efficiently to drive the discovery of both drugs and chemical probes?
