  <p>Activity‐directed discovery of AR modulators based on scaffolds with no previously annotated activity against AR. a) Potential cyclisation pathways of diazo substrates 
   <bold>A1</bold>–
   <bold>A12</bold>. b) Activities of crude product mixtures formed in reaction arrays in rounds 1 (left), 2 (middle) and 3 (right), relative to 5 μM testosterone; hit reactions are highlighted (yellow boxes). c) Reactions discovered that yield AR modulators.
