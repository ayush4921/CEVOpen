<p id="Par29">Here, the toxicity of diniconazole fungicide as well as preventive efficiency of CME to alleviate dinoconazole-induced damages were investigated in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots. Data obtained from the current study clearly demonstrated the detrimental potential of the fungicide in terms of physiological, cytogenetic and biochemical events as well as the fungicide-related damages in meristematic cells. MDA accumulation and reduction of the SOD and CAT activities as well as thickening of the cell wall following diniconazole treatment were reported for the first time in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> in the present study. The destructive effects of diniconazole were substantially prevented by the addition of CME to the fungicide. The present work is the first report that revealed the therapeutic and protective efficacy of CME against diniconazole. The fact that the groups only administered CME showed similar results to those of the control revealed that the extract had no side effects. 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> has been shown to be a promising model for studies focusing on the toxic power of fungicides as well as the healing effects of medicinal plants. Doseâ€“effect relationship between CME and its therapeutic capacity was stunning considering all parameters investigated. 
 <italic>C. mas</italic> fruits should be moved to the upper steps in daily nutrition thanks to the antioxidants they contain. The protective functions of these laudable fruits should be investigated against other toxic substances.
