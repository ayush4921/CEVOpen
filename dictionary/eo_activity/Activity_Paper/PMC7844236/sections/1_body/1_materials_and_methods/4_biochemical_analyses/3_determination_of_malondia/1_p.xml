 </sup> was chosen to identify the lipid peroxidation expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) level. 5% trichloroacetic acid used to homogenize 0.5 g of chipped root sample. The homogenization process was completed at room temperature using mortar and pestle until the roots became powdered. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature, the same volume of supernatant added to a mixture of 20% trichloroacetic acid and 0.5% thiobarbituric acid. Freshly prepared mixture was heated at 95 °C for half an hour. The reaction occurred at high temperature was terminated by transferring the mixture to the ice bath. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, the absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at 532 nm. The average MDA amounts of the groups were calculated utilizing the specific extinction coefficient (155 M
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and presented as μM per g fresh weight.
