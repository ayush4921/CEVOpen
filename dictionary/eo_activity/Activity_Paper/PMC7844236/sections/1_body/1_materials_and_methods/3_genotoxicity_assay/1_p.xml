 </sup>. 1 cm long pieces were cut from the root tips and fixed with glacial acetic acid:ethanol (3:1) solution. The root tips were washed with ethanol (96%) after 2 h of fixation. 70% ethanol was used to store the fixed roots in a refrigerator at + 4 °C. The hydrolysis procedure was completed by keeping the samples in a 1 N HCl solution at 60 °C immediately after removing the root materials from the refrigerator. 2 mm long root tips were stained with 1% acetocarmine for 24 h in a clean flask and crushed in 45% acetic acid to prepare microscope slides. Genotoxicity tests were performed on 10 slides screened with a research microscope at 1000 × magnification for each group. 1000 cells from 10 slides were examined to determine CAs and MN in each group and MN was evaluated according to the rules specified by Fenech et al.
