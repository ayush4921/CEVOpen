<p id="Par6">Scientists from all over the world use various model organisms in order to test chemicals which are potentially toxic to untargeted organisms. 
 <italic>Allium cepa </italic> L., a test material approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, the United Nations Environmental Programme and the World Health Organization, is a simple model used to assess the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of risky pollutants
