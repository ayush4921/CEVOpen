 </sup>. In addition, there is a lack of studies in the literature on the potential use of Cornelian cherry against the harmful effects of environmental pollutants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of diniconazole application besides the preventive efficiency of Cornelian cherry in diniconazole-treated 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots. For this purpose, some physiological, cytogenetic and biochemical parameters including germination percentage, root elongation, weight gain, CAs incidence, MN formation, mitotic index (MI) fluctuation, lipid peroxidation and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities were analyzed. Furthermore, meristematic destructions caused by the application of diniconazole were observed.
