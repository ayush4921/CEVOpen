<p id="Par28">Effects of diniconazole and CME administrations on meristematic cells of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots were checked microscopically. The appearance of the meristematic cells of the control group in cross-section was accepted as “normal” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–d). In the meristematic cells of the CME treated groups (Groups 2 and 3), no damage was observed similar to the control group. On the other hand, damage levels observed in other groups were classified as “little”, “moderate” and “severe”. From this view of point, diniconazole caused a great damage to meristematic cells that the damage has been described as "severe" (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The damages observed following diniconazole application in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> root meristematic cells were indistinct transmission tissue, epidermis cell deformation, thickening of the cortex cell wall and flattened cell nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e–h). Epidermis deformation occurred probably due to squeezing of the cells forming outer layer of the roots in order to prevent the intake of diniconazole. Thickening of the cortex cell walls may be attributed to a strategy to reduce horizontal transport of the fungicide. In addition to its genotoxic effects within the nucleus, diniconazole caused the cell nucleus to show deformity. The structural integrity loss in transmission tissue may hinder the transfer of water and nutrients between the roots and the upper parts. This situation indicates that exposure to overdoses of dinconazole can be very risky for the vital activities of plants. Anatomical changes in meristematic cells may also be related to ROS, which attacks the structural components of cells and tissues and occurs due to exposure to diniconazole. Our results were in line with Demirtaş et al.

 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots. In addition, Barnes et al.

 <italic>Zea mays</italic> and 
 <italic>Glycine max</italic>. Similarly, paclobutrazol induced distinct anatomical alterations in stem, leaf and roots of

 </sup>. 0.5 g/L CME lightened all malformations to “moderate” level in Group 5 and the intensity of the meristematic damages switched to “little” in Group 6 in which CME dose was increased to1.0 g/L. To the best of our knowledge, the restorative effect of CME in meristematic cells exposed to toxic materials has been reported for the first time in the literature. The healing role of CME in meristematic cells may be related to antioxidant wealth of 
 <italic>C. mas</italic> fruits, which are highly effective in reducing potentially dangerous ROS for cells and tissues.
