<p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus which causes AIDS-like symptoms in domestic and wild cats and hyenas. The genome size of FIV is approximately 9400 base pairs, including 
 <italic>pol</italic>, 
 <italic>gag</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes. These genes are responsible for expressing three major functions of FIV proteins, which are virion structural proteins, reverse transcriptase, and viral envelope glycoprotein, respectively [

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. FIV infects T-cells, monocytes, macrophages, and neural cells by binding to the CD134 receptor and CXCR4 coreceptor. After viral entry, its single-stranded RNA genome is converted into proviral double-stranded DNA by FIV reverse transcriptase (FIV-RT) enzyme before integrating into the host genome [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, FIV-RT is a core enzyme in viral replication and infection. Treatment of FIV-infected cats could be performed by inhibiting FIV-RT, for example, the use of nucleotide analog or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [
