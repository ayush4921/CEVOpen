<p>A two-fold serial dilution of the mushroom crude extract was performed and was then used as an inhibitor in IC
 <sub>50</sub> assays. The 2 μL of each two-fold diluted mushroom extract was mixed with 13 μL RT reaction buffer in a 384-well plate. Then, 5 μL of 50 nM purified recombinant wild-type FIV-RT was added into each well. The reaction was started by adding 5 μL of 1:400 primer/template. The reaction was incubated, stopped and the fluorescence intensity was measured as previously described. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated from the non-linear regression dose–response curve generated by the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of EFV against FIV-RT was also determined.
