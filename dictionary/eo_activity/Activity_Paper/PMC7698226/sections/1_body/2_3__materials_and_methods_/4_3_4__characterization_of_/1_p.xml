<p>The green synthesized AgNPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), used to investigate the crystalline structure of AgNPs. XRD was recorded in the 2θ range (30–80) using XRD6000 (Shimadzu). A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to determine the size and shape of AgNPs. The grid was left to dry overnight at room temperature before TEM analysis. The presence of functional groups in

 <sup>−1</sup>. The morphology of AgNPs was examined using FESEM, and the presence of silver was confirmed by EDX. The average size of AgNPs and their stability was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) according to the methods previously reported [
