<p>In this study, synthesized AgNPs from the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. exhibited significant antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The maximum zone of inhibition for synthesized AgNPs was observed in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (10 ± 1.5 mm), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (12 ± 2.5 mm), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (8 ± 1.0 mm), and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (14 ± 1.7 mm), respectively, with concentrations of 20 µg/mL. The zone of inhibition results confirmed that the synthesized AgNPs exhibited significant antibacterial activity as compared with aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. as well as AgNO

The results suggested that plant-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles is capable of producing AgNPs with capability of interaction with the negatively charged surface of the bacterial cell membrane, that thereby inhibits bacterial growth. Hence, plant-synthesized AgNPs could be used as an alternative source of antibiotics against microbial pathogens [
