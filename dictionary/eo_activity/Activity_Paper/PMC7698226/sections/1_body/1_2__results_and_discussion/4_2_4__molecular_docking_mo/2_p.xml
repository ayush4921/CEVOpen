<p>The binding mode and interactions of plumbagin with D7 salivary protein of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and OBP of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> were examined by molecular docking studies. The mosquito D7 salivary proteins are known to be functionally related to the superfamily of arthropod odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). In recent times, the mosquito salivary glands have been explored for identifying the key proteins that facilitate blood-feeding and can be considered potential targets for malaria transmission-blocking interventions. The results showed that plumbagin exhibited a docking score of −6.71 (kcal/mol) and inhibitory constant of 12.1 uM against D7 protein of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which were relatively higher than the docking score and inhibitory constant obtained for co-crystal ligand epinephrine (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01577-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b). Similarly, molecular docking of plumbagin with OBP showed that it exhibited a docking score of −7.48 (kcal/mol) and an inhibitory constant of 3.31 uM (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01577-f007">Figure 7</xref>d). Collectively, the docking results suggest that plumbagin possesses a relatively higher binding affinity towards the D7 salivary protein of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and a comparable binding affinity towards OBP of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The outcome of these results suggests that plumbagin, from 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam., can be developed into a potent antimalarial and antifilarial compound in the treatment of several vector-borne diseases.
