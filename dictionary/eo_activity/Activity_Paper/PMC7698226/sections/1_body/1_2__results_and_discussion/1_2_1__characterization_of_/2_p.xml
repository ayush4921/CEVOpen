<p>FTIR analysis was carried out to identify the possible reducing and capping biomolecules in the synthesized AgNPs. The spectra of AgNPs revealed strong bands at 3381 (due to primary amines), 2916 (C-H stretching of the alkanes), 2848 (C-H-O stretching of aldehyde), 1607 (N-H bend of primary amines), and 1207 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-N stretching of aliphatic amines) [

 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to the presence of stretching vibrations of alcohol, ethers, esters, carboxylic acids, and amino acids [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and 1034 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-O stretching of alcohol), which is related to the secondary metabolites present in the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Plumbago auriculata</italic> Lam. The spectral data also confirmed the presence of proteins by amine or amide I band at the region of 1607 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (

 <italic>Caesalpinia pulcherrima</italic> [

 <italic>Cacumen platyclade</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], where AgNPs were synthesized in the plant extracts. It has been also reported that the presence of secondary metabolites helps in maintaining the stability of AgNPs and also prevents aggregation [
