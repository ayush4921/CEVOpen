<p>In addition to extracting secondary metabolites from plants and microorganisms, another strategy to produce new compounds with antibacterial properties is via synthesis. Ferrera-Suanzes et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported a synthetic approach to obtain degraded analogs of limonoids, which is a group of plant secondary metabolites with several members that show antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. This scheme would allow synthesizing molecules with simple structures while preserving the desired properties of limonoids. The research group produced six compounds, and then tested the antimicrobial activities of their stereoisomer mixtures against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and its methicillin-resistant strain [
