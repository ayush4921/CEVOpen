<p>The majority of natural products are produced from plants, and one of the largest groups of plant-derived products is flavonoids, as more than 13,000 plant flavonoids have been isolated and identified [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These plant-derived compounds have remarkable pharmaceutical and medical applications, particularly in preventing diseases. Among plant flavonoids, pectolinarin and its aglycone, pectolinarigenin, are identified as the major constituents in many medicinal herbs around the world. A review on the isolation, pharmacological aspects and therapeutic potential of these two flavonoids was written by Cheriet et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], providing a comprehensive summary of our understanding of these secondary metabolites. Another widely distributed group of products in the plant kingdom is that of stilbenoids. Mattio et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reviewed recent achievements in the study of resveratrol and other natural stilbenoids as antimicrobial agents. The authors provided a thorough overview of the sources, chemical structures (particularly structural modifications), and the mechanism of action of stilbenoids.
