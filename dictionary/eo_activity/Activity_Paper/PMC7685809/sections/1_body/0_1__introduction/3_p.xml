 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> fungus is a precious edible and medicinal fungus and has a long history as a traditional medicinal plant in China and other countries. It is reported that 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> has many biological functions, including antioxidant, antimitotic, and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In particular, 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> polysaccharide (IOP) extracted from 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> fungus can be used to treat and prevent various diseases such as cancer [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], diabetes [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], pancreatitis [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], high lipidemia [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], colitis [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and Alzheimer's disease [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the effect of IOP on osteosarcoma and its possible mechanism are still poorly understood. This study is to investigate the effect of IOP on the proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells and its associated molecular mechanism, so as to provide a basis for the application of IOP in the treatment of osteosarcoma.
