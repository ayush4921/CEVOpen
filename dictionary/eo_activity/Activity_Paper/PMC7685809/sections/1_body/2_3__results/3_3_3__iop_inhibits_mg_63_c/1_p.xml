<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, after adding IOP to MG-63 cells and U2OS cells at different concentrations (80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) compared with the control group, the migration activity of the cells was significantly reduced in the 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). It is apparent that this inhibition on the MG-63 cells and U2OS cell migration by the treatment of IOP was in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, this result indicates that IOP can inhibit the migration of osteosarcoma cells.
