<p>Further studies suggested that IOP can also inhibit the activation of the Akt/mTOR and NF-
 <italic>Îº</italic>B signaling pathway in osteosarcoma cells. Akt, also known as PKB (protein kinase B), is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that can be activated by PI3K at Thr308 and Ser473 sites. Activated Akt can activate the mTOR pathway in a variety of ways. And mTOR is an important serine-threonine protein kinase downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway which can regulate the malignant biological process of tumor cells by activating ribosomal kinase [
