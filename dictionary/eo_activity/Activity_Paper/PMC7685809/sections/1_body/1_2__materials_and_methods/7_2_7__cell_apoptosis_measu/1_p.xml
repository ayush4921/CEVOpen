<p>MG-63 cells and U2OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and cultured overnight. The cells were treated with different concentrations of IOP for 24 h. Cells were then collected, washed with PBS, and double-stained using Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit. Finally, flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell apoptotic rate.
