<p>Cell migration experiments were carried out using scratch experiments. Specifically, MG-63 cells and U2OS cells were seeded on 6-well plates, cultured overnight, and then treated with different concentrations of IOP for 24 h. After that, scratch the cell layer with a sterile plastic pipette tip to form a scratch. The detached cells were rinsed off with PBS. After that, the DMEM medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum was added, the cells were cultured for 24 h, photos were taken, and the cell migration rate was calculated accordingly.</p>
