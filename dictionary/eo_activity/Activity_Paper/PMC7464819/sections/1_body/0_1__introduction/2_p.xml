<p>Despite the fact that vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> can be formed by the conversion of its precursors in the skin upon sunlight exposure, the above-reported studies document that this process is not sufficient to ensure appropriate levels of this vitamin. Moreover, the intake of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> from animal-based foods is not a proper solution because the current food systems, which are highly dependent on animal-based food sources, are not sustainable from an environmental point of view but also from a health and food security perspective [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, one strategy to overcome the global demand of vitamin D in a sustainable way is to produce this vitamin from mushroom irradiation. This way, vitamin D can be delivered through fortified foods [

 <sub>2</sub> in mushrooms is generally low. However, mushrooms have high amounts of the vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> precursor, i.e., ergosterol. Processes that generate vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> from ergosterol have been developed by UV irradiation on either the fresh or dried fruit body [

 <sub>2</sub> generation by combining supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction with dissolution of the extract in ethanol or methanol followed by UV irradiation [

 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp. are among the basidiomycetes that can be used for vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> generation because their cultivation can be performed on various agri-food waste at a low cost [
