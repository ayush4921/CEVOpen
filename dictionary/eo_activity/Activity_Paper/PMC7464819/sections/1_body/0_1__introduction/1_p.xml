<p>Deficient and inadequate vitamin D intake (vitamin D represents both D
 <sub>2</sub> and D
 <sub>3</sub> forms) is a worldwide public health issue causing both skeletal diseases and increased risk of various chronic diseases [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sources of vitamin D for humans are sunlight exposure, yielding vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub>; a few foods of animal origin providing vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub>; and yeasts and mushrooms, providing vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub>. Both vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> and D
 <sub>3</sub> are metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidneys to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). According to the serum concentration of 25(OH)D, vitamin D status is defined as deficient when serum 25(OH)D is lower than 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL) and insufficient when serum 25(OH)D is between 25 and 50 nmol/L (10–20 ng/mL). Vitamin D status can also be assessed by validated food questionnaires [
