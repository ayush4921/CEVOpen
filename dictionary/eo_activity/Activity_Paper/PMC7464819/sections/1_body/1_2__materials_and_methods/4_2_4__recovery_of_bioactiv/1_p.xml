<p>Mushroom powders of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> were extracted in triplicate with cold water (0.25 g into 5 mL) for 24 h at 4 째C under magnetic stirring. Then, the mixtures were centrifuged (Centrikon T-42K, Kontron, Instruments, Milan, Italy) at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 20 째C and the supernatant was used for further characterization [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The ethanol-insoluble fractions were obtained by adding 8.3 mL of 96% ethanol to 2 mL of the water extracts. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation (Centrikon T-42K) at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 20 째C and redissolved in water for further characterization [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The yield of water-soluble extracts and ethanol-insoluble precipitates was determined by measuring the weight of dry solids after drying in a vacuum oven at 70 째C and 50 Torr for 18 h.
