 <italic>H. pylori</italic> causes inflammatory gastritis and has been considered a major contributor to the etiology of peptic ulcer disease, due to its virulence factors such as flagellin, urease, CagA and VacA. VacA is an exotoxin that induces in the epithelial cell the formation of intracytoplasmic vacuoles and the destruction of mitochondria with cytochrome C (Cit C) release and cell death by apoptosis. Cag A is highly immunogenic and induces a strong inflammatory response. Urease is associated with adaptation and flagellin with adhesion of microorganism [
