<p>In addition to the acute ulcer induction models, there are the chronic ulcer models, such as those induced by acetic acids. The lesions produced by acetic acid are like human ulcers in terms of location, severity, chronicity, and the healing process [

 <sub>2</sub>, NO, growth factors, and cytokines, as well as changes in the microcirculation and the mucus adhesion pattern [

 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] showed antiulcerogenic and healing activity in this model; it can be inferred that flavonoids were able to accelerate the healing of ulcers, thereby being an important mechanism to reduce disease recurrences.
