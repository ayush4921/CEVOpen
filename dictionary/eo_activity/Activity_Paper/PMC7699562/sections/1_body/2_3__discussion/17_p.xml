<p>NO is important in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa since it is involved in cytoprotection, stimulating mucus and bicarbonate secretion, increasing the blood flow, and angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B182-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. NO is synthesized by three different forms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which are iNOS, neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial (eNOS) synthase. nNOS and eNOS synthase contribute to the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract, since inhibition of these enzymes results in disorders of motility, blood flow and acid secretion. Under certain pathological conditions, iNOS produces relatively large amounts of NO contributing to mucosal damage and inflammatory process [
