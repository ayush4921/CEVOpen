<p>In addition, the direct contact of ethanol in the gastric mucosa results in the infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, which are important releasers of ROS, increasing the production of pro-oxidative substances and pro-inflammatory molecules [

 <xref rid="B154-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 play important roles in the formation of gastric ulcers [

Ethanol is also capable of decreasing the levels of NO, which is an important mediator of physiological processes of the gastric mucosa, such as the maintenance of blood flow, thus leading to the development of hemorrhagic lesions and consequently solubilization of gastric mucus [
