<p>Several studies show a positive correlation between the severity of gastric ulcer and the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), associated with a reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), influencing inflammatory scores [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] modulate these molecules. Thus, these flavonoids can reduce the inflammatory process associated with ulcerative lesions, reducing the severity of the disease.
