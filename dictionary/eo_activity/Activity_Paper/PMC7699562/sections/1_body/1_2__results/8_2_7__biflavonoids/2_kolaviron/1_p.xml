 <xref rid="B137-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Kolaviron (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o., rat) showed a potential gastroprotective activity in different experimental models of peptic ulcer: immobilization and cold stress, NSAIDs, ethanol, pyloric ligation, and ischemia-reperfusion. This activity was related to antioxidant, cytoprotective, and antisecretory effects, with reduced levels of MDA, increased levels of NO, and gastric mucus. In addition, it had an inhibitory effect on H
