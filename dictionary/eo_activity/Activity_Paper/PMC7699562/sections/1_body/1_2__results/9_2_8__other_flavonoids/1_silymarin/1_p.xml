<p>Silymarin, a phytocomplex extracted from the medicinal plant 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> (“milk thistle”), is widely known for its hepatoprotective functions [

This gastroprotective effect (50 mg/kg, p.o., rat) is mediated by suppression of gastric inflammation with reduced MPO activity, levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and expression of NF-κB. It involves antioxidant and cytoprotective defense mechanisms by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increasing the activity of the enzymes, GPx and SOD, as well of Nfr
