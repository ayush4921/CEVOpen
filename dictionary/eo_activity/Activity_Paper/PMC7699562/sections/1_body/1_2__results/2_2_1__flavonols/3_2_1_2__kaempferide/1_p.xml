 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f002">Figure 2</xref>) is an O-methylated flavonol derivative of kaempferol. This compound isolated from green propolis prevented the ulcer induced by HCl/ethanol intraperitoneally and indomethacin by oral route (3 mg/kg), using carbenoxolone as a positive control (200 mg/kg, p.o.), as well as the ulcer induced by pylorus ligature (positive control, omeprazole 20 mg/kg, p.o.) in mice. Gastroprotection was accompanied by normalization of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities and reduced MPO activity. In addition, it increased the gastric mucin content and decreased the volume, pH, total acidity and pepsin activity of the gastric juice [
