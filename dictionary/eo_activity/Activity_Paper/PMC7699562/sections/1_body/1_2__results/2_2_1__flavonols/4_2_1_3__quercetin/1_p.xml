<p>Quercetin (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxychromen-4-one) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f002">Figure 2</xref>) is a flavonol found mainly in fruits and vegetables such as onions, broccoli, apple, cherry and grape and has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, vasodilatory, anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-tumor and antiviral effects [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Over the years, many researchers have studied the gastroprotective potential of quercetin in vivo [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The gastroprotective properties of nano-quercetin (2.5 mg) in vivo were evaluated in the ethanol-induced ulcer model in rats. The results obtained suggest a blockage of the synthesis and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP)-9, as well as, of the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oxidative damage. Besides, the quercetin regulates apoptosis and the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) [

Quercetin (50 mg/kg, p.o., rats) and the standard drug famotidine (50 mg/kg), inhibitor of H₂-type histamine receptors, showed a gastroprotective effect on indomethacin-induced acute gastric ulcers; this effect is related to its antioxidant potential (increased activity of antioxidant enzymes) [

Quercetin protects the gastric mucosa of rats (50 or 100 mg/kg, p.o) and Caco-2 cells (0.0331 mMol/L) against oxidative stress and inflammation induced by indomethacin, involving increased nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor related to erythroid 2 (Nrf
 <sub>2</sub>), as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Quercetin also prevented indomethacin-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and ICAM-1 and P-selectin expression [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. With its gastroprotective potential already proven in previous studies, the effect on 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> in vitro (0.212–0.423 mMol/L) and in vivo (25 mg/kg) of quercetin was investigated, showing promising results, involving the reduction in the levels of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) when compared with untreated mice [
