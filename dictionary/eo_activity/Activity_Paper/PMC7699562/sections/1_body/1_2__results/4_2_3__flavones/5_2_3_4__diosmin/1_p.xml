<p>Diosmin (synonym 3,5,7-trihydroxy-4-methoxyflavone 7-rutinoside or diosmetin 7-rutinoside) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f004">Figure 4</xref>) is a natural flavonoid glycoside obtained from different plant species constituted by a flavone named diosmetin, a unit of glucose and a unit of rhamnose. Diosmin exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, attenuating liver, kidney, and heart damage in experimental models [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Diosmin showed gastroprotection (100 mg/kg, p.o.) against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats, suppressed gastric inflammation, reducing TNF-Î± and NF-kB expression and restored levels of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10). It interrupted gastric oxidative stress through the inhibition of lipid peroxides with a reduction in the activity of MPO and a concomitant increase in GSH, GPx, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). These actions were associated with positive regulation of gastric cytoprotective PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and NO. Regarding apoptosis of the gastric mucosa, it suppressed the activity of caspase-3 and cytochrome C (Cit
 <sub>C</sub>) with B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) enhancement [
