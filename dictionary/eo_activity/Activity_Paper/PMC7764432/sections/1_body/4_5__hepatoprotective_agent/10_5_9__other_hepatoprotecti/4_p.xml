<p>Ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Salix subserrata</italic> has shown significant hepatoprotective activity in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver toxicity [
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] by decreasing serum enzymes levels and reversing hepatic tissue damage caused by CCl
 <sub>4</sub>. Studies have shown that the hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic 
 <italic>Pandanus odoratissimus</italic> roots extracts in PCM-induced hepatotoxicity in rats resulted in a substantial decrease in the higher levels of serum marker enzymes [

 <italic>Alocasia indica,</italic> commonly cultivated especially in West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, and Southern India, has been assessed for hepatoprotective activity in CCL
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatic injury in male Albino Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. It has been reported that the antioxidant activity of this plant has the potential for designing drugs for liver diseases. 
 <italic>Opuntia ficus-indica,</italic> another plant, is a cactus species that are commonly distributed in the arid and semiarid parts of the world and is believed to have originated from Mexico. Aqueous extract (2 mL/kg) from the cactus leaves (cladodes) has shown potent hepatoprotective activity in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced toxicity in Wistar male rats by decreasing AST and ALT levels [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The use of these natural phytoagents or nutraceuticals alone or in combination may protect the liver and modulates coronavirus infection, and provide recommendations for further study.
