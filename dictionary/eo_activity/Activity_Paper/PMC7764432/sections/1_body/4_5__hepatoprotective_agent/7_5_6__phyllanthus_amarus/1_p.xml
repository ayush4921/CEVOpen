 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic> is a small plant and is commonly found in tropical regions and is used in many traditional medicines due to its diverse pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Lignan phyllanthin, one of its essential bioactive constituents, has shown very potent activity as a hepatoprotective agent [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Histopathological analysis revealed that ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> attenuates the generation of intracellular ROS by enhancing the antioxidant levels against aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Furthermore, an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> has been shown to inhibit HBV DNA polymerase activity as seen in in vitro experimental conditions, suggesting its potential use for viral infections in the liver [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>P. muellarianus</italic>, displayed the presence of several bioactive ingredients such as furosin, isoquercetin, phaselic acid, corilagin, nitidine, geranin, and gallic acid [

 <xref rid="B124-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Aqueous extract of the 
 <italic>P. muellarianus</italic> leaf has shown hepatoprotective activity against damage induced by p-acetaminophen in swiss albino mice [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. It was observed that extract (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) significantly attenuated acetaminophen-mediated alterations in ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), AST, albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TB). Gallic acid, a well-known antioxidant agent, was documented to reverse AST, ALT, and ALP in acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity [
