<p>As previously discussed, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for entry into the host cells, where the lung is the main target for infection. Reports from RNA-seq analysis have confirmed the expression of the ACE2 receptor in the liver. Studies have shown the expression of ACE2 receptor on liver tissues [

Moreover, mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, glycogen degradation, and damaged cell membranes are demonstrated by electron microscopy. These microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics co-occur with the SARS-CoV-2â€™s cytopathic influence on hepatocytes, suggesting its role for the viral replication within liver cells [
