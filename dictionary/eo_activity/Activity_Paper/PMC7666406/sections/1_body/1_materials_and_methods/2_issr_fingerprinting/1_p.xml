<p id="Par6">ISSR fingerprinting was done according to Wu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005</xref>), with minor modifications. Twenty-two ISSR primers were screened against 18 populations, taking two individuals randomly from each population. The PCR reaction was set in a 10 μl reaction volume using 20 ng of template DNA. The PCR reaction mixture contains 10× reaction buffer—1 μl, 2.5 mM dNTPs—0.6 μl, 10 mM primers—2 μl, template DNA—20 ng, Taq DNA polymerase (1 U/μl)—0.5 μl and nuclease-free water—to make the final volume 10 μl. The PCR profile used include initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension of 72° for 10 min. After PCR, the amplified products were resolved in 1.3% agarose gel and photograph was taken in a gel doc for scoring. Low Range DNA Ruler Plus (Genie, Cat. No. 2662770501730) was used to determine the fragments sizes for scoring. To create a binary matrix, amplified fragments of 100 to 1200 bp were scored visually from printed gel photos as having present (1), absent (0), or ambiguous (?). Only distinct bands were scored as present, and the manual scoring procedure was repeated twice on separate occasions to reduce scoring errors.
