<p id="Par9">Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed based on Nei’s minimum distance matrix (Nei 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1978</xref>) in GenAlEx v 6.5. Population structure was determined using the program STRUCTURE v 2.3.3 (Falush et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>) which statistically determines the probability of an individual to be included in a homogenous cluster (
 <italic>K</italic> populations) without prior population information. The correlated band frequencies and admixed model were applied with a burn-in-period of 100,000 and 1,000,000 MCMC replicates after burn-in. The range of clusters (
 <italic>K</italic>) was given from 1 to 18. From 
 <italic>K</italic> = 1 to 
 <italic>K</italic> = 10, ten runs were performed, whereas for 
 <italic>K</italic> &gt; 10, five runs were performed. The detection of the most-likely 
 <italic>K</italic> was done according to Evanno et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>), which uses LnP(D) to get information about most probable number of groups and calculate height of the modal value of the ∆
 <italic>K</italic> distribution to detect the most-likely 
 <italic>K</italic> (Evanno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>).
