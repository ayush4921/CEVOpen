<p id="Par14">The 18 populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. in the present study showed high and significant genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.3894, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Gst = 0.4324). However, the estimated gene flow, Nm (Nm = 0.5(1 − Gst)/Gst), was found to be 0.6564 which suggests that although the genetic differentiation among studied populations is significant, there may be low migration rate among populations. We also calculated genetic differentiation and gene flow for the four groups separately (based on UPGMA tree, PCoA and STRUCTURE analysis results) and found that Gst, among all South-Eastern populations, was 0.0715 and Nm was 6.4974. Similarly, Gst among North-Western population was 0.0825 and Nm was 5.5591. The Gst among North-Eastern and South-Western populations was 0.0764 and 0.0586 with Nm value of 6.0474 and 8.0384 respectively. These results indicate weak genetic differentiation and frequent gene flow within the genotypes of all the regions. When the North-Western and North-Eastern populations were pooled together, the Gst value among population was 0.3263 and Nm was 1.0324 which indicates that there is significant genetic differentiation among the populations of North-Eastern and North-Western regions and that the gene flow is restricted. We also pooled the South-Eastern and South-Western populations together and calculated their respective Gst and Nm values. Interestingly, we found Gst to be 0.2868 and Nm value was 1.2433. Thus, gene flow was slightly more among South-Eastern and South-Western populations compared to between North-Eastern and North-Western populations.
