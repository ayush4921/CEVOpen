<p id="Par12">The analysis of molecular variance indicated that majority of genetic variation (60%) occurred among regions, while variations among population within region and within population were found to be 3% and 37% respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, AMOVA showed high genetic variation within population (91%) than that of among populations (9%) when the South-Eastern population was treated as one group. Also, similar type of result was observed for the North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Western populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which may be one of the reasons for populations getting clustered together based on their regions. When the North-Western and North-Eastern populations were pooled together, AMOVA calculated higher genetic variation within population (56%), while variation among population was 44%. Similar types of results were also obtained when South-Western and South-Eastern populations were pooled together with variation within population (53%) more than variations among populations (47%). Moreover, when we pooled all the 18 populations together as one group and estimated variation among and within population, we found Fst value to be 0.575 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with 57% variation among populations and 43% within populations. This finding thus suggests that inter-population variation was comparatively more than intra-population variation. Therefore, we hypothesise that the differentiation among regions in 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. population was significant, but genetic variation within population was also maintained.
