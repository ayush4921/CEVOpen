<p id="par0105">So far, few studies have examined the time-kill kinetics of mushrooms against microorganisms. In this study, the time-kill kinetic assay revealed that Tris buffer and warm water protein extracts of 
 <italic>A. auricula-judea</italic> had bacteriostatic properties that were contrary to findings of Tinrat [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] who reported bactericidal activity of some mushrooms in his study. In line with the finding of the present research, Appiah et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], showed that methanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. elegans, S. commune, V. volvacea</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. gibbosa</italic> mushroomshad bacteriostatic action against 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> ATCC 25923. Besides, this study showed that both Tris buffer and warm water protein extracts had similar killing kinetics which approved that irrespective of the extraction solvent, the killing rate is dependent on the duration of exposure and concentration.
