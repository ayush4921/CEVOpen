<p id="par0075">The time-kill kinetics assay was performed according to the previously described method with slight modification [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Various values of the protein extracts were adjusted equal to MIC, 2 × MIC, and 4 × MIC. An inoculum of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL was added and incubated at 37 °C. A value of 1.0 mL of the sample were taken at time intervals of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and cultured aseptically into 20 mL nutrient agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Finally, the CFU of the pathogens was calculated and a graph of the log CFU/mL against time was made.
