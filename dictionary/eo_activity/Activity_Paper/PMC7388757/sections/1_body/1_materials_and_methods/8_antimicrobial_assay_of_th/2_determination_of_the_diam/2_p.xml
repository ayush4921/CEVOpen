<p id="par0065">The DIZ was determined by agar well diffusion. The MHA and MEA plate surfaces were inoculated by spreading a 100 μl volume of the microbial inoculum (1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) over the agar surface. Then, an 8 mm hole punched aseptically with a sterile cork borer, and a volume of 30 μl of the extract solutions was poured into the wells. Ciprofloxacin (5 μg/mL) and fluconazole (12 μg/mL) were used as a control for comparison of the results. The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C or 30 °C for 24 or 72 h depending on the test microorganism. The clear zone around the wells was measured and recorded in mm post- incubation and considered as the DIZ. This assay was done in triplicate and the results were shown as the mean value with the parallel standard deviation (SD) (28).
