<p id="par0095">The killing rate kinetics of the Tris buffer compared with that of water protein extract (at 2 × MIC) against test isolates are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (the data of protein extracts equal to 1 × MIC, and 4 × MIC are not shown). The killing rate kinetic of both extracts was time- and concentration-dependent (data are not shown). Both extract were bacteriostatic at 1×, 2×, and 4 × MIC levels. Linear regression analysis of the killing kinetics on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> showed that the slopes of two extracts were not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.071). However, the elevations or intercepts were very significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.007) meaning that a known microbial load of the organisms was going to be cleared at significantly different times. For the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, slopes were quite significantly different (
 <italic>p-</italic>value = 0.005). The Tris buffer protein extract killed the organism significantly faster than the water extract. For the 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the slopes and the elevations (or intercepts) were not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.329 and 0.677 respectively). The rates of killing were similar. Also, a known microbial load of the organisms was going to be cleared at equal times. The anti-pseudomonads activities of the extracts were similar. For the 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, the slopes were extremely significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.004). The Tris-buffer protein extracts extremely killed the organism much faster than the water protein extract. For the 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the killing rates of the two extracts did not differ significantly (
 <italic>p-</italic>value = 0.158). Also, the elevations or intercepts were not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.350). For 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the differences between the slopes were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.028). The Tris-buffer extract performed better. For 
 <italic>T. schoenleinii</italic>, the slopes and intercepts did not differ significantly (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &gt; 0.05). Both extracts have similar killing kinetics.
