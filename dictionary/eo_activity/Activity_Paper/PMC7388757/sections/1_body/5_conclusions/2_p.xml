<p id="par0115">This study documented that Tris and warm aqueous protein extracts of 
 <italic>A. auricula-judae</italic> had antimicrobial effects against all the human bacterial pathogens and two fungal isolates; and therefore can be concluded that 
 <italic>A. auricula-judae</italic> protein may have a potential antimicrobial fraction that can be used as an antimicrobial protein/peptides (AMP) in the treatment of human bacterial and fungal infections. The results showed that although the extracts are active against these organisms, they require enough time to exhibit their inhibition properties on the organisms. Before this study, 
 <italic>A. auricula-judae</italic>, an edible tender mushroom that has quite a significant amount of protein has only been studied on a whole extract basis. The activities of the mushrooms bioactive substances have been published by several authors but nothing has been done on the proteins of this therapeutic and nutritional mushroom to evaluate its antimicrobial properties against some important human pathogens. With the results presented in this research, the alternate hypothesis is accepted that 
 <italic>A. auricular-judae</italic> proteins have antimicrobial effects on human pathogens. Determining the active fractions of these proteins and their antimicrobial effect in the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies or in combination with other chemicals or nanoparticles can be the subjects of future research.
