<p id="para0008">This data facilitates research assessing frequencies, abundance patterns and ecozones relevant to these materia medica and analyses of ecological niches, soil characteristics, and micro-climates in which such materia medica develop. By linking geospatial distributions of these species, this data allows researchers to analyze the degree to which climate change, land use patterns and habitat destruction may impact the sustainability of these medicinal resources and the viability of the botanical tradition of this medical system more broadly. Such analyses help medical and pharmacological researchers to identify potential future substitutes through compound analysis.</p>
