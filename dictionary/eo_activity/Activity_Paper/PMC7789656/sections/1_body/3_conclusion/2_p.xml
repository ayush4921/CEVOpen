<p id="Par138">The type of blanks and blank-correction methods employed in the assays had a significant effect on the final, calculated enzyme activity (and inhibition) values in all three assays. The importance of including a sample blank when testing highly coloured samples, as well as the relevance of a substrate blank, and avoiding errors due to unintended double-blanking were highlighted in the results. Depending on the blank(s) used in the blank-correction of raw data, variation in the final calculated results can lead to either an over-estimation or under-estimation of the calculated enzyme activity. Not accounting for interferences due to the colour of the natural product extracts can result in misleadingly high enzyme activity values which underestimates the bioactivity of the target sample. Therefore, potential enzyme inhibitors can be inadvertently overlooked resulting in missed opportunities in the drug discovery process.</p>
