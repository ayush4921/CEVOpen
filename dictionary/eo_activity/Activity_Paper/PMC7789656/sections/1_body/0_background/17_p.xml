<p id="Par38">Although the use of blanks in experiments is common practice, there is currently no consensus on which blanks should be used. Published studies vary widely with regards to which blanks are included for the calculation of blank-corrected data. Researchers have previously reported assays using a buffer blank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], sample blank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], a substrate blank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], or even an enzyme blank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Some researchers have combined substrate and sample in a single blank to account for interference from both [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Therefore, there appears to be many ways of blank-correction, with no standardisation, which not only adds to the confusion of researchers attempting these enzyme inhibition assays, it also adds bias and makes it difficult to compare results between studies. There are no studies that have investigated whether the type of blank used influences the calculated enzyme activity or enzyme inhibition results, which makes the selection of appropriate blanks problematic. In addition, despite the availability of a range of assay methods and countless publications involving α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase inhibition assays, there is a lack of comprehensive published protocols that detail the assays
