<p id="Par22">Enzymes are the molecular targets of almost half of all marketed small-molecule drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Their protein structure affords a high level of druggability and target validation which makes enzymes an attractive target for novel drug discovery efforts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Enzyme inhibitors form an important class of clinical drugs ranging in use from cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], neurological disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and obesity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Inhibitors of the endogenous carbohydrases α-glucosidase and α-amylase, reduces postprandial hyperglycaemia by delaying the digestion of dietary carbohydrates and are valuable therapeutics in the management of diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, calorie restriction imposed by inhibition of carbohydrases and pancreatic lipase is useful for the prevention of weight gain and the treatment of obesity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, enzyme inhibition assays targeting α-glucosidase, α-amylase and lipase are widespread in research, and screening plant extracts and natural products for inhibitory activity against these enzymes is a common approach for the discovery of potential antidiabetic and antiobesity drugs to treat and manages these metabolic diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].
