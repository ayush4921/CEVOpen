<p id="Par132">In the α-glucosidase assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), enzyme inhibition by the two plant extracts 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> and 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic> was only observed when a sample blank was included [RD − SaB, RD − (BB + SaB), RD − (SuB + SaB), and RD − (Su + SaB)] to offset the interference due to the colour of the extracts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). When results were calculated without a sample blank (RD − BB and RD − SuB), 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> and 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic> appeared to promote enzyme activity. This apparent increase in enzyme activity can be attributed to the colour of the two extracts contributing an additive effect to the absorbance of the test wells resulting in an over-estimation of enzyme activity. Note that the interferences due to sample colour may be minimised by diluting the samples. However, if the sample is too dilute for inhibitory activity to be detected, screening samples at low concentrations increases the risk of missing potential 
 <italic>hits</italic>.
