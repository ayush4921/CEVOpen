<p id="Par135">Although the sample blank did not influence the enzyme activity values in the fluorescence assays, the inclusion or omission of a substrate blank significantly impacted the final enzyme activity values in both the α-amylase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and lipases assays (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The enzyme activity results within each group (each of the positive controls and plant extracts) separated into two tiers depending on whether a substrate blank had been included in the blank-correction: the enzyme activity of all groups were significantly higher when a substrate blank was not included [RD − BB, RD − SaB, and RD − (BB + SaB)] than when a substrate blank was included (RD − SuB, RD − (SuB + SaB), and RD − (Su + SaB). This was attributed to the high background autofluorescence of the substrate (157,700 for α-amylase substrate, and 35,632 for lipase substrate) which contributed a proportionally larger error to the final results (e.g. for 
 <italic>G. jasminoides,</italic> F
 <sub>test</sub> = 193222, F
 <sub>sample blank</sub> = 179 vs F
 <sub>substrate blank</sub> = 171765). Subtracting the high background autofluorescence of the substrate (substrate blank) proportionally reduced the blank-corrected fluorescence of the test wells (193,222 − 171,765 = 21,457 when substrate blank was included versus 193,222 − 179 = 193,044 when the sample blank was included) and therefore reduced the final calculated enzyme activity values. In the α-glucosidase assay, the substrate had a comparatively smaller effect on the enzyme activity results because the background absorbance due to the substrate was lower when compared to the raw absorbance data of the test wells. These results indicated that it is crucial to include a substrate blank to avoid the risk of missing potential enzyme inhibitory activity in drug candidates due to the overestimation of enzyme activity.
