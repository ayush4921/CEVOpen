<p id="Par66">The flavonoids were best resolved using the solvent system consisting of Butanol, Ethanol and water in the ratio 4:1:2. This solvent system separated the flavonoids into 4 bands having a Retention Factor (R
 <sub>f</sub>) in the range of 0.151–0.769. When observed under natural light, only 2 Bands were visible. Band 1 was seen as a dark brown spot while Band 2 was a light brown spot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). All the four bands were visible when observed in iodine vapors and UV short wavelength (264 nm). Upon staining with iodine vapors, Band 1 was seen as the intensely brown spot and the other three bands showed light-brown intensity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), whereas these bands could be seen as blue spots under UV short wavelength (264 nm). Here, Band 1 was intense in comparison to the other three bands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). When observed under long wavelength UV at 365 nm, only Band 1 could be seen as a dark blue spot against the blue background while the other bands were not visible (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d).
