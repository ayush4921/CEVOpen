<p id="Par48">To find out the best organic solvent for effective leaching out of the active components, various solvents such as ethyl acetate, butanol, chloroform, hexane and methanol were used, where methanol was miscible with the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic>. Among all the organic extracts tested, the ethyl acetate extract demonstrated the highest activity against 10 out of 13 test organisms, with an average inhibition zone (IZ) of 14.92 mm, where 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram positive), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 (Gram negative) and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (Yeast) were the most sensitive organisms with an IZ of 19.5 mm, 23 mm and 21 mm, respectively (Fig. A6 in Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Butanolic extract followed up next and was active against 9 out of 13 strains (average IZ = 10.92 mm against all the tested organisms). Here, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was the most sensitive organism (19 mm). The hexane extract was active against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1, while the chloroform extract was completely inactive against all the tested microorganisms. The efficacy of ethyl acetate extract and the butanolic extract did not differ significantly from each other (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but ethyl acetate had a higher average IZ against the test organisms, hence was considered as the best organic extractant. The efficacy of both the extracts differed significantly from that of hexane extract of 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) at 5% level of significance, as revealed by One way ANOVA followed by Post hoc Tukey’s t-test. 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 2 and 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>, however, remained resistant to all the organic extracts of 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa.</italic>
