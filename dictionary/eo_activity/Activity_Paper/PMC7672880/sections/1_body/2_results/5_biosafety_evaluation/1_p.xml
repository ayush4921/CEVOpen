<p id="Par54">All the test preparations, i.e., ethyl acetate extract, flavonoids and cardiac glycosides were found to be non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic in nature, as assessed by Ames test and MTT assay, respectively (Table T2 in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In Ames test, no revertant colonies were seen upon exposure to the test preparations as compared to the numerous revertant colonies (856) obtained upon exposure to the known mutagen
 <italic>,</italic> i.e.
 <italic>,</italic> sodium azide. In MTT assay, the test preparations were found to be non-cytotoxic as evident from the high viability of the blood cells post-exposure [96.02% (ethyl acetate extract); 91.83% (flavonoids); 96.56% (cardiac glycosides)].
