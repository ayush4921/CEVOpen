<p id="Par58">The flavonoids and cardiac glycosides considerably reduced the cell viability, as indicated by the reduced metabolic activity (low mean absorbance values) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). In case of 
 <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> flavonoids (mean absorbance = 0.298) were more effective than cardiac glycosides (mean absorbance = 0.342), however, both of them had an effect comparable to amphotericin B (mean absorbance = 0.279). Cardiac glycosides reduced the metabolic activity of 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1 biofilm more efficiently than the flavonoids, whereas, the effect of flavonoids and cardiac glycosides was almost similar in case of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These were found to be good biofilms inhibitors by efficiently reducing the metabolically active cells. It was observed that the inhibitory potential of the phytoconstituents and the standard antibiotics was statistically different (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) from each other against all the four test organisms, as revealed by One way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s t-test. Also, the individual effect of phytoconstituents and antibiotics on the four test organisms showed statistically significant difference (
