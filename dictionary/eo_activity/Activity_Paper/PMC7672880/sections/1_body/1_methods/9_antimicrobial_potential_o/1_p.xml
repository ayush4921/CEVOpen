 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The sensitivity of different organisms was measured in terms of inhibition zone (in mm). The MIC of the most sensitive organisms was also worked out by broth dilution method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Different concentrations of each phytoconstituent (0.09 mg/mL-50 mg/mL) were made from their respective stock and mixed with 50 μL of actively growing bacterial suspension in a 96 well microtitre plate. The inoculum without the test compound served as a negative control and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). To determine the MBC, the aliquots from the wells showing no visible growth were swabbed further onto the nutrient agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The concentration corresponding to no growth on the plates was taken as MBC.
