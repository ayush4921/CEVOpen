<p id="Par22">Different organic solvents such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol, hexane and methanol were screened to work out the best extractant. The organic extracts were prepared by using solvent-solvent extraction of the aqueous extract (detailed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The aqueous extract was prepared by suspending powdered plant material (17.5 g) in sterile distilled water (100 mL) and keeping it in hot water bath at 40 °C for 20 min. Hundred milliliter of filtered aqueous extract was then shaken vigorously in a separating funnel with an equal volume of a particular organic solvent, for three independent times. The pooled organic layers were concentrated in a rotavapor at 45 °C (under vacuum). The leftover material thus obtained were dissolved in diluted Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) [(30% (v/v)], which was then tested for their antimicrobial activity against the reference strains using the Agar Diffusion Assay (ADA).
