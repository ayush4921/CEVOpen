<p id="Par29">MTT assay was also done for the test preparations to find out their cytotoxic effect, as described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with slight modifications (for details see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To calculate the % cell viability, the wells with untreated cells were used as control. Aliquots (100 μL) of blood cells’ suspension (in PBS; containing approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ mL) were dispensed into a 96 well microtitre plate in duplicates and after overnight incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was removed carefully and 200 μL of the test preparations (as mentioned in above experiments) was added and incubated further for 1 day. Following incubation, the suspension was decanted off and the cells were exposed to 20 μL of MTT dye (0.5% w/v) at 37 °C/3.5 h, under mild shaking condition. The excess dye was pipetted out and DMSO (50 μL) was added for dissolving the end product (formazan), whose absorbance was then read at 590 nm in a 96 well-microtitre plate reader and the % viability of cells was calculated.
