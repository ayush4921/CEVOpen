<p id="Par73">The present study thus provides a scientific support to the use of 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic> bark to explore its bioactive compounds of pharmaceutical importance, as evident from their wide zone of inhibition, low MIC values, shorter killing time and extended post antibiotic effect. These compounds showed a significant antibiofilm potential, were potent against drug resistant strains and were cytotoxic against the cancerous cell lines, which further add credence to the bioactive potential of the plant. The ethyl acetate extract and the phytoconstituents had a biosafe profile as seen in Ames test, MTT assay and acute oral toxicity studies. The various bioactivities exhibited by 
 <italic>Symplocos racemosa</italic> revealed and strengthened its candidature for development of potent pharmaceutical drugs.
