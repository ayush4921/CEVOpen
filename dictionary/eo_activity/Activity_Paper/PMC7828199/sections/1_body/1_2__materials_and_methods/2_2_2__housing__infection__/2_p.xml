 <italic>E. tenella</italic> oocysts without any addition of RN in their diet. Group 6 was the negative control (NC), i.e., an uninfected–unmedicated control group, in which birds have not exposed to 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic> oocysts without any addition of RN to the diet. The overall study duration was 28 d, and the birds were reared in an environmentally controlled house in a cage measuring 58 cm length × 50 cm width × 35 cm height. The temperature and relative humidity were 33 °C and 65% up to 5 d of age and were reduced gradually to 24 °C and 50% up to 21 d of age. The “23-h-on and 1-h-off” photoperiod was used. Feed and water were provided on an ad libitum basis.
