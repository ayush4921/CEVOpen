<p>For the analysis of variables, the following statistical ANOVA models were used:
 <disp-formula>Yij = μ + Ti + eij </disp-formula> where: Yij = the observed j variable in the ith treatment; μ = overall mean of the variables; Ti = the effect the ith treatment; and eij = random residual error. For statistical differences, all mean values were separated using the Ryan–Einot–Gabriel–Welsch multiple range.
