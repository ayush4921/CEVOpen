<p>The mean relative BWG ratio of each group is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-00167-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The initial weights between groups of chickens were not significant (data are not shown). The BW of all three RN-supplemented groups did not increase significantly when compared between groups or with the PC group (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) or even with the Sacox-treated group. Therefore, our data demonstrated that the RN leaf powder did not increase the BWG effectively at the current dose used.
