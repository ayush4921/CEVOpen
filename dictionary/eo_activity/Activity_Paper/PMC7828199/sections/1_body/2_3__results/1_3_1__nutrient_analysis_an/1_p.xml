<p>The chemical composition of RN leaves is shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00167-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The crude protein, crude fiber, ash, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and energy were detected at 13.63%, 8.24%, 18.01%, 20.21%, 15.48%, and 3273.31 kcal/kg, respectively, which indicated its potential as a nutraceutical. Gallic acid was the component detected with the largest composition (700 Âµg/g) in RN leaf extracts based on the HPLC results (
