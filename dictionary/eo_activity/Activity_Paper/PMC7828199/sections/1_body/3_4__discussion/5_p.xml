<p>The cecum is among the most influential digestive organs in broilers. Infection with 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> could cause major epithelial destruction. Therefore, the host may sustain diarrhea and malabsorption related to poor weight gain [

 <xref rid="B60-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and cecum atrophy varied from mild atrophy and scattered petechiae in the RN-medicated groups to serious atrophy and severe hemorrhage in the PC group. The GLS of the cecum of the birds was reduced mostly in the Sacox-treated group. These results demonstrated that bioactive ingredients present in RN leaf powder supplementation can have indirect anti-coccidial action and can play a role in the control of eimeriosis in birds by reducing the lesion score, oocysts output, suppressing or delaying the developmental 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic> parasite, and mortality. Therefore, RN leaf powder can play a vital role in developing the organ-protective properties of infected birds [
