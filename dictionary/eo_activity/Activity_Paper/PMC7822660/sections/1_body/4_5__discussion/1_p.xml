<p>Any drug or herbal formula which is intended to be used in humans must first be tested in suitable experimental animals in order to evaluate its safety. 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> is being used in many traditional herbal formulas. Even though there are not many toxicological studies, the available data suggests that 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> did not induce toxicity in experimental animals. The ethanolic extract prepared from the leaves of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> inhibited the carrageenin induced paw inflammation and also did not cause any toxicity in mice [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a dermotoxicity test, no irritation was noticed by 80% methanol extract of the leaves of
