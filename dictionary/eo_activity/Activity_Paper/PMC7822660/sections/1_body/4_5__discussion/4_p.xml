<p>The phenol and flavonoid content of different extracts revealed that the hexane fraction of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> had the lowest phenol and flavonoid contents. The hexane fraction had phenol and flavonoid content of 33.2 and 22.6 mg/mL, respectively, whereas the crude extract showed 47.9 and 27.9 mg/mL of phenol and flavonoid contents. The chloroform and butanol extract also exerted toxicity in treated zebrafish embryos, albeit at a higher concentration as compared to hexane and crude extract. The toxicity of the extracts of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in zebrafish embryos has shown a direct relationship with the amount of phenol and flavonoid. The crude extract and hexane fraction induced the highest level of toxicity and contained the least amount of phenol and flavonoid as compared to other fractions. A similar kind of observation has been reported previously with other medicinal plants. The developmental toxicity of four different types of herbal plants (
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata, Cinnamon zeylanicum, Curcuma xanthorrhiza, Eugenia polyantha</italic> and 
 <italic>Orthosiphon stamineus)</italic> was investigated in zebrafish embryos. It was shown that the extracts with low contents of phenol and flavonoid induced higher level of toxicity in zebrafish embryos [
