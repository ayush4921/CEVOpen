<p>The embryos and infants are highly sensitive to chemicals that could cause serious damage to growth during development. The reproductive toxicity of various extracts of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> on embryonic development has never been investigated before this study. We used zebrafish embryos to find out the developmental toxicity of 
 <italic>D. viscosa.</italic> Zebrafish embryos are being used successfully in many developmental toxicity testing screens. Using zebrafish in developmental toxicology has many advantages over other experimental animal model systems. Zebrafish embryos grow and hatch rapidly and have high fertility, and the small and transparent body is suitable for observation of internal organs with conventional microscopy. Large-scale screening in 96-well plate is possible for high-throughput chemical screens with zebrafish embryos. Moreover, easy exposure of embryos to chemicals with minimal amounts makes it an ideal model organism to test the developmental toxicity of chemical or extracts on a large scale [
