<p>The chemical constituents of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> hexane fraction (DVHF) were determined using gas chromatography and a mass spectrometer (Turbomass, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The temperature of program 4 was set to 40°C, followed by a 2 min hold, and then raised to 200°C at a rate of 5°C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, which was also then put on hold for 2 min. From 200°C, the temperature was raised by 5°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 300°C and held for another 2 min. The mass spectra of DVHF compounds were also compared with those of similar compounds in the Adams Library [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the Wiley GC/MS Library [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
