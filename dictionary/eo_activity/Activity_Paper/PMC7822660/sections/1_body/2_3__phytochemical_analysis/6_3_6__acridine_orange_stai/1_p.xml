<p>Apoptosis was analyzed in hexane extract of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> treated whole-mount embryos with an exposure to the sub-lethal concentration of 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL at 24 hpf (hours post fertilization). Control and treated embryos were rinsed several times with distilled water and then exposed to a solution of acridine orange (Carlo Erba) at a concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 1 h, after which several rinses were performed to remove the excess dye. The embryos were then mounted in a drop slide with glycerol and PBS. The images were acquired with Olympus SZ10 florescent microscope using FITC channel.
