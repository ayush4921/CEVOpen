<p>Fertilized embryos were transferred into 6-well plates (30 embryos/well) containing a series of diluted extracts ranging from 0.15 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL to 300 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL in total volume of 2 mL and incubated overnight in an air incubator at 29°C. Embryo development was monitored first after overnight and then after every 24 h interval for 96 h. Four morphological characteristics were evaluated including coagulation of eggs, tail detachment, presence of heart beat, and hatching rates using Carl-Zeiss Inverted Microscope (observer D1) equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) filter and camera and software for image optimization. Experiments were conducted in triplicate.
