 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic> is a very useful medicinal plant which is being used to treat various diseases in humans. The LD 50 values indicated that the solvent extracts of DV were very toxic in zebrafish embryos and killed developing embryos with concentrations in the microgram range. The morphological abnormalities which were recorded in zebrafish embryo were severe developmental delay, no pigmentation, and severe degenerated notochord which resulted in curved trunk. Moreover, severe cardiac edema and hypertrophy also resulted in treated embryos. The toxicity could be due to impaired UDP-glucuronosyltransferases enzyme due to the presence of major compound phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol). More detailed studies are needed to check the toxicity of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in pregnant experimental animals. As 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> has been reported to cause the infertility and abortion in female rats, its use and doses must be carefully monitored in pregnant patients.
