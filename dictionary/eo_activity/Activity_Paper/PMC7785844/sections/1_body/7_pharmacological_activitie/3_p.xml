<p id="p0150">The effect of miracle fruit (
 <italic>Synsepalum dulcificum</italic>) on insulin resistance induced by fructose-rich chow in male Wistar rats was evaluated by Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Treatment of insulin-resistant animals with 0.02, 0.04 and 0.2 mg/kg extract of miracle fruit ameliorated the effect of fructose-rich chow on glucose-insulin index and the time interval for response to tolbutamide (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.). There was also a significant increase in insulin sensitivity as a result of treatment with miracle fruit powder.
