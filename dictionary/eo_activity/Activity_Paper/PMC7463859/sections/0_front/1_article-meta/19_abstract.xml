 <p>The current study on the traditional use of medicinal plants was carried out from February 2018 to March 2020, in Gokand Valley, District Buner, Pakistan. The goal was to collect, interpret, and evaluate data on the application of medicinal plants. Along with comprehensive notes on individual plants species, we calculated Use Value (UV), Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC), Use Report (UR), Fidelity Level (FL), Informant Consensus Factor (FCI), as well as Family Importance Value (FIV). During the current study, a total of 109 species belonging to 64 families were reported to be used in the treatment of various ailments. It included three families (four species) of Pteridophytes, 58 families (99 species) of angiosperm, one family (three species) of Gymnosperms, and two families (three species) of fungi. The article highlights the significance of domestic consumption of plant resources to treat human ailments. The UV varied from 0.2 (
  <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> L.) to 0.89 (
  <italic>Acacia modesta</italic> Wall.). The RFC ranged from 0.059 (
  <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> L. and 
  <italic>Convolvulus arvensis</italic> L.) to 0.285 (
  <italic>Acacia modesta</italic> Wall.). The species with 100% FL were 
  <italic>Acacia modesta</italic> Wall. and the fungus 
  <italic>Morchella esculenta</italic> Fr., while the FCI was documented from 0 to 0.45 for gastro-intestinal disorders. The conservation ranks of the medicinal plant species revealed that 28 plant species were vulnerable, followed by rare (25 spp.), infrequent (17 spp.), dominant (16 spp.), and 10 species endangered. The traditional use of plants needs conservation strategies and further investigation for better utilization of natural resources.
