<p>The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the crude extract and fractions were determined using the tube diffusion method. Concentrations 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg mL of 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> extract fractions were formed by dissolving the dried extracts in chloroform (for chloroform and petroleum ether fractions) and methanol (for acetone and methanol fractions). Negative controls of the experiment were formed using 80% chloroform and methanol solvents alone. Antibacterial activity of all samples was determined by measuring the diameter of the zones of inhibition.
