<p>Shaking 500 mg of the crude extract with water in a test tube was performed to confirm the presence of saponins. The formation of froth that persists on warming was confirmatory for saponin content.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Another evidence for the saponin content of the crude extract was also obtained using normal phase thin layer chromatography (TLC). Silica gel was used as the stationary phase and the mobile phase constituted of a mixture of chloroform-glacial acetic acid-methanol-water (64:32:12:8). The formation of blue, blue-violet, red, or yellow-brown zones by spraying vanillin-sulfuric acid indicator on the TLC plates containing the chromatogram of the crude extract was used to identify the saponin content.
