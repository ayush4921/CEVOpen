<p>Plant extracts having chemicals with antimicrobial activity usually belong to alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, saponins, and their derivatives.
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The positive test result for alkaloids confirmed in the current study is due to the ability of the metallic atom in the reagent (bismuth and mercury) to form an ion pair with the nitrogen in the alkaloid, leading to the formation of a precipitate.
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The formation of froth that persists on warming due to the saponin content of 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> in the saponin confirmatory test is due to the surfactant nature of saponins due to the presence of polar carbohydrate groups and nonpolar sapogenin groups in their structure.
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The color change observed in TLC plates upon addition of vanillin-sulfuric acid indicator used in the phytochemical screening is due to the interaction between triterpene saponins oxidized by sulfuric acid and vanillin.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The ability of tannins to form tannic acid – ferric complexes upon addition of ferric chloride is the mechanism behind tannin identification test use in the current study.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The bacterial strains used for the determination of antimicrobial activity in the current study were the common causes of illness in the community. Similar antibacterial effects of the crude extract and the solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> were obtained in the current study against different strains of bacteria. This indicates the intermediate polarity of the component of the plant material responsible for antibacterial activity. The results of the current study indicated that 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> produces comparable antibacterial on the test strains of bacteria at a concentration of 75 mg mL and greater activity at 100 mg mL as compared to the positive control (gentamycin) for some strains (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>). No antibacterial activity was observed on the test strains for the negative controls (80% methanol and chloroform). The results of antimicrobial activity screening also identified 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as the most and least susceptible bacteria among the four bacterial test strains under study. On the other hand, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was found to be the most insensitive strain among all bacteria. This also indicates the potential effectiveness of the extract of 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> on gram-positive bacteria over their gram-negative counterparts. Structural differences between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria causing variation in antimicrobial penetration leading to the concentration of the potentially antibacterial compound found in 
 <italic>Agave americana</italic> in gram-positive bacteria could explain such variations in susceptibility.
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The inhibitory effect of the extract on bacterial cell wall synthesis (peptidoglycan crosslinking), which are less concentrated in gram-negative bacteria, may also be responsible for their reduced susceptibility to the extract and solvent fractions compared to gram-positive bacteria. This is also supported by the results from Alcázar et al who reported the growth inhibitory effect of the steroidal saponin components of 
 <italic>Agave durangensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Agave salmiana ssp. crassispina</italic> and their ability to change the cell wall structure on 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>K. marxianus</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The saponin component identified from the extract of 
 <italic>A. americana</italic> in the current study may be responsible for the antimicrobial effect observed. However, other phytochemical components identified in the crude extract of 
 <italic>A. americana</italic> such as alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and phenolic compounds have also a potential antimicrobial activities. Therefore, further experiments should be performed on the isolated phytochemical components to determine the exact component responsible for the antibacterial activity and perform structural elucidation to obtain a potential antimicrobial agent of the future.
