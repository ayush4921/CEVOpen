<p>The results of this test reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> indicated that coriander, parsley, and celery extracts were demonstrated considerable (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) discrepancies regarding the reduction of MDA formed by the oxidative action of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>. Parsley exhibited the highest antioxidant power (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.19 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) followed by celery and, then, coriander (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 58.04 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL). These findings are largely higher compared to ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 98.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) being the reference antioxidant.
