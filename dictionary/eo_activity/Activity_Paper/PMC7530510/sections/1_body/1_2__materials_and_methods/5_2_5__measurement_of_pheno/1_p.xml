<p>Quantification of phenols within the three extracts was executed using Folin–Ciocalteu's reagent, following the protocol reported by Bouhlali et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] whose principle relies on the decay of phosphomolybdic-phosphor tungstic acid caused by phenol compounds in an alkaline medium [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To proceed, 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of Folin–Ciocalteu's reagent diluted ten-fold in water was poured onto 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of a suitable diluted hydromethanolic plant extract and, then, 400 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of sodium carbonate solution (7.5% w/v). The resulting solution was allowed to stand for 60 min at room temperature, and its turbidity was noted at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 765 nm. The results were presented as gram of Gallic acid equivalent per 100 gram dry weight (g GAE.100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) through the calibration plot with gallic acid.
