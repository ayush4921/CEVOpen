<p>The antiradical property of plant extracts was also assessed via the neutralization of a peroxyl radical initiator, AAPH, following the protocol established by Blache and Prost [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of rabbit blood collected in heparinized bulbs was stirred up with 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of plant extract, and then, 600 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of AAPH (10%) was added. The resulting solution was slowly agitated and incubated at 37°C. Later on, after every 5 min, the turbidity of the solution was noted at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 540 nm. The water-methanol extract was replaced by saline (0.9% NaCl) and trolox in the negative and positive controls, respectively. The preventive powers of plant extracts against AAPH-induced erythrocyte oxidative hemolysis were determined via half-time hemolysis (HT
 <sub>50</sub>) which is the necessary time to prevent the hemolysis of 50% erythrocytes. Trolox played the standard.
