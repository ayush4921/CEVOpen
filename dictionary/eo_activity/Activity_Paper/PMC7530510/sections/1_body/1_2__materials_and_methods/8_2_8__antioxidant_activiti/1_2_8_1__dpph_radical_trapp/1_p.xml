<p>The electron-donating capacity of the obtained extracts was quantified by bleaching of the purple-colored solution of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH
 <sup>●</sup>) radical following the procedure reported by Blois [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with slight changes. The closely stable radical cation DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> changes color from red to yellow when scavenged. Thus, it is used to quantify the antiradical activity, usually expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (correspond to the antioxidant level needed to lower the initial concentration of DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> by 50%). The lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value indicates a potent antioxidant effect [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To proceed, the reactants included 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of the plant extract at various concentrations and 1.9 mL of DPPH mixed with methanol (0.3 mM). The solution was strongly shaken and incubated at room temperature for twenty minutes. Later on, the turbidity was measured at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 517 nm. Vitamin C played the reference antioxidant. The antiradical activity was presented as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) which is the concentration required to cause 50% DPPH inhibition. The free-radical trapping capacity was, thus, calculated manipulating the following equation:
