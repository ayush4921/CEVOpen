<p>The TBARS test was implemented to evaluate the antiperoxidative effect as described by Bouhlali et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of egg yolk homogenate (10% w/v dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)) was stirred with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of the plant sample, and then, the resulting solution was filled with distilled water up to 1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>L. Then, 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of iron (III) sulphate (FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>) (0.07 M) was poured on the solution which was consequently incubated for a half an hour at 37°C to start lipid peroxidation. To the overall solution, three components (50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of 20% trichloroacetic acid, 1.5 mL of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) (0.8% w/v prepared in 1.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate) and 1.5 mL of acetic acid (20%, pH 3.5)) were added, mixed, and heated at 95°C during exactly one hour. Thereafter, following cooling at ambient temperature, 6 mL of 1-butanol was added to each test tube. The contents of the tubes were agitated, and to remove the precipitated protein, a centrifugation was performed at 1000 g for ten minutes; later on, the turbidity of the Malondialdehyde (MDA)-TBA complex in the resulting supernatant was read against 3 mL of 1-butanol at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 532 nm. Only distilled water (100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L) served as the negative control. Vitamin C was the standard. The antiperoxidative effect was deduced using the following equation:
