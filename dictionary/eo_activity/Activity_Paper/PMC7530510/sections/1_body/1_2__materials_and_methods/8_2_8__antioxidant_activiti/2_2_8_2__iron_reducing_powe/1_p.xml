<p>The potassium ferricyanide-ferric chloride method [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was used to quantify reducing power whose principle relies on the reduction of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-TPTZ complex to its colored ferrous form (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-TPTZ) in the existence of antioxidant compounds. Hence, it serves as a significant indicator of antiradical potential. The FRAP reagent contained 50 mL of acetate buffer (0.3 M) at pH (3.6), 5 mL of TPTZ solution (10 mM) prepared in 5 mL of ferric chloride solution (FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>) (20 mM), and HCl (40 mM). Then, 2 mL of the FRAP solution was immediately poured on 10 µL of each extract. Test tubes were incubated for ten minutes at room temperature. Later on, the turbidity of the resulting mix was read along with the blank at

 <sup>−1</sup> dry weight (DW).
