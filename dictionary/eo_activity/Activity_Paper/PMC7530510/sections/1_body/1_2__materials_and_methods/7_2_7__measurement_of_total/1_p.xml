<p>Quantification of total condensed tannins was performed employing the method modified by Heimler et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, four hundred microliters of the plant extract was stirred with 3 mL of vanillin mixed with methanol (4%) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.5 mL). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature so that the reaction starts, and the turbidity was determined at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 500 nm. Total condensed tannin contents were depicted as 
 <italic>g</italic> catechin equivalent per 100 gram dry weight (g CE.100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) through the calibration plot with Catechin.
