<p>During pathological regulation, the mitochondrial proteins involved in electron transfer can overproduce oxygen free radicals, which are prone to alter DNA, peptides, and lipids, leading to cell ageing, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation-related diseases, and cancer [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Indeed, when the immune system interacts with xenobiotic agents, high levels of oxygen prooxidants (ROS) are produced and are not properly neutralized by antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and catalase, which lead to their accumulation in the mitochondria, thereby compromising their physiological role [

Although, there is a common view that many artificial antioxidants such as butylhydroxyanisole and butylhydroxytoluene (BHA and BHT, respectively) used to process food must be switched by natural antioxidants since they were entitled to show potential toxicity and health hazards [
