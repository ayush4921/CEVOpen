<p>To date, there is no relevant method to evaluate the antioxidant activity; thus, we used DPPH and ABTS radicals-scavenging ability assays, as well as iron-reducing capacity (FRAP). Their principle is based on the ability of an antioxidant to reduce a free radical leading to a change in the intensity of color after being reduced [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The intensity of color is oppositely related to the antioxidants level [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We concluded that parsley, coriander, and celery extracts possessed both scavenging and reducing powers, but not at the same level. Parsley showed a marked scavenging ability and reducing power among other plants. Given the diversity of mechanisms by which antioxidants act, employing one type of antioxidant capacity evaluation is considered insufficient. As a result, TBARS assay was performed to investigate the antiperoxidative effect on lipids. In fact, during radical attack, free radicals alter lipid membranes, leading to the release of the MDA end product [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The latter binds to a chromogenic reagent TBA forming MDA-TBA complex, the latter is quantified spectrophotometrically [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Unlike the TBARS assay, the AAPH-induced hemolysis test gives an idea about the antihemolytic potential. Erythrocytes are the first target to radical attack because of two potential sources of ROS depicted by their membrane rich of multiunsaturated fat acids and the hemoglobin redox reactions linked to O
 <sub>2</sub> transfer [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Due to thermal decomposition, the azo compound AAPH produces free radicals, which attack red blood cells and activate the oxidative chain reactions of macromolecules such as lipids, altering the membrane integrity and, consequently, cause hemolysis [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Antioxidants from plants quench free radicals and, thus, protect lipid membranes from radical attack. The protective effect is measured by the vhalftime of hemolysis (HT
 <sub>50</sub> which corresponds to the necessary time to the hemolysis of half initial erythrocytes). The more antioxidant levels in the plant extract, the more prolonged the HT
 <sub>50</sub> value. In our study, the parsley extract exhibited the strongest antihemolytic activity supported by high erythrocyte membrane-stabilizing and -protecting effects.
