<p>Our results confirm previous studies on the impacts of phenolic on the scavenging potential of various plant extracts [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As a matter of fact, the strong correlation found between the flavonoid content and membrane-protecting effect (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.927) suggests that flavonoids are the main providers of the antihemolytic capacity as already mentioned by Huang [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Several authors have reported that flavonoids and other polyphenols can bind to membrane phospholipids, thus protecting membranes against fat deterioration [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On a different side, plant extracts induced an increase in the erythrocyte membrane resistance and halftime of hemolysis, which can be related to the high correlation between the flavonoids content and membrane-stabilizing effect on erythrocytes treated only with plant extracts (
