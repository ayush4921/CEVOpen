<p>Snapdragon flowers were purchased from a local farm (Seoul, Korea), sorted by colors (red and yellow), and washed. Freeze‐dried (PH1316, IshinBioBase, Yangju, Korea) red and yellow flowers were separately ground into powder and extracted with 80% ethanol (40‐fold volume) for 6 hr at room temperature. After centrifugation at 1,500 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min (A320101, Gyrozen), the solvent was evaporated using a speed vacuum concentrator without additional heating applied (NB‐503CIR, N‐bioteck). The remaining dried extract of red and yellow flowers (RSFE and YSFE, respectively) was weighed to calculate the extraction yield and stored in deep freezer for further use.
