<p>H1299 cells were seeded in 6‐well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with SFE at 0, 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml for 72 hr. After aspiration of medium, cells were then incubated with 100 nM DiOC
 <sub>6</sub>, a dye selective for the mitochondria of live cells, in the dark for 30 min at 37°C. Relative fluorescence intensity was measured using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
