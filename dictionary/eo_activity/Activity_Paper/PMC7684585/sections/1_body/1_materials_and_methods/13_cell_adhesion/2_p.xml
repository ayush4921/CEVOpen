<p>H1299 and HCT116 cells were suspended at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in serum‐complete media containing SFE at 1,000 μg/ml and plated into 96‐well plates precoated with 0.5% gelatin. After 2 hr, 0.5 mg/ml of MTT in the fresh media was added to cells adherent to gelatin. Gelatin is a hydrolyzed collagen and frequently used for mimicking major component of extracellular matrix (Plant et al.,
