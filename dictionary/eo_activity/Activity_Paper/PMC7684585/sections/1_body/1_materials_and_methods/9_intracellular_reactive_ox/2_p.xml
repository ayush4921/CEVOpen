<p>H1299 and HCT116 cells were seeded in 96‐well black plates at a density of 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with SFE at 0, 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml for 72 hr. In another experiment, H1299 cells were pretreated with 2 mM NAC for 2 hr and then treated with 500 μg/ml SFE in the presence of NAC for 72 hr. After aspiration of medium, cells were incubated with 100 μM DCFH‐DA in the dark for 30 min at 37°C. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidize DCFH‐DA to 2′,7′‐dichlorofluorescin (DCF), which was monitored at the excitation and emission wavelength of 485 nm and 528 nm, respectively, using a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800, Biotek Instrument).
