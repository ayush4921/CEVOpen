<p>To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating inhibitory effects of SFE against cell growth and metastatic properties of human cancer cells. Further studies are warranted to standardize SFE and then verify whether such effects are demonstrated in laboratory animals and finally humans. Since a recent study has reported that snapdragon flowers are rich in different bioactive phytochemicals, including flavonol glycosides and anthocyanin (Gonzalez‐Barrio et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), it needs to be clarified whether the inhibitory activities of SFE observed in the present study are ascribed to an isolated single constituent or more than one constituents in combination. Detailed molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory action of SFE against lung and colon cancers also remain to be elucidated.
