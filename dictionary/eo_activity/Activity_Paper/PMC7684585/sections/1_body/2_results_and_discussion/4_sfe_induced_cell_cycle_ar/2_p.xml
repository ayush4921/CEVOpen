<p>Uncontrolled cell cycle progression is a cardinal feature of cancer cells (Evan &amp; Vousden, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Apoptosis is a vital process for normal cell turnover. Defective apoptosis represents a major causative factor in the development and progression of cancer. Impediment of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, therefore, are recognized as an effective preventive and therapeutic approach against cancers (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Pan &amp; Ho, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). To examine possible alteration in cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis by SFE, cell cycle analysis was performed. SFE significantly elevated the percentage of cell population at G2/M phase to 1.8‐fold to 1.9‐fold of the control H1299 cells (at 500 µg/ml) and to 1.6‐fold to 1.8‐fold of the control HCT116 cells (at 1,000 µg/ml) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>), indicating G2/M arrest‐inducing activities of SFE. SFE also significantly elevated the percentage of cell population at sub‐G1 phase to 2.2‐fold of the control H1299 cells (at 500 µg/ml) and to 1.6‐fold to 2.1‐fold of the control HCT116 cells (at 1,000 µg/ml) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Since the cells at sub‐G1 phase are apoptotic (Evan &amp; Vousden, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>), these results indicate apoptosis‐inducing activities of SFE. To confirm the induction of apoptosis by SFE, Annexin V/propidium iodine double staining assay was performed using H1299 cells. SFE at 500 μg/ml increased the percentage of both early and late apoptotic cells to 3.7‐fold to 5.5‐fold and 1.6‐fold to 1.8‐fold of the control cells, respectively, resulting in increased percentage of total apoptotic cells to 2.3‐fold to 3.3‐fold of the control (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Since dysregulated cell cycle and evaded apoptosis are important contributors to the stimulated growth of cancers (Evan &amp; Vousden, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), our results suggest that the growth‐inhibitory activities of SFE found in this study (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are attributed to the cell cycle arrest at G2/M and induction of apoptosis.
