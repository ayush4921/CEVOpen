  <p>SFE induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in H1299 and HCT116 cells. H1299 (a) and HCT116 cells (b) were treated with SFE (500 µg/ml and 1,000 µg/ml, respectively) for 72 hr, and the cells at G2/M (M2) and sub‐G1 (M4) phases (%) were counted by flow cytometry. Additionally, H1299 cells were treated with SFE (500 µg/ml) for 72 hr, stained with Annexin V‐FITC and PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry (c). Total apoptotic cells were calculated by summing early (Annexin V+/PI−) and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI+). Different letters (a‐c) indicate significance (
