<p>The compound was displayed by total weight loss in three stages. In the first stage, the weight loss occurred in the temperature range about 40-220째C representing the vapor liberation in the sample. The weight loss befell in the second stage at the temperature range between 220 and 450째C consistent to the liberation of vapor from the inner apertures of Cu. The weight loss in the third stage happens between the temperature ranges of 450-800째C display indulgences of carbonaceous material of the sample. Organic material presence in the sample, was observed at exothermic peak of 290째C. The TGA/DTA profile for the Cu-Np precursor was shown in
