<p>The Cu-Nsp with 2-pyrimidinamine derivatives was performed by hydrogen donor antioxidants (AOH), steadying and postponing the free radicals of oxidation lipids. In 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of free radical fabrication, an azo compound was causing free radicals by impulsive thermal decomposition. Alkylperoxy free radicals were produced via the water-soluble AAPH used as a hygienic and governable source thermally. AAPH assay was achieved to enhance the antioxidant activity of Cu-Nsp with 2-pyrimidinamine; the compound 1c and Cu-Nps-Pyr-1c are awarding activities of 75.6 and 91.2%, respectively, at a concentration of 100
