 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> indicated the recovery of the catalyst with salvaged for at least 10 run times and slight loss in catalytic activity. The lessening of activity could be detected with the regenerated catalyst on salvaging due to surface area of the catalyst during the reaction or partial loss of basic sites/regeneration. The values are shown in
