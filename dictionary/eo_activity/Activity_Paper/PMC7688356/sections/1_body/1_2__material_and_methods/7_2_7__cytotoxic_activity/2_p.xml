<p>The results were analyzed between the growth percentage of treated cells and untreated control cells. Sample preparation, 0.1 mL of the test solution (6.25–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g in 1% DMSO), and 0.1 mL aliquot of the cell suspension (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added and kept in an incubator (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) at 37°C for 72 h. The blank sample checked only the cell suspension, and the control wells contained 1% DMSO and the cell suspension. After 72 h, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MTT was added, and the plates were kept in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 2 h, followed by the addition of propanol (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). The absorption data (562 nm) were obtained by 27-well plates on an ELISA reader; the test sample was prepared by aluminum foil covered with subsequently agitated in a rotary shaker for 10–20 min.
