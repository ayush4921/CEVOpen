<p>This linoleic acid peroxidation assay was achieved and followed the methods of Surendra Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All values were carried out in triplicate, with the consistent data, provided in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The oxidation of linoleic acid production was analyzed by conjugated diene hydroperoxide in an aqueous distribution was observed at 234 nm, [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with AAPH (2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride) used as a free radical initiator. For UV cuvette solution preparation, 1 mL aliquot of a 16 mM linoleic acid was added to 1 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer(pH 7.4), thermostatic at 37°C and addition of 1 mL of the 40 mM AAPH solution. Oxidation reaction was monitored in occurrence of 1 mL of the tested compounds 1a-c, Cu-Nps, and Cu-Nps-Pyr (1a-1c). In the absence of antioxidants, the lipid oxidation was monitored in DMSO mixed compounds. The rate of oxidation was monitored at 37°C and absorption recorded at 234 nm due to the formation of a conjugated diene hydroperoxide.
