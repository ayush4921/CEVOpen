 <italic>trigintipetala</italic> Dieck (Taif rose) from the city of Taif, Saudi Arabia, has been studied and essential, concrete, and absolute rose oils have exerted anticancer activity against HepG2 and MCF7 and were cytotoxically and genotoxically safe at a dose of 10 μg/mL on normal human blood lymphocytes. The methods used involved a sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay (for the tumor cell lines) and 7-AAD viability assay, DNA index determination. Genotoxicity/antimutagenicity assays included using mitomycin C as a mutagenic positive control, colcemid for obtaining metaphases, and microscopical screening for chromosomal aberrations for determining the mitotic index (for the lymphocytes). Four different chemical categories, namely monoterpenes (68%), sesquiterpenes, and aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons were found. The major compounds were β-citronellol (17.6%), geraniol (11.4%), nonadecane (6.5%), nerol (6.4%), linalool (5.9%), α-pinene (4.5%), and phenylethyl alcohol (3.6%) High level of phenyl ethanol may be one of the constituents responsible for the anticancer properties, along with the previously identified geraniol and eugenol [
