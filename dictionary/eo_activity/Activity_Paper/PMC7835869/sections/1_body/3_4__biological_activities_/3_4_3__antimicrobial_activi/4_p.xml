<p>Bulgaria is a major producer of oil from 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L., thus many Bulgarian scientists focus their work on studying the biological activities of this oil [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mileva et al. (2014) investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial effect of white rose essential oil and its ingredients originating from the Valley of Roses, Kazanlak. The authors compared the MIC of 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. oil with the MIC of nerol, eugenol, citronellol, methyleugenol, and geraniol. Interestingly, the oral pathogen 
 <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> proved to be the most sensitive bacterium to eugenol and citronellol (with MIC = 0.17 mg/mL), as well as to other pure compounds—about 0.2 mg/mL—with the exception of geraniol (MIC = 0.37 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. oil 0.45 mg/mL. 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> is sensitive to eugenol (MIC = 0.17 mg/mL), followed by equal MICs of nerol and rose oil (0.82 mg/mL), geraniol (MIC = 1.12 mg/mL), methyl eugenol (MIC = 1.19 mg/mL), and citronellol (MIC = 1.74 mg/mL). 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is more resistant to nerol and oil than 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. (MIC = 1.36 mg/mL). Geraniol and methyl eugenol in opposition to enterococci showed the same effect as against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (MICs were 1.12 mg/mL and 1.19 mg/mL, respectively). Citronellol had higher anti-enterococcal activity with a MIC of 0.69 mg/mL [

 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. showed that geraniol was characterized by the lowest antifungal activity, followed by nerol, citronellol, methyl eugenol, and eugenol against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Carvalho et al. (2008) showed the weak antimicrobial effects of aqueous extract from 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. of Brazilian origin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (inhibition growth zone 9 mm) [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Gochev et al. (2010) found, through thedisc diffusion method, theweak antimicrobial activity of Bulgarian essential oil from 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> L. against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. abony</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (10–14 mm inhibition zone) and no effect against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. putida</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, these authors examined the MIC and MBC of essential oil, including the pure compounds citronellol, geraniol, and nerol. The individual substances geraniol and nerol exhibited highest antimicrobial activity against all tested strains, with MIC varying between 0.01% and 0.2% and MBC ranging from 0.01% to 0.41% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>). Citronellol ranks in a middle position with MIC from 0.03% to 0.41% and MBC between 0.03% and 0.82% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>), followed by rose essential oil with MIC varying from 0.05% to 0.82% and MBC from 0.05% to 1.64% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) against all microorganisms [
