<p>The 
 <italic>R. alba</italic> essential oil possesses genoprotective potential. Data of Gateva et al. (2020) suggest a promising pharmacological potential of Bulgarian white rose essential oil applied in non-toxic concentrations in barley root tips (250, 500 μg/mL) and in human lymphocytes in vitro (50, 200 μg/mL), owing to a well-expressed anticytotoxic/anti-genotoxic potential against the direct alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (50 μg/mL). This effect was manifested by increasing the cells’ proliferation and decreasing both chromosome aberrations and micronuclei, regardless of the experimental schemes used, when applied in nontoxic concentrations [
