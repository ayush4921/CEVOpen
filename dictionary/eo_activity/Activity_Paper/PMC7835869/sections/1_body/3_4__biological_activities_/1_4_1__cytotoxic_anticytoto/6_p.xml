<p>In the last decade, some studies have shown the cytoprotective and genoprotective potential of the extracts and oils of

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> of Bulgaria and 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> have genoprotective effects against 25 μmol/L of hydrogen peroxide in human lymphocytes [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> var. 
 <italic>trigintipetala</italic> Dieck exerted a strong antimutagenic effect against the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C-induced damage in normal human lymphocytes [
