<p>The results outlined regarding 
 <italic>E. angustifolium</italic> having the highest TPC and TFC quantities were not supported by the work of Vukajlović et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], who was able to show that 
 <italic>E. vulgare</italic> presented the highest total antioxidative capacity (TAC) followed by 
 <italic>E. italicum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. rubrum.</italic> Although 
 <italic>E. rubrum</italic> showed the least TAC in these investigations, this species had more significant results in the DPPH, FRAP, and reducing power assays with 78.18 ± 8.73 mg TE/g DW, 122.07 ± 11.30 mg TE/g DW and 638.74 ± 65.40 mg BHTE/g, respectively. There is disagreement within the literature regarding which species has the more antioxidative capacity and presents an opportunity for further investigation.
