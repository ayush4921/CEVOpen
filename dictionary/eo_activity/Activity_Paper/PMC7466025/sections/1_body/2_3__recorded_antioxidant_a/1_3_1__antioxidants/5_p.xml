<p>Interestingly, natural antioxidant activity is influenced by the drying process and extraction methods. Fatemeh Nadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] demonstrated that at an air velocity of 1 m/s at 50 °C, the dried petals showed the highest DPPH values (61.16%). Yet the optimal drying condition was found to be 60 °C and an air velocity of 0.86 m/s, which obtains the optimum level of TPC, TFC, anthocyanin content, and antioxidant capacity. Additionally, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>E. vulgare</italic> flowers showed a moderately higher scavenging hydroxyl radical ability and significant DPPH values (89.3%) compared to the control (78.6%), which relates to a higher antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, growing in metallicolous and nonmetallicolous soil environments influenced the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>E. vulgare.</italic> Plants that were exposed to short-term zinc stress generally showed higher antioxidant activity, as well as total phenolics and flavonoids [
