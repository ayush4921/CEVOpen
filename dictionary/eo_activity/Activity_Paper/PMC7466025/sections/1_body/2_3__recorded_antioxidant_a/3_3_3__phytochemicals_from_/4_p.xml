<p>Phenolic acids are also commonly distributed in 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species. One of the best-characterised compounds isolated from the 
 <italic>Echium</italic> genus is rosmarinic acid, which is found in several 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. russicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. vulgare</italic> [

 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Moreover, when extracted with hot water, 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> petals were shown to have the highest content of rosmarinic acid within these species [
 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Other phenolic acids have been well characterised in 
 <italic>E. russicum,</italic> including salvianolic acid A, rabdosiin, lithospermic acid, and eritrichin (globoidnan A) [
 <xref rid="B38-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. All of these phenolic phytochemicals could explain the ethnomedicinal success of these species and represent a potential source of potent antioxidants, antivirals, anti-inflammatories, and potentially, antibacterial agents, which have limited published biologically related mechanistic data to date.
