  <p>Experimental scheme used to determine the protective effect of GM-90432 against PTZ-induced epileptic seizures in zebrafish larvae and adults. Zebrafish were separated into 4 different treatment groups (G): G1: control group, G2: GMâ€“90432 group, G3: PTZ-induced epilepsy model group, and G4: GM-90432 + PTZ group. At the experimental endpoint, zebrafish were sacrificed for analysis of ROS levels (larva only), and neurotransmitter and neurosteroid analyses.</p>
