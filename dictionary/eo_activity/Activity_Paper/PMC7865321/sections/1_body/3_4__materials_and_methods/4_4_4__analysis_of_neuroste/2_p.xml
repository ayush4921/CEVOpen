<p>LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Waters
 <sup>®</sup> Acquity UPLC I-Class system (Waters Corporation) that interfaced with a Waters
 <sup>®</sup> Xevo TQ-S micro tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation) with electrospray ionization (ESI) source [

 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a Waters
 <sup>®</sup> Acquity UPLC BEH C
 <sub>18</sub> octadecylsilane column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm). The LC conditions for the separation were mobile phase A was 0.2 mM ammonium fluoride in H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and mobile phase B was 0.2 mM ammonium fluoride in MeOH. The gradient program (

 <italic>v</italic>) at the 27 min mark, and held at 80% B (

 <italic>v</italic>) for 3 min. The column was re-equilibrated over 3 min with 30% B (

 <italic>v</italic>). The temperature of the column was maintained at 40 °C. Separated steroid hormones were monitored by positive (for T, DHT, C, Prog, 5α-dihydroProg, and Allo-P) and negative (for E2) electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The source and operating parameters were optimized as follows: capillary voltage of 3 kV (ESI
 <sup>+</sup>) and 4 kV (ESI
 <sup>−</sup>), cone gas flow of 30 L/h, desolvation temperature of 450 °C, and desolvation gas flow of 800 L/h. Quantitative analysis was performed in MRM mode, and peak identifications were achieved by comparing retention times and matching the MS/MS ions. Data acquisition was performed using MassLynx software (V4.1, Waters Corporation).
