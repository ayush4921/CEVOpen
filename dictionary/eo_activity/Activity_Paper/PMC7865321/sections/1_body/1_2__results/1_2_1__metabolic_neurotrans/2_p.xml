<p>One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test were conducted to examine the statistical significance among groups (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01285">Table S2</xref>). The levels of 5-HT (F

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), NM (F
 <sub>(3.44)</sub> = 18.0; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and GABA (F
 <sub>(3, 44)</sub> = 18.5; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) were found to be significantly different, but not altered GLN (F
 <sub>(3,44)</sub> = 0.9946; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.4042) (

 <sub>(22)</sub> = 7.076; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), while G2 displayed a significantly increased E/I ratio, compared to G1 (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 8.798; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In addition, G4 displayed a dramatically attenuated E/I ratio compared to G2 (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 6.081; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (
