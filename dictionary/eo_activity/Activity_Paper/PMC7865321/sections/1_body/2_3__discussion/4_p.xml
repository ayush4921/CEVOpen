<p>In amino acid ligand, previous studies reported that amino acid profiles are altered during epileptic activity in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of epileptic patients [

 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, GM-90432 and PTZ co-treatment (G4) did not show significant changes compared to the PTZ-treated group (G3) in zebrafish. Therefore, we could not determine a pharmacological relationship between neuroactive amino acids and GM-90432 treatment in a zebrafish model of epilepsy.
