<p>Enzyme activities, which can be monitored by measuring the reactions between target enzymes and substrate molecules using radioimmunoassays and/or enzyme immunoassays, describe the functional diversity of biological systems, which is driven by genetic diversity. However, these conventional methods have several disadvantages, such as overestimating cross-reacting antibodies, which limits the applicability of these assays; in addition, the activity of only one enzyme at a time can be examined. In contrast, estimating enzyme activities by examining the ratios of metabolites to precursors based on chromatography-mass spectrometry has better quantitative reproducibility and can be used to investigate broader enzyme activity profiles [
