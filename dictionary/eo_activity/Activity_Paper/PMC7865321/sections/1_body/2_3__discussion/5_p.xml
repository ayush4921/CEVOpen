<p>In cholinergic ligand, several studies have demonstrated that antagonists of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) reduced seizures in rodent models [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Previous animal studies have reported that ACHO and CHO were increased in the cortex and hippocampus, but not in the striatum, due to cholinergic receptor activation in epileptic seizure models [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. On the contrary, our data showed that ACHO levels were increased in PTZ, GM-90432, or co-treatment with PTZ and GM-90432 groups (G2, G3, and G4) compared to controls. Additionally, CHO levels were increased in PTZ alone or PTZ and GM-90432 co-treated zebrafish, compared to controls. Therefore, our results indicated that GM-90432 could not improve cholinergic imbalance as a result of PTZ-induced neurotransmitters alterations in the zebrafish brains.
