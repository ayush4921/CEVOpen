<p>In dopaminergic ligand, several reports have described the role of DA signaling in modulating seizures, suggesting an inhibitory activity on hippocampal excitability via activation of DA receptors [

 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, dopaminergic dysfunction has been detected in both epileptic human brains and animal seizure models. Increased DA levels and firing of DA neurons were observed in temporal lobe epilepsy in rodent models [

 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, our data showed that PTZ exposure significantly increased the DA synthesis pathway in zebrafish, as indicated by PHE to TYR conversion, but this did not lead to increased DA levels compared to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01285">Table S1</xref>); additionally, GM-90432 co-exposure with PTZ did not attenuate these increased levels compared to PTZ-exposed zebrafish. However, PTZ exposure markedly increased levels of NM, which is a DA metabolite, and GM-90432 co-treatment with PTZ decreased NM to levels similar to controls (

 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, our results, which increased NM levels were found in the brain tissue of PTZ-exposed adult zebrafish, were supported by previous findings. We suggest that the neuroprotective effect of GM-90432 against PTZ-induced neurotransmitter alteration may be associated with NM metabolism, but not with the DA synthesis pathway in zebrafish.
