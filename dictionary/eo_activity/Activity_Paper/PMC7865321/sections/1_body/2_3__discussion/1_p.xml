<p>We have previously published the results of a phenotype-based ASD screen of 6566 small molecules, including a variety of pharmacophores, in chemically- or genetically-induced models of epilepsy. Among these small molecules, we identified GM-90432 as a novel pharmacophore for treatment of epileptic seizure, and its pharmacological properties were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. GM-90432 effectively reduced seizure-like behaviors, and regulated EEG and neural activity in PTZ-induced epileptic seizure mouse and zebrafish models. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic assessments suggested that GM-90432 could be used in animal models [
