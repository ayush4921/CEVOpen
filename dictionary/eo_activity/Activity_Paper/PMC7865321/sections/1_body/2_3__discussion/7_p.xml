<p>In serotonergic ligand, seizure modulating activity of TRYP, 5-HT, and 5-HTP on the anti-epileptic effects of anti-depressant drugs has been reported in both human and animal studies [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These findings demonstrated that 5-HT depletion increased seizure susceptibility and neuropathological disorders, and the anti-epileptic effects of drugs were abolished by deficiency of a postsynaptic 5HT receptor subtype. These works suggested that low concentration of 5-HT could be a potential risk factor for epilepsy. In this study, PTZ-exposed zebrafish displayed significantly decreased 5-HT levels compared to controls, and these decreased 5-HT levels were rescued by GM-90432 co-treatment. Therefore, our results demonstrate GM-90432 may have biphasic neuroprotective potential, through serotonergic-mediated anti-epileptic effects and anti-depressant activity.
