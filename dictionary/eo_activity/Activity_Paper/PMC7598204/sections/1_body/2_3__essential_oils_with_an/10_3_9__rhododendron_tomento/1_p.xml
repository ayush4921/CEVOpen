 <italic>Rhododendron tomentosum</italic> Harmaja (Ericaceae) is a small evergreen shrub that is widely distributed in northern and central Europe, North America, and northern Asia. This species has been widely used in folk medicine against arthrosis, rheumatism, pain, wounds, fever, and cough, even if the internal use of its extracts has become rare due to it containing the toxic sesquiterpenoid ledol [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The authors tested the antiproliferative activity of different EOs from 
 <italic>R. tomentosum</italic> on CD4+ and CD8+ limphocytes, which are involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. The pro-apoptotic effects on synovia-infiltrating limphocytes and monocytes or macrophages, which impact rheumatoid-arthritis-affected joint synovium, were also evaluated. In both experiments promising results were obtained.
