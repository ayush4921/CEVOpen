<p>The low toxicity and reduced genotoxicity are some of the advantages associated with the use of EOs [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, due to the structural relationships within each chemical group, the constituents of EOs may undergo cyclization, isomerization, oxidation, and dehydrogenation reactions, which can easily convert them into each other. As a consequence, the chemical compositions of EOs are influenced not only by factors affecting the plant material, such as the growth stage and habitat, but also by the conditions during both the processing and storage of the plant, during distillation, and during the subsequent handling of thee EOs. Their chemical components are subjected to oxidative damage, chemical transformations, and polymerization reactions that generally lead to sensory and pharmacological properties loss. These deterioration reactions have not been completely addressed and need to be taken into account [
