<p>The pharmacological management of both these major forms of arthritis is mostly symptomatic and is aimed at reducing pain and inflammation. This includes the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral glucocorticoids. Current treatment modalities for RA are based on the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine. However, these drugs can cause serious side effects, including gastrointestinal complaints, pneumonitis, and liver function abnormalities. More recently, biologic drugs (antibodies or soluble receptors for IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a) have gained importance in the treatment of OA and RA. These agents are able to reduce inflammation and joint destruction, however besides the higher cost of such new agents, which limits their use, both their long-term side effects and benefits have not yet been fully understood. These drugs are not always effective and severe side effects may occur, such as serious infections and increased risk of cancer. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic drugs (e.g., leflunomide, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide) may be used as well, but these drugs also cause a number of toxic side effects [
