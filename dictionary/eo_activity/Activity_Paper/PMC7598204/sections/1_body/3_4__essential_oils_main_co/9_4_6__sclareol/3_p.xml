<p>Tsai and coworkers assessed the potential therapeutic effects of sclareol on RA using the human synovial cell line SW982 and the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The authors demonstrated that this compound can reduce the IL-1β-induced expression of TNF-α, MMP-1, and IL-6 in the SW982 cell line via attenuating NF-κB translocation and the phosphorylation of MAPK pathways. Moreover, it was demonstrated that sclareol (5 and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was able to improve swelling and bone erosions, and a reduction in the number of Th17 cells was also observed.
