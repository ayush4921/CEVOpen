<p>More recently, El-Sheikh and coworkers assessed the ability of β-caryophyllene to increase the efficacy of methotrexate and leflunomide and to improve their side effects [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Experiments were carried out on FCA-induced arthritic rats. The co-administration of β-caryophyllene and methotrexate or leflunomide significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of these two drugs and also reduced their myelosuppressive and hepatotoxic effects, thus suggesting that β-caryophyllene could be utilized with these two drugs to reduce their side effects or increase their efficacy
