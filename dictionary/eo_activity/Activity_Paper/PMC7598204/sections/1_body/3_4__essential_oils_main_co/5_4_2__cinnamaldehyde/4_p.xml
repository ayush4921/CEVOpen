<p>The antiarthritic activity was also evaluated in a rat model of arthritis by Mateen and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Cinnamaldehyde (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 15 days in collagen-induced arthritic rats. This compound was able to reduce ROS and NO levels and to increase the reduced glutathione level in arthritic rats. It was able to improve the levels of TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-10. The effectiveness of cinnamaldehyde in decreasing the severity of arthritis was also confirmed by histopathological and radiological findings.
