    "<h4>Introduction</h4><i>Achyranthes aspera</i>, <i>Chenopodium murale</i>, <i>Satureja punctata</i>, <i>Rumex abyssinicus</i> and <i>Aloe pulcherrima</i> are traditionally used to treat urolithiasis in Ethiopia. However, there are limited reports on toxicity studies.<h4>Objective</h4>This study was intended to evaluate the acute and sub-acute toxicity effects of plants.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The crude extracts of <i>A. aspera</i> and <i>C. murale</i> leaves, <i>S. punctata</i> aerial parts, <i>R. abyssinicus</i> rhizomes, and <i>A. Pulcherrima</i> gel were prepared using 70 % ethanol. In acute toxicity, 125, 500 and 2000 mg/kg were tested in a stepwise manner; whereas 2000 mg/kg administrated to female rats using gavage during sub-acute toxicity. On day 14 and 28, blood samples were collected from retro-orbital sinus; liver and kidneys of each animal were collected under anaesthesia. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's comparison test of the Graph Pad Prism.<h4>Results</h4>No mortality and significant weight loss for all extracts in both toxicity tests. In acute toxicity, <i>C. murale</i> extract significantly reduced hemoglobin and platelets (P < 0.01) compared with the control. Likewise, <i>S. punctata</i> (P < 0.05) and <i>R. abyssinicus</i> (P < 0.01) extracts revealed significant reduction in platelet count. An exposure to <i>C. murale</i> and <i>R. abyssinicus</i> extracts reduced the concentrations of platelet distribution width and platelet larger cell ratio (p < 0.05) during sub-acute toxicity test. The level of creatinine reduced due to <i>A. aspera</i> extract administrations(P < 0.05). Liver histopathological examinations revealed focal periportal hepatitis following sub-acute toxicity test of <i>C. murale.</i> Histopathological studies of liver demonstrated that <i>R. abyssinicus</i>, <i>A. aspera</i> and <i>S. punctata</i> extracts showed mild acute liver injury. <i>A. pulcherrima</i> was not associated with any toxicity.<h4>Conclusion</h4><i>C. murale</i> extract showed hematological, and histopathological toxicity profiles in rats. Furthermore, chronic toxicity studies of <i>A. aspera</i>, <i>S. punctata</i> and <i>R. abyssinicus</i> extracts would be beneficial to ensure safety."
