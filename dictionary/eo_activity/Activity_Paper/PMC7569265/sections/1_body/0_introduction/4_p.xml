 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and are useful in predicting toxicity effects of phytotherapeutic products or drugs [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The liver is the main target for toxic compounds because of its prior exposure to foreign substances absorbed in the intestine before reaching into the blood circulation [

 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although toxins may harm the liver, it detoxifies toxins [
