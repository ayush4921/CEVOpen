<p id="par0100">Histopathological examinations were done for liver and kidney tissues of the experimental rats. All rats were sacrificed in a humane manner using Isoflurane anesthesia at the end of the 14th day for acute toxicity and at the end of the 28th day for sub-acute toxicity studies. Liver and kidneys were examined macroscopically for its gross pathological changes (lesions developed) due to exposures of test extracts as compared to control groups in toxicity studies. The tissues were microscopically examined for sub-acute toxicity test. In sub-acute toxicity, the tissues were fixed by 10 % buffered neutral formalin solution, and subsequently embedded in paraffin wax. The sections (5 Î¼m thick) were cut using Rotary Microtome 4060E (Germany), and mounted on glass slides and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin to study the histopathological changes [

All fields of the tissue morphology were examined under a light microscope (100x magnification) (Wagtech Thatcham, Berkshire, RG19 4QD, United Kingdom), and the photomicrographs were captured using a digital Camera manually mounted on it (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W180 10.1 M P with 3x optical Zoom, New Jersey, USA) for further reference.
