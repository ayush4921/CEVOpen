<p id="par0180">A significant reduction in the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) following 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> extract administration is suggestive of its anti-urolithic potential of the plant extract similar to a study on 
 <italic>Phyllanthus niruri</italic> extract, which had demonstrated that the decrease in ALP level contributes to a reduction in the number of renal calculi [

 <italic>A. aspera</italic> extract have hepatoprotective activity against paracetamol-induced toxicity at dose 250 mg/kg b.w [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and it is non-toxic administered intraperitoneally in rats [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which is a good indication that would justify its use as an antiurolithic treatment.
