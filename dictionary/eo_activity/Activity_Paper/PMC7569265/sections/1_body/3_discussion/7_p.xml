<p id="par0190">The mode of action of most phytotoxins associated with toxicants is unclear [

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], interfere with nutrient absorptions [
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and being pro-oxidants (inducing oxidative stress or inhibiting antioxidant systems) when there are high doses of phytochemicals such as polyphenols and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Moreover, it has been also suggested that soil contaminants such as heavy metals, aflatoxins, and pathogenic microbes during plant extract preparation causes toxicity [
