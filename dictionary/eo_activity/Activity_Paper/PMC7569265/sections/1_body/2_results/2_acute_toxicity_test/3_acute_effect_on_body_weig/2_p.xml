<p id="par0115">The administration of extracts at 125 and 500 mg/kg body weight to rats resulted in an increase in body weight over time similar to the control group, which indicates that the extracts were not acutely toxic. The extracts of 
 <italic>S. punctata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> did not acutely affect body weight at a given dose 2000 mg/kg body weight in rats. These supports the safety of these extracts at a given dose in rats, which resulted an increase in body weight over time similar to the control group. However, the administrations of 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> and 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extracts at dose 2000 mg/kg were associated with weight loss compared to their initial weight, although it was not significant (
