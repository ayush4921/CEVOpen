  <p>
   <italic>Achyranthes aspera</italic>, 
   <italic>Chenopodium murale</italic>, 
   <italic>Satureja punctata</italic>, 
   <italic>Rumex abyssinicus</italic> and 
   <italic>Aloe pulcherrima</italic> are traditionally used to treat urolithiasis in Ethiopia. However, there are limited reports on toxicity studies.

  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>This study was intended to evaluate the acute and sub-acute toxicity effects of plants.</p>

  <title>Materials and Methods</title>
  <p>The crude extracts of 
   <italic>A. aspera</italic> and 
   <italic>C. murale</italic> leaves, 
   <italic>S. punctata</italic> aerial parts, 
   <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> rhizomes, and 
   <italic>A. Pulcherrima</italic> gel were prepared using 70 % ethanol. In acute toxicity, 125, 500 and 2000 mg/kg were tested in a stepwise manner; whereas 2000 mg/kg administrated to female rats using gavage during sub-acute toxicity. On day 14 and 28, blood samples were collected from retro-orbital sinus; liver and kidneys of each animal were collected under anaesthesia. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's comparison test of the Graph Pad Prism.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>No mortality and significant weight loss for all extracts in both toxicity tests. In acute toxicity, 
   <italic>C. murale</italic> extract significantly reduced hemoglobin and platelets (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the control. Likewise, 
   <italic>S. punctata</italic> (P &lt; 0.05) and 
   <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> (P &lt; 0.01) extracts revealed significant reduction in platelet count. An exposure to 
   <italic>C. murale</italic> and 
   <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extracts reduced the concentrations of platelet distribution width and platelet larger cell ratio (p &lt; 0.05) during sub-acute toxicity test. The level of creatinine reduced due to 
   <italic>A. aspera</italic> extract administrations(P &lt; 0.05). Liver histopathological examinations revealed focal periportal hepatitis following sub-acute toxicity test of 
   <italic>C. murale.</italic> Histopathological studies of liver demonstrated that 
   <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic>, 
   <italic>A. aspera</italic> and 
   <italic>S. punctata</italic> extracts showed mild acute liver injury. 
   <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> was not associated with any toxicity.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>
   <italic>C. murale</italic> extract showed hematological, and histopathological toxicity profiles in rats. Furthermore, chronic toxicity studies of 
   <italic>A. aspera</italic>, 
   <italic>S. punctata</italic> and 
   <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extracts would be beneficial to ensure safety.
