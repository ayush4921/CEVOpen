<p>To determine the effect of α-Cyperone on the growth rate of 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, we used a real-time growth monitoring system (Bioscreen-C, Oy Growth Curves AB Ltd., Helsinki, Finland). The plates were incubated at 37 °C without shaking except for 10-s of shaking before reading absorbance at 600 nm at 30-min intervals. Data were plotted using the GraphPad program.
