<p>Our group used a focused library of medicinal plant-derived compounds earlier [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, this library contains about 600 compounds fractionated on conventional Si-columns. Selected medicinal plants were collected mostly from Tamil Nadu, Southern India and authenticated by an ethnobotanical expert. The library of compounds contain partially purified compounds from ethanolic and aqueous extracts (including conventional Soxhlet distilled) of rhizomes of the 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> plant. A commercial source of α-Cyperone (Cat# A15413) was obtained from AdooQ Bioscience (Irvine, CA, USA) and diluted in DMSO when required. Fluconazole was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in water. Aliquots were stored at −20 °C as recommended.
