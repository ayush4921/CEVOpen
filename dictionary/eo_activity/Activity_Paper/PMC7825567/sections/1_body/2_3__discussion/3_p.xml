<p>Interestingly, α-Cyperone showed synergistic activity with one of the clinical antifungals, fluconazole (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00051-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The synergistic antimicrobial activity can result from the inhibition of two different targets or pathways. Fluconazole affects the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal membrane. EO is also known to affect the cellular membrane by targeting the phospholipid [
