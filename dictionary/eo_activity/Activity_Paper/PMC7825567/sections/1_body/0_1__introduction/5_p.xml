<p>Various health benefiting properties of α-Cyperone have been described. According to Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], α-Cyperone showed a protective effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury/inflammatory response in mice by downregulating the NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways, mainly by upregulating SIRT1. In another study, the neuroprotective effect of α-Cyperone against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in dopaminergic neuronal SH-SY5Y cells was demonstrated [
