<p>Among the various fungal pathogens that affect humans, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the major fungus that is frequently associated with Candidiasis, causing a mortality rate up to 50% [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Humans are a natural reservoir for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which colonizes on the mucosal surfaces (oral, GI, and urogenital tracts) and can disseminate systemically by their yeast-to-hypha conversion, leading to life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Other species of Candida (
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>) also contribute significant infections that are intrinsically resistant to fluconazole [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An emerging Candida fungal pathogen, 
 <italic>C. auris</italic>, is a major concern due to its pan-antifungal resistance, persistence in hospital environments as well as its invasive virulence potential with a high mortality rate (60%) [
