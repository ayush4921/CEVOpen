 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> in normal as well as cyclophosphamide induced immunosuppressed rats. The extracts showed an dose dependent increase in the carbon clearance, humoral antibody (HA) titre, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and white blood cell (WBC) count in a dose dependent manner and authors concluded that the extract was effective to stimulate the immune system and also to protect from the immunosuppressant [
