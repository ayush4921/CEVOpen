<p>Another group of compounds known for their anti-inflammatory activity is alkaloids. They usually contain nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, in a state of negative oxidation, with an amine group that gives them a basic character [

Alkaloids that have a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring are called true alkaloids. Substances with nitrogen atoms not belonging to a heterocyclic ring are called protoalkaloids and substances with and without heterocyclic rings that are not derived from amino acids are called pseudoalkaloids [
