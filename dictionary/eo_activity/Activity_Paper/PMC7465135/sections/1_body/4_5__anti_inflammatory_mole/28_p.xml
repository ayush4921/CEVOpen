<p>Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) formsone of the main groups of mediators of the inflammatory process, through the production of arachidonic acid. By inhibiting the action of phospholipase, the onset of the inflammatory process is inhibited. Besides, free arachidonic acid can be metabolized to various lipid mediators known as eicosanoids via the lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenase pathways [
