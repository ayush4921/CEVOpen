<p>In this context, inflammation is clinically defined as a pathophysiological process characterized by redness, increased heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. These signs occur as a response of the organism to the invasion of infectious agents or physical injury. Both the innate immune response and acquired are involved in the inflammatory process, generating numerous local and systemic effects.

The innate immune system is the foremost defense mechanism against invading microorganisms and cancer cells, involving the activity of various cells including macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells. The adaptive immune systems involve the activity of more specialized cells such as B and T cells which are responsible for eradicating invading pathogens and cancer cells by producing specific receptors and antibodies [
