<p>Thus, arachidonic acid metabolites play a vital role in inflammation. In inflammatory conditions, arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the enzyme phospholipase A2 and metabolized by cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450s (CYPs) to prostaglandins/thromboxane, leukotrienes, and epoxy/hydroxy-metabolites such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and other EpFAs, respectively [

Cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the generation of prostaglandins (PG) from arachidonic acid, which is released from phospholipids of the cell membrane by phospholipase, has an induced form (COX-2) and a constitutive form (COX-1) [
