<p>Investigations involving kaempferol, quercetin, and aromadendrene glycosides and their anti-inflammatory activity due to suppression of NO levels in LPS-stimulated microglial cells indicated that glycosylation attenuated the aglycone suppressor activity. Although attenuated, some of the glycosides, depending on the position and degree of glycosylation, retained the inhibitory capacity of NO production, which suggests that the glycosylation of flavonoids should be considered as an important modulator of biological activity [
