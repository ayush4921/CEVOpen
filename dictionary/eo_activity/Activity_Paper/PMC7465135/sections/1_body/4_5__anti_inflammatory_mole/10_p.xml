<p>Although other authors have shown that the glycosidic portion of biologically active substances may be a crucial factor for their biological activity, in many situations, glycosylation only improves pharmacokinetic parameters [

The presence of methoxyl as substituents in flavonoids may considerably interfere with their anti-inflammatory activity; 41 synthetic chalcones were studied, verifying that the most active structures have a methoxyl in the position adjacent to a carbonyl [
