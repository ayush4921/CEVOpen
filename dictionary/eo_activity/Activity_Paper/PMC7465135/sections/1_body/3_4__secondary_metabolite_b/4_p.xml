<p>The secondary compounds produced from these intermediates are synthesized by biosynthetic routes called the acetate pathway, the mevalonate pathway, and the deoxyxylulose phosphate (DXP) pathway [

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-03726" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Through the acetate pathway, compounds called polyketides are formed (by the condensation of acetic acid units, giving rise to poly-Î²-keto chains). In this class are fatty acids, polyacetylenes, prostaglandins, macrolide antibiotics, and various aromatic compounds, such as anthraquinones and tetracyclines [
