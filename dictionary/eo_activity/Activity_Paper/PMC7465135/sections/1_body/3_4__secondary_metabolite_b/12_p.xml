<p>Flavonoids are a class of polyphenolic compounds that differ from each other according to their chemical structure and particular characteristics. The biosynthesis of these compounds occurs through a via mist, between the shikimic acid and acetate pathways. Shikimic acid is the precursor to the starting compound for the synthesis of flavonoids, phenylalanine. After being deaminated by phenylalanine amonialiasis, this aromatic amino acid produces cinnamic acid, which by the action of 4-hydroxylase cinnamate is converted into p-coumaric acid (4-cumharic) [
