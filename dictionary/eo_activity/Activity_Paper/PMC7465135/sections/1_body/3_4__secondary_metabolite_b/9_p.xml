<p>The shikimate pathway is used only by microorganisms and plants and is a pathway for the synthesis of aromatic compounds, particularly aromatic amino acids: L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan. This pathway starts with phosphoenolpyruvate (from glycolysis) and D-erythrose phosphate (from the pentose pathway or photosynthesis), forming the shikimic acid and this, in turn, gives rise to aromatic compounds. The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine form phenylpropane, which is a basic unit present in many natural products (cinnamic acid, phenylpropanoids, coumarins, lignans, and flavonoids) and, together with tryptophan, are precursors to a wide range of alkaloid structures [
