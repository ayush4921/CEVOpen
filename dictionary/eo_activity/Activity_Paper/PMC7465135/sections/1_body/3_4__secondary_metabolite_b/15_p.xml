<p>Tannins are a class of phenolic compounds of great complexity and importance. They are classified, according to their chemical structure, into two groups: hydrolyzable and condensed [

Gallic acid reacts with ureadin diphosphate-glucose (UDP-glucose), forming the intermediate Î²-glycocalin, which gives rise to 1,2,3,4,6-pentagaloyl-
