<p>Thus, with such distinct precursors of biosynthetic origin, it is easy to understand the complexity and structural diversity of this class of metabolites, with more than 5000 alkaloids known today. Alkaloids are classified according to the amino acid that provides both the nitrogen atom and the fundamental part of the moleculeâ€™s skeleton. The aromatic amino acids histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine give rise to alkaloids with indole, isoquinolinic nuclei and anthranilic acid gives rise to quinolinic, quinazolinic, benzoxazinic alkaloids [
