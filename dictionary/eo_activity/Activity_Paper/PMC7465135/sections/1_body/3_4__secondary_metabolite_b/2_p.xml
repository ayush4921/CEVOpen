<p>Shikimic acid is synthesized from a combination of phosphoenolpyruvate (via glycolysis) with 4-phosphate erythrosis (pathways pentoses or photosynthesis) and is a precursor to hydrolyzabletannins, coumarins, alkaloids derived from aromatic amino acids and phenylpropanoids, compounds that have the presence of an aromatic ring in common.
