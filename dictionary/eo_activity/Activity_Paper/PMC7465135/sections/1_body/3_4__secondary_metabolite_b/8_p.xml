<p>Saponins are glycosides of steroids or polycyclic terpenes. For aglycone, they are called steroidal saponins and triterpene saponins. Tripterpenic saponins correspond to a triterpenoid carbon skeleton pentacyclic, formed by the epoxidation and cyclization of squalene, in the conformation chair-chair-chair, and then carboxylations, oxidations, oxidation of methyl groups, the appearance of formyl (-CHO) or hydroxymethyl (-CH
 <sub>2</sub>OH) groups may occur [
