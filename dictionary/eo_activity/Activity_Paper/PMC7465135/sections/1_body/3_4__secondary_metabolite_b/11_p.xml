<p>Chromones are heterocyclic compounds, which consist of the fusion of a benzene ring with a pyrone ring. The simplest compound in this family is the chromone itself (4
 <italic>H</italic>-chromen-4-one, 4
 <italic>H</italic>-1-benzopyran-4-one). The most abundant natural chromones are those that have substituents in the C2 and C3, by another benzene ring, being called flavones and isoflavones, respectively, and for this reason, their inclusion in the group of flavonoids is recurrent. These compounds constitute an important set of biologically active substances, mostly of natural origin, being present in great abundance in the plant kingdom [
