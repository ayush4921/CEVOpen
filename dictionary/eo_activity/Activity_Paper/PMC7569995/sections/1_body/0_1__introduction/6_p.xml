<p>Only a limited number of these species have been subjected to phytochemical studies. They have been carried out outside Kurdistan, mostly by research groups working in Turkey, Iran, and India, where the same plants are commonly used in the local traditional medicine. The results of these investigations have been summarized in the first part of this inaugural paper on secondary metabolites from 
 <italic>Verbascum</italic> plants occurring in Kurdistan. The literature reported in Reaxys and Google Scholar databases until April 2020 has been reviewed. In the second part of this paper, we describe the preliminary results of our study on the content of a methanol extract of 
 <italic>V. calvum</italic> flowers.
