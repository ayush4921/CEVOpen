<p>Powdered air-dried flowers of 
 <italic>V. calvum</italic> (210 g) were suspended in hexane (1.25 L). The flask was immersed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then left at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the mixture was decanted and filtered. This process was repeated 3 times; the extracts were combined and the solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue (A, 1.78 g, 0.85% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) was stored at 4 °C, protected from light. Subsequently, the biomass was extracted with MeOH (1 L). The mixture was immersed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then left at room temperature for 1 h; subsequently, the mixture was decanted and filtered. This process was repeated 3 times, each time using a fresh amount of solvent (1 L). The extracts were then combined and the solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum. The resulting residue (B, 35.5 g, 16.9% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) was stored in a vial at 4 °C, protected from light. Finally, the biomass was extracted with 800 mL of a mixture of MeOH/ H
 <sub>2</sub>O (70:30), following the procedure previously described 3 times. The extracts were then pooled together and the methanol was removed by a rotary evaporator; the residual aqueous phase was finally lyophilized to give a crude residue (C, 16.05g, 7.6% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) that was stored in a vial at 4 °C, protected from light.
