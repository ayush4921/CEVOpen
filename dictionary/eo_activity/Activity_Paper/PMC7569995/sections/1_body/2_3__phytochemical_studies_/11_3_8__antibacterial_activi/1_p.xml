<p>The antibacterial activities of B’ and C’ against bacteria 
 <italic>Staphylococus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), 
 <italic>Staphylococus mutans</italic> (ATCC 25175), 
 <italic>Staphylococus pyogenes</italic> (ATCC 19615), and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 10356) were determined as the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), both expressed in µg/mL. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibits the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation, whereas the MBC corresponds to the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that results in bacterial death after sub-culture onto an antibiotic-free medium. Gentamicin was used as the positive control. Each strain was first incubated for 18–20 h in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB; Oxoid LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) at 37 °C. The culture thus obtained was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to separate the cells from the culture medium. The culture medium was removed and the cells were resuspended in IsoSensitest Broth (ISB; Oxoid LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England). Subsequently, the bacterial suspension was appropriately diluted to obtain an absorbance of 0.2 at 655 nm, measured by a spectrophotometer (Jasco-320 Uvidec Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). This absorbance corresponded to a concentration of microorganisms in the range of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>–1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU /mL.
