 <sub>3</sub> solution), and 20:180, 30:170, 40:160, 50:150 (plant extract: gold (III) chloride trihydrate solution) produced aggregation of the nanoparticles upon formation, and were not considered further in this study. Agglomeration of nanoparticles have been reported to produce more irregular shapes, which could be linked to increase concentration of reducing agent [

 <sub>3</sub> (1 mM) or 10 mL of AECR/CECR and 190 mL aqueous solution of gold (III) chloride trihydrate (1 mM) were more suited for the synthesis of AgNPs and AuNPs with sharp intense peaks at 470 and 540 nm, respectively (
