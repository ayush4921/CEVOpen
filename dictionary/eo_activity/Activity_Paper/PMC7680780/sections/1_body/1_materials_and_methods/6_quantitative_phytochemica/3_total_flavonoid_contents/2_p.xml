<p id="p0080">The total flavonoid contents (TFC) of the extract and nanoparticles were measured by aluminum chloride colorimetric assay according to a method described by Zhishen et al. [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with slight modifications. Extract or nanoparticles (1.0 mL, 105 μg/mL) was mixed with 1.0 mL AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (5%). The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min, after which 2.0 mL NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (7%) was added. Thereafter, 1.0 mL sodium hydroxide (1%) was added to the reaction mixture, and the absorbance was read at 510 nm against a blank. Results were calculated from standard curve obtained using varying concentrations of quercetin (5–20 μg/mL) in methanol and expressed in mg of quercetin equivalent (QE) per g sample.
