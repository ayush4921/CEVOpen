<p id="p0090">The ability of the nanoparticles to inhibit lipid peroxidation was carried out according to a method described by Ruberto et al. [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, 0.1 mL of egg yolk homogenate (10% v/v) was added to 0.5 mL of varying concentrations of the nanoparticles, extract or ascorbic acid (standard) in test tubes. The volume in each test tube was made up to 1 mL with distilled water. Afterwards, 0.05 mL ferrous sulfate was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, 0.5 mL acetic acid-thiobarbituric acid reagent prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide was added. The resulting mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then allowed to cool and centrifuged at 650 ×
