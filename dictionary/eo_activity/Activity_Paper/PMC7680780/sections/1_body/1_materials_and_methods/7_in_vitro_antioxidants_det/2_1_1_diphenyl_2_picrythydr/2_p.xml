<p id="p0085">The DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay was performed according to a method described by Shirwaikar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with some modifications. Two mL solution of 0.1 mM DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> (in methanol) was added to 2 mL of various concentrations of each nanoparticle, plant extract, or ascorbic acid (standard). An equal amount of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> and methanol served as control. The reaction mixture was kept in the dark at 30 °C for 20 min, and the absorbance recorded read at 517 nm. The experiment was performed in duplicates. The % scavenging activity was determined by 
 <xref rid="fd1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. (1)</xref>:
 <disp-formula id="fd1">
  <label>(1)</label>% DPPH radical scavenging activity = [(Abs of control –Abs of sample) / (Abs of control)] x 100
 </disp-formula>where Abs of control = absorbance of DPPH radical + methanol, Abs of sample = absorbance of DPPH radical + sample/standard.
