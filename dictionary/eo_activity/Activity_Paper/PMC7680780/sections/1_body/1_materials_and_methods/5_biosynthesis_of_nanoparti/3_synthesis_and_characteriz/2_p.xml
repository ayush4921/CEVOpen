<p id="p0050">Green synthesis of AgNPs was carried out by adding 10 mL AECR (0.1 g extract/mL distilled water) or CECR (from section 
 <xref rid="sec2.3" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref> above) to a beaker containing 90 mL aqueous solution of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> (1 mM) solution on a hot plate at 50 °C, and continuously stirred for 20 min using a magnetic stirrer. The synthesized nanoparticles were centrifuged twice at 15,000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min after each washing with distilled water. This was done to remove unbound and excess plant materials in the mixture. The pellet was left overnight at room temperature to air dry, and then kept at 4 °C until further use.
