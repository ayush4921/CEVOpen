<p id="p0040">Two different aqueous extraction methods (maceration and decoction) were considered for 
 <italic>Crassocephalum rubens</italic>. In the maceration, using laboratory extraction method, 10 g of powdered dried leaves of 
 <italic>Crassocephalum rubens</italic> was soaked in 100 mL of distilled water at room temperature for 24 h. It was then filtered using cheese cloth, followed by Whatman filter paper (number 1). This was freeze dried and the concentrate (cold aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Crassocephalum rubens</italic> (AECR)) was stored at 4 °C until use. In the decoction, using traditional extraction method, 10 g of 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaves was boiled in 100 mL distilled water at 100 °C for 45 min. This was thereafter filtered using cheese cloth, and thereafter with Whatman filter paper (number 1), and then centrifuged at 10000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, to remove undissolved particulates. The supernatant (hot aqueous crude extract of 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> (CECR)) was kept at 4 °C until further use.
