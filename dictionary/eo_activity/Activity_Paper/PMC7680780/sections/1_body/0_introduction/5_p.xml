<p id="p0025">Decoction (using traditional) and maceration (using laboratory) methods of aqueous extraction were considered in this study because it has been reported that combination of phytochemicals in plant diet may be more efficient than isolated compounds in cancer chemoprotection [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In quest for finding possible solution to free radical related diseases, it is imperative to try several means to explore cost efficient, less toxic, and targeted therapies. Aqueous medium was considered in this study, as it is the most preferred medium for household consumption and traditional herbal preparation. It is, therefore, necessary to synthesize nanoparticles using aqueous medium for 
 <italic>C.Â rubens</italic> extraction, and investigate the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities of the biosynthesized AuNPs and AgNPs. This will provide preliminary information on the effect of the biosynthesized nanoparticles 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and thus its potential use in nanomedicine.
