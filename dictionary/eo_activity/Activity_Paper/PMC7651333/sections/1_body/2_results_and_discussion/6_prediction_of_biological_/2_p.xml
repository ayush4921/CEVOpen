<p>PASS is used to estimate the probable biological activities of drug-like compounds (Filimonov et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Different biological activities, including anti-viral activities, were assessed by determining the Pa and Pi values. The PASS analysis of standard drugs and bioactives from the medicinal plants is presented in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0001 t0002 t0006" ref-type="table">Table S6.1 and S6.2</xref>, respectively. The Pa value towards 1, indicates the ligand is probably ‘active’, whereas the Pi value implies that the ligand is probably ‘inactive’. Approximately seventeen proposed biological activities were determined. The results have shown that some of the medicinal plant bioactives can act as potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant. However, most of the standard drugs have shown different anti-viral properties, at the same time, some of them also have shown immunostimulatory properties. The chosen bioactives also exert various biological activities, which can act as complementary medicine during the COVID-19 disease.
