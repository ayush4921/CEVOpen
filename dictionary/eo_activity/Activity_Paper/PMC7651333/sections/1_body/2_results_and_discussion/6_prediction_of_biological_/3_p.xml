<p>Similarly, the BAS of the selected medicinal plant bioactives were evaluated for various biological ligands and enzymes. It is known that if the BAS of a ligand is &lt; −0.50, then it is inactive on that target receptors, likewise, if BAS is −0.50 to 0.00, ligands are moderately active, and if BAS is &gt;0.00, then it is biologically active against human receptor and proteins like GPCRs, ion channels, nuclear receptor, proteases and kinases (Mishra et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Our results of selected medicinal plant bioactives exhibited biological activities and have a physiological effect. Further, standard drugs were shown to have high activity towards protease inhibition, similarly, the selected medicinal plant bioactives also demonstrated moderate to high activity against protease inhibition, apart from having an activity like enzyme inhibition, and interaction with nuclear and GPCR ligand receptors as shown in Supporting Information
