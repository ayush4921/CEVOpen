<p>The drug-likeness property is an essential parameter to find the ability of a compound to become a drug. Based on the Lipinskiâ€™s rule of five (RO5), we have analyzed the drug-likeness properties of eight standard drugs (

 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among them, bioactives from medicinal plants having a maximum of three violations were selected for analyzing other pharmacological features since the selected standard drug Nelfinavir has shown three violations. Seven bioactives (daturaolone, deoxytubulosine, gallotannins taraxerol, tinosporide, withametelin, withanolide A) have qualified the features of drug-likeness with maximum acceptable violations of three, as highlighted in
