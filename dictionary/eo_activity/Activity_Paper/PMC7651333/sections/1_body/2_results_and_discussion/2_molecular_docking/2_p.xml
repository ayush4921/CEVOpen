<p>Molecular docking is a computational approach to predict the binding efficiency, and types of interactions between the ligand and receptors (Kamath et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Salam et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The bioactives from several medicinal plants, which are traditionally known to have various health benefits, were investigated in the present study and compared their BE with the standard drugs. Among the standard drugs, nelfinavir, an anti-retroviral and protease inhibitor, has shown a stronger affinity towards all three targets of SARS-CoV-2 with the BE of −8.3 kcal/mol for M
 <sup>pro</sup>, −6.6 kcal/mol for S-protein and −6.4 kcal/mol for ACE2 (Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Many medicinal plant bioactives have also shown a higher binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 targets compared to standard drugs. For example, emblicanin A had BE of −9.3 kcal/mol with M
 <sup>pro</sup>; rutin had BE of −8.2 kcal/mol with S-protein and echinacin had BE of −7.8 kcal/mol with ACE2 (Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Based on the overall BEs of the standard drugs and medicinal plant bioactives, we have set −8.5 kcal/mol, −7.0 kcal/mol and −6.5 kcal/mol as the threshold BEs for M
 <sup>pro</sup>, S-protein and ACE2 receptors, respectively. The threshold BEs were used to select the medicinal plant bioactives having a higher binding affinity towards target proteins. We have chosen the bioactive that had shown higher binding affinity against at least two or more potential targets with the minimum fixed threshold BE for further analysis. Based on these criteria, 15 medicinal plant bioactives, out of sixty screened, were having equal or more binding affinity with more than two targets of SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted in Supporting Information
