<p>In the ACE2-nelfinavir complex (Supporting Information video S5), the nelfinavir is stable in the entire study. In the ACE2-taraxerol complex study (Supporting Information video S6), the taraxerol molecule is flipping from the docked position in early stages around 1.7 ns, then become stable and change its orientation around 84 ns simulation. The RMSD plot of ACE2-nelfinavir and ACE2-taraxerol shows that the overall structure of ACE2-nelfinavir is relatively more stable than the ACE2-taraxerol complex structure during the course of the MD simulation (
