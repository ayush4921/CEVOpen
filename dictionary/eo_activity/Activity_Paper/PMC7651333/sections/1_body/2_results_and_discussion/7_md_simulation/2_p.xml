<p>Unrestrained MD simulations were performed for M
 <sup>pro</sup> with nelfinavir, M
 <sup>pro</sup> with withanolide A, S-protein with nelfinavir, S-protein with taraxerol, ACE2 with nelfinavir and ACE2 with taraxerol complexes, each for 100 ns. In the M
 <sup>pro</sup>-nelfinavir complex, nelfinavir is fairly stable throughout the simulation at the binding pocket (Supporting Information video S1). Similarly, in M
 <sup>pro</sup>-withanolide A complex (Supporting Information video S2), withanolide A molecule is stable and remains inside the pocket. From the RMSD plot, it is evident that the backbone of the M
 <sup>pro</sup> did not converge in both cases. The RMSD of the M
 <sup>pro</sup>-nelfinavir complex is sampling higher values after 70 ns, whereas in M
 <sup>pro</sup>-withanolide A complex, the RMSD is reaching a maximum of around 40 ns, then is stable at 4 Å minimum and gain the stability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). Since the stability of ligand binding at its pocket is evident from the simulation videos, the fluctuations in the RMSD are likely due to changes in the regions other than its catalytic site; hence, these do not alter our main discussion points.
