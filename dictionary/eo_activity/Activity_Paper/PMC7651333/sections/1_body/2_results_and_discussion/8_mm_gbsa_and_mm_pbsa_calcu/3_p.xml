<p>In addition to that, we analyzed the contribution of each residue to the BE using the decomposition tool present in the AMBER: MM-GBSA method. Forty residues of M
 <sup>pro</sup> has shown significant interaction with nelfinavir and/or withanolide A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). Among those His41, Met49, Met165 and Gln189 are common residues that showed favorable binding energies with the medicinal phytochemical compounds. Apart from that Thr25, Leu29, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, His164 and Gln189 of M
 <sup>pro</sup> showed good interaction with nelfinavir, and Ser46, Leu50, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189, Asn142 and Cys145 of M
 <sup>pro</sup> showed higher binding energies with withanolide A. Recent studies on M
 <sup>pro</sup> with bioactive molecules from the tea plant, showed similar interactions (Bhardwaj et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Among those residues, His41 and Cys145 form a catalytic dyad located at the interface between domains I and II, and most of the remaining residues are involved in substrate binding and dimerization (Goyal &amp; Goyal, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Thr478, Pro479, Cys480, Asn481, Gly482 and Val483 of S-protein show better binding energies with nelfinavir, whereas the taraxerol have significant binding energies at three different positions Ser359-Val363, Cys391-Phe392 and Pro521-Cys525 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>). Recent mutagenesis studies identified that Arg439, Lys452, Leu455, Ala475, Glu484, Phe486, Gln493, Gln498, Pro499 and Asn501 of S-protein play a major role in human ACE2 binding (Yi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and these residues are closely matching with our results. It is also interesting to note that the taraxerol is having reasonable binding energies with three cysteine residues (Cys361, Cys391 and Cys525), which play role in stabilizing the secondary structure of S-protein (Lan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The ACE2 complexes, His34 and Phe28 of ACE2 are the two major amino acids that have a higher binding affinity with nelfinavir and taraxerol, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>). Interestingly His34 of ACE2 is the common residues interacting with both SARS-Cov S-protein and SARS-Cov-2â€‰S-protein (Lan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
