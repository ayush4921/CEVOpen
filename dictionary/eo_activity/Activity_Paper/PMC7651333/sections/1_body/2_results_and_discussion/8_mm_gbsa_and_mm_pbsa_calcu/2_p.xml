<p>Binding free energies calculated using MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA methods are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> for all the six complex molecules. Initial 10 ns frames or omitted for equilibration, and a total of 900 frames out of the remaining 90 ns simulations were used to obtain the free energy all the systems. In terms of MM-GBSA M
 <sup>pro</sup>-nelfinavir showed the highest energy (–51.7 kcal/mol). M
 <sup>pro</sup>-withanolide A (–27.9 kcal/mol), ACE2-nelfinavir (–26.3 kcal/mol) and ACE2-taraxerol (–26.2 kcal/mol) showed similar energies. In terms of MM-PBSA, ACE2-taraxerol (–7.3 kcal/mol) showed the highest affinity than other complex molecules. The BE versus time graphs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B–D)</xref>) is drawn for all the complexes. In terms of M
 <sup>pro</sup> complexes, both nelfinavir and taraxerol showed similar energies, whereas the ACE2, and S-protein complexes, taraxerol shows better binding energies than the standard drug nelfinavir. It should be noted that taraxerol has only one hydroxyl and seven methyl groups attached to the pentacyclic triterpenoid. The taraxerol possess anti-tumor (Hong et al.,
