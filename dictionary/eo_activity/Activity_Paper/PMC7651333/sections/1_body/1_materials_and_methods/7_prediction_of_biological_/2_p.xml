<p>The biological activity scales for the ligands of medicinal plants and standard drugs were predicted by using the Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) program (Filimonov et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Briefly, the Canonical SMILES of ligands were used in the PASS-Way2Drug server (

The bioactivity score (BAS) for the selected bioactives from medicinal plants and standard drugs was predicted using Molinspiration web-based tool (

This web-based tool provides BAS against human receptors and protein molecules like GPCRs, ion channels, nuclear receptors, proteases and kinases.
