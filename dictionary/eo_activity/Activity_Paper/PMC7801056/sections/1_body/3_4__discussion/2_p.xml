<p>There is growing evidence that z-guggulsterone was involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway to prevent cancer growth [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We also found that z-guggulsterone dose-dependently induced apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells. Our results also indicated that active caspase-3 and proapoptotic protein Bax expression was increased, while antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased in SGC-7901 cells under treatment of z-guggulsterone, indicating z-guggulsterone has a proapoptosis effect through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway [

 <italic>β</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> regulate apoptosis in various cancer cells and are associated with carcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. VEGF is a characteristic factor for angiogenesis and cell viability during cancer progression [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results indicated that z-guggulsterone dose-dependently raised the level of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and reduced the levels of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 and VEGF in gastric cancer cells. In the future, we would like to make clear the underlying mechanism for z-guggulsterone-induced TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> increase as well as TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 and VEGF decrease, which might be through their transmembrane receptors [
