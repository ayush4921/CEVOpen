<p>Gastric cancer causes increasing cancer-related deaths throughout the world. The chemotherapy used to treat gastric cancer kills not only cancer cells but also normal cells by inducing toxicity and apoptosis. As a promising herbal medicinal agent, z-guggulsterone has been investigated thoroughly to cure numerous malignancies including gastric cancer [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Z-guggulsterone has been investigated to function as an antagonist of FXR to inhibit cell survival and induce cancer cell death [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the role of z-guggulsterone in the cell apoptosis of gastric cancer is not completely clear. Our results indicated that the expression of FXR and its downstream target SHP is higher in SGC-7901 cancer cells compared with GES-1 normal gastric cells. Z-guggulsterone greatly attenuated the high expression of FXR and SHP. Meanwhile, the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells was greatly suppressed by z-guggulsterone dose-dependently. However, compared with SGC-7901 cells, gastric epithelial cells GES-1 were minimally affected by z-guggulsterone.
