<p id="Par3">Among women, after lung cancer, cancer of the breast is the second source of mortality. About 40,610 women passed away from cancer of the breast and about 252,710 more diagnoses were projected in 2017 (Bajaj et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>). Cancer of the breast accounts for about 24% of all cancer types in females (Xiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>). A likely population of people with breast cancer has similar features such as older age, lack of prolonged breast feeding, adding weight, overdue age at first birth, lack of exercise, etc. (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>). Detailed investigation of pathways and mechanisms on how cancer spreads and discovering many anti-cancer agents have made a breakthrough in the treatment of cancer (Bhaumik et al.
