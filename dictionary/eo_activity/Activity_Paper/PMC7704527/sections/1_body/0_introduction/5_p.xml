<p id="Par6">Chemotherapy remains one of the best and fast clinical options though it is often limited due to undesirable toxic effect including weight loss, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and so on, making it urgent to develop more effective drug candidates with less toxicity to eradicate this disease (Iqbal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>). The computer-aided drug design approach saves time and ensures better effectiveness of the drug candidate. This research would be aimed at exploring the novel derivatives of imidazolone by building a mathematical model (QSAR) that predicts the anti-proliferative activities from its compound and using plk1 receptor with the derivatives to understand their interactions via molecular docking studies towards anti-breast cancer drug discovery, concentrating on breast cancer treatment with less toxicity and more effectiveness.
