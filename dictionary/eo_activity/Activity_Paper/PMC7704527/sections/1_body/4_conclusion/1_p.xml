<p id="Par58">2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazole-5-ones derivatives showed a more reliable anti-cancer drug candidate against MCF-7 cell line using QSAR analysis, molecular docking assessment, and pharmacokinetics analysis. The model 1 parameters obtained from QSAR showed that increasing MATS4e and RDF150u, and decreasing GATS5e and SPMAX4_Bhs would proliferation the biological activities of the inhibitors 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones derivatives as an effective drug for curing breast cancer. The strength and predictive capability of the generated equation was explored for both internal and external validation assessment which conforms with the least approved values, indicating that model number one parameters could be used in developing new 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones drug compounds with higher effectiveness. The model parameters (MATS4e and GATS5e) had more significant and based on their mean effect, adjustment were made on the fragments of the lead compounds (2 and 4) to design 18 new imidazole derivative compounds with a higher calculated activity against MCF-7 cell line.</p>
