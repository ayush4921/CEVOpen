<p id="Par55">Again in compound 24, ARG136 and ASP 139 gave covalent hydrogen interaction at a distance of 2.60978A
 <sup>0</sup> and 1.99045A
 <sup>0</sup>. Two electrostatic bonds occur with the compound at LYS82 (4.16479A
 <sup>0</sup>) and ASP194 (1.99045A
 <sup>0</sup>). It formed a hydrophobic bond with PHE64 (5.25545A
 <sup>0</sup>), MET98 (4.1282A
 <sup>0</sup>) also, the pi-orbital containing delocalized electrons in the benzene ring interact with the alkyl groups of PHE64 (4.85386A
 <sup>0</sup>), CYS67 (5.47383A
 <sup>0</sup>), ALA65 (5.17103A
 <sup>0</sup>), MET98 (5.26908A
 <sup>0</sup>), ALA80 (5.26908A
 <sup>0</sup>) three amino acids of PRO384 (5.1107A
 <sup>0</sup>, 4.7845A
 <sup>0</sup> and 4.7531A
 <sup>0</sup>) to form a hydrophobic bond. Both the hydrogen bond and the hydrophobic interactions in the complexes showed that ligand 24 and 27 of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazole-5-ones derivatives are most active against Polo-like kinase 1(PKL1) in complex with B16727 respectively.
