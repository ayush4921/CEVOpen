 <sub>50</sub> underwent molecular docking studies with the receptor Polo-like kinase 1(PKL1) in complex with B16727. The receptor used was obtained from Protein Data Bank (Code: 3FC2) and was set using Discovery studio software, the ligand (compounds) were also converted to PBD format as shown in Fig.Â
