<p>The neuroprotective effects of xanthotoxin and umbelliferone on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats were evaluated [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Alzheimer’s disease was induced in these animals and both compounds were administrated, proving to prevent cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze and object recognition tests. In addition, both compounds reduced the activity of hippocampal AChE and the level of malondialdehyde, increasing the glutathione content. These coumarins also modulated neuronal cell death by reducing the level of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the overexpression of inflammatory markers (nuclear factor κB and cyclooxygenase 
 <bold>II</bold>), and upregulating the expression of NF-κB inhibitor (IκB-α). An attenuation of cognitive dysfunction by these compounds was observed. This effect can at least be attributed to the inhibition of AChE and the reduction of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss, opening a new door for these classic coumarins.
