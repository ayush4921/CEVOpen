<p>There is also an abundant bibliography related to the interest of coumarins as antimicrobials. Most of the projects are still inspired by the classic antibiotic novobiocin. There are several works in which antibacterial activity is found due to the presence of an azole ring introduced in different positions of the coumarin system. Articles have been published recently on the antibacterial activity of azole–coumarins, as well as 3/4/7 substituted arylcoumarins (
