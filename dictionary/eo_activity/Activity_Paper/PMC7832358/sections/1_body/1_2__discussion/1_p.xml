<p>Searching for the word “coumarin” in Mendeley, PubMed, and SciFinder in early November 2020, and filtering by year “2020”, more than a thousand references appeared. Another search was conducted in late December to include as much information as possible in this manuscript. A diversity of journals from different fields publishes research articles and reviews related to the biological interest of both plant extracts containing coumarins and/or synthetic molecules based on this scaffold. Hybrid molecules containing different pharmacophores [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] like piperazines or pyrazolines [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are at the top of the list. For simplicity, in the current review the information is organized taking into account the potential pharmacological/biological applications of coumarin derivatives.
