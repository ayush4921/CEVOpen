<p>In addition, it is worth highlighting the design of hybrids in which one part of the molecule provides fluorescent properties, and another provides therapeutic action (theranostic). Such is the case of the fusion of a 7-aminocoumarin fluorescent ring with a chalcone fragment (

 <bold>V</bold>). This molecule is an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs), presenting high antitumor activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.6 Î¼M), and is also used as a diagnostic agent [
