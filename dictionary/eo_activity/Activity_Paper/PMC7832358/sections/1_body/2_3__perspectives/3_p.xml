<p>Due to the length of this general overview, synthetic strategies for obtaining new coumarins have not been discussed in detail. To find information on the most recent synthetic pathways, we recommend the manuscripts by Molnar and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and Kovaƒç and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], both from 2020. To find an overview of the wide range of biological activities of coumarins, a 2020 review by Pinto and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is strongly recommended. Finally, to find information on the most recent analytical methods (fundamentals, instrumentation, purification and quantification applications, optimization of experimental conditions, emerging ecological methods, etc.) we recommend the review by Xue-song and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].
