<p>Coumarins belong to a privileged family for biomedical proposes. Their simplicity, chemical properties, and the efficiency of the synthetic routes to obtain a wide range of substitution patterns make these compounds highly attractive and versatile for medicinal and biological chemists. To date, and during 2020, more than a thousand research articles and reviews containing information on coumarins appear in the PubMed, SciFinder, and Mendeley databases. The number of research groups working on this scaffold, and the impact of the results, highlight the potential of these molecules. Special attention has been paid to the potential of coumarins in drug design, as well as to fluorescent probes. This last application seems to be the most promising field of research for the next few years, since several coumarin derivatives have shown great potential in the decaging of prodrugs (drug release) and for diagnostic purposes.</p>
