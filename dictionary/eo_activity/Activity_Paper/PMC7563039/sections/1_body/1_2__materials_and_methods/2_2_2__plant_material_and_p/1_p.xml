<p>The wampee was collected in the fully matured stage in 2018 from Hainan Province, China. The plant was authenticated by Professor Min Li in Hainan Tropical Ocean University (Sanya, China). A voucher specimen (No. 20180630) has been deposited at the herbarium for Research and Development of Natural Plants, Hainan Tropical Ocean University (Sanya, China). After being washed with water and air dried, the seed, peel, and pulp were separated, then continuously lyophilized, and finally powdered with an electric blender. The leaf was air dried and then powdered with an electric blender. The different parts of the wampee (pulp, leaf, seed, and peel powders) were then vacuum packaged and saved at −20°C for further use. The four kinds of wampee powders were suspended in sterilized distilled water at 4°C [

After centrifuging, the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman filter paper No. 1 to remove any remaining debris, evaporated by a lyophilizer (Lyph Lock6 Model 77595-01; Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA), and stored at −80°C. The four lyophilized extracts were dissolved in a culture medium and filtered through a 0.22-
