<p>And then, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity in HGF was examined. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is also the active ingredient in tooth bleaching agents [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which has been reported to stimulate irritation, ulceration on the gums [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and toxic effects on human gingival fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our previous study assessed the catalase activities among MC3T3-E1, human dental pulp cells, HGF, and L929 cells. The highest activity was detected in HGF cells, which explained the reason that HGF cells are more resistant to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity than other cells, such as human pulp cells [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, we used a relatively high concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the present study to assess the effects of wampee extracts on the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced HGF cell model. All extracts significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity generated by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the greatest protective effect was obtained by the treatment with the leaf extract; moreover, the protective effects were in the following order: leaf extract &gt; seed extract &gt; peel extract &gt; pulp extract. In addition, the F-actin staining, which is required for cell movement and changes in cell morphology, was consistent with the cell-protected effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The leaf extract maintained the cell morphology and actin staining similar to control cells at both 0.5 and 5 mg/mL concentrations.
