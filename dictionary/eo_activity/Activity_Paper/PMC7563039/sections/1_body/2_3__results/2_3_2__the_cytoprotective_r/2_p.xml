<p>The cytoskeleton has an important role in maintaining the cell morphology and in migration. F-actin was stained by phalloidin in HGF cells treated with the different wampee extracts and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated cells were mostly apoptotic, and F-actin staining was not performed compared to the control group. When combined with the different wampee extracts, F-actin staining showed that the cells recovered from the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity. Especially in the leaf extract-treated group, the HGF cells had a normal morphology both in the 0.5 and 5â€‰mg/mL in combination with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> groups.
