<p>To investigate whether the aqueous extracts of the different wampee parts influenced the cell viability, HGF cells were exposed to the aqueous extracts at different concentrations (50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h, and then, the cell viability was measured by WST-8 assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, all of the aqueous extracts of wampee showed no cytotoxicity at concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. In addition, wampee seed extract at higher concentrations of 1000 and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL induced 27% and 23% increase in cell viability, respectively, compared to the control group. Therefore, we further explored the effect of the four extracts on HGF cell proliferation. The seed extract increased the cell proliferation at the 1000 and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL concentrations during the 48 and 72 h treatment, similar to the trend during the 24 h treatment, demonstrating the continuous effects of the seed extract on the HGF cell proliferation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The pulp extract enhanced cell proliferation at 1000 and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL statistically significant during 48 h compared to the medium-treated control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The leaf extract effectively increased the cell proliferation at relatively high concentrations, but it did not last up to the concentration of 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). The peel extract decreased the cell proliferation at lower concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>).
