<p>Recently, studies on wampee have given more attention to its bioactive benefits, and antioxidant activity was one of them. The studies on the antioxidant activity used mostly wampee extracts of organic solvents [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and little is known about the comparison of cellular antioxidant activities among the aqueous extracts of different wampee parts. Therefore, the aims of this paper were to compare the cytoprotective effects among the pulp, seed, leaf, and peel aqueous extracts of wampee in human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells under oxidative stress and to monitor the effect of the wampee extracts on promoting oral wound healing for further in vitro and vivo studies.
