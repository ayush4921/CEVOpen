<p>Formalin is a commonly used irritant to induce acute and sub-acute inflammation. The activity of analgesic and antipyretic drugs, capable of inhibiting inflammation in the mouse foot after formalin, may well be owed to their antifibrinolysin action. It is also possible that inhibition of formalin induced inflammation is due to inhibition of the action of bradykinin released by the injured cells. This initiates the release of substances such as prostaglandins, serotonin, and histamine causing capillary hyperpermeability leading to edema.
