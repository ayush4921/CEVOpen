<p>In the hot plate method, at 120 min the recorded latency significantly raised for morphine and OI400. Likewise comparable percentage inhibition was observed between the two groups. Pharmacokinetic difference to induce peak activity was also observed between OI400 and MO10 where MO10 peaked at 60 min while peak activity of OI400 was observed at 120 min. The lag time might be attributed to the time it takes for the extract to reach to the systemic circulation; furthermore perhaps it takes time for the metabolism of an active metabolite that has analgesic activity. Alternatively, the consistency of pharmacokinetics across the experimental groups might explain the direct relationship observed between the observation time and percentage inhibition. As the hot plate method is a specific central antinociceptive test, the extract may partly exert its effect via the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) of the central nervous system which may induce the release of endogenous peptides.
