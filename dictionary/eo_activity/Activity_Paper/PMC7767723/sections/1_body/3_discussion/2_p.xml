<p>The hot plate evaluation is a typical test that uses heat stimulation to induce pain and considered as a vital tool to examine centrally coordinated analgesic pathway. The main benefits of this model are the precision of the outcome, its sensitivity to most effective analgesics, minimal tissue injury, and limited time consumption.

Both are considered as supraspinal integrated response and determining the involvement of central antinociceptive mechanism.
