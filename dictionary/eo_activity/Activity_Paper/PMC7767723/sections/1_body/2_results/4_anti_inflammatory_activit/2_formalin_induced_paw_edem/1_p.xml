<p>All doses of 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>O. integrifolia</italic> (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) resulted in significant decrease (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in paw volume across all days starting from day two (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). OI400 significantly reduced paw edema compared to the other doses of the extract (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) while OI200 showed better effect than OI100 (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) at the seventh day. Furthermore, higher percentage inhibition of edema was observed as 15.8%, 27.3%, and 34.1% for OI100, OI200 and OI400 respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>). However, all doses of the extract showed lower effect than the positive control (ASA150).
