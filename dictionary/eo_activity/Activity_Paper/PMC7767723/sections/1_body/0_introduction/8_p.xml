 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It consists of terpenes in the form of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. The reported terpenes include axinyssene, otostegindiol, pretostegindiol, pentatriacontane, and stigmasterol.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In addition, Tesso and König reported trans-Sabinol, β-cyclocitral, dihydroedulan, and theaspirane from the leaves of 
 <italic>O. integrifolia</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> From these compounds otostegindiol was found to possess antimalarial activity.
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> From the genus 
 <italic>Otostegia, O. fruticosa</italic> and 
 <italic>O. persica</italic> exhibited essential analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Accordingly, the aim of this research was to examine whether the experimental plant possesses analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, this investigation may serve as a benchmark for future examination and isolation of different phytochemicals responsible for the observed effects.
