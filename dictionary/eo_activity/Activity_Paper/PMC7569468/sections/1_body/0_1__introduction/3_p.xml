<p>Plants produce a mixture of compounds known as secondary metabolites that have different biological and pharmacological properties. These secondary metabolites are known to have antioxidant potential that is important for maintaining this oxidative balance. These molecules may be obtained from different plant tissues such as leaves, bark, roots, and fruit [
