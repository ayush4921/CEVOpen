<p>Moreover, 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been shown to be an excellent model for identifying toxicity in chemical compounds. There are some assays that may show toxicity, such as egg hatching and nematode development [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The results obtained showed that EE and WE were not toxic because they did not affect egg hatching, and these extracts had a protective effect against oxidative stress when t-BOOH was used as a stressor agent. These extracts increased survival by 28% for 1 mg/mL EE, 31% for 1 mg/mL WE, and 42% for 10 mg/mL WE compared to that of the control animals. Yue et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] observed that 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid was able to reduce oxidative stress in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> as well as increase its life span in oxidative stress conditions, similar to what was observed in EE and WE. Choubey et al. [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] showed different activities from gallic acid due to its antioxidant potential. Thus, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, gallic acid, and vitexin may be some of the bioactive molecules present in our extract that have antioxidant potential and no toxicity, as observed in the data presented here for 
 <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> extracts.
