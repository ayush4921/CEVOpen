 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has an impermeable cuticle, which is an extracellular matrix of collagen, forming a multifunctional exoskeleton, which makes the passage of substances difficult [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because of this, higher extract concentrations were used compared to cell line assays. Considering the results obtained with antioxidants and with cell lines, the extracts, EE and WE, were selected for evaluation. For this model, 1 and 10 mg/mL extract concentrations were used to evaluate the possible toxic effect on egg hatching (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Compared to the control, which had 70% egg hatching, both extracts, WE and EE, had a similar effect at 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, ranging from 70% to 91% (

 <italic>C. elegans</italic> model.
