<p>Bioinformatics is an excellent tool for data mining from potential targets considering the two bioactive molecules that were identified in the 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts: vitexin and isovitexin. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to identify possible targets for these bioactive molecules. These molecules may be associated with pathways related to the immune system, cardiovascular disease, signalling pathways, cancer, nervous system, and others. More than 32 targets were observed (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). When the overlap between targets was analysed, several gene targets such as IKBKB, PTGS2, RELA, TNF, MAPK7, AR, and NF-B were observed (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the bioinformatics approach suggested that the bioactive molecules identified in 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> may have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
