<p>TLC analysis revealed that the presence of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and their compounds may be associated with antioxidant activity observed in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. When the chromatoplates were revealed using sulphuric vanillin, colourful spots of saponins (CE, EE, ME, and WE), and terpenes (CE, EE, and ME) were observed. Furthermore, the chromatoplates in contact with ferric chloride solution developed spots that suggested the presence of phenolic compounds in the polar extracts (EE, ME, WEE, and EE), and with the Natural A Reagent, the presence of flavonoids in the polar extracts was observed (EE, ME, WEE, and WE). In order to identify some compounds present in polar active extracts, standards were used in co-TLC analysis, and vitexin (Rf = 0.51, green fluorescent) and isovitexin (Rf = 0.40, green fluorescent) were detected in the EE and ME. The presence of phenolic and flavonoids in all polar extracts, especially EE and ME, was observed.
