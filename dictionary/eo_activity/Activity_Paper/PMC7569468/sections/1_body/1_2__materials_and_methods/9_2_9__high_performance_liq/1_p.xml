<p>The WE was analysed by HPLC-DAD (Agilent 1260) equipped with a C18 column (Zorbax—150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.×3.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m). The elution was done with a gradient of 0.1% acetic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) as follows: 10% B (0-6 min), 10 to 15% B (6-7 min), 15% B (7-22 min), 15 to 50% B (22-32 min), 50 to 100% B (32-42 min), and 100% B (42-50 min), at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The sample was prepared at 1 mg/mL using methanol (HPLC grade), and the volume of injection was 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>L. The column temperature was 45°C, and detection was done at 228, 254, 280, 290, 320, 340, and 352 nm. The identification of phenolic compounds was obtained by comparison of retention time and UV-visible absorption spectra with standard compounds.
