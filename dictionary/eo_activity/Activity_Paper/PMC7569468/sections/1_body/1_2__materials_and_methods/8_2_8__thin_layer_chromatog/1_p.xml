Compound visualization was achieved by spraying solutions of sulfuric vanillin, 0.5% Natural A Reagent (difenilboriloxietilamina), 1% ferric chloride in methanol, and Dragendorff. The standards used at TLC were as follows: quercetin, ursolic acid, gallic acid, isoquercetin, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, isoquercitrin, luteonin, canferol, rutin, caffeic acid, catechin, orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, and isovitexin (Sigma-Aldrich purity ≥ 95%). Then, the color was observed, and the retention factor (Rf) of spots measured and compared with literature [
