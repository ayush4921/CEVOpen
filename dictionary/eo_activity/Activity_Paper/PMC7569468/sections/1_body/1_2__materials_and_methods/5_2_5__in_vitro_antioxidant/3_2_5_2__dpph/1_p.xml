<p>The antioxidant activity was determined by the ability of the antioxidants present in the samples to scavenging the radical DPPH [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The extract was added at concentration of 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DPPH (0.1 mM). The mixture was mixed vigorously, and it was allowed to stand at room temperature during 30 min. Then, the absorbance was then measured at 517 nm. The blank control was ethanol 99.5% (Synth, Brazil), and the negative control was distilled water. The DPPH scavenging activity was calculated as follows: Scavenging activity (%) = [(1 − (sample − blank))/negative control] × 100%.
