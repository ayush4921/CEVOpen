<p>The antioxidant activity was measured considering the reduction of Mo
 <sup>+6</sup> to Mo
 <sup>+5</sup> by the plant extracts and subsequent formation of a green phosphate/Mo
 <sup>+5</sup> complex at acid pH. The extract concentration used was 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL that was mixed to the 600 mM sulfuric acidammonium molybdate), and it was incubated at 100°C for 90 min [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. After this time, the mixture was kept at room temperature to cool down, and the absorbance was measured at 695 nm. The results were compared to the negative control (distilled water). The total antioxidant capacity was expressed in equivalents of ascorbic acid (EAA/g).
