<p>The assay is based on the ability from the extracts to inhibit the photochemical reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) into riboflavin-light-NBT system [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To do this, the extract at concentration of 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was added into 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 13 mM methionine, 100 mM EDTA, 75 mM NBT, and 2 mM riboflavin. After, the mixture, the solution was exposed for 10 minutes to a fluorescent lamp. The change of color to blue was due to formazan production, and it was monitored by absorbance at 560 nm. In the spectrophotometer. EDTA was used as a control and distilled water as blank. Results were expressed as percent scavenging:
