 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), indicating that people perceive very few risks associated with the consumption of the aforementioned wild food plants. Another attribute for which the species obtained very high scores was the spatial availability. The medicinal potential and temporal availability attributes had the lowest score averages for the species (values less than 2.5). Thus, although people generally perceive wild food plants as highly available in space, they also indicate that parts of plants used as food are offered for a short period.
