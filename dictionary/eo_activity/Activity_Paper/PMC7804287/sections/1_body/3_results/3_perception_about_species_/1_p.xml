<p id="Par45">The local perception of plants' biological and ecological attributes has shown to be a good predictor of knowledge about these plants. The attributes of wild food plants influence local ecological knowledge, since the plants with the highest perceived potential are also the plants known to a greater number of people (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.36; p &lt; 0.05; AIC = 30.9) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In general, the attributes measured from the local perception were not correlated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This means that, when assigning scores to plants, people are actually guided by different motivations for each parameter. Exceptions were identified for the relationship between commercial potential and medicinal potential (rs = 0.77; p &lt; 0.01), ease of collection and absence of adverse effects (rs = -0.60; p &lt; 0.05), and taste and medicinal potential (rs = 0.58; p &lt; 0.05). However, in none of the cases did the correlation reach values greater than 0.8, which is usually indicated as the threshold for autocorrelation.
