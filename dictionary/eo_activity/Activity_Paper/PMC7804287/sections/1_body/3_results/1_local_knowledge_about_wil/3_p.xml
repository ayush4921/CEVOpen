<p id="Par32">Of the 13 wild food plants cited by more than one respondent, the majority (69.2%) is shrub, tree or arborescent. Herbaceous plants (14.4%) and climbing plants (15.4%) were less important. Most of the plants occur in the forests of the region. However, local farmers have devoted efforts to promote these plants in gardens, backyards and other anthropic areas. Thus, there is a certain overlap in the collection sites, as 76.9% are collected in forest areas, while 53.8% are collected in the fields, roadsides, vacant lots or in other anthropic areas.</p>
