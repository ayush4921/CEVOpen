<p id="Par7">Thus, this study aimed to provide a simple framework to identify wild food plants with potential for popularization based on local knowledge and perception, especially among potential consumers in urban areas. Such identification can help intensifying the trade of these plants by farmers and extractivists and contribute to income generation in the field. We based our framework on identifying attributes that may influence the odds for popularization and, subsequently, we focused on how people value the species for each attribute. Previous studies included some of the attributes proposed in this study. Pieroni et al.
