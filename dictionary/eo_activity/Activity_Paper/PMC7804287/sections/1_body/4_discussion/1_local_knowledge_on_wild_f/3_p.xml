<p id="Par48">When people from different geographical backgrounds converge to a place, it is plausible to expect that the richness of plants mentioned is relatively high, since each individual's biocultural knowledge would be added. However, the richness of food plants that were found in the Dom Helder settlement was lower than the values found in most studies on local or metacommunity scales in Brazil

A study on medicinal plants observed that there are temporal limits in the retrieval of information by the interviewees, so that people tend to cite mainly the plants they used in the last year

 </sup>. Thus, memory may have served as a filter, so that, of the plants taught by parents or grandparents outside the context of the settlement, only those occurring on the site were actually mentioned.
