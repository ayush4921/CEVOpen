<p id="Par71">A possible bias in our framework could exist if the attributes measured from the local perception were highly correlated. This could indicate that people would always be assigning the highest scores to the same plants, regardless of the attribute considered, that is, without there being any greater reflections about each attribute itself. Thus, the absence of high correlations between the attributes indicated independence between the factors analyzed, which, in our view, reinforces the framework used. However, depending on the local context, highly correlated variables can be excluded and other variables can be included to access the potential of wild food plants, such as post-harvest resistance and the temporal availability of the part of the plant used for food
