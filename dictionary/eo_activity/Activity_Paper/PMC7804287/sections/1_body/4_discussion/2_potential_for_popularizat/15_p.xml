<p id="Par67">The indication of 
 <italic>D. trifida</italic> as the species with the greatest nutritional potential converges with the fact that, among the four prominent plants, it obtained the highest caloric value in nutritional studies, between 100 and 112 Kcal

 <italic>D. trifida</italic> has higher levels of iron and copper than other tubers such as yams, potatoes and macaxeira

 </sup>. However, considering the high genetic variability, some varieties of 
 <italic>D. trifida</italic> have lower levels of anthocyanins in the tubers, and, consequently, a lower pigmentation, which seems to be the case of the strains present in the Dom HÃ©lder settlement (inhame da mata branco and inhame da mata roxo). Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate, from a genetic and chemical point of view, the individuals of 
 <italic>D. trifida</italic> occurring in the study area.
