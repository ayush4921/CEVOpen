<p id="Par25">We calculated the average scores for each parameter assessed during the interviews. They were calculated from the sum of the scores attributed by the interviewees divided by the number of people who mentioned the plant. Thus, to avoid bias due to idiosyncratic information, we excluded the plants that were cited by only one interviewee from the analysis. We also calculated the average overall score for each plant and the average overall score for each attribute.</p>
