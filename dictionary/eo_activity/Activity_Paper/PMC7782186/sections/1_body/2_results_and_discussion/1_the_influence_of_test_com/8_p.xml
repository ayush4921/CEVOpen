 </xref>. Normal zebrafish embryos hatch between 48 and 72 h post-fertilisation, and the ability to hatch may be stimulated or inhibited by various factors, including molecular pharmaceuticals

 </xref>. The hatching rates of zebrafish embryos, exposed to each test trifluoromethylated fused triazinone (
 <bold>I–VIII</bold>) and pemetrexed at different concentrations, are presented in Figure S1 in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2020.1865944" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supplementary material</ext-link>. It was shown that the hatchability of embryos is not significantly affected by the compounds 
 <bold>I–VIII</bold> or pemetrexed at concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> when compared to the control group. Almost all the embryos from both untreated and treated groups hatched between 48 and 72 h post-fertilisation. However, the hatching rates were delayed in the compounds/pemetrexed groups exposed to 25 and 50 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> concentrations. Interestingly, even at the highest concentration, all living embryos were hatched out from the chorion at 96 h post-fertilisation (in case of 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold>) or 120 h post-fertilisation (in case of 
 <bold>III</bold>). In turn, a significant inhibition of hatching was observed in the embryos treated with the trifluoromethylated fused triazinones substituted by the 3,4-dichlorophenyl and 
 <italic>para</italic>-chlorophenyl at 
 <italic>N</italic>8 (i.e. 
 <bold>VIII</bold> and 
 <bold>VII</bold>, respectively) as well as pemetrexed. At the highest concentration almost all the embryos exposed to 
 <bold>VII</bold>, 
 <bold>VIII</bold> and pemetrexed were unable to hatch up to 120 h post-fertilisation.
