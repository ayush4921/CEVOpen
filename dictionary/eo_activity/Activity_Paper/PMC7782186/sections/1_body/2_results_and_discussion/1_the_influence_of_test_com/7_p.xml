<p>Additionally, the maximal non-lethal concentration (MNLC) – denoting the maximum concentration used which does not result in a statistically higher mortality rate of zebrafish embryos/larvae than in the control group during the experiment – for each examined trifluoromethylated fused triazinone (
 <bold>I</bold>–
 <bold>VIII</bold>) and pemetrexed was established (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It was proven that the molecules 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold> (with the MNLC from 20 to 8.3 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) are less toxic than pemetrexed (with the MNLC = 4.2 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>), while the toxicity of compounds 
 <bold>III</bold> and 
 <bold>VII</bold> (with the MNLC = 6.7 and 5 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively) is close to that of this anticancer drug. Among all the compounds tested, only 
 <bold>VIII</bold> (with MNLC = 3.3 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) was found to be slightly more toxic than pemetrexed.
