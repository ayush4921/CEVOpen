<p>The caspase-5, -6 and -8 levels were evaluated employing Human Caspase-5, -6, -8 (CASP5, CASP6, CASP8) ELISA kits (based on the double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which were purchased from SunRed Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China). All the reagents, standards as well as cell culture supernatants were prepared according to the instructions that were given in the manufacturer kits. Lysates of normal (i.e. Vero) or tumour (i.e. A549, HeLa, T47D) cells were obtained as a result of the thermal shock repeated three times (from liquid nitrogen i.e. −186 °C to 37 °C). Both untreated (controls) and treated (with each test compound at a concentration close to the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, i.e. 50 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) cell lysates were used in the bioassay. These ones were added to the micro ELISA plate wells that were pre-coated with the Human CASP5 or 6 or 8 monoclonal antibodies. Next, the biotinylated detection antibodies specific for the individual caspases and the conjugate of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase were added successively. The immune complex which was formed was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Each plate was washed five times with a washing buffer to remove the uncombined enzyme. After adding the chromogen A and B solutions, the incubation was still continued at 37 °C for 10 min in the darkness. Then, a stop solution was added in order to terminate the enzyme-substrate reaction. All the optical densities, being proportional to the concentration of particular caspases, were determined within 10 min on an ELISA reader (BIO-TEC Instruments, USA) at λ = 405 nm. The human caspase-5, -6 and -8 levels (in ng mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were calculated employing the standard curves for the particular caspases.
