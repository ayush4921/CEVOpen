<p>As soon as possible after fertilisation, the eggs were transferred into Petri dishes (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) containing a fresh E3 medium. After washing and removing debris, only viable fertilised eggs with a round chorion were placed into 24-well sterile cell culture plates (Costar, Corning Inc., USA) (five embryos per well). Each well contained 2 ml of the test solution at a respective concentration or the E3 medium alone. Twenty embryos were used for each concentration of compound/pemetrexed. An equal number of embryos untreated with any compound/pemetrexed was employed as the control group. Throughout the experiment, all the covered plates with embryos/larvae were kept in the incubator at static conditions at 26 ± 1 °C up to 120 h after fertilisation.</p>
