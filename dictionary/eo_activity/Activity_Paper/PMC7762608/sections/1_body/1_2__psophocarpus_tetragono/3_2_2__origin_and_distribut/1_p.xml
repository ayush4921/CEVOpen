<p>Winged bean, a domestic plant, is distributed in South East Asia, in the countries situated between India and Papua New Guinea, along with some African countries. The relation between 
 <italic>Psophocarpus tetragonolobus</italic> and other 
 <italic>Psophocarpus</italic> species is mainly identified depending on morphology [

However, comparing the genetic makeup of these plants will be a more reliable approach that can help to identify the wild ancestor of this plant. Till now, different theories are suggested concerning the origin of this plant. Southeastern Asia was suggested as an origin because the plant was cultivated in this area for a long time. However, the progenitor was not known and it was assumed to be extinct. 
 <italic>Papua New Guinea</italic> is another possible origin due to the large repertoire of genetic varieties of plants in this country. Winged bean was also found to be similar to some African plants in terms of morphology, cytology and pathology [
