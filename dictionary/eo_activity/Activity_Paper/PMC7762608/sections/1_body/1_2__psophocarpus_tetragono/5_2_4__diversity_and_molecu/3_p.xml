<p>Comparison of gene expression between winged bean plants contrasted for their tannin production revealed more than 1000 differentially expressed genes. This result allowed developing and cultivating cultivars with low tannin content [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, twenty-two mutations were found with desirable outcomes in terms of morphology and chlorophyll content. However, these mutants were sterile. A gene that has anti-fungal effects (class III chitinase) was shown to be expressed in the roots of winged bean plants [
