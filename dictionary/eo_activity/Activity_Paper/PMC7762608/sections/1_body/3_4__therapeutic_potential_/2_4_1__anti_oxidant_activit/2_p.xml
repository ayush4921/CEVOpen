<p>A 75% methanol extracts and its ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, petroleum ether, and the methanolic plant extracts all showed an antioxidant activity. By ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP() and ferric thiocyanate (FTC) techniques, the ethyl acetate fraction of the methanolic extracts had the highest antioxidant activity and the highest phenolic content (1.7 mg GAE/g) compared to the chloroform fraction and the methanol extract itself. However, by the 2,2â€²-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay, the chloroform fraction had the highest antioxidant activity. 
 <italic>n</italic>-Butanol and petroleum ether extracts were proved to have anti-oxidant activity using ABTS and FRAP assays, and the phenolic content was shown to be correlated with the anti-oxidant activity.
