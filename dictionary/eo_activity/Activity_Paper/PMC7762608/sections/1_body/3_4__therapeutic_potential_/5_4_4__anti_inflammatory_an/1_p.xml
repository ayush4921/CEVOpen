 <italic>Psophocarpus tetragonolobus</italic>. The anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities of the plant extracts were evaluated by using Griess assay and by measuring the number of writhing response of mice upon acetic acid induction respectively. All plants showed significant nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity upon IFN-Î³/LPS treated macrophages in a concentration-dependent way without causing cytotoxicity to RAW 264.7 cells; in addition to that all plants lead to the suppression of writhing response of mice at different degrees of inhibition (10.7 to 43.1%) at 0.2 g/kg [
