<p id="Par8">Not surprisingly most of the fragments—including all 48 covalent ones—bind in the active site. Interestingly, two fragments that bind covalently to the active-site cysteine were expected not to be covalent; the bromoalkyne “warhead” they contain (Fig.

 </sup>. The fact that these compounds modify the enzyme illustrates how susceptible the active-site cysteine is to modification, which could auger well for drug discovery. That said, the multiple recently approved kinase inhibitors all target noncatalytic cysteines

 </sup> and few approved covalent drugs target active-site cysteine residues. That fact speaks to the importance of 23 non-covalent fragments which collectively explore many individual subpockets within the large active site. Indeed, recent fragment-based efforts against another cysteine hydrolase, USP7, led to two classes of potent, noncovalent inhibitors
