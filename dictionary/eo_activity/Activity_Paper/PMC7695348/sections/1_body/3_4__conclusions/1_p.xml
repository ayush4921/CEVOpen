<p>In this paper, we described the design, synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial screening of 20 new fluorinated chalcones. Most of the compounds displayed promising antibacterial and antifungal activities and two compounds bearing indolyl scaffold, i.e., 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold>, showed potential activities and were also non-toxic on the normal human liver cell lines (L02). Additionally, compounds bearing electron-withdrawing nitro or the chloro substituents at the ortho or the meta position showed valuable antimicrobial activity. Hence, these compounds are novel lead compounds identified through our study for the development of novel agents against bacterial and fungal infections. Although the present study gave us some lead molecules, future investigation needs to be done by synthesizing analogues of 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> by replacing the indole scaffold of 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> with benzofuran and benzothiophene moieties as well as by substituting more lipophilic -SCF
 <sub>3</sub> for -OCF
 <sub>3</sub> in 
 <bold>B3</bold>. Further, a plausible mode of action for the proposed activities needs to be investigated.
