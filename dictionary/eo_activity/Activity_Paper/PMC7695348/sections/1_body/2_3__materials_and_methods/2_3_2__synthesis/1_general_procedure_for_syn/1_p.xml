<p>The two series of chalcones were prepared (

 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Initially, 1 mmol of the ketone (4′-trifluromethyacetophenone/4′-trifluromethoxyacetophenone) was dissolved in 8 mL of ethanol. To the above solution, 1 mmol of the corresponding aldehyde was added and then 7.5 mL of 40% sodium hydroxide solution was added dropwise and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature for about 6–15 h. The progress and the completion of the reaction was monitored on precoated silica gel-G TLC plates and the spots on the plates were visualized using UV lamp and iodine vapors. After the completion of the reaction, the contents of the reaction mixture were transferred into a beaker containing crushed ice and then the mixture was neutralized with 50% hydrochloric acid, which resulted in the separation of the crude precipitate of the chalcone. The precipitate was filtered under vacuum, washed thoroughly with HPLC grade water, and dried in a desiccator. The dried crude mixture was further subjected to column chromatographic purification to obtain the pure product. Column chromatography was performed on 100–200-mesh silica gel as the stationary phase and a 1:15 ratio of hexane and ethyl acetate as mobile phase.
