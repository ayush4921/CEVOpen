<p id="Par5">In this study, 10 candidate reference genes were chosen from the transcriptome sequence of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, and their expression profiles were investigated in different tissues and under diverse treatments. Four different software tools, GeNorm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], NormFinder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], BestKeeper [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and RefFinder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], were applied to appraise the expression stabilities of them under diverse experimental conditions. Additionally, two target genes, 
 <italic>SbF6H</italic> (flavone 6-hydroxylase) and 
 <italic>SbF8H</italic> (flavone 8-hydroxylase), were applied to verify the applicability of the recommended reference gene. The results of this study will guide the option of appropriate internal reference genes under specific experiment condition for acurate quantification of the relative transcription levels of interest genes in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>.
