<p id="Par8">Total RNA was isolated by the plant rapid RNA isolation kit RP3501 (BioTeke Corporation, Wuxi, China) and quantified by a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) to measure absorbance ratios. Only RNA samples with A260/A280 of 1.8–2.1 and 260/A230 &gt; 1.8 were used for cDNA synthesis. RNA integrity was observed on 1% agarose gel. The synthesis of cDNA was carried out by taking 1.0 μg of total RNA with a PrimeScript RT kit (Takara, Kusatsu, China). All the cDNA samples were diluted with enzyme-free ultrapure water (1:20) and subjected to qRT-PCR.</p>
