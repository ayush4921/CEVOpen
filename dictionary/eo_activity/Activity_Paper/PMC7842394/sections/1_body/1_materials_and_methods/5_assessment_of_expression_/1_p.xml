<p id="Par11">GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder, four conventional software tools for evaluating the stability of the candidate reference genes, were applied under various experimental conditions. The raw Ct values were transformed to relative quantities (Q) applying the following method: Q = 2
 <sup>−△Ct</sup>, where △Ct = each corresponding Ct − minimum Ct [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Then, the Q-values were input into GeNorm and NormFinder to calculate stability values (SV). GeNorm uses the average stability value (
 <italic>M</italic> value) to evaluate the expression stability, which involves the average pairwise variation between each reference gene and others. Genes with 
 <italic>M</italic> &lt; 1.5 are generally regarded as stable. Moreover, the GeNorm pairwise variation (V) values (Vn/Vn + 1) were applied to define the most appropriate reference gene number. The recommended value is ≤0.15 when opting for an appropriate number of genes [
