 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> seeds were collected from Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, China. They were drenched in running water for 12 h to soften the seed coat, and then planted in pots (3–5 plants per pot) filled with soil mixture and grown in a greenhouse (23 ± 2 °C, Natural light, 60–75% humidity). Three-month-old seedlings received abiotic stress and hormone treatments.
