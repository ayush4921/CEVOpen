<p id="par0195">Favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamid, AviganÂ®) is an antiviral drug that selectively inhibited the RdRP of influenza virus [
 <xref rid="bib0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. It showed specific activity against all three influenza A, B, and C [
 <xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The primary mechanism of action of favipiravir against the influenza virus was through specific inhibition to vRNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Favipiravir functions as a purine homologue, where vRNA polymerase mistakenly recognizes favipiravir-RTP as a purine nucleotide resulted in inhibition of viral RNA synthesis [
