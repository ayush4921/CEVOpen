<p id="par0115">The activity of polyphenols derived from 
 <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> against 3-chymotrypsin-like and papain-like coronavirus cysteine proteases were discussed by Ji-Young Park et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Many polyphenols were discovered to be more potent as inhibitors of papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) than those of 3-chymotripsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) [
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Among these polyphenols, papyriflavonol (
 <bold>22</bold>) (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ) was discovered to manifest the most potent inhibitory activity against PL
 <sup>pro</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.7 μM while C-5-alkyl group (prenyl)-substituted flavan (
 <bold>23</bold>) was the most potent against SARS- CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> which was proven to be more effective than quercetin derivative (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.7 μM).
