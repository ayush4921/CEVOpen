<p id="par0060">In an extensive study, more than 200 Chinese medicinal herb extracts were screened for antiviral activities against (SARS-CoV) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) [

 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic>, 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyrrosia lingua</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lindera aggregata</italic> showed potent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV strain BJ001 with 50 % effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) 2.4 ± 0.2, 34.5 ± 2.6, 43.2 ± 14.1, and 88.2 ± 7.7 μg/mL, respectively. Among those extracts, 
 <italic>L. radiata</italic> extract showed the best inhibition effect in SARS-CoV bioassay guided fractionation yielded lycorine (
 <bold>4</bold>) as the main bioactive components (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for lycorine (
 <bold>4</bold>) was found to be 15.7 ± 1.2 nM. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> of lycorine (
 <bold>4</bold>) in Vero E6 and HepG2 cells were 14980.0 ± 912.0 and 18810.0 ± 1322.0 nM, respectively [

 <bold>4</bold>) can cause toxic effects at low doses in canines’ model (∼ 1 mg/kg), further development of this compound as a potential drug candidate is needed, and the mechanism of its antiviral activity is still not clear [
