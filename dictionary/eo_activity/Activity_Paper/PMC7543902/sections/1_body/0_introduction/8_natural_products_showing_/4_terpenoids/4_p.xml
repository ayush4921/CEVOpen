<p id="par0145">Saikosaponins isolated from medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Bupleurum spp.</italic>, 
 <italic>Heteromorpha spp.</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scrophularia scorodonia</italic> have been reported to produce various biological activities including antihepatitic, antinephritic, antihepatomic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antibacterial effects [

The cytotoxicity of saikosaponins A, B2, C, D and actinomycin D on MRC-5 cells using the XTT assay indicated no cytotoxic effect on the cells at concentrations of 2.5 μM/L. Saikosaponins (A, B2, C and D) were examined for their anticoronaviral activity, where saikosaponin B2 (

 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The percentage viral inhibition for 0.25, 2.5, and 25 μM/L saikosaponin B2 was 35.7 ± 0.7, 63.0 ± 0.8, and 100.0 ± 0.2 %, respectively. The mechanistic studies show that saikosaponin B2 inhibits HCoV-229E infection in a dose- and time-dependent manner, block viral penetration into cells, and interfere with the early stage of viral replication, such as virus absorption and penetration.
