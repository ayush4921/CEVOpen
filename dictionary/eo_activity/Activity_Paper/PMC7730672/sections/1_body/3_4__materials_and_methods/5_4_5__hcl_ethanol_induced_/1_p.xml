<p>Acute gastric ulceration was induced by HCl/ethanol administration according to Mizui and Doteuchiâ€™s method [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, Stillen 300 mg/kg (positive control), IFE 100 mg/kg, and IFE 300 mg/kg. Stillen (Dong-A ST Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea), an ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Artemisia asiatica</italic>, has been approved for gastritis treatment in Korea and has been shown to exert gastroprotective effects against various inducers [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Doses of IFE 100 and 300 mg/kg were selected based on the traditional dose range of Inulae Flos in Asian folk medicine. As the aim of this study was to provide a scientific basis for traditional use, we converted the daily human consumption to rats, based on body surface area [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The daily human dose of Inulae Flos ranges from 12 to 100 g/day [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Given the extraction yield and body surface area, the rat doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg/day correspond to human doses of 15 and 45 g/day. IFE or Stillen was orally administered at a volume of 10 mL/kg body weight after overnight fasting. The control rats were administered distilled water (vehicle), using the same regimen. One hour after treatment, 1.5 mL of 150 mM HCl/60% ethanol solution was orally administered, and, 1 h later, rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia. The stomach of each rat was removed quickly and incised along the greater curvature.
