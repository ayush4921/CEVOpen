<p>This study had some limitations. First, it is difficult to draw a solid conclusion on whether the IFE re-established gastric mucosal homoeostasis, because a normal control group was not included in this study. Thus, it is necessary to confirm the gastroprotective effect of the IFE with a normal control group. Second, in this study, we used an HCl/ethanol-induced rat gastric ulcer model, which resembles gastric lesions caused by alcohol consumption. As gastric ulcers can also be induced by several factors, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, and ischemia [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], further studies are needed to investigate the effects of IFE in various ulceration models. Third, in this experiment, as the low dose of IFE, i.e., 100 mg/kg, had a high gastroprotection effect (90.7%); thus, further studies are needed to determine the lowest effective dose. Finally, we did not identify the active components of IFE for gastroprotection against HCl/ethanol-induced ulceration. However, it is known that sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids, the main compounds of 
 <italic>I. Britannica</italic>, are responsible for its various pharmacological effects [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular, 1-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylbritannilactone, the major sesquiterpene lactone in 
 <italic>I. britannica</italic>, exerts gastroprotective effects in caffeine-arsenic ulcers [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and flavonoid compounds are responsible for the antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>I. britannica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Based on these previous findings, sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids might be responsible for the gastroprotective effects of IFE, and further studies are needed to address this limitation.
