<p>The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant potential of 6-gingerol with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In short, 1 ml of 6-gingerol (100 to 600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in distilled water was added to different tubes having phosphate buffer (2.5 ml, 0.1 M, pH = 6.6). Now, potassium ferricyanide (2.5 ml, 1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was added to each tube. After proper mixing of solutions, the mixtures were incubated at 50°C for 20 min. At the end of incubation, 2.5 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%) was included to each solution, and solutions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Subsequently, 2.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and was mixed with 2.5 ml of distilled water. The resultant mixture was subjected to vortexing, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of ferric chloride (0.5%) solution (freshly prepared) was added to this. The absorbance of ascorbic acid (reference) and test samples was recorded at 700 nm against phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) as a blank solution. All the samples were run in triplicate. Higher absorbance belongs to higher reducing power.
