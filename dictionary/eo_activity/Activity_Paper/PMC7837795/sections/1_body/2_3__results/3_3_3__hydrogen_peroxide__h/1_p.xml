<p>Reduction of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for various dilutions of 6-gingerol may be due to its electron-donating ability and was assessed according to a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reducing activity of 6-gingerol was found to increase in a concentration-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). The maximum percentage of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reducing activity was exhibited by 600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of 6-gingerol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). This reducing activity of 6-gingerol is very crucial because the lethal hydroxyl radicals are produced by disintegration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Hydroxyl radicals are harmful because they are cytotoxic in nature [
