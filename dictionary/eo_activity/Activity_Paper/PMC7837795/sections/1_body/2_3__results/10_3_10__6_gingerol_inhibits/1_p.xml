<p>The high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause membrane lipid peroxidation and the production of linked by-products like malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4HNE [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a product of lipid peroxidation, the malondialdehyde level can reflect the liver lipid peroxidation level [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The DEN induction caused an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) production due to an increase in membrane lipid peroxidation. DEN treatment caused significant increases in MDA levels as compared to the control group (
