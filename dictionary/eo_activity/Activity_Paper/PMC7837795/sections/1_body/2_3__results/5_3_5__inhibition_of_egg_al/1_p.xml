<p>The antiarthritic effect of 6-gingerol was investigated by using the inhibition of egg albumin denaturation (

The current study indicates that 6-gingerol is highly effective against heat-induced denaturation of egg albumin, and the denaturation of egg albumin decreases with an increase in the concentration of 6-gingerol. Diclofenac, a standard drug, showed the maximum inhibition (66.786 ± 2.95%) at a concentration of 200
