<p>Oxidative stress is explained as an imbalance between production and removal of ROS due to the decrease in the antioxidant defense mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is very evident that free radicals adversely affect various types of biomolecules and can cause lipid peroxidation, thereby damaging several organelles. If endogenous antioxidant enzymes become inactivated, the oxidative stress becomes exacerbated [
