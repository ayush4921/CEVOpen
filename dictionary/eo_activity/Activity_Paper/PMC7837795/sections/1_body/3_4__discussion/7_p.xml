In the present study, DEN was found to cause significant elevation in the levels of inflammatory markers in DEN-induced rats as compared to the control group. The treatment with 6-gingerol was found to significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory markers. Therefore, our results suggested that 6-gingerol might inhibit DEN-induced inflammation through inhibition of inflammatory process/proinflammatory markers. There are many studies that are in accordance with our observations. A pioneer study reported that diethylnitrosamine induced elevation in liver function enzymes with noteworthy increase in oxidation; also, inflammation biomarkers and DENA caused degenerative changes in hepatocytes and inflammatory foci, whereas ginger extract pretreatment showed a role in the improvement of liver function and restored normal GSH with significant mitigation of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers compared to the DENA-treated group [
