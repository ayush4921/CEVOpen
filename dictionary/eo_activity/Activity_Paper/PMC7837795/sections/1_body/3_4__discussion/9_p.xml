<p>In the current study, DEN-induced liver injury is confirmed by haemorrhages, infiltration of inflammatory cells, congestion, blood vessel dilation, and edema. In the meantime, coadministration of 6-gingerol significantly reduced the DEN-induced hepatic damage, and the histopathological patterns of liver injury were significantly less than those of rats belonging to the DEN treatment group. Henceforth, electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of hepatocytes. It was observed that alteration in cellular structures was more pronounced in the DEN-treated group. In contrast, treatment with 6-gingerol showed improved hepatocellular architecture. This supports our biochemical observations indicating the protective role of 6-gingerol against DEN-induced liver damage. Our findings are again supported by previous investigations regarding the protection of natural products against DEN-induced liver injury. It has been seen that administration of
