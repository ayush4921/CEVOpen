  <p>The role of 6-gingerol on liver function enzymes. ALT, ALP, and AST enzyme levels were considerably higher in the group of DEN-induced rats than in the control group. However, the group that got both DEN and 6-gingerol demonstrated substantially lower ALP, ALT, and AST levels than the DEN-induced group only. Statistical significances are compared between the normal control vs. DEN-induced groups only (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and DEN-induced versus both DEN- and 6-gingerol-treated groups (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
