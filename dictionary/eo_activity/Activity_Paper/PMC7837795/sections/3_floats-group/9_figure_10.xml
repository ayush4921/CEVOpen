  <p>The effect of 6-gingerol on inflammatory markers. The anti-inflammatory markers include TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, CRP, and ICAM1. In rodents, which received DEN, the levels of TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, CRP, and ICAM1 were found to be significantly increased as compared with the control group (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, the levels of these inflammatory markers were significantly decreased in rats administrated with both DEN and 6-gingerol (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
