DEN induces the pathogenesis of the liver through reactive oxygen species mediated inflammation and modulation of various biological activities. 6-Gingerol, a major component of ginger, is reported to prevent liver diseases by reducing the oxidative stress and proinflammatory mediators. The present study investigated the hepatoprotective effects of 6-gingerol through the measurement of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory markers, liver function enzyme parameter, and histopathological analysis. The rats were randomly divided into four groups as the control, DEN treated (50&#x02009;mg/kg b.w.), DEN+6-gingerol (each 50&#x02009;mg/kg b.w.), and 6-gingerol only. To evaluate the hepatoprotective effects, liver function enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP), oxidative stress markers (SOD, GSH, GST, and TAC), lipid peroxidation, inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and ICAM1), haematoxylin and eosin staining, Sirius red staining, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were performed. The results showed a significant increase in liver function enzymes, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers in the DEN-treated group as compared to the control group. Besides this, altered architecture of hepatocytes (infiltration of inflammatory cells, congestion, blood vessel dilation, and edema), abundant collagen fiber and organelle structures like distorted shaped and swollen mitochondria, and broken endoplasmic reticulum were noticed. The administration of 6-gingerol significantly ameliorated the biochemical and histopathological changes. The increased expression of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> protein was noticed in the DEN-treated group whereas the administration of 6-gingerol significantly decreased the expression of this protein. Based on these findings, it can be suggested that 6-gingerol may be an alternative therapy for the prevention and treatment of liver diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Qassim University</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The liver is a main homeostatic organ, involved in several biochemical processes such as the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and alcohol and detoxification of various toxins and metabolic waste products [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Continuous exposure of the liver to some factors including fatty diet, alcohol, drugs, and certain infections like virus leads to liver damage or injury. Sustained liver damage has been reported to cause chronic liver diseases [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Liver diseases are an important and certainly underestimated public health problem worldwide and are known to cause a substantial level of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to information on the global burden of disease project, more than two million people die from liver diseases that include acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, which represent about 4% of all deaths around the world [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>It is well-known that the liver is the centre for metabolism of various drugs and chemicals which makes it very susceptible to tissue damage by these compounds. Hence, these drugs and chemicals induce liver damage and alter the architecture of hepatocytes. Increased specific liver enzymes like alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be used as markers for the diagnosis of drugs and toxin-induced hepatotoxicity. Further, the discharge of mitochondrial enzymes from the liver might be a clear evidence of hepatic necrosis [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is likewise connected with different liver diseases.</p><p>Besides, liver injury has been reported to be manifested by the generation of diverse free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Exposure to certain drugs and chemicals including DEN results in hepatocellular accumulation of ROS leading to oxidative damage of biomolecules including DNA [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, inflammation has been known to be an important pathogenic event of liver injury, and ROS causes the induction of proinflammatory genes [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The excessive production of ROS [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and overexpression of these proinflammatory genes play an important role in the severity of liver diseases [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Cytokines as inflammatory mediators are implicated in the pathogenesis of various acute as well as chronic diseases such as alcoholic liver disease [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that during chronic liver damage and activation of nuclear factor-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, increased expression of TLR3 and TLR7 and increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines are associated with human end-stage ALD [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>DEN is an N-nitroso-alkyl compound and is a well-known hepatotoxin [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The parenteral or oral administration of DEN has been already observed to cause severe liver damage in experimental animals. DEN has been found in different food items such as cheese, soybean, cured meat, salted, and dried fish. In addition, DEN has been detected in tobacco smoke and baby bottle nipples. Humans are thus at potential risk of DEN exposure. Consequently, it becomes very necessary to search for effective and therapeutic medicines for hepatoprotection and management of liver diseases [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents have been recommended to be beneficial in the management of liver diseases [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the use of natural products that have the potential to protect from oxidative stress and inflammation can be considered as an important strategy in ameliorating hepatotoxicity.</p><p>Many herbs and their products have been used in the treatment of diseases due to their medicinal properties. Ginger or <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> is a traditional dietary ingredient with notable medicinal properties like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic, antitumorigenic, and hepatoprotective activities [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 6<italic>-</italic>Gingerol is the chief pharmacologically active phenolic compound found in the rhizomes of ginger and has been demonstrated to exhibit a variety of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antimutagenic activities [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, 6-gingerol has been reported to exert a therapeutic effect in osteoarthritis by means of attenuating oxidative stress as well as downregulation of proinflammatory mediators <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, 6-gingerol had been shown to induce cell death in the cancer cell line via caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and autophagy [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further, 6-gingerol inhibits the metastasis of cancer cells and induces apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Henceforth, the present experimental study was accomplished to investigate the hepatotoxicity of DEN in rat liver and the protective ability of 6-gingerol against DEN-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Several factors which are involved in the pathogenesis of liver include oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) is a well-known hepatocarcinogen, and it induces liver injury and is usually used to induce liver cancer in experimental animal models [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It has been reported that the prolonged oral administration or intraperitoneal injection of DEN causes liver pathogenesis.</p><p>The elevated levels of liver function enzymes in the serum are associated with hepatocellular damage because damage in the liver cell plasma membrane results in the release of these enzymes into circulation [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. ALT and AST are basically found in the hepatic cells, and their leakage is correlated to cellular damage. Therefore, serum levels of ALT and AST can be considered as the most sensitive indicators of hepatocyte injury [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that DEN administration (50&#x02009;mg/kg b.w.) developed severe liver injury in rats that was characterized by a significant increase in serum enzyme activity of AST, ALT, and ALP. The results had showed that administration of 6-gingerol considerably inhibited DEN-induced elevation of serum ALT, ALP, and AST levels, indicating that 6-gingerol protected the liver from the damaging effects of DEN hepatotoxin, which was well supported by our histological findings.</p><p>Further, our results were in accordance with previous findings of some investigators who reported that treatment of 6-gingerol and silymarin had significant hepatoprotective effect against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by the decrease in serum levels of liver marker enzymes including AST, ALT, and ALP [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Besides, another previous study has confirmed the hepatoprotective activity of ginger. An administration of ginger has exhibited the decrease in the elevated serum level of AST, ALT, and ALP [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, ginger treatment prior to acetaminophen displayed a significant hepatoprotective effect because of the decrease in the concentration of hepatic marker enzymes and total bilirubin in plasma [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is explained as an imbalance between production and removal of ROS due to the decrease in the antioxidant defense mechanisms [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is very evident that free radicals adversely affect various types of biomolecules and can cause lipid peroxidation, thereby damaging several organelles. If endogenous antioxidant enzymes become inactivated, the oxidative stress becomes exacerbated [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. ROS have also been reported to be produced by metabolism of hepatotoxic substances. DEN interacts with macromolecules and leads to lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane.</p><p>Endogenous antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) protect the liver against oxidative damage [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] because they convert ROS into stable molecules such as water and O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. SOD is an important part of the antioxidant enzyme that encounters the harmful effects of ROS [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Ginger and its active compound 6-gingerol have been documented to possess significant antioxidant property, and such activities have been reported to play a considerable role in the activation of antioxidation protective cascades. Further, this activity is attributed to the reduction of the liver damage through lowering of hepatic marker enzymes. Our findings from the DPPH assay confirmed the strong antioxidant nature of 6-gingerol. Thus, our result indicates that high antioxidant capacities of 6-gingerol might contribute to its therapeutic potential since it shows that its free radical scavenging ability may offer protection from oxidative damage caused by free ROS. The current study revealed that DEN administration caused a significant decrease in concentration of antioxidant enzymes including GSH, SOD, and GST in the livers of rats as compared to the control group. On the other hand, pretreatment of the rats with 6-gingerol before DEN administration significantly increased the activities of hepatic GSH, SOD, and GST activities. Thus, these observations provided evidences that 6-gingerol has the potential to protect liver damage induced by oxidative stress through enhancing activities of various antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that inflammation is generally implicated in the liver diseases ranging from the initial to the late stage [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and is a common pathophysiological response to liver injury. Remarkably, the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines results in the elevation of ROS and, hence, oxidative stress, causing cell damage [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Keeping in mind this fact, it can be suggested that any antioxidant compound with anti-inflammatory activity can be used as a drug therapy in the management of liver damage. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines are documented to be produced in a large amount which has been considered to be an important hallmark of the pathogenic conditions including hepatic inflammation and injury. Carcinogens and toxins have been reported to cause tissue injury that significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Various types of proinflammatory markers like TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), quickly produced in response to different infections and tissue injuries, attributes response to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and its overexpression has been noticed in liver diseases. After liver injury, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) is activated that results in the production of various inflammatory factors including IL-6 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. IL-6 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> are considered as proinflammatory markers and are useful for the identification of low-grade inflammation associated with visceral adiposity [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Natural products have been already proven to inhibit the inflammatory marker level and inhibit the pathogenesis [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the present study, DEN was found to cause significant elevation in the levels of inflammatory markers in DEN-induced rats as compared to the control group. The treatment with 6-gingerol was found to significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory markers. Therefore, our results suggested that 6-gingerol might inhibit DEN-induced inflammation through inhibition of inflammatory process/proinflammatory markers. There are many studies that are in accordance with our observations. A pioneer study reported that diethylnitrosamine induced elevation in liver function enzymes with noteworthy increase in oxidation; also, inflammation biomarkers and DENA caused degenerative changes in hepatocytes and inflammatory foci, whereas ginger extract pretreatment showed a role in the improvement of liver function and restored normal GSH with significant mitigation of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers compared to the DENA-treated group [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>A previous study had exhibited that IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-induced inflammation and oxidative stress becomes attenuated by <italic>S</italic>-[6]-gingerol in HuH7 cells. This observation was supported by a decrease in mRNA levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and IL-8. Further, S-[6]-gingerol was found to reduce both IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-induced COX2 upregulation and NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activity [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In another study, 6-gingerol was shown to forestall the increase in inflammatory markers such as myeloperoxidase, NO, and TNF-alpha in the brain, ovaries, and uterus of rats treated with chlorpyrifos. Besides, 6-gingerol was noticed to restrain the LPS-induced increment in levels of GFAP and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in the rat brain [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, DEN-induced liver injury is confirmed by haemorrhages, infiltration of inflammatory cells, congestion, blood vessel dilation, and edema. In the meantime, coadministration of 6-gingerol significantly reduced the DEN-induced hepatic damage, and the histopathological patterns of liver injury were significantly less than those of rats belonging to the DEN treatment group. Henceforth, electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of hepatocytes. It was observed that alteration in cellular structures was more pronounced in the DEN-treated group. In contrast, treatment with 6-gingerol showed improved hepatocellular architecture. This supports our biochemical observations indicating the protective role of 6-gingerol against DEN-induced liver damage. Our findings are again supported by previous investigations regarding the protection of natural products against DEN-induced liver injury. It has been seen that administration of <italic>P. granatum</italic> and <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> extracts to rats provides protection from the hepatocellular injury induced by DEN [<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>In the pathological process of liver injury, several inflammatory cytokines are meaningfully upregulated including TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, which facilitate inflammation and repair in physiological conditions [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In the current study, it was noticed that the TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> expression was significantly high in the DEN-treated group, whereas the expression was notably decreased by the treatment of rats with 6-gingerol. Thus, our findings suggest that 6-gingerol exhibits hepatoprotective activity due to its anti-inflammation potential. These findings are consistent with the previous study on hepatoprotective activity of other medicinal plants. The expression of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> was evaluated in the group receiving berberine alone and was found to be similar to the control. On contrary, a strong TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> expression was reported in rats receiving CCl<sub>4</sub> only [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data has demonstrated that 6-gingerol extract possesses significant anti-inflammatory potential. Further, we confirmed the anti-inflammatory actions of 6-gingerol using an <italic>in vitro</italic> study. Thus, the results obtained from the antiproteinase activity assay are in accordance to our findings from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, and 6-gingerol has been exhibited to possess powerful anti-inflammatory action practically identical to the reference anti-inflammatory drug. Inhibition of proteinase action and inflammation may be contributed by its strong antioxidant potential. Thus, our data propose that significant antioxidant activity of 6-gingerol might be responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity, and administration of 6-gingerol can be suggested to contain some considerable protective effect against DEN-induced liver damage.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrate that DEN induces oxidative stress and hepatocellular changes in the liver, and 6-gingerol has a significant hepatoprotective effect against DEN-induced liver damage in rats through attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, our results confirm that 6-gingerol reduces or prevents hepatic damage and enhances the recovery from liver injury induced by DEN. Based on the findings, it can be suggested that the hepatoprotective action of 6-gingerol might be mediated through its antioxidant nature and anti-inflammatory action. Thus, intake of 6-gingerol may have beneficial effects in treating liver diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The researchers would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University, for the funding publication of this project.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization was handled by Saleh A.
