 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> extracts, as well as quercitrin, trifolin, and cynaroside, reduced the accumulation of ROS in treated cells compared to control using H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA fluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01086-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The highest reduction of ROS was found when using trifolin, and cynaroside in all cells after 90 min of incubation. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> showed the highest accumulation of ROS cancer cells.
