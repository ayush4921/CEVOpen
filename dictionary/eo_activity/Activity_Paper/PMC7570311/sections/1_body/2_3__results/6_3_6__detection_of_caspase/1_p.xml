<p>The effects of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts on caspase 2, 6, 8 and 9 activities were studied in selected cancer cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01086-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The results showed that increased caspase activity occurred after 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> treatment in all cancer cell lines compared to the control cells. In caspase 2, the treatment with 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts showed the highest activities in Jurkat cells. In caspase 6 and 9, the treatment with 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts showed the highest activities in HeLa cells. In caspase 8, the treatment with 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts showed the highest activities in T24 cells.
