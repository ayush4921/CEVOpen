<p>The HPLC-DAD analyses of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> extracts revealed nine phenolic compounds from phenolic acids (chlorogenic (1), caffeic (2), p-coumaric (3), ferulic (4) and rosmarinic (8) acids), and flavonoids (quercitrin (9), rutoside (5), quercetin (7) and trifolin (10)) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01086-f002">Figure 2</xref>). From phenolic acids, the highest amounts were confirmed for rosmarinic acid (269.5 mg/100 g DW (dry weight)) and chlorogenic acid (126.8 mg/100 g DW) (

 <italic>F. alnus</italic> extract, an abundant unknown compound (6) was recognized, based on UV spectra, as a flavonoid derivative (

 <italic>F. alnus</italic> extract), and was 1072.4 mg/100 g DW (
