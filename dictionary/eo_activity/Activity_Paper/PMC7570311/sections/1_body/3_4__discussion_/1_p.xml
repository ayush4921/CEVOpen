<p>This is the first study exploring the polyphenolic compositions of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic>. The common raw material of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> is the bark, which contain frangulins, anthraquinone glycoside derivatives, anthtaquinone monoglycosides (emodin) and glucofrangulins components [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] studied hydroalcoholic, ethanolic and methanolic bark extracts of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> collected from Iran. They determined the total phenolic composition in the extracts and only identified 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol and butylated hydroxytoluene with the GC/MS analysis. They indicated no presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids. Maleš et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] quantified the glucofrangulins and the phenolic compounds in Croatian 
 <italic>Rhamnus</italic> and 
 <italic>Frangula</italic> species. In the methanolic bark extracts of the Croatian 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> they estimated, using a spectrophotometric method, the total flavonoids, phenolic acids and total polyphenols components and their contents ranged from 0.05 to 0.08%, 1.21–1.44% and 5.57–8.30%, respectively. The variation of the polyphenolic composition of this species might be affected by an environmental factor such as light, which may influence the tannins in this species [
