 <italic>Frangula alnus</italic> (Rhamnaceae) is a tall shrub growing in western Asia, Europe and northernmost Africa [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The shrub bark is dark, with a bright lemon-yellow inner bark, and is the main economic part of the plant. The bark is widely used in traditional as well as modern medicine as laxative (Council of Europe, 2008). These laxative properties of the bark have been attributed to frangulins, anthraquinone glycoside derivatives, anthraquinone monoglycosides (emodin) and glucofrangulins components [

 <italic>F. alnus</italic> (Croatian origin) showed moderate antioxidant effects attributed to emodin [

 <italic>Staphyllococcus aureus</italic> [

 <italic>F. alnus</italic> natural populations. Previous investigation showed that this species is invasive and can survive and adapt in different environmental conditions including wetlands [
