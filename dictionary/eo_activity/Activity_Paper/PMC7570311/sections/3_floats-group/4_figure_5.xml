 <caption>
  <p>Enzyme activity of caspase 2, 6, 8 and 9 following treatment of different cancer cells with 
   <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
   <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts (IC
   <sub>50</sub>). The results showed that increased caspase activity occurred after 
   <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
   <italic>P. harmala</italic> treatment in all cancer cell lines compared to the control cells. The activity was expressed as a percentage (%) of control. The values are means ± SDs of three series of experiments. Different letters among columns indicate significant differences at 
   <italic>p ≤ 0.05</italic>.
