The biologically active ingredients locked up in plant tissues as secondary metabolites are the major drivers of plant-based treatments and are the target molecules by pharmaceutical, flavour, aroma, and agrochemical industries [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Early detection of penicillin from mould, salicylic acid in willow bark, cardiotonic in foxglove and morphine from poppies aided the establishment of pharmaceutical industries [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, increased knowledge about bioactive compounds in medicinal plants coupled with sustained efforts on the analysis of micronutrients that are responsible for this bioactivity has led to the development of refined and purified dose-dependent chemical compounds as drugs [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The present and future priority thus lie in finding new plant-based chemicals, bearing in mind, sustainable conservation, rational utilization, and biodiversity management [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Secondary metabolites have been reported to be responsible for anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties exhibited by plants and are thought to play a major role in the adaptation of plants to their environment [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Apart from protecting plants from pathogens, they confer allelopathic properties on plants, they possess ultra-violet absorbing structures capable of protecting plants from leaf damage caused by incident light intensity, and also, they have anti-feeding properties, protecting plants from insects and even larger animals [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">One of the potent compounds being isolated from plants for medicinal purposes is an alkaloid. Examples of alkaloids in isolated forms and their uses are caffeine (a stimulant), ephedrine (a stimulant), scopolamine (travel sickness), capsaicin (rheumatic pains), morphine (pain killer), codeine (antitussive), papaverine (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), quinine (anti-malarial), colchicines (gout), yohimbine (aphrodisiac), pilocarpine (glaucoma), berberine (psoriasis), ajmaline (antiarrhythmic) and various cardiac glycosides [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">Typically, <italic>Sceletium</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> contain four classes of alkaloids; the 3a-aryl-<italic>cis</italic>-octahydroindole class, C-secomesembrine alkaloids, alkaloids containing a 2,3-disubstituted pyridine moiety and a ring <italic>C</italic>-seco <italic>Sceletium</italic> alkaloid A4 group and in particular, is one of the only plant genera known to carry mesembrine alkaloids [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). In <italic>S.&#x000a0;tortuosum</italic>, alkaloids responsible for these psychoactive, sedative, euphoric properties and other biological activities are mesembrine and mesembrenone although, the concentration of alkaloids may vary within individual plants depending on their chemotype and degree of exposure to environmental stress [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>S.&#x000a0;tortuosum</italic> is a succulent plant that belongs to the family Mesembryanthemaceae.

The trays were placed in an environmentally controlled propagation greenhouse at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Bellville campus. The first sign of roots was observed after 2 weeks, and roots had fully developed after 2 months.

(2016). Each system consisted of one 70 L capacity low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reservoir; four polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) square gutters (130 mm &#x000d7; 70 mm x 2 500 mm) secured onto wire mesh tables (900 mm x 1 250 m x 2 500 m); sixty 12.5 &#x000d7; 12.5 cm plastic pots, a 2 000 L/h submersible water pump with a 2.5 m head capacity, ten-meter x 20 mm LDPE irrigation piping; four reducers (20 mm&#x02013;15 mm); four 15 mm flow regulators; one air pump, one air stone (15cm) and eight 20 mm bulkhead connectors. Reservoirs were kept filled to a level of approximately 50 L with aqueous nutrient solution. Each gutter was sealed with PVC adhesive and fitted with an inlet guiding water towards the gutters and an outlet to return excess water to the reservoir. Each inlet consisted of LDPE irrigation piping converted from 20 mm to 15 mm diameter and each fitted with a 15 mm valve allowing maximum control of aqueous nutrient solution flow into gutters. All gutters were filled with silica sand to a depth of &#x000b1; 1.5 cm. Fifteen pots (12.5 cm &#x000d7; 12.5 cm) were placed into each gutter on top of the silica sand. As water passes through the gutter the sand becomes fully saturated with an aqueous nutrient solution which is then imbibed by soilless growing media in pots via capillary action. Every gutter for each system represented a different soilless substrate in 15 pots, as follows: 100% silica sand (SS); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and coco-peat (SC); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and vermiculite (SV) and a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and perlite (SP).</p><p id="p0055">Each separate system was manually controlled to fertigate plants with the same amount of aqueous nutrient solution at different time intervals. The five systems were given aqueous nutrient solution amounts as follows: Fertigation regime 1 (FR1) was fertigated once a week at &#x000b1; 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 2 (FR2) was fertigated every second week at &#x000b1; 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 3 (FR3) was fertigated once every third week at &#x000b1; 350 ml per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 4 (FR4) was fertigated once every fourth week at &#x000b1; 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fertigation regime 5 (FR5) was fertigated once every fifth week at &#x000b1; 350 mL per minute for 1 h. Fifteen plants, one per pot were placed into each soilless substrate of each system, which totals to 60 plants per hydroponic system and 300 plants for the entire experiment. Therefore 15 replicates in a randomized blocked design were tested for each media and fertigation regime combination.</p><p id="p0060">All aqueous nutrient solutions used in the experiment were kept at a pH level of 6.0, and an electrical conductivity (EC) level of 0.5. EC levels of the aqueous nutrient solutions were monitored with a calibrated handheld digital EC meter (Hanna Instruments&#x000ae;&#x02122; HI 98312). Water reservoir pH levels were monitored with a calibrated handheld digital pH meter (Eurotech&#x000ae;&#x02122; pH 2 pen). For increasing pH, potassium hydroxide was used, while phosphoric acid was used for decreasing pH of aqueous nutrient solutions. For decreasing the EC of aqueous nutrient solutions, reverse osmosis water was added into reservoirs, while adding Hoagland Solution to aqueous nutrient solutions in reservoirs increased the EC. Pots were individually numbered and arranged randomly [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All gutters were slightly tilted to allow aqueous nutrient solutions to flow from one end (inlet) to the other (outlet). Each outlet was guided to a separate smaller gutter which then returned the aqueous nutrient solution to the reservoir, creating a circulating system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Treatment preparation</title><p id="p0065">Soilless medium treatments were prepared using four different soilless medium combinations, namely: 100% silica sand (SS); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and coco-peat (SC); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and vermiculite (SV) and a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and perlite (SP). For treatments SC, SV and SP equal parts of silica sand and coco-peat/vermiculite/perlite were mixed. All silica sand used was thoroughly rinsed with tap water until water poured through the sand ran clear.</p><p id="p0070">Fertigation regimes were achieved by installing identical pumps to all hydroponic systems. The amount of aqueous nutrient solution delivered to each grow bed was controlled by adjusting all output valves until &#x000b1;350 mL per minute was measured. Measurement was achieved by placing an empty bucket below each output for 1 min, the liquid captured in the bucket was decanted and measured using a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask until the amount of aqueous nutrient solution for each output was measured at &#x000b1;350 mL for 1 min.
