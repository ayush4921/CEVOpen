 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> is a one of a kind medicinal crop plant, containing various alkaloids for application in the pharmacological industry [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This study has shown there is a clear effect on alkaloid concentration in 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> root and shoots extracts in response to different soilless media, fertigation regimes as well as soilless media in conjunction with fertigation regimes [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Shoot extracts contained a higher concentration of total alkaloids than root extracts, however, root extracts had an overall higher amount of delta 7 mesembrenone, and mesembrenone in terms of area %, while shoots had higher amounts of mesembrine.
