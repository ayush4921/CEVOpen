<p id="p0075">Plants were placed in brown paper bags post-harvest and dried at 30–31 °C in a forced convection oven (Daihan Labtech LDO-150F) until the material was crisp dry. Plants were then weighed using an electronic balance (RADWAG® Model PS 750.R2) with 0.001 g readability and recorded.

The coffee grinder was cleaned thoroughly between the milling of each treatment.</p>
