<p id="p0085">The most commonly used technique for analysing natural products is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet light detection. Due to the commercial unavailability of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> alkaloid standards the HPLC tests for the area % of delta 7 mesembrenone, mesembrenone and mesembrine were based on standard references for mesembrine-type alkaloids as reported by [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The liquid or mobile phase used for 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> is water plus acetonitrile at a ratio of 72:28 plus 0.01% ammonia hydroxide. 20 μL of extractions were filtered into HPLC vials, the vials were then numerically placed in the sample collector according to treatment. From here the mobile phase and extract samples individually got injected into a column (C18-kromasil 100-5-C18) at a flow rate of 1 μL/min, which separated the molecules and passed them through a UV detector and UV signatures at 280 nm were recorded and in turn, determined the area % of the different alkaloids. Procedures were done at room temperature and repeated 5 times for each treatment extraction sample.
