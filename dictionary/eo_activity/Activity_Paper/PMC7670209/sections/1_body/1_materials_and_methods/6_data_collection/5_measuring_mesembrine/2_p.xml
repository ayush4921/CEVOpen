<p id="p0090">The pure mesembrine compound was injected into the HPLC system by itself, the peak observed as a result on the chromatograph represents mesembrine, which then draws a standard reference for other molecules to compare to, therefore if another molecule is injected and analysed in the same way and results are in the same peak on the chromatograph, they are the same molecule as the standard [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The HPLC method with UV detection was again used for this analysis. About 20 μL of extractions were filtered into HPLC vials, the vials were then numerically placed in the sample collector according to treatment. From here the mobile phase and extract samples individually got injected into a column (C18-kromasil 100-5-C18) at a flow rate of 1 μL/min, which separated the molecules and passed them through a UV detector and UV signatures at 280 nm, molecules that were identical to the mesembrine standard were recorded. Procedures were done at room temperature and repeated 5 times for each treatment extraction sample [
