<p id="p0050">Five identical hydroponic systems were constructed following Teto et al. (2016). Each system consisted of one 70 L capacity low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reservoir; four polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) square gutters (130 mm × 70 mm x 2 500 mm) secured onto wire mesh tables (900 mm x 1 250 m x 2 500 m); sixty 12.5 × 12.5 cm plastic pots, a 2 000 L/h submersible water pump with a 2.5 m head capacity, ten-meter x 20 mm LDPE irrigation piping; four reducers (20 mm–15 mm); four 15 mm flow regulators; one air pump, one air stone (15cm) and eight 20 mm bulkhead connectors. Reservoirs were kept filled to a level of approximately 50 L with aqueous nutrient solution. Each gutter was sealed with PVC adhesive and fitted with an inlet guiding water towards the gutters and an outlet to return excess water to the reservoir. Each inlet consisted of LDPE irrigation piping converted from 20 mm to 15 mm diameter and each fitted with a 15 mm valve allowing maximum control of aqueous nutrient solution flow into gutters. All gutters were filled with silica sand to a depth of ± 1.5 cm. Fifteen pots (12.5 cm × 12.5 cm) were placed into each gutter on top of the silica sand. As water passes through the gutter the sand becomes fully saturated with an aqueous nutrient solution which is then imbibed by soilless growing media in pots via capillary action. Every gutter for each system represented a different soilless substrate in 15 pots, as follows: 100% silica sand (SS); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and coco-peat (SC); a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and vermiculite (SV) and a 50/50 mixture of silica sand and perlite (SP).</p>
