<p id="p0135">The effect of soilless media and fertigation regime on mesembrine area % in the shoot of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> was statistically significant at the value of p ≤ 0.001. At p ≤ 0.001, soilless medium SS yielded the highest mesembrine area % (86.52% and 86.65%) respectively under fertigation regime 3 (FR3) while the least value (56.65%) was recorded in SV medium under fertigation regime 4 (FR4). In general, shoots had an overall higher concentration of mesembrine area % than roots while roots had an overall lower mesembrine area in terms of area % than roots (Figures
