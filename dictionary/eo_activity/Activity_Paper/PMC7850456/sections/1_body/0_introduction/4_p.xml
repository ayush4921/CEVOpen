<p>It should be emphasised that compounds with the 1,2,4-triazine nucleus condensed with five-membered heterocycles have received considerable attention because they are bioisosteric with a purine core. Among the fused 1,2,4-triazine derivatives with one heterocycle, compounds bearing a pyrrole ring, such as pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,2,4]triazine and pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine, represent the most abundant class of triazine with antitumor activity

 </xref>. Derivatives bearing this heterocyclic system are widely described as potent kinase inhibitors. Pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4] triazine scaffold, miming the adenine ring of ATP, was also employed to afford other kinase inhibitors such as Met kinase inhibitors
