<p>Determination of the apoptosis status of DLD-1 and HT-29 cells after 24 h of incubation with 1,2,4-triazine derivative, RSC, and 5-FU was assessed by dual annexin V and propidium iodide staining using flow cytometry. One of the characteristic early changes in the cells during PCD is displacement of phosphatidylserine from the internal to the external cell membrane–externalisation of phosphatidylserine. Dual staining allows to detect live cells (not binding annexin V and PI), early-apoptotic cells (binding annexin V and not binding PI), late-apoptotic cells (binding annexin V and PI), and necrotic cells (binding PI and not binding annexin V). Following 24 h incubation with the studied compounds, the activation of PCD in DLD-1 and HT-29 cell lines was observed (

 <bold>MM-129</bold> compound at a concentration of 3 µM, where the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells was about 82.5%. In the HT-29, the highest number of apoptotic cells–38.9% was also seen in response to analogous 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> concentration vs. 12.7%, 12.6%, and 7.7% in cells treated with RSC, 5-FU or controls, respectively (
