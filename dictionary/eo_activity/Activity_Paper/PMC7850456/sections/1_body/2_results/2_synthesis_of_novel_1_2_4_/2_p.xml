<p>The target compound 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> was obtained by a multi-step synthesis, starting from 1,2,4-triazine (1), according to the methods described in the literature (

 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>e</italic>][1,2,4]triazine (2) was performed based on the reaction of nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen in 1,2,4-triazine and oxidation process under two-phase-transfer catalysis conditions

 </xref>. The final new tricyclic sulphonamide 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> was achieved by a convenient multiple procedure consisting of the following steps: chlorosulfonylation, reaction with 
 <sc>l</sc>-proline derivative, and nucleophilic substitution reaction of methylsulfonyl group with sodium azide
