<p>Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the activation of signalling pathways responsible for cell maturation and viability. The incubation of DLD-1 and HT-29 cells with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> for 24 h resulted in downregulation of phosphorylated BTK (pBTK) expression compared with control as well as compared with RSC and 5-FU in both cell lines. The strongest reduction in BTK level was exhibited by the 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> at a concentration of 3 µM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(a–c)</xref>). These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy, where we also observed a significant decrease in BTK expression after 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> stimulation (
