<p>DLD-1 and HT-29 cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding mCherry fluorescent protein (pmR-mCherry) were implanted into the yolk sac of wild-type (WT) zebrafish 48 hpf embryos. The scheme of the experimental protocol is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(a)</xref>. Three days after cell injection, solid tumours were established in 100% of DLD-1 (
 <italic>N</italic> = 32) and HT-29 xenografts (
 <italic>N</italic> = 32). The embryos were then incubated with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>, 5-FU, or a combination of these compounds for 48 h. The control group received the 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> solvent (0.1% DMSO/PBS). In both DLD-1 and HT-29 xenografts, we observed a significant reduction in tumour development in the 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> treated group compared with the control group, as reflected by the drop in fluorescence intensity (49.73 ± 13.93 vs. 87.71 ± 13.22 and 56.62 ± 18.91 vs. 88.26 ± 19.69, both 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(b,c)</xref>). Incubation with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>+5-FU significantly intensified the reduction in the number of cancer cells in both DLD-1 (30.12 ± 15.83) and HT-29 (40.0 ± 13.42) xenografts compared with the appropriate control (87.71 ± 13.22 and 88.26 ± 19.69; both 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The combination of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>+5-FU showed more pronounced anticancer activity than 5-FU alone in DLD-1 and HT-29 cells (69.06 ± 23.67 and 63.46 ± 19.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; respectively). Similarly, the combination of these compounds was also more effective in reducing cancer cells than 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> alone in DLD-1 (49.73 ± 13.93; ^
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> showed a markedly synergistic anticancer effect when used in combination with 5-FU.
