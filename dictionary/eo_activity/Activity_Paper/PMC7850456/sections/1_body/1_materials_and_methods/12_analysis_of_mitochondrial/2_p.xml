<p>Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were provided with flow cytometry using JC-1 MitoScreen kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). In normal cells, JC-1 (1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloroimidacarbocyanine iodide) aggregates in the mitochondrial matrix. Nevertheless, in apoptotic and necrotic cells, this lipophilic dye diffuses out of mitochondria and stains cells with a green fluorescent. DLD-1 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines covering about 80% of the plate were incubated with the novel synthesised compound 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>, and the reference drugs, RSC and 5-FU, for 24 h in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. All compounds were used at 1 µM and 3.0 µM concentrations. Following incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were washed two times with the required buffer. Then, the cells were suspended in a 10 µg/mL JC-1 dye and incubated in the dark for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS and analysed using BD FacsCanto II flow cytometer. The results were assessed using BD FacsDiva software (BD Biosciences Systems, San Jose, CA). The values were obtained from three independent experiments (
