<p>Melting points were determined on a Mel-Temp apparatus and were uncorrected. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian spectrometer (400 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 100 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C). The chemical shift values were expressed in ppm (part per million) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. The relative integrals of peak areas agreed with those expected for the assigned structures. The molecular weight of the final compounds was assessed by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) on Agilent Technologies 6538 UHD Accurate Mass Q-TOF LC/MS compositions (Santa Clara, CA) were within ±0.4% of the calculated values.
