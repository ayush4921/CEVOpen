 </xref>. During programmed cell death (PCD), the phosphatidylserine (PS) is transferred from the inner cell membrane to the cell surface. DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were incubated (24 h) with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> and with the reference drugs: RSC and 5-FU. All compounds were used in two concentrations: 1 µM and 3.0 µM. Following incubation, the cells were dyed with FITC-labelled annexin V and propidium iodide. It allows to identify viable, necrotic, early, and late apoptotic cells. The positive controls were cells in which apoptosis was induced by the addition of 2 μL of 3% formaldehyde. The cells were placed in a refrigerator for 15 min to induce apoptosis. Three controls were made: the first contained control cells and propidium iodide; the second, control cells and annexin V-FITC; and the third, control cells and propidium iodide and annexin V-FITC. Cells cultured in medium without the tested compounds were used as the negative control. The values were obtained from three independent experiments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). The experiment was performed using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer and the results were parsed with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences Systems, San Jose, CA).
