<p>Living zebrafish embryos were anaesthetised with tricaine and embedded in a lateral orientation. The animals were analysed for cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity. Images of the cells were acquired using an EVOS M5000 Imaging System with the following filters: GFP (470/22 nm excitation; 510/42 nm emission) and Texas Red (585/29 nm excitation; 624/40 nm emission). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ v1.51 software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p>
