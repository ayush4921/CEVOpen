  <p>Viability of DLD-1 (a) and HT-29 (b) colon cancer cells treated for 24 h with different concentrations of 
   <bold>MM-129</bold>, roscovitine (RSC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the antiproliferative effects of the studied compounds in DLD-1 (c) and HT-29 (d) colon cancer cells measured by the inhibition of [
   <sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Mean values ± SD from three independent experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) done in duplicate are presented.
