<p>Despite the increased global interest in bioactive metabolites from medicinal plants, very little is known about the health-promoting effects of plant-associated microbiota. A range of bacterial species colonizes the rhizosphere, plant surfaces and internal tissues (epiphytes or endophytes) of various dietary and medicinal plants (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Borozan and Raba, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Presta et al., 2017</xref>). The microbiota composition from leaves, roots and rhizospheric soil was followed in aromatic plants 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus citriodorus</italic> and correlated with the composition of essential oils (

 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> and 
 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> were tested (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Presta et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bibi, 2017</xref>). The antimicrobial activities against various pathogenic bacteria were scored, such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, indicating that medicinal plants could be a valuable source of bacteria with antimicrobial activity against clinically relevant pathogens (

 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Erwinia</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> sp. in the biosynthesis of various metabolites and therapeutic potential of 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> was reported (

 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> has not been studied so far.
