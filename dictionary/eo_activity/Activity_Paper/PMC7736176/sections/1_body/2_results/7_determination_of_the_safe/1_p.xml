<p>In order to determine the safety status of the 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> isolates, the cytotoxic, gelatinase, and hemolytic activities were assayed, and the susceptibility to minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics was determined. The Caco-2 cells were exposed to live 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> isolates to determine the possible cytotoxic effect of the strains. The results showed that 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 live bacterial strains exhibited cytotoxic activity to Caco-2 cells, while the cell culture supernatants from both strains did not exhibit cytotoxic activity on the same cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). MTT assay showed that cell culture supernatants from 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 do not decrease cell metabolic activity of Caco-2 cells after the treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Absence of gelatinase activity, for both 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains (BGSR162 and BGSR227), on gelatin agar plates was noted, as well as absence of hemolysis zones, on blood agar plates. Both strains were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol).
