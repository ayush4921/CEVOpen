<p>In human colon adenocarcinoma LS174 cells exposure for 24, 48 and, 72 h to undigested and digested 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extracts applied at a concentration of 20% led to remarkable increase in the percentage of subG1 cells when compared with control cell sample, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>. The increase of LS174 cells within the subG1 phase was remarkably higher in cells incubated with 20% undigested extracts. In addition, all three digested extracts caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in LS174 cells after 24, 48 and, 72 h of incubation. Accumulation of LS174 cells within the G2/M phase was the most prominent in cell samples exposed for 24 h to tested extracts. It should be noted that the food matrix at a concentration of 20% slightly increased the percentage of LS174 cells within the subG1 phase.
