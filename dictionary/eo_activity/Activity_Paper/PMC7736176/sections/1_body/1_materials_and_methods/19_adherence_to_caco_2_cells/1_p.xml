<p>The adhesion ability of 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> isolates was performed on colonocyte-like Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 was purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC No. 86010202). The culture and maintenance of the cells were done according to procedures described by 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sánchez et al. (2010)</xref> using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM l-glutamine. Media and reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The adherence (expressed as a percentage) was calculated as: CFU adhered bacteria/CFU added bacteria. Experiments were performed in two replicated plates and in each plate; three wells were used per sample.
