<p>The ferrous ion binding capacity was monitored by the previously described method of 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dinis et al. (1994)</xref> with slight modifications. Briefly, 940 μL of supernatant dilutions in distilled water were mixed with 20 μL of 2 mM ferrous chloride and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 200 μL of 5 mM ferrozine was added and the mixture was incubated for 10 min under the same conditions. Formation of a red ferrous ion-ferrozine complex was recorded at 562 nm. Control sample was prepared with distilled water instead of the sample. Percentage of ferrous ion binding was calculated according to the equation:
