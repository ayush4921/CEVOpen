<p>The 217 pure cultures were isolated and characterized according to their morphology by Gram staining and cell formation, catalase test and gelatinase production. Out of 217 isolates, 50 Gram-positive aerobically grown isolates were selected for further analysis. They were divided into 3 subgroups according to their growth on different mediums and different temperatures (23 isolates chosen from MRS plates incubated at 30°C, as well as 16 isolates chosen from GM17 plates and 11 isolates chosen from Nutrient-plates incubated at 22°C).</p>
