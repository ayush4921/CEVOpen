<p>The two 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> (BGSR163 and BGSR227) isolates were tested for hemolytic activity. The strains were cultured in MRS broth and were streaked on Columbia agar plates containing 5% of sheep blood (Oxoid). The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C. Blood agar plates were examined for signs of β-hemolysis (clear zones around colonies), α-hemolysis (green-hued zones around colonies) or γ-hemolysis (no zones around colonies) as described
