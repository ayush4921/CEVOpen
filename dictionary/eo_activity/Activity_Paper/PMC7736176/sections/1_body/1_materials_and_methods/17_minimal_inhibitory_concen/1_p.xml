<p>Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clinically relevant antibiotics were determined by microdilution testing following European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, Panel, 2012) guidance. Susceptibility was tested against: ampicillin (2 μg/ml), gentamicin (16 μg/ml), kanamycin (64 μg/ml), streptomycin (64 μg/ml), erythromycin (1 μg/ml), clindamycin (1 μg/ml), tetracycline (8 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (4 μg/ml). Microdilution tests were performed in MRS (Oxoid). Cell density was monitored after 24 h incubation at 37°C at 595 nm using Plate Reader Infinite 200 pro (MTX Lab Systems, Vienna, Austria).</p>
