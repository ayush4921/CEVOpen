<p>For GC × GC-MS analysis, obtained samples after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> were extracted using dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) for 1 h by liquid/liquid extraction. Prepared extracts were filtered using membrane filter (0.45 μm, Agilent) and after concentration directly analyzed by GC × GC-MS GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with ZX2 thermal modulation system (Zoex Corp.) as Total Ion Chromatograms (TIC). A Rtx
 <sup>®</sup>-1 (first column: RESTEK, Crossbond
 <sup>®</sup> 100% dimethyl polysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, df = 0.25 μm) and a BPX50 (SGE Analytical Science, 1 m, 0.1 mm ID, df = 0.1 μm) columns were connected using the GC × GC modulator as the first and second capillary columns, respectively. The oven was programmed at an initial temperature of 40°C for 4 min, then ramped at 10°C/min to 310°C. Isothermal step at 310°C for 5 min was at the program end. The modulation period was 6 s with 300 ms of hot jet pulse. The MS data were collected using Shimadzu GC/MS Real-Time Analysis and GC × GC-MS data were analyzed using GC Image R2.6 (GC Image LLC). Obtained MS spectra were compared with the MS libraries NIST 11, NIST 11s, and Wiley 8.
