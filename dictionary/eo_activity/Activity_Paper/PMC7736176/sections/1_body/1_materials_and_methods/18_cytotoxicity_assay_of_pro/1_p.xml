<p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) was used for a measure of cytotoxicity level in the cell cultures through detection of LDH released from dead cells. After treatments of Caco-2 and mesenteric lymph node cells (MLNC) with selected 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains, LDH activity in supernatants was determined by following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using Plate Reader Infinite 200 pro (MTX Lab Systems).
