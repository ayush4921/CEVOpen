<p>To investigate the dominant bacterial communities by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, United States) was used for extraction of bacterial DNA from the first serial dilution of leaves and saline mixture. PCR amplification of the obtained DNA was performed using lactobacilli-specific primers Lab-0159f and Uni-0515-GCr (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom), as described by 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lukic et al. (2013)</xref>. The samples were amplified using KAPA 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (KAPA Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa) in GeneAmp PCR System 2700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States). DGGE analysis and gel manipulation after electrophoresis was performed according to 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lukic et al. (2013)</xref>. DGGE was performed on DGGE-2001 (C.B.S. Scientific, San Diego, CA, United States). Cloning of PCR fragments of interest, the transformation of the DH5Î± competent cells and analysis of selected transformants was performed as previously described
