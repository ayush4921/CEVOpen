 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp. isolates were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in order to determine differences among the strains. PFGE was carried out as previously described (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Tenover et al., 1995</xref>). Briefly, PFGE with 
 <italic>Not</italic>I-digested genomic DNA was performed for 18 h at 300 V at 9Â°C using a 2015 Pulsafor unit apparatus (LKB Instruments, Bromma, Sweden). Grouping of isolates based on the PFGE results was done using SPSS software package, version 20 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, United States).
