<p>16S rDNA PCR amplification was performed with UNI16SF (5′-GAGAGTTTGATCCTGGC-3′) and UNI16SR (5′-AGGAGGTGATCCAGCCG-3′) primers, complementary to 16S rRNA gene, as described by 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jovcic et al. (2009)</xref>. The obtained PCR amplicons were purified (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced (Macrogen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To determine sequence similarities the BLAST algorithm was used in the NCBI nucleotide sequence database
