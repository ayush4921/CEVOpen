<p>Ramson â€“
 <italic>Allium ursinum</italic> has been used as a medicinal plant for centuries. While its antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and antioxidant activity were previously shown, the ramson-associated microbiota was not characterized so far. The current study represents the first attempt to elucidate the effect of simulated digestion of ramson in the presence of complex food matrix on the bioaccessibility of phenolic and organosulfur compounds as well as their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biological activities. Hence, this paper presents the characterization of antiproliferative and antioxidant activities of ramson, together with the health-promoting properties of its associated LAB. Namely, the number of studies in the last decade identified the complex plant-associated microbial communities, so-called plant microbiota (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Compant et al., 2019</xref>). However, the comprehensive analyses of the plant extracts together with the health-promoting effects of the plant microbiota are rare. Particularly the data related to the probiotic effects of the 
 <italic>A. ursinum-</italic>associated microbiota are lacking.
