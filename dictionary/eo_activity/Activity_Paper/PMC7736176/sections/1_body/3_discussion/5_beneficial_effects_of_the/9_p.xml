<p>The survival in simulated gastrointestinal conditions is an important criterion for the selection of probiotic strains in order to exhibit their probiotic effects in the gut (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and World Health Organization, 2006</xref>). The results of this study revealed that the strains successfully survived the simulated GIT passage. It was known from literature data that bacteria better survive the GIT transit when applied in food matrix due to the buffering and protective effect of the food components on probiotic bacteria (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Ranadheera et al., 2010</xref>). Particularly, the strains successfully survived simulated mouth conditions indicating that both strains were resistant to saliva and Î±-amylase. The number of viable cells lowered in simulated gastric conditions, although the CFU number was still quite high, indicating that the strains are used to the acidic environment, which is expected for LAB strains (
