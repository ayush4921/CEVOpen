<p>In this study, TU derivatives were synthesised and tested for their potential as HCV entry inhibitors. The seven selected TU compounds exhibited potent anti-viral activities against genotypes 1/2 with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.04 to 27â€‰nM. The compounds also showed good pharmacokinetic properties. However, some compounds significant cytotoxicity; accordingly, 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> was selected as a potential anti-HCV drug candidate. The 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> possesses effective multi-genotypic antiviral activity. The docking analysis results suggest that 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> would bind to E2 to inhibit the entry of HCV. These results demonstrate that 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> can be a potential candidate drug for the development of HCV entry inhibitors.
