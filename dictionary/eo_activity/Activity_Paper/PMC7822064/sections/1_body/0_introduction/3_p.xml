<p>Despite increasing efforts to develop novel drugs effective against HCV, patients are mainly being treated with a virus-unspecific combination therapy of pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin

Unfortunately, both drugs induce severe side effects and have a low resistance barrier as well as an inconvenient administration regime

Other challenges include appearance of escape mutants, high costs of current therapy regimens, and negative side effects.

Although drugs that target the virus are currently in clinical trials, a medical need remains for new HCV therapeutic agents. There is a particular need for HCV therapeutic agents that have broad activity against the majority of HCV genotypes and their subtypes (e.g. 1a/b, 2a/b 3a/b, 4a/b, etc.).
