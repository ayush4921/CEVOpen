<p>The essential players in HCV virus entry are HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2, which form a heterodimer and constitute viral envelope proteins

 </xref>. HCV E1 does not directly interact with host receptors, whereas E2 directly binds with host receptors, such as the CD81 receptor

 </xref>. Therefore, we propose that 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> would bind to E2 in order to neutralise CD81 receptor interaction and viral entry. The flexible conformation of compound 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> demonstrated energetically favourable interactions with those targeted residues of E2 involved in the interaction of the CD81 receptor (mainly the loop) and the surface of the β sandwich.
