<p>Initially, we screened 296 TU derivatives for anti-viral activity against genotypes 1/2 using the infectious HCVcc system and seven selected compounds with potent activities for further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ADME/toxicity studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Accordingly, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ADME and cytotoxicity evaluations were conducted for the seven compounds to select the best potential drug candidate (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The compounds showed good metabolic stability in mouse and human liver microsomes, and they also were found to be stable in mouse and human plasma. In addition, the compounds did not reveal any negligible effects for CYP3A4 and CYP2A9 inhibition. However, some compounds showed significant cytotoxicity with human cell lines, including HEK293 (embryonic kidney cells), SK-N-SH (neuroblastomas), HepG2 (hepatomas), and Jurkat (immortalised T lymphocytes) (data not shown). Accordingly, based on these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> test results, 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> was selected for further characterisation as an anti-HCV drug candidate.
