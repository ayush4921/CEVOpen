 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> was tested for cross-genotype activities against seven genosubtypes (nine subtypes) of the virus using a dose–response assay in the HCVcc system. The representative dose–response plots for HCV inhibition and cytotoxicity are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> generally exhibited potent inhibition against the six HCV genotypes (HCV genotype 
 <bold>1a</bold>, 
 <bold>2a</bold>, 
 <bold>2 b</bold>, 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>4a</bold>, and 
 <bold>7a</bold>) whereas no significant cytotoxicity was observed for all tested genosubtypes. 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the nano-subnanomolar range in several HCV subgenotypes, which is much lower than those of a well-known HCV inhibitor, sofosbuvir (

 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> possesses effective multi-genotypic antiviral activity.
