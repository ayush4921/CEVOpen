 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>To develop unique small-molecule inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV), thiophen urea (TU) derivatives were synthesised and screened for HCV entry inhibitory activities. Among them, seven TU compounds exhibited portent anti-viral activities against genotypes 1/2 (EC
  <sub>50</sub> &lt; 30â€‰nM) and subsequently, they were further investigated; based on the pharmacological, metabolic, pharmacokinetic, and safety profiles, 
  <bold>J2H-1701</bold> was selected as the optimised lead compound as an HCV entry inhibitor. 
  <bold>J2H-1701</bold> possesses effective multi-genotypic antiviral activity. The docking results suggested the potential interaction of 
  <bold>J2H-1701</bold> with the HCV E2 glycoprotein. These results suggest that 
  <bold>J2H-1701</bold> can be a potential candidate drug for the development of HCV entry inhibitors.
