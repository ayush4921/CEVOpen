<p id="par0095">We prepared a list of herbs that had been subjected to efficacy testing. Some known efficacies were confirmed. For example, Ginseng Radix

 </xref> Only six herbs have not been recently evaluated in terms of skin effects: Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata, Arisaematis Rhizoma, Asini Corii Colla, Dolichoris Semen, Euphorbiae Kansui Radix, and Succinum. Notably, four of these (Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata, Arisaematis Rhizoma, Crotonis Semen, and Euphorbiae Kansui Radix) are widely known to be toxic. Our approach affords a novel understanding of unknown medicinal characteristics of herbs used for skincare and will help in the identification of new skincare candidates.
