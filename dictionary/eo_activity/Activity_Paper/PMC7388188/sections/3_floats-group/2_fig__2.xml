  <p>A color-coded map of the relationships between the 52 herbs and 26 SRKs. We used data mining to reveal the characteristics of 52 herbs mentioned in a classical medical text. Each herb is associated with a different skin-related function. For example, Ginseng Radix was highly associated with both tonification and anti-aging, but Rehmanniae Radix was associated with anti-aging only.</p>
