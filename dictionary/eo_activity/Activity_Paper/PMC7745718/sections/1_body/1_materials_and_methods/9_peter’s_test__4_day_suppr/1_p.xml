<p>By using chloroquine-sensitive rodent malaria parasite, namely; 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, the standard four-day suppressive method was used in this study.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Treatment of infected mice was started after 3 hours of infection on day 0 and continued daily for four days (ie, from day 0 to day 3). On the fifth day (day 4) blood samples were collected from the tail snip of each mouse. Thin smears were prepared and stained with 10% Giemsa solution. Then, each stained slide was examined under the microscope with an oil immersion objective of 100x magnification power to evaluate the percent suppression of each extract with respect to the control groups.
