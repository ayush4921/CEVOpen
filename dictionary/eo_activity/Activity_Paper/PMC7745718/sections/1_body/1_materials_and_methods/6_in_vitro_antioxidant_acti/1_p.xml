<p>The antioxidant activity of the leaves extract of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> was evaluated by using DPPH free radical scavenging assay. 0.004 gm of DPPH was dissolved in 100mL methanol in the dark and 3.9 mL of a 0.1 mM methanolic solution of DPPH was mixed with a 0.1mL methanolic solution of different concentrations of the extract ranging from 50 to 1000 Î¼g/mL and incubated in the dark for thirty minutes at room temperature. Ascorbic acid served as a standard antioxidant for this experiment. After 30 minutes, the absorbance of the mixture and the control at 517 nm was read by a UV spectrophotometer.
