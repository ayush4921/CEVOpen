<p>In all mouse models, the positive control group was received Chloroquine 25 mg/kg and the negative control group was received distilled water 10 mL/kg; while the test groups were received three doses (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg) of the 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> crude extract. The leaves extract of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> was determined based on the result of the acute oral toxicity test. The middle doses of the solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> were 1/10 of the limit dose, the higher doses of the solvent fractions 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> were twice of the middle doses of the solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic>, and a half does of the middle doses of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> were the lower doses of the extract.
