<p>The current finding revealed that all tested doses (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg) of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> extract exhibited significant parasitemia suppression when compared with the negative control group. The maximum suppression (49.25%, p &lt; 0.0001) was revealed at the highest dose of the crude extract (400mg/kg) then by the middle dose of the extract (200mg/kg) (33.67%, p &lt; 0.0001) and 100mg/kg (27.64%, p &lt; 0.01) (
