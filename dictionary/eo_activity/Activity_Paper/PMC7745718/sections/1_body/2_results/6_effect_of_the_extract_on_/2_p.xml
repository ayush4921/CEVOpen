<p>The lower (100mg/kg), and the middle (200mg/kg) doses of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> failed to protect the weight loss as compared to the negative control group. However, the higher (400mg/kg) dose of the extract and the standard drug exhibited a significant (p&lt;0.05) protection of body weight loss as compared to the negative control group. The extract also produced a dose-dependent effect on preventing a drop in body temperature on day 4 after the infection. The middle (200mg/kg) and highest (400mg/kg) crude extract-treated group had showed significant (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) activity in prevention against rectal temperature reduction when compared to negative control group. Similarly, chloroquine 25mg/kg had shown significant (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) activity in prevention against body temperature reduction when compared to the negative control (
