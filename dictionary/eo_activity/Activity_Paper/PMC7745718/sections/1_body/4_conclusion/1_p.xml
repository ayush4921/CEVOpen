<p>The results obtained from the present study revealed that the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> has antiplasmodial activity as evidenced by their ability to suppress P. berghei infection in mice in a dose-dependent manner. The results also revealed free radical scavenging activity by the extract which may contribute to the antimalarial activity. This confirms the traditional antimalarial claim of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic>. Thus, the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> leaves might serve as a new source for the development of a novel antimalarial agent. However, further fractionation, isolation, and characterization of the extract are required to identify the accountable lead compound (s) with the potential of antimalarial activity.
