<p>Hematological abnormalities and body temperature reduction are the common features of P. berghei infected rodents.

 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> In all test models, the higher doses of the crude extract (200 and 400mg/kg) showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) protective effect against temperature reduction as compared to the negative control. The possible mechanism for the prevention of body temperature reduction could be the reduced level of parasitemia as a reduction of temperature is directly related to the increased level of parasitemia. The packed cell volume was determined to assess the effectiveness of the extract of 
 <italic>A. polystachyus</italic> in preventing hemolysis as a result of a rising parasitemia level. The basic causes of anemia in humans and rodents comprise, the clearance of uninfected RBC, dyserythropoiesis, erythropoietic suppression, and the clearance and/or destruction of infected RBCs. In the negative control group, the parasitemia level was increased, while the hematocrit packed cell volume was decreased noticeably from day to day till the death of the mice, which was also reported in previous similar studies.
