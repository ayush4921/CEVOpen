<p>Liver fibrosis is characterized by excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) such as collagen type-I (Col1) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-smooth muscle actin (
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. So we detected the effect of the compounds on the expression of the above proteins, and results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. After 24 h treatment, both RTA and RTB could inhibit the increase of ECM-related proteins stimulated by TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is also an important signaling pathway in the development of liver fibrosis that not only participates in the proliferation and apoptosis of liver cells but also promotes activation of hepatic stellate cells [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In HSC-T6 cells stimulated by TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>, the p-p65 was significantly increased, as well as p65 in nucleus. While under the treatment of the compounds, the levels of these two proteins decreased indicating that RTA and RTB could suppress NF-kB activation and ECM deposition induced by TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> in hepatic stellate cells.
