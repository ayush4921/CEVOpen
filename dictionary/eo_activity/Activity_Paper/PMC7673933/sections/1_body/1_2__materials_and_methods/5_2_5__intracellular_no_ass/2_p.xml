<p>The fluorescence microscopy imaging of intracellular NO was recorded utilizing DAF-FM DA. Similarly, RAW264.7 murine macrophages were dispensed in 96-well microplates with a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well. After cell adhesion, RTA and RTB were added to the cell culture medium 2 hours before LPS stimulation. After 24 h incubation, cells were loaded with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of DAF-FM DA for 40 min at 37°C [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Then, cells were carefully rinsed by PBS for three times and then incubated for 30 min with Hoechst 33342. Fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence microscope (BX-53, Olympus, Japan).
