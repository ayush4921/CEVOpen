 </sup> Briefly, 250 µL of the oil (5% oil in DMSO) was pre incubated with 250 µL of α-amylase solution for 10 minutes at 25°C in 1 set of testtubes. In another set of testtubes, α-amylase was pre incubated with 250 µL of phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). Starch solution (250 µL) at increasing concentrations (0.30-5.0 mg/mL) was added to both sets of reaction mixtures to start the reaction. The mixture was then incubated for 10 minutes at 25°C and then boiled for 5 minutes after the addition of 500 µL of DNS to stop the reaction. The amount of maltose released was determined spectrophotometrically using a maltose standard curve and converted to reaction velocity. The Michealis-menten plot was obtained by plotting reaction velocity against substrate concentration, A double reciprocal plot (1/V vs 1/[
 <italic>S</italic>]), where V is reaction velocity and (
 <italic>S</italic>) is substrate concentration, was plotted. The type (mode) of inhibition of the oil on α-amylase activity was determined by analysis of the double reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plot. This plot was used to determine the Michaelis-Menten parameters.
