 </sup> Serial dilution of the oil (ranging from 1.25%-10%) was prepared with dimethyl sulfur oxide (DMSO). An aliquot amount (250 µL) of the various concentrations was placed in separate testtubes and 250 µL of 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing α-amylase solution (0.5 mg/mL) was added. This solution was pre incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes, after which 250 µL of 1% starch solution in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) was added and then further incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 µL of dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent. The testtubes were then incubated in boiling water for 5 minutes and were cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with 5 mL distilled water and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using spectrophotometer. Similar procedure was also used for the standard drug, acarbose. A control was prepared using the same procedure replacing the oil with DMSO. The α-amylase inhibitory activity was calculated as percentage inhibition:
