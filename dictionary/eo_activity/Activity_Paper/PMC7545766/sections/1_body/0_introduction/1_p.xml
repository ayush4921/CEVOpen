 </sup> It is a genetically multifactorial disease characterized by abnormally elevated blood glucose and dysregulation of carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr3-1179551420963106" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
 </sup> In diabetes mellitus, homeostasis of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is altered due to defects in insulin production, secretion or action.

 </sup> The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus in 2019 is estimated to be about 9.3% of the population and was responsible for about 4 million deaths globally in 2017.

 </sup> There are 3 different types of diabetes; type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

 </sup> Type 1 diabetes mellitus also known as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus results from chronic autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing pancreatic beta cells.

 </sup> Gestational diabetes mellitus is defined as glucose intolerance of various degrees that is first detected during pregnancy.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr8-1179551420963106" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
 </sup> In type II diabetes also reffered to as non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, the body does not use insulin effectively resulting in elevated blood glucose.

 </sup> It accounts for approximately 90% of the total occurrence of diabetes mellitus.

 </sup> An effective therapeutic approach for controlling blood glucose level is to inhibit or suppress the activities of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes such as alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase.

 </sup> Alpha amylase catalyzes the first step in the breakdown of starch by hydrolyzing the polysaccharide (starch) into 3 major products; maltose, maltriose and limit dextrins while α- glucosidase catalyzes the end step of digestion of starch and disacharides.

  <xref rid="bibr13-1179551420963106" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </sup> Thus, inhibitors of α-amylase delay the breakdown of carbohydrates in the small intestine thereby diminishing postprandial blood glucose in T2D.

 </sup> Carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme inhibitors used in clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes include acarbose, miglitol and voglibose. These inhibitors have side effects such as flatulence, diarrhoea and liver disorder.

 </sup> Besides, most of these inhibitors contain sugar moieties and their synthesis involves tedious multistep procedures.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr1-1179551420963106" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 </sup> Thus, the need for inhibitors from non-sugar sources with lesser side effects.
