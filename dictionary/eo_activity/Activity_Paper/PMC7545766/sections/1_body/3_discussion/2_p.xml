<p>The decrease in velocity observed in the Michealis-Menten plot indicates that the oils decreased the enzyme activity. This further suggests that they oils are inhibitors of alpha amylase. The Lineweaver-Burk plot and the kinetic parameters obtained from it, indicates that Vmax of they 2 oils and the no inhibitor remains the same while the Km of the oils increased. This is characteristic of competitive inhibition. The standard drug, acarbose, is a competitive inhibitor of Î±- amylase.

 </sup> Competitive inhibitors are effective because they are structural analog of the substrate and thus can bind to the active site of the enzyme. When they bind, they form an EI complex instead of ES complex, which prevents the enzyme from acting on its substrate (starch) and thus prevents it breakdown to smaller molecules and ultimately prevents the breakdown to glucose.
