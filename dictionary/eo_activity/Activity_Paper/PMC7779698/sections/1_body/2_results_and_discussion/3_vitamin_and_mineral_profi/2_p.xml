 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Vitamins are the essential micronutrients which orchestrate various physiological functions in the human body. These essential components need to be supplied from the diet to prevent deficiencies (hypovitaminosis or avitaminosis) (

 <italic>C. cristata</italic> inflorescences. The chromatograms of vitamins as obtained by HPLC are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 (a–j)</xref>. Water soluble vitamin, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was found to be present in CCF at a concentration of 4.3 mg/100gm. This value is very low if compared with other edible flowers (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Prata et al., 2017</xref>). Among B-complex vitamins, Panthothenic acid (Vitamin B5) was found to be present in adequate amounts (107.64μg/100g) followed by Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6). Thiamine (Vitamin B1), Folic acid (Vitamin B9), Cyanobobalamine (Vitamin B12) and Biotine (Vitamin B7) were present in trace amounts. Lipophilic Vitamin, Vitamin A (Retinol) was present in minute amounts (11.95μg/100g). High concentration of Vitamin E (α-tocopherol), which is an important antioxidant, was present in the sample (455.00μg/100g). Compared to other plant resources, the concentration of vitamin E was higher and can play a pivotal role in providing the essential micronutrients to the consumer.
