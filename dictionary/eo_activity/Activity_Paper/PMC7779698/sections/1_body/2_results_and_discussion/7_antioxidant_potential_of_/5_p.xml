<p id="p0155">The reducing power of CCF extract as a function of its concentration dependent response relation was found in the reductive ability of the sample extract. The absorbance increased with increase in concentration of the extract. At the concentration of 1000 μg/ml, the absorbance value was measured to be 0.814. This may be due to the presence of hydrogen donating reductones in the flower (
