Various dilutions of standard gallic acid were prepared from this stock solution. One millilitre aliquots of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/ml of gallic acid solution were mixed with 5.0 ml of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (diluted ten-fold) and 4.0 ml of sodium carbonate solution (75 g/l) and calibration curve was plotted. The absorbance was measured after 30 min at 20 °C at 765 nm. One millilitre extract was mixed separately with the same reagents and absorbance was measured at 765 nm after 1 h and kept under light protection. The total phenolic compound in the extract was determined using the formula:
