<p id="p0075">The ability of CCF extract to scavenge the DPPH radicals was investigated by using standard methodology (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blois, 1958</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Shah and Thakur, 2015</xref>). Briefly, 0.1 mM solution of DPPH in ethanol and 1.5 ml of this solution was added to 0.5 ml of extract solution in ethanol at different concentrations (50–300 μl/ml). The mixture was shaken and allowed to stand at room temperature (27 °C) for 30 min. The absorbance was then measured at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer. A blank without DPPH was used to remove the influence of the color of the extracts and an ethanolic solution of DPPH was used as a negative control. Ascorbic acid was used as a reference. All the measures were carried out in triplicates. The DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following equation:
