<p id="p0160">This is the first report on the nutritional composition and antioxidant capacity of the 
 <italic>Celosia cristata</italic> inflorescences (red variety) from Kashmir Valley. The results of our present investigation have shown the potential of 
 <italic>C. cristata</italic> as an edible and medicinal plant. The flowers are a source of biologically active and nutraceutical components with important pharmacological and antioxidant effects. Our findings suggest that CCF extract can strongly quench free radicals, inhibit the peroxidation of lipids, and preserve the aesthetics of food by chelating metal ions. In the present investigation, the major anti-oxidant components were phenols, flavonoids and α-tocopherol. Ascorbic acid and secondary metabolites like saponins, and alkaloids found in CCF are also known to exhibit antioxidant activities. This implies that presence of CCF extract in the diet could reduce the risk of several degenerative diseases, depending upon the bioavailability of the compounds. The flower was found to be a good source of minerals, fatty acids and amino acids. As mentioned earlier, 
 <italic>C. cristata</italic> is a potential source of betalain pigment which is responsible for its brilliantly colored inflorescences. The pigment demonstrates high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting that it may be adopted at a commercial scale for the production of an important food additive with promising health benefits.
