 <p>This study was undertaken to investigate the nutritional value, chemical characterization and 
  <italic>in-vitro</italic> antioxidant activity of 
  <italic>Celosia cristata</italic> Linn. inflorescences, a culturally significant plant of Kashmir valley, India. The results revealed that the flower contained variety of vitamins (A, B-complex, C and E) with Vitamin E (tocopherol) showing the highest concentration. Among minerals, potassium was found to be present in significant amounts, the amino acid and fatty acid profile of the flower was also found to be satisfactory. The antioxidant activity of flower extract was evaluated by various 
  <italic>in-vitro</italic> analytical methods: DPPH free radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation, reducing power, and metal chelating ability. Therefore, the present research brings into focus, the nutritional and antioxidant potential of 
  <italic>C.Â cristata</italic> flower and its extract.
