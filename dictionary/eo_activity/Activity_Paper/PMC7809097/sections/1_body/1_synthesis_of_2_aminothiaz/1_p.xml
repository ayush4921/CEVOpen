<p id="Par7">To date, there are many methods for the preparation of 2-aminothiazole and their derivatives such as Hantzsch, Cook Heilborn, and Tchernic have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The first and most frequently used method is Hantzsch’s synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], who originated it in 1887, involving the reaction of α-halo carbonyl compounds with thioureas or thioamides in the presence of bromine/iodine, silica chloride, 1,3-di-nbutylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, ammonium 12-molybdophosphate, and cyclodextrin, aq. NaICl
 <sub>2</sub> or using various homogenous and heterogonous catalysts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another method of 
 <bold>6</bold> preparations involves condensation rhodanamine (H
 <sub>2</sub>N–SCN) with the tenfold excess of ethyl acetoacetate in a melt at 100–120 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Condensation of ethyl acetoacetate with formamidine disulfide hydrobromide was performed analogously, providing 
 <bold>6</bold> in 57–62% yield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Carbonyl compounds and thiourea can be combined directly into the thiazole ring using bromine as the condensing agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Reaction of ethyl β-ethoxyacrylate with 
 <italic>N</italic>-bromosuccinimide (NBS) produces a novel intermediate, α-bromo-α-formylacetate hemiacetal. Cyclization of the in situ formed hemiacetal with thioureas, also afforded 2-aminothiazole-5-carboxylates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, reaction of the trichloroether with diethylene glycol gives the cyclic acetal, which may also be converted to 2-aminothiazole (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
