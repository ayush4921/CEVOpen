<p id="Par12">Zhang and coworkers designed and synthesized 2-amino-4-phenylthiazole derivatives. The compounds were screened for in vitro antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines containing A549, HeLa, HT29, and Karpas299 human cancer cell lines. Some of these synthesized compounds displayed remarkable antiproliferative activity. Among these derivatives, compound 
 <bold>10</bold> exhibited outstanding growth inhibitory effects against A549, HeLa, HT29, and Karpas299 cancer cell lines, especially for HT29 cells (IC

 <italic>µ</italic>M). Based on in vitro activity of target compounds, the 
 <italic>meta</italic>-halogen- (especially chloro-) on benzene ring improved anticancer activity and 3,4-diCl- or 3-Cl-benzene ring exhibited better inhibitory activity than 2,4-diCl substitution. According to the biological assay and a molecular docking analysis suggests that these compounds can be identified as a potential inhibitors (Fig.
