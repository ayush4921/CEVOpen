<p id="Par34">Regarding in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity of girolline (
 <bold>35</bold>) as a natural antitumor compound Schiavi et al. synthesized 2-aminothiazole analogues of girolline. Because of undesired side effects of girolline, the phase I clinical trials have been discontinued. Thus, the synthesis of analogs might allow for improvement of its biological profiles. In this study, analogs were produced in two forms, 
 <italic>threo</italic> (natural stereochemistry form) and 
 <italic>erythro</italic> (non-natural form). They synthesized analogs in which the side chain of the natural product was preserved, while the 2-aminoimidazole ring was replaced by a 2-aminothiazole ring. This change was resulted into the most potent compounds 
 <bold>36a</bold> and 
 <bold>36b</bold> in this series. Prepared compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against KB cells, derived from an epidermoid carcinoma in the mouth of an adult Caucasian male. Compounds 
 <bold>36a</bold> and 
 <bold>36b</bold> have shown an interesting and unexpected in vitro activity; 100 and 85% inhibition, respectively. Presence of chlorine and nitrogen functional groups was known as necessary for their anticancer activity. Amine group performed the better activity than azide in the side chain. Also, 1สน-hydroxy and 2-amino groups must be protected (Fig.
