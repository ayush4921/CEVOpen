<p id="Par16">In a study in 2016, Zhu and coworkers assessed antitumor activity of TH- 39 (
 <bold>15</bold>) against K562 cells by immunoblot, co-immunoprecipitation, MTT assay, and flow cytometry. TH- 39 (
 <bold>15</bold>) showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.78 µM against K562 cells. Mechanism studies exhibited that TH-39 (
 <bold>15</bold>) may prevent the interaction of Hec1 and Nek2 in K562 cells. These compounds inhibited cell proliferation by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in K562 cells in concentration and time dependently. Apoptosis induction was associated with caspase-3 activation, Bcl-2 down-regulation, and Bax up-regulation. TH-39 (
 <bold>15</bold>) also increased ROS accumulation and diminished mitochondrial membrane potential in K562 cells. According to the results, this compound might create apoptosis induction using the ROS-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Therefore, this study exhibited the potential therapeutic efficacy of TH-39 as an anti-cancer compound for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (Fig.
