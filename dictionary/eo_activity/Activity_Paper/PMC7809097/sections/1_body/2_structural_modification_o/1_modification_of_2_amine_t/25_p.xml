<p id="Par33">According to the results, derivative with a 2-(dialkylamino)ethylurea moiety at the position 2 of benzothiazole retained the antiproliferative activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 13 nM against PI3Kα) against the four cancer cell lines and inhibition of PI3K and mTOR. Replacement of 2-acetylamino in compound 
 <bold>33</bold> with akylamino showed a significant drop in the cell-based activity. Therefore alkylamino is not a suitable substituent at the 2-position of benzothiazole core. Derivatives with a methoxy at the position 2 pyridine ring increased the antiproliferative effects. The presence of arylsulfonamino group at the position 3 of pyridine ring, such as 4-methylphenylsulfonamino, showed more activity than the presence of cyclopropylsulfonamino and the cyano groups at the position 3 of pyridine. The replacement of benzothiazole scaffold with thiazolo[5,4-
 <italic>b</italic>]pyridine exhibited an better activity towards HCT-116 and MCF-7 cell lines and a close activity towards U87 MG and A549 cell lines. In the cell-based activity, derivative 
 <bold>34</bold> had the comparable IC
 <sub>50</sub> value to that of compound 
 <bold>33</bold>. Acute oral toxicity of these derivatives increased dramatically. Derivative 
 <bold>34</bold> inhibited successfully tumor growth in a mice S180 homograft model. The results suggested that 1-(2-dialkylamino)ethyl-3-(6-(2-methoxy-3-sulfonylaminopyridin-5-yl) benzo[
 <italic>d</italic>]thiazol-2-yl)urea analogues could use as strong PI3K inhibitors and anticancer compounds with low toxicity (Fig.
