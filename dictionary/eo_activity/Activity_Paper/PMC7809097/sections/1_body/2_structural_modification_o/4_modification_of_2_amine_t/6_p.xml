<p id="Par64">Regarding in demonstrated impressive anticancer activity of SK1 and SK2, Compound 
 <bold>73</bold> was identified by Smith and co-workers from a high throughput screen. 4‑((4-(4-Chlorophenyl)thiazol-2yl)amino)phenol (
 <bold>73</bold>) exhibited some selectivity toward SK2 as a kinase inhibitor (Ki: SK2 = 7.9 μM, SK1 = 16 μM) but is a more powerful promoter of SK1-degradation (100% SK1 ablation at 10 μM) and has been identified as an inhibitor of Des1 activity (Ki= 0.3 μM). Presumably, the exchange of the thiazole ring in 
 <bold>73</bold> with the oxadiazole ring has decreased affinity for the allosteric site and increased affinity for either the ATP or Sph binding sites on SK1 and SK2 (Fig.
