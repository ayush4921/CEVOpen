<p id="Par59">Considering Sphingosine kinases (SphK1, SphK2) as main regulators of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an aminothiazole class of Sphingosine kinases inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by Vogt et al. Modifications of the known 
 <bold>SKI-II (66)</bold> scaffold for definition of structure-activity relationships discovered potent inhibitors. The hydroxy group in 4-position of the phenyl ring seems to be crucial for inhibitory potential, because of shift it to the 2- and 3-position led to loss of inhibition and insertion of a methylene spacer between hydroxyl moiety and aromatic ring produced an inactive compound. Interestingly, the methoxy-group in 2-position of the phenyl ring showed a slight tendency towards SphK1-selective inhibition. Analogues containing alkyloxy-substituents in 4- and 3-position as dimethoxy lost their ability to inhibit SphKs. But by introducing a third methoxy group in 5-position a substantial increase in potency and isoenzyme preference could be achieved. Therefore, presence of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl was a favorable substitution for inhibitory activity. Compounds 
 <bold>68</bold> (ST-1780) and 
 <bold>69</bold> (ST-1577) were candidated for structural modifications and in vivo investigation as selective SphK1 and SphK2 inhibitors, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>67</bold> (ST-1803) exhibited the most promising inhibition of over 50% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.3 and 6.5 µM towards SphK1 and SphK2, respectively. Derivative 
 <bold>67</bold> have not exhibited apparent cytotoxicity. These desirable properties were qualified compound 
 <bold>67</bold> for further physicochemical studies (Fig.
