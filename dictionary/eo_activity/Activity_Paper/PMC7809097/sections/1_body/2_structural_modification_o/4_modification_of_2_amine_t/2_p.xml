<p id="Par60">Recently, Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) has been proposed as a first-in-class anti-cancer target molecule to regulate Wnt signaling pathway. Yamada et al. have designed and synthesized a novel aminothiazole inhibitor of TNIK, 5-(4-methylbenzamido)-2-(phenylamino)thiazole-4-carboxamide (KY-05009 (
 <bold>3</bold>)). It was shown to be a potent inhibitor of TNIK attenuating β-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription and MLK1 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 9 and 18 nM in a kinase assay). Also, in A549 cells its efficacy to inhibit EMT in cancer cells was validated through MAP kinases (ERK and JNK) signaling pathways. The molecular docking/binding report revealed that KY-05009 has two H-bond interactions with Cys108 in the hinge region of TNIK, and CH/π interactions with Val31, Gly111, and Leu160 [
