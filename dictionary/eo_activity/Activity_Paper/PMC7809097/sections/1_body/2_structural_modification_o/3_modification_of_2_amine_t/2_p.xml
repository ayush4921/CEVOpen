<p id="Par41">Therefore, novel series of FTis by mimetics of the C-terminal CAAX tetrapeptide of Ras protein replacing cysteine with 2-amino-4-thiazolyl-, 2-mercapto-4-thiazolyl-, 2-mercapto-4-imidazolyl- and 2-methylmercapto-4-thiazolyl-acetic or propionic acid were designed. Of the four designed replacements of 3-pyridyl with new heterocycles, the compounds which have 2-amino-4-thiazolyl and a methylenecarbonylamino linker between aminothiazole and biphenyl core (
 <bold>45a</bold> and 
 <bold>45b</bold>), exhibited a significant FTase inhibition both in vitro and in cells and reduced rat smooth muscle cell growth in the low nanomolar range. Also, in case of 
 <bold>45a</bold> the o-tolyl residue is determinant for the correct orientation and is itself responsible for favorable contacts within the active site, which have been imputed both to the increased hydrophobic surface area and conformational constraint. On the basis of these results, 2-aminothiazole can be considered as an alternative to heterocycles, such as pyridine and imidazole, normally used in FTase inhibitors designed as non-thiol CAAX mimetics (Fig.
