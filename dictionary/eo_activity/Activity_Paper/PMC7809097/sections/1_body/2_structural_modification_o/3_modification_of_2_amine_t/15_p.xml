<p id="Par54">Considering Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) (
 <bold>59</bold>) as one of the well-known natural molecules that inhibits cell growth at nanomolar concentrations, exhibiting inhibitory effects even on multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines through its interaction with tubulin at the colchicine site. Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies of CA-4 have underlined that the presence of the 3,4,5-trimethoxy substituted A-ring and the 4-methoxy substituted B-ring separated by a double-bond with cis-configuration are fundamental for optimal antiproliferative activity. It has also been reported that 3-hydroxy group on the B-ring is not necessary for potent activity. These histories caused Romagnoli and coworkers to synthesize a novel series of 2-amino-4-(3ʹ,4ʹ,5ʹ-trimethoxyphenyl)-5-aryl thiazoles with the goal of evaluating the effects of substituents on the phenyl at the 5-position of the thiazole skeleton on biological activities. On the basis of in vitro antiproliferative activity data, the best substituents for the C5-position of the thiazole ring were revealed (
 <bold>60a-e</bold>). An ethoxy group at the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position (
 <bold>60e</bold>) produced the most active compound in the series, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.03-0.9 nM against five of seven cancer cell lines. The most active compounds retained full activity in multidrug-resistant cancer cells and acted through the colchicine site of tubulin. Treated cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, with cell death proceeding through an apoptotic pathway that was only partially caspase-dependent (Fig.
