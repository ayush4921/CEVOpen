<p id="Par53">A novel series of (S)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole derivatives were designed and synthesized by Prasanna and coworkers. These compounds were evaluated on K562 and Reh by trypan blue exclusion, MTT, LDH assays as potential antileukemic agents. The results displayed that thiazole derivatives with electron withdrawing halogen groups at phenyl ring of arylthiourea increased cytotoxic effect. The presence of chloro and fluoro in phenyl ring exhibited high potency compared with compounds without them. The best result obtained for compound 
 <bold>58</bold> with 2,4 dichloro groups. IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 
 <bold>58</bold> were 11 and 20 µM for K562 and Reh cell lines, respectively. According to the flow cytometric analysis by annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide (PI) double staining and DNA fragmentation, compound 
 <bold>58</bold> showed apoptosis inducer effect in cancer cell line tested (Fig.
