<p id="Par90">Mohamed et al. evaluated a novel synthesized derivative 
 <bold>101</bold> on different human cell lines and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for MCF-7, HepG2 and HCT-116 cell lines obtained 21.4 ± 1.5 (µg/mL), 19.6 ± 1.45 (µg/mL) and 20 ± 2.1 (µg/mL), respectively. The major problem encountered in cancer chemotherapy is mainly because of iron deficiency finally leads to reduction in RBC count or hemoglobin content. Similarly, in this study RBCs count was increased in 
 <bold>101</bold> by 51% compared to EAC control group that was reduced hemoglobin, RBC, and WBC count. Literature survey affirm that increase in life span of tumor-bearing mice, decrease in tumor volume and viable cell count and elevation of non-viable cell count is as a result of any antitumor agents efficacy. Also compound 
 <bold>101</bold> significantly increases the life span of the EAC treated mice. Reported results proved the cytotoxic efficacy of 
 <bold>101</bold> on tumor cells. Based on flow cytometric analysis, compound 
 <bold>101</bold> increased P53 genes expression that induced Ehrlich cells apoptosis (Fig.
