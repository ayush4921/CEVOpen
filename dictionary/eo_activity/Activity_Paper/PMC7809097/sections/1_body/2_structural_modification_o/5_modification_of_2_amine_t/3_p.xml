<p id="Par77">Tomita et al. discovered a new derivatives of 1,7-disubstituted-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acids that have moderate cytotoxic effect. The SAR studies of these compounds performed by modifying positions of N-1 and C-7 and core ring in the structure. These synthesized compounds were assessed against different types of murine and human tumor cell lines (melanoma, stomach, colon, lung, ovary, and bladder). Based on the SAR studies, the 2-thiazolyl group was the optimal group at the N-1 position of the naphthyridine structure for improving antitumor activity. The aromatic groups were shown in order of decreasing activity: 2-thiazolyl &gt; 2-benzothiazolyl &gt; 3-methyl- 5-isoxazolyl &gt; 2-thienyl &gt; phenyl 
 <bold>=</bold> 4-fluorophenyl &gt; 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl &gt; 5-isoxazolyl. 2-Pyridyl similar to 5-pyrazolyl didnâ€™t show activity. Different substituents affected on the thiazole ring in order of decreasing activity: unsubstituted &gt; 4-methyl = 4-phenyl &gt; 5-bromo = 5-chloro &gt; 4,5- dimethyl &gt; 5-methyl &gt; 5-methoxy &gt; 4-
 <italic>tert</italic>butyl. According to the core, pyridopyrimidine analogue exhibited the most effect. Aminopyrrolidine group at the C-7 position was tolerable than others. In biological evaluation of derivatives, compounds 
 <bold>87a</bold> and 
 <bold>87b</bold> displayed good in vitro antitumor activity and in vivo assay (in mice bearing P388 leukemia) as well as AT-3639. The activity of these compounds can be compared with etoposide (Fig.
