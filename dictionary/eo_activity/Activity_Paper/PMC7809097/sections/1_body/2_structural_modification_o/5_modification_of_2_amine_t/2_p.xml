<p id="Par76">In a further work by Misra et al. were found N-Aryl aminothiazoles as potent CDK inhibitors (CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4). These compounds exhibited high potency on A2780 cells (in vitro). In determination of CDKs (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4) selectivity for synthesized compounds was identified that the nature of the N-aryl group affected on selectivity. Indicating substituent para to the amino group on the aryl ring would be directed toward the exterior of the protein and thus should be compatible with maintaining CDK inhibitory activity. Compounds 
 <bold>86</bold> (BMS-357075) indicated a pan-like CDK inhibitory activity. The amide backbone atoms of Leu-83 created essential H-binding interaction with the thiazole nitrogen and exocyclic amine proton. Analysis indicated serum protein binding at 90% for 
 <bold>86</bold>. Analogue 
 <bold>86</bold> with polar groups on the aryl ring displayed a potent inhibitor activity of CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 18, 3 and 26â€‰nm, respectively and produced a 56% increase in survival time versus untreated control against P388 murine leukemia in mice (Fig.
