<p>The analysis of volatile constituents from the HD and nanoemulsions of 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> essential oil was performed using a GC–MS apparatus. A trace GC ultra-chromatography system equipped with an ISQ-mass spectrometer and a 60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm-thick TG-5MS capillary column (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was programmed from 50 °C with a holding time of 3 min, and then the temperature was increased at a rate of 4 °C per min to 140 °C with a holding time of 5 min. Consequently, the temperature was increased at a rate of 6 °C per minute to 260 °C for a 5-min isothermal holding time. The injector temperature was 180 °C, the ion source temperature was 200 °C, and the transition line temperature was 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The mass spectrometer had a scan range from m/z 40–450, and the ionization energy was set at 70 Ev. The identification of compounds was based on matching with the MS computer library (NIST library, 2005 version) and comparison with those of authentic compounds and published data [
