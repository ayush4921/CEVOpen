<p>Cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay:CUPRAC was determined according to Bouratoua et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The method includes mixing of 40 μL of sample solution with 50 μL of a copper(II) chloride solution, 50 μL of neocuproine alcoholic solution, and 60 μL of ammonium acetate aqueous buffer at pH 7. After 30 min, the absorbance was read at 450 nm.Results were recorded as absorbance compared with the absorbance of TROLOX and ascorbic acid, which were used as antioxidant standards.
