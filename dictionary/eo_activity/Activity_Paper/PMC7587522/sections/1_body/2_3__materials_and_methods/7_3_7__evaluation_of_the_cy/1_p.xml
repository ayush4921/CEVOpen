<p>Hep G2 and THLE2 were cultured at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well (100µL) in a culture medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics (10,000 U of penicillin and 10 mg of streptomycin in 0.9% saline) and 10% serum (FBS) and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After attachment for 24 h, a serially diluted essential oil and its nanoemulsions were applied at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 6.25 μg/mL for THLE2 and from 200 to 6.25μg/mL for HepG2 cells. A positive control (5-FU) at concentrations ranging from 400 to 5 μg/mL was applied in parallel. Subsequently, 10 μL of a 12-mM MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL MTT in sterile PBS) was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the MTT solution was eliminated, and the precipitated purple formazan crystal was dissolved in DMSO for 20 min. A negative control of 10 μL of the MTT stock solution was added to 100 μL of the uncultured medium. With an ELISA reader, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The curve was illustrated on the basis of the variation of the proportions of surviving cells [(OD of sample − OD of blank)/(OD of control − OD of blank) × 100%] according to concentrations, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated using the sigmoidal curve obtained [
