 </bold> shows the distribution of subjects for each section of IndSIC, housewife, and unemployment, all of which were stratified by gender. The highest proportion of all subjects was working in Section G (wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycle), followed by Section C (manufacturing). Among female subjects, the highest proportion was in housewives. In almost all sections of IndSIC 2015, the proportion of males was dominant except for Section C (manufacturing), Section K (financial and insurance activities), Section P (education), and Section T (activities of a household as employers; undifferentiated goods and services-producing activities of households for own use).
