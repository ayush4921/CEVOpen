<p>The “Indonesian Standard of Industrial Classification” IndSIC was developed by the Centre of Statistical Bureau, or Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) of Indonesia, which was derived from the ISIC rev. 4. This study used the IndSIC 2015 version which consists of 21 sections (A to U), 88 divisions, 240 groups, 520 subgroups, and 1573 classes. Each item is coded as one letter plus five digits. For example, the code A 01111 can be interpreted as follows: A represents Section A (agriculture, forestry, and fishing), A 01 indicates Division A 01 (crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities), A 011 indicates Group A 011 (crowing of non-perennial crops), A 0111 indicates subgroups A 0111 (growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds), and A 01111 indicates Class A 01111 (corn farming) [
