<p>“Model 2” analysis was developed to discover the possible hidden risk of lung cancers in some divisions or groups. We subdivided Sections A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing), B (Mining and quarrying), C (Manufacturing), G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycle), H (Transportation and storage), and Q (Human health and social work activities) into divisions or groups. The remaining sections were not redivided into divisions because most of their divisions are not so different in terms of workplace exposure or work processes. The new classification consisted of the combinations of the sections and divisions or groups. The investigation of ORs was similar to the “Model 1” analysis.</p>
