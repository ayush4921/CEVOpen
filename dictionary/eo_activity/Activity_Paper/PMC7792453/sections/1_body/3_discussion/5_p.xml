<p>Siemiatycki et al. and Loomis et al. listed lung carcinogens (Group A) with the occupations or industries in which the carcinogen substances are found [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This study only identified the elevated risks of lung cancer for Division A01 (crop, animal production, and hunting) and Section F (construction) and could not discover potential increased risk for other occupations or industries that have occupational carcinogens. However, we can observe possible increased risks coming from Division C17 (pulp, paper, and paper products), Division C21 (pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical, and botanical products), and Division B (oil and gas). Unfortunately, the number of subjects was not sufficient to obtain enough controls. This meant that those divisions did not have controls, only some cases. Therefore, we could not indicate the OR. We were also careful with the increased OR for chemical and chemical product divisions compared to the housewife as a reference. The increased OR was not significant when the reference was from Section S and the other remaining sections. Further research should be conducted to investigate the risks of lung cancer by having a sufficient number of subjects.
