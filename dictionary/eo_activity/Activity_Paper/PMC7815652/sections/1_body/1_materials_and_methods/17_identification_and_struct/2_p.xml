<p id="p0135">The GC MS analysis was performed on a GC (PerkinElmer) system coupled to Perkin- Elmer Turbo Mass MS. HP1-MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 μm × 0.25 μm) was used under the following conditions: oven temperature programmed from 70 °C for 10 min, then gradually increased at 290 °C at 3 min; injector temperature, 250 °C, carrier gas Helium, flow rate 1 ml/min; the volume of injected sample was 0.4 μl; split ratio 1:60; ionization energy 70eV: Run time 40 min. The relative amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total area. The identification of the separated volatile compounds was done through retention indices and mass spectrometry by comparing mass spectra of the unknown peaks with those stored in the Nist 98/Nbs 75 K GC-MS library.</p>
