<p id="p0140">In order to check antifungal activity of crude and partially purified extract, extracts were dissolved in inert solvent i.e. acetone. It was observed to be neutral for growth of test fungus. Results of antifungal activity of crude as well as partially purified extracts were given in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> respectively (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, B). Inhibitory activity of standards and control tabulated in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). In case of crude extract, 100% alcoholic extract was observed to be best which showed 71.48% inhibition followed by aqueous and 50% hydroalcoholic extract which showed inhibition percent of 56.60% and 20.24% respectively.
