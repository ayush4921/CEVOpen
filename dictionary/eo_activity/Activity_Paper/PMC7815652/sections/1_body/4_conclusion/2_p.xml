<p id="p0215">Plant-based formulations can successfully be used in agriculture to treat plant diseases and can limit the use of chemical control agents to safer levels. Thus use of plant extract against plant pathogenic fungus is an important field of study and will be a best alternative of existing chemical antifungal in the near future. Antifungal effect of plant extract is mainly attributed to existence of secondary metabolites. These active constituents binds to membrane receptors and alter the cascade action generated thus leading to cyto-morphological alterations in test pathogenic fungus and directly or indirectly effect the growth and reproduction of the pathogen, thus bringing about its inhibition. Phytochemicals responsible for antimicrobial activity can be extracted from plant parts by using solvents of different polarity. Partial purification leads partial fractionization of phyto-constituents (i.e. much in alcoholic fraction of 
 <italic>Thevetia</italic> leaf extract) which can be further refined by column fractionation. This further refinement of phyto-constituents via GC-MS analysis is much sensitive and sophisticated technique of fractionation. In this study benzoic acid and its derivatives were observed in active column fraction which is already reported for antimicrobial activity in different plant.
