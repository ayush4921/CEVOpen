 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the research has not pinpointed the plant species that provide the daily dietary intake of these indigenous people. Still, the ethnic minorities in northern Thailand face food insecurity and malnutrition [

 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Promoting the consumption of traditional diets could improve nutrition because a number of wild food species, in particular ones that are used as vegetables, have been reported to have high nutritional qualities that surpass conventional vegetables [

 <xref rid="B45-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the information on the nutritional composition of wild leafy vegetable species in Thailand is limited and incomplete. Knowledge of nutrition- or health benefits may improve the perception of and attitude toward wild food plants [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The nutrient composition of wild food plants may provide informative data that will be advantageous to the health- and food security not only for indigenous people but also the rest of the population.
