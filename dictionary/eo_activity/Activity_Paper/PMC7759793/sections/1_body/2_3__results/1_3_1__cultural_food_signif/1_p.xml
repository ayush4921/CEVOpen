<p>According to the Cultural Food Significance Index, twelve wild food species had high CFSI values in both the Karen and the Lawa villages (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The folk names and traditional uses by the Karen and the Lawa of wild leafy vegetables are provided in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Most of the leafy vegetables originated in Asia, but a few species were more widely distributed, i.e., 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Acmella uliginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic>. The taste of the plant, the availability of plants, and multiple functionality were the main drivers of high significance, whereas the frequency of use, plant parts used, and medicinal roles were less important (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01748-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The highest taste score was for 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic> (15%), followed by 
 <italic>Spondias pinnata</italic> (10%) and 
 <italic>Ficus auriculata</italic> (9%). Most informants mentioned that the twelve wild leafy vegetables are very common and easy to collect and are available for a long collection period (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The multiple food uses of the twelve leafy vegetable species were cooked as soup (33%), eaten raw (31%), and boiled (10%). Most of the informants mentioned that the frequency of the leafy vegetable use was one time each month (36%), one time each week (21%), and more than one time each year but less than once per month (18%), respectively. The food medicinal role index values for the twelve wild leafy vegetables were smaller than their values for other sub-indices because the informants did not recognize the twelve wild vegetable species except 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, which received a very high score.
