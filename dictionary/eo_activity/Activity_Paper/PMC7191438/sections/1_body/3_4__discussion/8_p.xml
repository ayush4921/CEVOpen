 <italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity and antioxidant properties of some of the plants reported in our study have also been studied. Among these plants, potent cytotoxic activity was reported for knipholone anthrone isolated from 
 <italic>Kniphofia foliosa</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value that ranges between 0.9 ± 0.1 and 3.3 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similarly, Nibret and Wink reported the cytotoxic activity of the crude extract of 
 <italic>Acokanthera schimperi</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Studies conducted on the leaves of 
 <italic>Cineraria abyssinica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], bark of 
 <italic>Senna singueana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], and bark and leaves of 
 <italic>Rumex nepalensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] also revealed potent radical scavenging activity of these plants.
