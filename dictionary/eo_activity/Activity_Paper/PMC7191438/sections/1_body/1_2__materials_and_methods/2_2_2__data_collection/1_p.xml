<p>A team comprising a botanist and researchers from Addis Ababa University was set up, and health authorities were contacted for permission and identification of traditional herbalists living in each study area. Altogether, 117 traditional healers were approached using the snowball technique and 74 traditional healers who used herbs to manage cancer-like symptoms were selected. Ethnobotanical data were collected between January and August 2016, mainly through individual interviews with the selected traditional herbalists using a semistructured interview questionnaire. The questionnaire was prepared in Amharic language and translated to different local languages for traditional healers who do not speak Amharic. This questionnaire was designed to obtain information in the following areas: (i) general data on the informant, (ii) school attendance, (iii) use of plants for cancer treatment, (iv) source of the plant material, (v) part of the plant used, (vi) method of medicinal preparation, (vii) route of administration, and (viii) side effects.</p>
