<p>Mature leaves of 
 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> L. were procured from KOCL Research Farm, Kirbhatt, Nuvem, Goa, India (15°18ʹ11.27”N and 73°57ʹ13.34”E) during the flowering stage. The plant has been identified by Dr S. Krishnan and deposited at Goa University Herbarium, Goa-India, with the voucher number AVN, AM01516. The collected materials were thoroughly washed in water, cut into small pieces and shade dried at 35°C–40°C. The dried leaves were milled to a coarse powder. Thimbles were prepared of weighed quantities (100 gms) of powder and extracted with 95% methanol by hot continuous percolation method using Soxhlet apparatus at 45°C for 12 h. Subsequently, the extract was reduced to a molten mass and dried under-reduced pressure. The solid residue was stored at 0°C–4°C for subsequent experiments. The concentrated extract (10 mg) of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> was re-dissolved in 200 µL dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and made up to a volume of 1 mL with PBS. The acute toxicity study of this extract was carried out on Swiss albino mice as per reported method by Lorke [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to obtain a safe dose in mice. A test dose of 2000 mg/kg b.wt. was carried out with six animals. No, gross behavioural and mortality changes were observed at a dose level of 2000 mg/kg b.wt. suggesting the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value to be more than 2000 mg/kg b.wt. Frequently, 1/5
 <sup>th</sup> to 1/10
 <sup>th</sup> of the lethal dose is considered for effective dose calculation. For this purpose, the limit test was performed using a dose of 500 mg/kg b.wt. that was administered to six mice (Test Group, 
 <italic>n = 6</italic>) starved overnight and another group of six mice served as Control Group which was not administered leaf extract. On day 15, blood samples from both the groups were collected by direct heart puncture method and were assessed for haematological and biochemical parameters determined in a Bioanalyzer (Microlab 200) using commercial kits (Atlas Medica, UK) following standard methods [
