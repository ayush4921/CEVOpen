<p>The activities of Biochemical indices were estimated in blood serum samples as tissue function biomarkers as given in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A significant increase was found in albumin, total bilirubin (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and SALP enzyme (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) activities in LEAM treated mice. However, a significant decrease was observed in Urea (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), creatinine, SGOT (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and SGPT (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) contents in treated group. On the other hand, the activities of total protein and globulin were not significantly altered (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) when treated with LEAM (500 mg/kg b.wt.).
