<p>Effects of LEAM on solid tumour development are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The oral administration of the leaf methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> significantly inhibited the formation of solid tumours in a dose-dependent manner. It was observed that LEAM at 100 mg/kg b.wt. caused no significant tumour reduction compared to the untreated group. In untreated mice, the tumour volume induced by DLA cells were found to be about 15 times increased from day 0 to day 43. However, the tumour volume was found to be only 9, 8, 6, and 2 times increased in mice treated with LEAM at 100, 200, 500 mg/kg b.wt. doses, and standard Cisplatin, respectively, during these days. Significant reduction in solid tumour volume was observed for LEAM treated groups at 200 and 500 mg/kg b.wt. with 58.11% and 65.70% inhibition compared to control tumour. Whereas Cisplatin treated group showed substantially higher tumour inhibition compared to control by 86.31%. While least tumour inhibitory potential was seen at a lower dose of 100 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM with 40.36% inhibition compared to control. The higher concentration of 500 mg/kg b.wt. of LEAM was found to be more efficient in reducing the tumour volume followed by 200 mg/kg b.wt. of LEAM and 100 mg/kg LEAM during the experimental period.
