<p>This study was undertaken due to vast research literature that brought enlightenment and motivation to conduct further clinical 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> investigations on the biological activities of methanol extracts from 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaves to gain an insight into its emergence as new food and pharmaceutical option. As reported, the leaves of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> contain bioactive compounds such as annonaceous acetogenins in which annonacin was the foremost copious acetogenin isolated from leaves of
