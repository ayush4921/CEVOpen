<p id="p0175">The inhibitors of AChE are being used widely to find targeted therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. The BvRM and BvLM extracts were also investigated for their AChE inhibition activity. Both extracts depicted significant inhibition activity along with the standard drug, donepezil. BvRM and BvLM depicted 89.8% and 93.3% inhibition of AChE in comparison to 94.2% inhibition by donepezil at 100 μg/mL (

 <sub>50</sub> values for both extracts along with donepezil depicting their high efficacy for AChE inhibition (
