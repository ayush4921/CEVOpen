<p id="p0170">The BvRM and BvLM extracts were investigated for their anti-inflammatory activity using HRBC stabilization test. Aspirin, an anti-inflammatory drug was used as standard. BvLM extract at 50 μg/mL concentration showed the highest percentage of protection (99.58%) from hemolysis (

 <sub>50</sub> values of 50.18 ± 1.0 μg/mL and 8.572 ± 0.2 μg/mL, respectively while aspirin showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.341 ± 0.47 μg/mL indicating that percentage protection of hemolysis by selected plant extracts is significantly higher than standard drug (
