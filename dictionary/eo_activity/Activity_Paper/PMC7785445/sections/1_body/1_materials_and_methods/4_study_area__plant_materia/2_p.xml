<p id="p0030">Fresh Red beets (
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic>) plant species were collected from a local vendor on Park Road Near cultivation point and transported to laboratory (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). The plant was identified by a taxonomist and a voucher specimen was deposited. The stems joining the roots and leaves were detached and discarded. The leaves and roots were washed with fresh water. The roots were peeled and sliced into fine and thin pieces. Both the leaves and thinly sliced roots were shade dried at room temperature until all the water content had evaporated and the sample had become fit for grinding. Once the sample had completely dried, both the roots and leaves were separately grinded into powder using a mechanical blender and placed in containers for later use.
