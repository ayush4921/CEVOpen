<p id="p0105">HRBC test was performed in two steps. The first step involved preparation of erythrocyte suspension. The suspension was prepared by collecting fresh human blood (10 mL) from a healthy volunteer who had not taken any NSAIDS for 2 weeks prior to the experiment. The blood was collected in heparinized centrifuge tubes and was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. After centrifugation the sample was washed with equal volume of normal saline solution 2 times and centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 rpm until a clear supernatant was obtained. The supernatant was discarded and the volume of blood was measured and made to 10% (v/v) with normal saline solution. The second step of this test involved heat induced hemolysis where reaction mixture of 2 mL was prepared comprising of 1 mL of BvRM and BvLM extracts concentration ranging from (20–200 μg/mL) and 1 mL of 10% RBC suspension. Saline solution was used instead of the extracts in the case of control. Aspirin was used as a positive control. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 56 °C then centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm. The absorbance of supernatant was measured at 560 nm. The test was performed in triplicates. Percentage of hemolysis of human red blood cell membrane was calculated:
