<p id="p0195">In neurological disorders treatment, strong inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) are of great importance. This enzyme is involved in catalyzing the acetylcholine (ACh), therefore having potential for treatment of dementia (

 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Kandiah et al., 2017</xref>). Decrease in ACh concentration via dysfunction of multiple biochemical pathways eventually leads to NDs (
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Callahan et al., 2017</xref>). AChE causes the termination of signal transmission in synapses via ACh. Therefore inhibition of this metabolizing enzyme may provide effective therapy for many other neurological disorders (
 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, currently available drugs are significantly associated with severe side effects including hepatotoxicity and are potent to use only in mild condition of disorder (
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">McEneny-King et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, prime importance of current study is to explore novel remedies for NDs treatment. Various research groups including current study are scrutinizing indigenous flora for finding potential bioactive compounds for treatment of neurological disorders. Present study illustrated the very significant AChE inhibitory activity by 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> extracts. Results demonstrated that percentage inhibition values of BvLM and BvRM are not significantly different from in comparison to donepezil (standard drug) at the same concentration. BvLM and BvRM extracts exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.99 μg/mL and 3.731 μg/mL in comparison to donepezil (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 3.691 μg/mL) against AChE. Results have shown the significant therapeutic potency of extracts for cholinesterase. Previously 
 <italic>Carpolobia lutea</italic> and many other plants were analyzed for their antioxidant activity and found therapeutically effective against AChE (
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Nwidu et al., 2017</xref>). Although beetroots show promising properties and activities, yet further studies regarding isolation will authenticate its therapeutic potential as neuroprotective agent. In future, our research group will continue study for the exploration of pharmacological activities of purified phytochemicals of 
 <italic>B. vulgaris</italic> using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> techniques.
