<p id="p0190">Inflammation is considered as a beneficial process under normal conditions. Inflammation being an immune response can also have deteriorating impact on its host, at times. The traditional treatment for inflammation involves the use of non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs commonly known as NSAIDS (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs). These drugs do pose severe side effects in the case of chronic doses (
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Varga et al., 2017</xref>). The BvRM and BvLM extracts were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory action potential by conducting protein denaturation and HRBCs stabilization assays. Both extracts, BvLM and BvRM had the ability to inhibit protein/albumin denaturation when compared with the standard anti-inflammatory drug aspirin. Results of anti-inflammatory assays illustrated that

They also have the ability to boost immunity because of their anti-inflammatory properties and their richness in Vitamin C (
