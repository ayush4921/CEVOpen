<p>Anti-diabetic potential of the organic fractions of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> (Ht-EAF, Ht-HF, Ht-MF) and its methanolic extract (HT-ME) was examined by a standard method of α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition assay. In brief, the reaction mixture consists of 50 µL of sample, 200 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), α-amylase as enzyme (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), starch as substrate, and DNS as a coloring agent. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 80 °C and its inhibition activity was spectrophotometrically read at 540 nm [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The method of Sathiyaseelan et al. (2020) was used to measure the inhibition activity of α-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, 25 µL of α-glucosidase was mixed with 50 µL of sample and incubated for 15 min. Then, 25 µL of the substrate solution (
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside) was added to the mixture. After the 15 min incubation period, 100 µL of saturated sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) solution was added to stop the reaction. All the steps in the protocol were carried out at room temperature and the inhibition activity was measured at 405 nm by spectroscopy. Acarbose was used as the positive control. The incubation activities were calculated using the following formula and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were measured using Graphpad Prism. 
 <disp-formula>Inhibitory activity = [(A
  <sub>c</sub> − A
  <sub>t</sub>)/A
  <sub>c</sub>] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where, A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the control and A
 <sub>t</sub> is the absorbance of test sample.
