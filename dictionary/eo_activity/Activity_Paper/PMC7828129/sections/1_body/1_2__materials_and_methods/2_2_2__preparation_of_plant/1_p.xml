<p>A modified experimental procedure proposed by Teke et al. (2011) was employed for the extraction and active fractionation of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, the tubers part of the plant sample was allowed to shade-dry and ground to a coarse powder. Approximately 200 g of this powder was dissolved in 1000 mL of methanol and kept for 48 h and the extract was filtered. To the remaining mass, 250 mL of fresh methanol was added, allowed to stand further for 24 h, and the extract was filtered. Then the extracts were pooled together, and the excess solvent was removed by a rotary vacuum evaporator at a reduced pressure to get a concentrated extract. This concentrated extract (13.97 g) was used for further studies. To this, a portion of 10 mg extract pre-dissolved in 20 mL of methanol and 10 mL distilled water were added and then partitioned with 50 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane using a rotatory vacuum evaporator. The upper organic layer (n-hexane) was collected, and this step was repeated for two times. The semi-liquid concentrated fractions were collected and marked as an active fraction of hexane. The lower aqueous layer (aqueous methanol) was concentrated and mixed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate to collect the active fraction of ethyl acetate as mentioned above. The remaining lower layer (aqueous methanol fractions) was collected, labelled with respective fractions, and preserved for further use.
