<p>The mouse fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3) was used to evaluate the biocompatible nature of Ht-EAF. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were cultured into 96-well plate and allowed for overnight incubation. Then the cells were washed with 100 µL of ice-cold PBS (Corning, NY, USA). Then, 10 µL of different concentration (2.5−50 µg/mL) of different fractions (hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol) of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> were dissolved in RPMI media (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and placed in culture plates. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber. Then, 10 µL of WST solution (CellomaxTM, Mediflab, Seoul, Korea) was added to each well and incubated for a further 4 h to assess the cytotoxicity. The biocompatible nature of the test material was recorded (OD at 450 nm) using a multi-functional microplate reader. Additionally, the apoptotic-inducing nature (AO/EtBr staining) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Rhodamine 123 staining) of the samples were screened by standard fluorescent staining method [
