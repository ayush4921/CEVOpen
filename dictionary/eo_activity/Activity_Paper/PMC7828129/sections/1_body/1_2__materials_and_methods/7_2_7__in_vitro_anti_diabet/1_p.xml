<p>To ascertain the anti-diabetic nature of the Ht-EAF, cell cytotoxicity and glucose uptake assay were studied with HepG2 cells. For cytotoxicity studies, HepG2 cells (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were grown in high glucose DMEM media supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution. Then, the culture flask was kept in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber and allowed to reach 80% confluence. Then, the cells were treated with varying concentrations of Ht-EAF to determine the cytotoxicity [

 <sup>5</sup>) were fixed in a DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution and incubated for 12 h. Then, 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> mol/L of human insulin (Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, Kent, UK) containing fresh DMEM medium was added to the flask and kept for 48 h to create insulin resistance (IR) cells [

Later the IR-HepG2 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and treated with varying concentrations of HT-EAF (5–50 µg/mL) and allowed to stand for 12 h. Non-resistance HepG2 cells were kept as the positive control in the experimental setup. After 12 h of incubation, the cells were collected, and the glucose content was measured by DNS assay. Besides, IR HepG2 cells were sub-cultured and used to assess the oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential, and nuclear damage by fluorescent staining method [
