<p>Even though people are taking much care on their health, the epidemiology of DM is gradually increasing day by day. There are several hypoglycemic drugs to treat DM, which include synthetic, semi-synthetic, and chemical formulations such us metformin, sulphonylureas, pramilintide, thiazolidiones, etc., [

However, these syntactic drugs cause severe side effects. A number of studies has documented the anti-diabetic mechanism of medicinal plants. There are several ancient traditional medicine systems, including Korean folk medicine, Chinese medicine, Japanese kampo medicine, Indian Ayurveda system, African complementary and alternative medicine, practiced for a long while to treat diabetes [

 <italic>Vinca rosea, Momordica charantia, Azadirachta indica, Trigonella foenum, Ocimum sanctum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> [

 <xref rid="B9-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Also, several research articles have described the isolation of functional molecules from natural resources to cure the DM. Using the search term of “functional food and DM” in PubMed dated on 28 December 2020 showed ~882 research articles. Intrigued by this, we intended to search and validate anti-diabetic compounds from functional food sources. 
 <italic>Helianthus tuberosus</italic> L., commonly known as Jerusalem artichoke, is a traditional medicinal plant belonging to the family of sunflower plant [
 <xref rid="B10-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Its therapeutic potential has been well documented in traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine for more than a century. In the mid-19th century, people used to consume it as an alternative to potato. In the past, 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> tuber was one of the important ingredients in Korean soup [
 <xref rid="B11-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is also one of the unique plants that contain all the essential amino acids, which are the necessary nutrients for humans. Also, the higher amount of polysaccharides, phenolic, and flavonoid compounds might be responsible for its medicinal property [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The leaves of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> show anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, anti-fungal, and analgesic activity. The tubers of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> have shown spermatogenic, diuretic, cholagogue, and aperient activities and have been used in the treatment of rheumatism and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Unauthorized folk medicine practitioners have reported that the plant material might have potential to ameliorate insulin sensitivity through decreasing the fasting glucose level in diabetic patients. Considering all these facts, the present study aims at the detailed scientific validation of antioxidant, wound-healing, and anti-diabetic effects of active organic fraction from 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>.
