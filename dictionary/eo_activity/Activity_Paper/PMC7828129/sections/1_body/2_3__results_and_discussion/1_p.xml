<p>In the past five decades, researchers all over the global have been working toward the complete eradication and management of DM, as the increasing incidence rate would increase the mortality rate [

Among several therapies involving synthetic drugs, insulin therapy has received a great attention as it stabilizes the blood glucose level. However, repeated, and prolonged dosage of this drug causes severe adverse effects including skin rash, stomach upset, dizziness, shivering, nausea, and kidney complication. In this regard, plant extracts and their active compounds have been considered an attractive source of anti-diabetic drug to stabilize the blood glucose level without any harmful effects. In the recent past, the isolation and validation of anti-diabetic drugs from natural resources have gained attention. Usually, the therapeutic index of bioactive compounds from the plant sources are obtained in the form of terpenoids, saponins, tannins, alkaloids, glycosides, carotenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolics [

 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Preliminary screening of phytochemicals and quantification of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were done with 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> extracts following a standard spectroscopic method. Besides, the GS-MS analysis documented that several phytocompounds are present in the extracts and active fraction of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>, which are responsible for its antioxidant and anti-diabetic activity. In addition, α-amylase and α-glycosidase assays were carried out to document the anti-diabetic index of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> extracts and active fraction. Further, in silico docking studies were performed to validate the molecular interaction with the identified phytochemicals.
