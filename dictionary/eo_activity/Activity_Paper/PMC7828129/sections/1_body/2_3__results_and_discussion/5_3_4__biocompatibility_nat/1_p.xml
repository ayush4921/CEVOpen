<p>Morphological changes of the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> were evaluated by light microscopic analysis, nuclear damage was assessed by PI staining, and the apoptotic inducing potential was assessed by AO/EtBr staining method. First, the biocompatible effects of different fraction of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> were studied in noncancerous cell line of NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblast cells). The cytotoxicity nature assay was performed by WST assay. The results of the cytotoxic activity of all the fractions showed &gt;76% cell viability (
