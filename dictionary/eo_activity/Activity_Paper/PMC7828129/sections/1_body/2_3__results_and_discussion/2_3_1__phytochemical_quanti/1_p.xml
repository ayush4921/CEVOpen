<p>The total phenolic content in the active fractions and the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> was determined by the standard Folin-Ciocalteu method and the results are collected in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00099-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Based on standard curve of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) [R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9326], the total phenolic content was found to be 69.55 ± 0.36 mg GAE/g for Ht-EAF, 43.07 ± 0.05 mg GAE/g for Ht-ME, 17.11 ± 1.05 mg GAE/g for Ht-HF, and 10.29 ± 0.82 mg GAE/g for Ht-MF. The Ht-EAF has highest amount of phenolic content than the other fractions. The total flavonoid content was calculated against the equivalent of quercetin [R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.952]. The total flavonoid content varied from 6.27 ± 1.09 to 21.03 ± 4.36 mg of quercetin equivalent (QE)/g dried weight. The Ht-EAF has the highest amount of flavonoid content than the other fractions. It was found to be 21.03 ± 0.97 mg QE/g for Ht-EAF, 19.85 ± 0.21 mg QE/g for Ht-ME, 11.48 ± 0.11 mg QE/g for Ht-HF, and 6.27 ± 1.09 mg QE/g for Ht-MF. Taken together, the findings of the phytochemical quantifications in 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> revealed that phenols and flavonoids are abundantly present in the fractions that are responsible for its therapeutic potentials [

 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, the total flavonoid content was significantly lower than the total phenolic content. These results are in accordance with an earlier study reported by Nizioł-Łukaszewska et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities were screened by chemical and cellular assays and the possible mechanisms are discussed below.
