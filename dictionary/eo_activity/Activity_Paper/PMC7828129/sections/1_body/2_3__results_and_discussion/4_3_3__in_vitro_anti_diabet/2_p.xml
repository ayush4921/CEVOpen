<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of Ht-EAF, Ht-HF, Ht-MF, Ht-ME, and acarbose against α-glycosidase were found to be 187.04 ± 0.42, 377.88 ± 1.63, &lt;1000 and 723.58 ± 0.15 μg/mL, respectively. Besides, the α-amylase inhibiting activity ranged from 1.7 to 90.79%. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of Ht-EAF, Ht-HF, Ht-MF, Ht-ME, and acarbose against α-glycosidase were found to be 102.53 ± 1.39, 294.39 ± 0.65, 456.92 ± 2.07, &lt;1000 and 64.62 ± 0.59 μg/mL, respectively (

 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> was found to inhibit irreversibly α-glycosidase and α-amylase. In line with previous findings, it is suggested that the phytochemicals present in the extracts or phytochemical-rich fractions slowdown the breakdown rate of polysaccharides, reduce the blood glucose level, and consequently suppress the post-prandial glucose level in blood [
