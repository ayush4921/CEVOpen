<p>HepG2 cells are an ideal cell culture model for the study of hepatic glucose uptake and insulin resistance pathway. Insulin resistance in liver cells is mainly caused by the impaired glycogen production, which is the main contribution to hyperglycemia [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. The addition of 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> mol/L of insulin incubation of HepG2 cells showed the decreased level of glucose uptake. Moreover, the treatment with Ht-EAF showed concentration-based glucose uptake in IR-HepG2 cells and it confirmed that the active fraction treatment has the ability to prevent the impairment of glucose uptake. As expected, the 50 µg/mL of Ht-EAF increased the glucose uptake nearly 75%. Our results also clearly confirm that 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> mol/L of insulin treatment significantly induce the nuclear damage and apoptosis changes in comparison with untreated cells. As projected, Ht-EAF fraction does not cause any adverse effects or apoptosis inducing effects to IR-HepG2. It was confirmed by DAPI, propidium iodide, rhodamine 123, and dual staining method (
