<p>Oxalate content was determined as described by Ohikhena et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Briefly, 1 g of sample was weighed into a conical flask containing 75 ml of 3 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The solution was properly mixed and filtered. 5 ml of the filtrate was heated to 90°C and then titrated against 0.05 M of KMnO
 <sub>4 </sub>until there was a color change which persisted for about 30 s. The oxalate content was calculated by taking 1 ml of 0.05 M of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> as equivalent to 2.2 mg oxalate.
