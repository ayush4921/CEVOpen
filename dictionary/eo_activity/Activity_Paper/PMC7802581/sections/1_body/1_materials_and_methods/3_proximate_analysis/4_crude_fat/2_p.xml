<p>The crude fat content was determined by the AOAC (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) method. Briefly, 5 g of the pulverized sample was extracted in 100 ml of diethyl ether for about 24 hr. The extract was filtered into a beaker of known weight (
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>). It was thereafter made up to 100 ml with diethyl ether and shaken for another 6 hr; the filtrate was collected into 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. The ether was concentrated to dryness in a steam bath and oven dried at 40–60°C, and then the beaker was weighed again (

 <sub>2</sub>). The crude fat content was estimated as:
