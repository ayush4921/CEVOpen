Vegetables are very important sources of these nutrients which contribute markedly to food security and healthy diets for humans especially for children, lactating and pregnant women

However, due to lack of knowledge about some of the medicinal food plants which are necessary to combat malnutrition and meet the required nutrient intake levels, such plants are underutilized. The study of plant foods with nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, nutritional, and functional properties is on the increase, and many plants with multi‐functional properties are now gaining recognition and usage (Otunola &amp; Afolayan,
