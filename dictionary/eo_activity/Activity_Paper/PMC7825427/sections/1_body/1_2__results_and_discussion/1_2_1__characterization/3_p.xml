<p>The crystallinity of the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles was determined by XRD analysis, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. The XRD spectrum of synthesized nanoparticles revealed nine different Bragg’s diffraction peaks, indexing to crystal planes of (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (214), (220), and (306) at 2ϴ = 24.5°, 33.6°, 36.2°, 41.5°, 50.2°, 54.9°, 63.4°, 76.8°, and 79.1°, respectively. The diffraction peaks of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles are well-matched with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) 38–1479 [

 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The peaks associated with impurities were not observed, indicating the purity of the nanoparticles. The peak’s intensity further displayed the high crystalline nature of the nanoparticles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c shows the SEM and TEM images of the synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. SEM and TEM images displayed that the synthesized nanoparticles have spherical morphology. The Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles size determined by TEM ranged from 35–60 nm. The average nanoparticle size determined using DLS was 27.76 nm and ranged from 17–42 nm (
