<p>The antioxidant activity of green synthesized Cr

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles was determined in the linoleic acid system and compared to plant leaf extract, chemically synthesized Cr

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The results demonstrate that maximum lipid peroxidation inhibition was observed with the standard, followed by plant extract and green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. Chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles displayed the lowest level of antioxidant activity in terms of lipid peroxidation inhibition. It is interesting to note that the plant extract presented a comparable antioxidant activity compared to the standard. The enhanced antioxidant activity of green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles might be attributed to the presence of phytomolecules of the plant leaf extract on the nanoparticle’s surface, as evident from the FTIR, EDX, and XPS results. Hence, these results suggest that green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles and plant extract can be used as powerful antioxidant agents in different applications. Moreover, our green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles appeared to be more active in terms of antioxidant activity than previously reported for Cr
