<p>MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay was used for determining the anticancer activity of chromium oxide nanoparticles against MCF-7 (breast cancer cells) [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-00502" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The MCF-7 carcinomatous cells were placed in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37 °C. To obtain the 5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cells/well, the MCF-7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates containing the 100 µL of DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C. The 50 µL of each sample (green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, plant extract, and pristine) at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 µg/mL was added separately in each well, and the plate was then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After the plate was centrifuged to remove the supernatant and then washed with phosphate buffer saline. The 15 microliters of MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well. The plate was placed in an incubator for incubation for 4 hours at 37 °C. To dissolve the crystals of formazan, a reduced product of MTT, 150 µL of DMSO were added in each well and stirred on a shaker for 10 min. The optical density (OD) of formazans products was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. The cell viability percentage was calculated using the following formula; with the help of the following equation;
