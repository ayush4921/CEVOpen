<p>To investigate whether the isolated compounds and fractions of interest possessed potential NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitory effects, their influence on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in LPS and ATP-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages was assessed. The levels of caspase-1 activities in the culture media were determined using the Caspase-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> 1 Inflammasome Assay (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f002">Figure 2</xref> below, it was observed as expected that LPS and ATP treatment significantly (*** 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) increased caspase-1 activities in the cell culture supernatant when compared with the untreated cells. However, when cells were pretreated with the isolated compounds and fractions of interest in graded concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 µg/mL, the caspase-1 activities were reduced by at least 34%. The tested compounds revealed their maximal inhibitory activities at 5 µg/mL, except for the ER2.4 fraction that showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the caspase-1 activation (
