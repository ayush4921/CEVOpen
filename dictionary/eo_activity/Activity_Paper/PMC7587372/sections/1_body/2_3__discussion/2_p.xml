<p>In our previous study, among the plant recipes evaluated, R19Sz was the most potent in inhibiting caspase-1 activity [

 <italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic>, one of the plant’s components of the recipe, has been cited by three different traditional healers during our investigation, indicating its possible importance in the treatment of asthma. In addition, few studies reported on the traditional use of the plant in the treatment of different ailments, some of which are of inflammatory background such as asthma, wounds, headache, etc. [

 <italic>H. noldeae</italic>, would have inhibitory properties on inflammasome or on IL-6 production, a well-known downstream target of IL-1β. A bioguided fractionation approach to address this question was employed. Many of the isolated compounds (

Therefore, plant crude extracts, fractions and purified compouds were first tested for eventual cytotoxicity allowing to select the range of working sample concentrations in such a way that their pharmacological effects could not be biased.
