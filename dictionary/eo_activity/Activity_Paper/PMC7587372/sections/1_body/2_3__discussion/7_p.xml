<p>In the present study, the effect of our plant samples on the production of IL-6 in RAW264.7, a murine cell line widely used for the in vitro production of IL-6, was also investigated. This cytokine is a known downstream target of IL-1β and is consistently increased in serum from patients with NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated conditions. In fact, IL-1β has been reported to be one of the most potent activators of IL-6 production, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that IL-6 could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of IL-1β-mediated inflammation [

Moreover, cytokine-targeting therapies are gaining an increasing popularity in the treatment of inflammatory diseases including asthma and other respiratory diseases. With the Covid-19 outbreak pandemic, it has been reported that dexamethasone and monoclonal antibody drugs targeting IL-6 (tocilizumab) reduced the mortality rate [
