  <p>Inhibition of IL-1β production by 
   <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents. (
   <bold>A</bold>) PMA-differentiated cells were pretreated with the indicated plant constituents at the concentration range shown for 1 h, and then primed by LPS (1 µg/mL) for 3 h. Concentrations of 20 µM YVAD and 20 µg/mL Dex were used as controls. Cells were then stimulated by ATP (5 mM) for additional 1 h. Supernatants were harvested and kept at −70 °C before analysis. For the ELISA analysis, samples were diluted 10 times in the assay diluent. The concentration of IL-1β in the culture supernatant was measured using a human IL-1β Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each experiment, the amount of IL-1β produced without any pretreatment was considered as 100% and the remaining treatments were calculated as (Treatment/LPS) × 100. The results are presented as the mean ± SD of a triplicate from a representative of three independent experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). A one-way ANOVA, followed by Benforroni’s multiple comparison test, was used to compare the sample groups. *** stands for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Immunoblotting of cell lysates by anti-ProIL-1β (Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) or anti-Pro caspase-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was done twice according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were then stripped, reprobed with anti-β-Actin antibodies and exposed again to detect the internal β-Actin standard.
