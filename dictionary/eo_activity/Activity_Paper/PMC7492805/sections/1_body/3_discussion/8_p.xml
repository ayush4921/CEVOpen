<p id="p0160">The results of this study have shown that both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts. The observed antimicrobial effects of 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts are ascribed to the phytochemical-induced antibacterial activity as the extracts contained bioactive compounds known to have antibacterial activity. The presence of several phytochemicals with antibacterial activity in the extracts may have contributed to the synergistic destruction of the bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Farasat et al., 2014</xref>). Although the organic solvent extracts showed efficacy, the aqueous extract was less effective mainly due to poor extraction of the key phytochemicals with antibacterial activity. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, Rogers, McLaughlin, Daniels, and Yadav (2013)</xref> reported that gram-negative bacteria had resistance to the antimicrobial activity of plant-derived extracts. Nonetheless, in the current reaserch, the 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts showed activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. A related study, but using extracts from 
 <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Falowo et al., 2016</xref>), also showed potency against gram-negative bacteria. It is noteworthy that like the 
 <italic>T. trifidum</italic> extracts, the 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extracts, also contained phytochemicals with antibacterial activity.
