The possible future threat of this antibiotic resistance has led to research into the use of natural alternatives that are considered to be safe. The antimicrobial capacity of plants is assumed to be the function of phytochemical compounds present in them. Which include alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids and phenolic compounds (
