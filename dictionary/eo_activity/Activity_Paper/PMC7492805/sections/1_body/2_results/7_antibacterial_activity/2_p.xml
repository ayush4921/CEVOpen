 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the aqueous extract exhibited the lowest antibacterial activity on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values greater than 5 mg/mL. The standard erythromycin exhibited the highest antibacterial activity with MIC values within the range of 0.001–0.008 mg/mL. The acetone extract was active against all the bacterial isolates except
