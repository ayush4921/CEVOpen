 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ohikhena et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, 0.5 mL of each extract and standard at varying concentrations (0.025–0.400 mg/mL) was combined with 2 mL of 10 mM sodium nitroprusside made in 0.5 mM phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). The resulting solution was then left standing in a water bath at 25 °C for 2.5 h. Thereafter, 0.5 mL of Griess mixture and 1 mL of naphthalene diamine dichloride [0.1% w/v]) were added. The Griess mixture consisted of 1 mL sulfanilic acid reagent that is 0.33 % made in 20 % glacial acetic acid. The mixture was left standing in a water bath at room temperature for another 30 min. The absorbance was then read at 540 nm. A solution containing water instead of the extract/standard was used as a control. The number of nitric oxide radicals inhibited by the extracts was extrapolated from the following equation:
 <disp-formula id="ufd3">(%) inhibition of NO = [(Absorbance of control – Absorbance of the sample)/(Absorbance of control)] × 100</disp-formula>
