 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">EUCAST (2003)</xref> were used in the antibacterial assay. The MHA was heated in an autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min, then left to cool to 50 °C in a water bath. One millilitre of the 2-fold serial dilutions was transferred to the liquefied agar (19 mL) and carefully whirled before pouring into sterile petri dishes and then left to harden. A 10 μl was taken from the bacterial inocula and then dotted on separate hardened agar to obtain the desired absolute inoculum of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/mL. The concentrations of extracts used in the antibacterial assays ranged from 0.3125 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL. The extracts were compared against the antibacterial standard, erythromycin (0.001–0.016 mg/mL). The petri dishes with bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the extracts were considered to be the lowest concentration without visible growth on the agar plates.
