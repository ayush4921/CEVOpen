<p id="p0080">The procedure of suspension of the colony by the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">EUCAST, 2003</xref>) was adopted in the preparation of the inoculum. All the test bacteria were cultured on nutrient agar slants, recovered in sterile Muller-Hinton broth (MHB) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The previous cultures were mixed 1:100 v/v with fresh sterile MHB and grown on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) overnight at 37 °C. Similar colonies from the culture were dispersed in 0.85 % sterile saline, diluted with saline, and balanced with 0.5 McFarland standards to obtain a suspension density equivalent to 1 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. The suspensions were then confirmed by spectrophotometric measurement at a wavelength of 600 nm. Finally, the cell suspensions were adjusted 1:100 by taking 0.1 mL of the bacterial suspension to 9.9 mL of sterile broth to give an estimated inoculum of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/mL. Inocula suspensions were used for inoculation in less than 15 min.
