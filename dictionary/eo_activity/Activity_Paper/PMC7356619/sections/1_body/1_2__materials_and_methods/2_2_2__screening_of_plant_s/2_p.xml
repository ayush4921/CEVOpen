<p>For the evaluation of the allelopathic activity, the concept of the “standard deviation variance” (SDV) was adopted [

 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For the statistical analysis, the mean and standard deviation were calculated and the criterion of the SDV was evaluated by Microsoft Excel 2010. The severity of inhibition on growth elongation was defined at 3 levels: from the least to the highest effect, respectively. Level one (*) = M—0.5 × SD, level two (**) = M—1 × SD, and level three (***) = M—1.5 × SD, where “M” and “SD” refer to average and standard deviation, respectively.
