<p>In this study, the leaf leachates of 50 Chinese medicinal plant species were obtained from the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography and the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine to evaluate their allelopathic potentials. Among the collected plant samples, 18 plant species are distributed in Yunnan Province, 17 plant species are distributed in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and 15 species are distributed in Guizhou Province, Inner Mongolia, and Tibetan Autonomous Region. All the plant samples were dried in a hot air circulation oven at 60ÂºC for approximately 4 h and were ground into powder. Finally, they were put into paper bags for further use. Seeds of 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> L., 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> L., 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Lotus corniculatus</italic> L. (Takii Seed Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were used as receptor plants in the test for plant growth inhibitory activities among the collected samples and the candidate species.
