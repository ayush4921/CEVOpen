<p>Furthermore, De Marco et al., demonstrated that propolis and poplar bud resins ethanolic extracts from Italy present significant antibacterial potential against

Benedec et al. have shown that black poplar bud ethanolic extract collected from Romania present strong antioxidant activity due to an increased amount of polyphenolic compounds. Moreover, using the disk-diffusion method, the research group has demonstrated that the ethanol extract of black poplar bud presents in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as
