<p>Bail et al. studied the interaction between pinostrobin and the estrogen receptor in the presence or absence of 17β-estradiol (E2) or DHEAS, in a stably transfected human breast cancer cell line (MVLN). They have found an antiaromatase activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10 μM) without decreasing DHEAS- or E2-stimulated cell proliferation and without binding to the estrogen receptor. Since aromatase is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, inhibition of the enzyme could reduce estrogen levels, and therefore the probability of hormone-related cancer [
