<p>Jaudan et al. investigated the apoptotic potential of pinostrobin in vitro on cervical cancer cells (HeLa) using various methods of analysis (TUNEL assay, AnnexinV-FITC, AO/EB staining and DCFH-DA staining). The phytocompound demonstrated dose dependent growth inhibition potential. It also reduced GSH at 100 μM and NO
 <sub>2-</sub> levels at 50 μM. Apoptosis was induced by Caspase dependent pathways, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent increased apoptotic events at 100 μM [
