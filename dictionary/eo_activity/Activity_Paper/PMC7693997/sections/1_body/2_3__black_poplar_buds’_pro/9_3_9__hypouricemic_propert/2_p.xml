<p>Havlik et al. investigated the effects of poplar bud extracts (Czech) in vitro and in vivo. They have evaluated the xanthine oxidase activity in vitro and the antihyperuricemic effects in vivo using an experimental animal model that includes rats. Allopurinol (10 mg/kg) was used as a reference drug. Results have showed that 100â€“500 mg/kg poplar bud extract significantly inhibited xanthine oxidase activity and also presented hypouricemic effects on the experimental animal model if administered over 3 consecutive days [
