<p>Some particularities that characterize the 
 <italic>Populus</italic> genera refer to the fact that it includes more than 40 species, being widespread especially in Europe and Asia. In Romania poplar species grow through wet meadows and depressions, but can be also found in the plains. Black poplar is a tall tree; its height can reach up to 30 m and its diameter up to 2 m. The roots are adherent, the rhytidome is thick, blackish. The buds, which are actually the part of the plant explored in phytotherapy, are large, 2 cm long and 5–8 mm thick, conical, elongated, the tip is sharp and slightly curved, yellow-brown. On the surface, they have viscous resins with a weak balsamic but aromatic smell. On the central axis of the buds there are 4–8 oval and sharp bracts; they are adherent due to the resins in the composition. Additionally, due to the resins, which actually cover the buds, they have a shiny appearance.

In ancient times the poplar trees were often planted around public meeting places, which is a historical explanation for the name of this plant. In Europe, poplar buds appeared for the first time in John Gerard’s book (1597), which described the use of the buds in a healing ointment, with beneficial effects against inflammations [
