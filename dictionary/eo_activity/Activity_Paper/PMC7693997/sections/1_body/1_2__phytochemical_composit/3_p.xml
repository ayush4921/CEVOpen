<p>Recently, another important study about the chemical composition of this vegetal product was described by RistivojeviÄ‡ et al. This research group identified more than 75 phenolic compounds in poplar bud ethanolic extracts (collected from Serbia). They have reported the presence of phenolic acids and their derivatives (caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid), flavan-3-ols (four diastereoisomers of catechin), flavonols, flavanonols, glycosides (apigenin-7-O-glucoside) and phenolic glycerides [

Following the NMR spectroscopy and MS analysis, Dudonne et al. have shown that aqueous black poplar bud extracts (Bulgaria) contain phenolic acids (caffeic, cinnamic, coumaric, ferulic and di-O-methyl caffeic acid), flavonoids (pinocembrin and pinobanksin) and also salicin [

The phytochemical screening of methanol, hexane, chloroform and water extracts of black poplar buds (Algeria) has shown that beside flavonoids, tannins and terpenoids the extracts are a rich source of polyphenols, terpenes and alkaloids. Additionally, it was mentioned the absence of anthocyanin, saponins and quinones [
