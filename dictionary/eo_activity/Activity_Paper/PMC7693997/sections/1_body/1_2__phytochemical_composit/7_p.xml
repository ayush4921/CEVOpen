Based on the mass spectra and comparison with Wiley library database, 1-(2, 6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-phenyl-(E)-2-propen-1-one was identified as the main compound. Moreover, volatile compounds (beta-eudesmol and alpha-eudesmol) were found to be similar to the results obtained for

 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01464" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Research conducted by Jerković and Mastelic identified, forty-eight compounds among poplar buds volatiles, using GC–MS. Sesquiterpene alcohols such as β-eudesmol and α-eudesmol were the principal compounds identified (26.3–28.7%). Other major sesquiterpenes were g-selinene (7.6–8.8%), d-cadinene (7.8–8.6%), a-elemene (3.3–5.2%) and g-cadinene (3.9–4.2%) [
