<p>Cordycepin and adenosine in CCM were determined according to Huang et al. (2009) with some modifications. In brief, the fruiting bodies were dried in hot-air oven (55°C, 48 h). The dried samples were ground using a homogenizer, and 1.0 g of powder was added into 10 ml of methanol : water (50/50, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and sonicated for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 9,900 g for 15 min 2 times. The obtained supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m filter membrane before injecting into the HPLC system (Shimadzu, Japan) with a column (Restek, Ultra IBD; 150mm × 4.6mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m particle size) set at 35°C. The mobile phase was a mixture of water and methanol (90 : 10; 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) with the flow rate at 1 ml/min and a UV-vis detector at 254 nm. Five standard solutions of cordycepin and adenosine (Sigma Chemical, MO, USA) (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) were prepared and injected into the HPLC to create standard calibration curves.
