<p>NOS activity in the penis was determined using the nitric oxide synthase assay kit (Cat. No 482702; Calbiochem®, Germany). The penile tissue was weighted and homogenized with ice-cold 1 M PBS (pH 7.4) by homogenizer (Ultra-turexT8, Germany). The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes and filtered through 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m membrane filter, and then the supernatant was obtained by centrifuging the sample at 100,000 g, 4°C for 15 min. The penile NOS activity was measured, following the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance at 540 nm was determined using a microplate reader (1401, LabSystem, Finland). Blank wells were used to normalize the yield.
