<p>Mating tests were conducted in a custom made clear glass chamber 50 × 35 × 35cm. Each male rat was allowed to habituate in the chamber for 5 min before introducing a sexually receptive female rat into the chamber. The following male sexual behaviour parameters were calculated after monitoring for 30 min: 
 <list list-type="roman-lower">
  <list-item>
   <p>Mount latency (ML). The time interval between the introduction of the female and the first mount by the male</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Intromission latency (IL). The time interval between the introduction of the female and the intromission by the male</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Ejaculatory latency (EL). The time interval between the first intromission and ejaculation</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Mount frequency (MF). The number of mounts from the time of introduction of the female until ejaculation</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Intromission frequency (IF). The number of intromissions from the time of introduction of the female until ejaculation</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Ejaculation frequency (EF). The number of ejaculations in a sexual cycle.</p>
