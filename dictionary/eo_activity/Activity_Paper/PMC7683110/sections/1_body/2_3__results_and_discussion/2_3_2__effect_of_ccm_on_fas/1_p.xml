<p>The antidiabetic activity of CM was demonstrated in type 2 diabetic animal models [

 <italic>β</italic>-cells, inducing an impairment of insulin secretion. Further development of polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss confirmed diabetes. The body weight change of diabetic rats was lower than those in normal rats (

In our results, treatment of CCM (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g/kg BW) did lower FBG but not significantly different. The greater baseline FBG levels in diabetic rats of our study may have contributed to the less decrease in FBG levels with CCM treatment.
