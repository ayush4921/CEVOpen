<p>DM is known to cause many systemic complications including male infertility [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As observed in this study, the male sperm counts and sperm motility significantly declined in diabetic rats as compared to the normal control rats. Treatment of CCM (0.1 and 0.5â€‰g/kg) significantly increased the number of sperm, as well as sperm motility in diabetic rats (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and long-term administration of cordycepin has been shown to counteract the decline of testicular function in middle-aged rats [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A significant improvement in sperm quality has also been reported in aged rats that received cordycepin extracted from CM [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, the number of sperm and its motility were relatively unchanged in diabetic rats treated with sildenafil citrate. This drug seemed to consistently demonstrate an unusual side effect on the histological structure of the testis of adult albino rats when given for a long time [
