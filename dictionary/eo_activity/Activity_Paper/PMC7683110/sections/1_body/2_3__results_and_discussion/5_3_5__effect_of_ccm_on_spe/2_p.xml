<p>Testosterone level is an important indicator of male reproductive health. As might be expected, serum testosterone levels were markedly lower in diabetic rats than in normal control rats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Administration of CCM (0.1 and 0.5 g/kg) and sildenafil significantly increased serum testosterone in diabetic rats. Testosterone level in the DM+CCM 1 g/kg showed a marked increase, but the difference from the DM control did not reach statistical significance. In agreement with this, an increase in testosterone production was observed in the SD rats that received fruiting bodies of CM cultured on bee drone and brown rice medium for 4 weeks [
