<p>Alternative approaches, such as herbal medicine, have been adopted for sexual improvement for centuries. To date, many plants have been reported to possess aphrodisiac potential, and their effects on sexual behaviour have been validated [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Asian countries, herbal supplements derived from Cordyceps species have been traditionally used as prosexual agent, one of which is 
 <italic>Cordyceps militaris</italic> (CM), a valuable medicinal mushroom in the family Clavicipitaceae [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nowadays, instead of harvesting from natural resources, CM has been cultivated using the artificial culture medium and similar bioactive contents and medicinal potential as wild Cordyceps has been reported [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to the growing demand, a number of culture techniques and the media formula to support growth of CM have been developed, and many bioactive ingredients have been isolated, such as adenosine, cordycepin, D-mannitol, polysaccharides, nucleosides, amino acid, essential oils, ergosterol peroxides, and xanthophylls [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several scientific evidences related to the mechanisms and efficacy of this fungus, such as anticancer, antihypertensive, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and hypoglycemic effects, have been reported [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its positive effects in sexual function and testicular function have also been elucidated in young male rats [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], middle-aged rats [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and aged male rats [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, research on its bioactivity as prosexual agent in DIED is still scarce. The objective of the present study was to ascertain if CCM had aphrodisiac activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
