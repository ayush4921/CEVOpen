<p>One of the reproductive complications of DM in men is erectile dysfunction. In this study, diabetes had a negative effect on sexual function, penile erection, sexual organ weight, and sperm parameters with a parallel decrease in the level of testosterone of male rats. The diabetic rats that received CCM showed a significant improvement in mating behaviour, erection function, and testicular function as observed by increasing ejaculation frequency, ICP/MAP ratio, and testosterone level, respectively. These improvements may be due at least in part to bioactive compounds that could improve testosterone production and its antioxidant properties. Additionally, cordycepin itself acts as adenosine analogue mediating the vasodilation to improve erectile function. Based on our findings, cultured
