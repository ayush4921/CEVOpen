<p>A portion of Fraction 1 (12.6 g) was further purified using silica gel column chromatography (CC). The compounds were eluted with various mixtures of dichloromethane and methanol, by increasing the polarity step-wise, to yield four fractions (1a–d): 1a (2.6 g), 1b (0.10 g) and 1c (0.42 g) were eluted with dichloromethane:methanol (9:1), while 1d (5.8 g) was obtained with dichloromethane:methanol (7:3). Fraction 1a was further purified on silica gel by stepwise elution with hexane:ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate:methanol to obtain four fractions (1a1–4). Each fraction was analysed using UPLC-MS to identify the fractions containing peaks of interest (major peaks evident on the chemical profile). Fraction 1a2 contained a prominent compound (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469). It was further purified by silica gel CC using gradient elution with mixtures of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol to yield six fractions (1a2a-f). Of these, 1a2d (0.6 g) was further purified using preparative-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (prep-HPLC-MS), to obtain compound (
 <bold>1</bold>) (342 mg, 0.04%).
