<p>One- and bi-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker Ultra ShieldTM Plus 400 MHz (Biospin) spectrometer (Bruker, Bellericea, MA, USA). Recorded spectra were processed using Bruker Topspin 3.2 on the AVIII 400 software. Compounds (10 mg) were dissolved in 0.7 mL of deuterated methanol (Methanol-d4) and transferred to NMR tubes before analysis.</p>
