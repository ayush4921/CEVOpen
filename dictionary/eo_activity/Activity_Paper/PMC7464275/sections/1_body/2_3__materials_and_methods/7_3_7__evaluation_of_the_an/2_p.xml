<p>Crude extracts (dichloromethane:methanol 1:1) prepared from the 10 populations were used against two pathogens (
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>) to determine the possible effect of geographical variation on the antibacterial activity and to correlate the phytochemistry to the activity of the 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark. Stock solutions of the crude extracts were prepared at a concentration of 32 mg/mL, while the pure compounds were prepared at 5.0 mg/mL for the antibacterial assays. The samples were dissolved in either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or acetone (both AR grade; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) depending on the solubility of the samples or compounds in the solvents where final concentration did not exceed 5% in the first well of the microtitre plate.
