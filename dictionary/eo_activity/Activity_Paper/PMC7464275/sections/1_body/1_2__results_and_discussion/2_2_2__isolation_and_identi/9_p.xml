<p>Finally, arjunetin (9) (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 695) was obtained as a white solid, identified on the basis of MS peaks and NMR spectral data (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03683">Figure S9A,B</xref>) that corresponded to literature data [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The fragmentation ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 487 (
