<p>All the compounds, with the exception of sericic acid, sericoside and resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside, were isolated for the first time from the root bark of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic>. Sericic acid was identified as a marker for branch (X), while sericoside was identified as the marker for branch (Z) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03683-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Although the marker for branch (Y) was not isolated in this study, the molecular ion (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 682) and retention time (4.66 min) is characteristic of a triterpenoid glycoside. The concentration of resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside was high in samples found in branches (X) and (Z), but low in samples in branch (Y).
