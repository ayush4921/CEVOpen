<p>The metabolomics study revealed that sericic acid, sericoside and resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside are major constituents of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark, contrary to previous reports that limit the major constituents to sericoside. The root bark extracts displayed the best antibacterial activity towards 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, a pathogen associated with food poisoning. Quercetin-3-(2′′-galloylrhamnoside) (
 <bold>7</bold>) displayed noteworthy activity against the pathogen with an MIC of 0.05 mg/mL. This aspect of the study, which validates the traditional use of the plant, should be further investigated. Flavogallonic acid dilactone and its methyl derivative, methyl-flavogallonate, were identified as the most active antibacterial compounds towards the range of pathogens tested. The variation in the activity of the extracts against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> was associated with the concentration of sericic acid and resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside, two major yet inactive compounds. Despite a biochemometric study, no definite compounds could be pinpointed as being responsible for the antibacterial activity towards 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, highlighting the complex interactions between the secondary compounds present. This study has revealed that a crude extract of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark with good antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> is characterised by a high concentration of flavogallonic acid dilactone and its derivative, and a low concentration of sericic acid and resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-rutinoside. We therefore conclude that the major constituents of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark contribute to the chemical and antibacterial variation among different samples. They are of significance in the quality control of raw materials and products that exploit the antibacterial activity of this plant.
