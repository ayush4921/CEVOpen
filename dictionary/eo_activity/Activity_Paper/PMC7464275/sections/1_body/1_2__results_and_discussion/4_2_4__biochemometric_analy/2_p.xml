<p>Consideration of the MICs for the crude extract (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-03683-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) indicates variations in activities. The crude extract displayed a higher activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (MIC value 0.29 mg/mL) than the individual extracts from different populations (MICs 1.0 mg/mL). Conversely, the samples from the individual populations displayed higher activities towards 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> (MICs 0.25â€“1.0 mg/mL) compared to the crude extract (MIC 1.5 mg/mL). The crude extract was a composite of samples from different populations, which may have resulted in a different balance of the major constituents. This result highlights the fact that the relative proportions of the secondary metabolites have a significant impact on the activity.
