<p>The biochemometric analysis was carried out to establish the link between the chemotypic variation and the antibacterial activity. Samples were classified into two groups according to their antibacterial activities. Samples with MICs &lt; 1 were grouped as active and samples with MICs values ≥ 1 were grouped as non-active. An orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was constructed to evaluate the relationship between chemistry and bioactivity. The five-component model obtained for the two preassigned groups (active and non-active) indicated a 54% variation (R
 <sup>2</sup>), R
 <sup>2</sup>Y of 99.28% with prediction ability (Q
 <sup>2</sup>) of 98.6% (

The active samples (Red) were distributed on the negative T score 1 and the non-active samples (Green) were clustered along positive T score 1 (
