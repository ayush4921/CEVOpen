<p>One of the main challenges encountered in drug development from natural sources is the loss of activity observed in isolated compounds compared to that of the crude extracts. The search for a single highly bioactive compound does not adequately consider the interaction of the intricate and concatenated network of secondary metabolites present in medicinal plants [

Antimicrobial activity is a good example in this context, since plants are composed of complex phytochemical pools of compound combinations designed to fight infections, and often molecules isolated from plant sources have exhibited lower antimicrobial activities compared to the whole extracts [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the study of plant extracts remains inherently complex and is often exacerbated by rampant variation due to genetic traits and/or environmental factors that influence the production of secondary metabolites by plants. It is therefore important to have knowledge of the phytochemical variation within a species, and to understand how the variation is linked to the differences in the bioactivity of extracts prepared from individual samples [
