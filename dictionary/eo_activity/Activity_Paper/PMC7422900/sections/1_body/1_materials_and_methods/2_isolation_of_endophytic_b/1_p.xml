<p>Samples were washed with distilled water and surface sterilised using the following procedure: 0.1% (w/v) HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution for 1 min, sterile water for 1 min, 90% (v/v) ethanol for 2 min and finally washed again with sterile water. Leaf samples were then cut into segments of approximately 0.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> using a sterile scalpel and placed onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) plates and incubated at ambient temperature in the dark. To ensure bacterial growth was only obtained from plant endophytes, one additional LB agar plate for each plant was also incubated with uncut surface sterilised leaves as a control (Martinez-Klimova, Rodríguez-Peña and Sánchez 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). No growth from plant epiphytic bacteria was observed. During incubation, inoculated plates were frequently observed for bacterial growth at the cut-ends of the leaf tissue and emerging bacteria were transferred onto fresh LB agar. Bacterial endophytes were streaked, and individual colonies were selected and sub-cultured three times to obtain pure bacterial cultures on LB agar. Each bacterial isolate was transferred separately to LB agar slopes and stored at 4°C for further study. The cultures were maintained at the University of Mysore for characterisation and elucidation of bioactive compounds, while phylogenetic analysis and genome sequencing of endophytes was performed at Cardiff University. All bacterial cultures isolated in this study are available from the laboratory collection held at the Department of Studies in Microbiology, University of Mysore, India by request from the corresponding author.
