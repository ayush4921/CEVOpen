<p>Genome-sequenced medicinal plant endophytes (ME) were tested for antimicrobial activity against a small panel of human and plant pathogens (
 <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic> LMG 2464; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> NCTC 12981; 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> SC5314) using an agar overlay inhibition assay as described (Mullins 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In brief, ME isolates were grown overnight at 30°C on agar-solidified basal salts medium supplemented with glycerol (BSMG). After 24 h growth, a 10 µL-sized loopful of bacteria was resuspended in 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer, spotted (3 µL volume) onto BSMG plates and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. ME isolates were killed by chloroform exposure for 2 mins, overlaid with pathogen-seeded half-strength iso-sensitest agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and incubated at 30°C or 37°C for 24 h.
