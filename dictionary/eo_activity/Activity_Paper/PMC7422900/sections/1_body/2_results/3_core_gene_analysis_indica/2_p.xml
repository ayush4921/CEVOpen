<p>Notably, core-gene analysis revealed 
 <italic>Aureimonas</italic> sp. isolate ME7 as a novel endophyte, as shown by its unique phylogenetic placement (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). All sequenced genomes obtained for the genus 
 <italic>Aureimonas</italic> were extremely diverse, displaying deep phylogenetic branching and ANI values far below the established 95% threshold for species delineation (≥85% identity). The nearest neighbours for this isolate were all known endophytes and included 
 <italic>Aureimonas sp</italic>. AU22 and Leaf324 from soybean and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, respectively.
