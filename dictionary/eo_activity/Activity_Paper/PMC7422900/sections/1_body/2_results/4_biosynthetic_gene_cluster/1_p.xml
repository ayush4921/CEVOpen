<p>Following the prediction and curation of BGCs of the 26 sequenced endophyte genomes, a total of 102 distinct BGCs were identified across the 11 bacterial genera. These BGCs represented 15 known metabolite classes including siderophores, lassopeptides and non-ribosomal peptides (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Approximately 15% of BGCs could not be assigned a class and were collated under the antiSMASH category ‘Other’. The most prevalent classes were non-ribosomal peptides synthetases (NRPS), terpenes and bacteriocins representing approximately 45% of curated BGCs. The genus 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> with nine ME isolates contributed the majority of predicted BGCs to the endophyte biosynthetic potential, representing one-third of the 102 gene clusters (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
