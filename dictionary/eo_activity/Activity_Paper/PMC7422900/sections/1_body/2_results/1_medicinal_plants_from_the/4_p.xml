<p>The grass species 
 <italic>Coix lacryma-jobi</italic> was observed to contain the highest culturable diversity (ten isolates) of MEs (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with six different bacterial genera present (
 <italic>Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus and Paenibacillus</italic>). Contrastingly, the shrub 
 <italic>Desmodium pulchellum</italic> had the lowest culturable diversity with only one bacterial isolate belonging to 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> (ME86). Both plants were sampled from the Mangaluru location. For comparison, 
 <italic>Aristolochia tagala</italic>, a climbing species found in forests of Asia had the highest culturable diversity (eight isolates) of MEs (
 <italic>Enterobacter, Klebsiella</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>) identified from leaf samples taken from the Bisle Ghat (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref>; Table
