<p>Overall, from the three locations sampled (Bisle Ghat, Mysore and Mangaluru) pure culturable endophytes were isolated from 20 plant species covering 16 plant genera (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Only three plant genera (four plant species: 
 <italic>Nothapodytes nimmoniana, Garcinia gummi-gutta, Kingiodendron pinnatum and Dysoxylum binectariferum</italic>) were unsuccessful in ME pure culture isolation. Interestingly, diversity indices and rarefaction analysis calculated at the bacterial genus level (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Figure S2, Supporting Information) suggested that the endophyte population collected from Bisle Ghat (34 isolates) was more diverse and species rich than the populations collected at Mangaluru (38 isolates) or Mysore (three isolates). In addition, rarefaction curves (Figure S2, Supporting Information) and Good's coverage statistics (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) suggest that the total culturable bacterial diversity has not yet been isolated from the medicinal plants investigated in this study and further analysis is necessary to identify the full range of bacterial endophytes present.
