<p>This study identified multiple bacterial endophytes across a diverse array of medicinal plants from one of the World's ‘Hottest Hotspots’ of biodiversity, the Western Ghats (Myers

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The draft genome assemblies obtained from these endophytes have permitted an insight into the biosynthetic diversity of these bacteria, whilst the isolation of pure cultures enables the future exploitation of the identified biosynthetic potential. To our knowledge, this represents one of the largest collections of isolates with draft genomes available from endophytic bacteria in a single study of medicinal plants. Identifying and understanding the medicinal plant endophytic microbial diversity therefore has potential for the discovery of new natural products.
