<p>Using a cultivation-based approach we have successfully isolated and identified 75 fast-growing cultivable bacteria that were associated with leaves of different plant species. Previously, endophytes have been reported from various other traditional medicinal plants; for example,

However, to our knowledge, this study is unique in exploring a diverse range of bacterial isolates from a large collection (covering 24 plant species) of medicinal plants from the Western Ghats region of India. The identified bacterial endophytes belonged to four major taxa, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, with isolates from the following genera: 
 <italic>Bacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aureimonas, Curtobacterium, Brevibacillus, Pantoea, Methylobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Paenibacillus</italic>. Previously, culture-based bacterial endophyte diversity analysis has shown that most culturable endophytes are Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (Rosenblueth and Martínez-Romero

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The same limited group of bacterial phyla were also found to predominate in the phyllosphere of different plants identified by a range of culture-independent approaches including metagenomic shotgun sequencing of total genomic DNA (Vorholt 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, concerted efforts have been made to study Actinobacteria since they are a major source of natural antibiotics and metabolites (Passari

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Ek-Ramos 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), while other bacterial phyla are a natural resource that are still relatively untapped.
