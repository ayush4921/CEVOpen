 <italic>Bacillus</italic> species have been found to be one of the most abundant metabolite-producing Gram-positive bacterial endophytes (Frank, Saldierna-Guzmán and Shay 
 <xref rid="bib3_819_1596717385168" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and in this study 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> were responsible for a third of all distinct BGCs identified (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> species produce a wide variety of antimicrobial metabolites, including ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides (e.g. bacteriocins, lantipeptides and lassopeptides), as well as non-ribosomally synthesised peptides and polyketides (Zhao and Kuipers 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> ME isolates (ME39 and ME40), with good bioactivity against 
 <italic>P. carotovorum</italic> found in this study were shown by genome mining to contain several complete BGCs that may contribute to antimicrobial activity. 
 <italic>Bacillus aryabhattai</italic> ME39 was shown to carry both lantipeptide and bacteriocin BGCs, while 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. ME40 carried a lassopeptide BGC with sequence similarity and gene synteny to the paeninodin BGC. While the paeninodin lassopeptide lacked antimicrobial activity against representatives of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (Zhu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), antagonism against 
 <italic>P. carotovorum</italic> was not investigated. However, several endophytic bacterial peptides with antimicrobial activity have been reported (Zhao and Kuipers 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
