<p id="Par56">Ethnoscience and indigenous knowledge need to be consolidated with modern biotechnological techniques and approaches to achieve the desired end products with scientific validation and to make the most use of the vast amount of natural resources around us. This study suggests that various medicinal plants can serve as an alternative to the mainstream drugs to which bacteria are gradually becoming resistant. From the results, 
 <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> has not only shown significant antibacterial effect against several diarrhea-causing pathogens, but we also found some medically important constituents after conducting the phytochemical tests; thus, further research is recommended to purify these phytochemicals to understand the full potentials of this medicinal plant.
