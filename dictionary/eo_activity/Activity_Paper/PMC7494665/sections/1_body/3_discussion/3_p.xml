 <italic>Dendrobium longicornu</italic> exhibits the DPPH free radical scavenging capacity as it has many antioxidant-rich secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We have already evaluated the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial capacity of its wild counterparts [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its secondary metabolites scavenged DPPH radicals that would be measured at 517 nm. The present study highlights the antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> developed protocorms of 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic>. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> plant tissue cultures could be new sources of antioxidants because bioactive secondary metabolites could be biosynthesized in the plant materials [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Many research highlights the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> developed plant materials of 
 <italic>Dendrobium</italic> and other plant species, which support the present research [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Free radicals and reactive oxygen species generated in the human body induce the carcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Antioxidant-rich compounds present in the plant products scavenge such types of radicals that prevent cancer development [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such compounds arrest the cell cycle and induced apoptotic bodies to prevent cancer. Similar types of the mechanism of action of antioxidant-rich compounds identified in protocorms were seen on the HeLa and U251 cell lines in this research. This could be explored that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> developed protocorms have potential source of anticancer compounds synthesis. For example, presence of Tetracosanoic acid, 9-Hexadecyn-1-ol, 3-Heptadecanol, Pentafluoropropionate-
 <italic>trans</italic>-2-dodecen-1-ol, 6,10-Dimethyl-4-undecanol, α-Cadinol in the protocorms may have shown the antioxidant and anticancer effects [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> bacterial strains was inhibited by the extract. All these are Gram-negative bacteria whose outer membrane is thick that prevent the entering of antibiotic drugs so that they are highly resistivity to the antibiotic drugs [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The extract of protocorms can readily enter the bacterial cell and kill them because it has some compounds of strong antibiotic capacity and efficient permeability. Similar types of research has been carried out from the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> developed plant materials of orchid which supports our result [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, in comparison to commercially available gentamicin the extract has less susceptible to bacterial strains, but it has capacity of antibiotic.
