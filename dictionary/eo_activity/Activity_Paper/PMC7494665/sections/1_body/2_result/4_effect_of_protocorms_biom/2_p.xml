<p id="par0085">Anticancer effect of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic> protocorms was evaluated against HeLa and U251 cell lines by MTT colourimetric assay. The percentage of cancer cells growth inhibition by the action of extract was increased in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The extract has shown less percentage of HeLa cells growth inhibition (4.68–25.39 %). Similarly, it also showed less percentage of U251 cells growth inhibition (4.11–27.80 %). The concentration of extract required for the 50 % inhibition of cell growth (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained as 350.06 μg/mL (for HeLa cells) and 507.22 μg/mL (for U251 cells). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of extract on both cell lines was significantly different from that of the positive control, cisplatin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 25.00 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The result has shown the moderate anticancer effect of protocorms extract toward the cancer cell lines. The formazan crystals of the living cells were formed after the addition of MTT dye (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a and c). They were dissolved by DMSO before reading the absorbance. The extract killed cells were became spherical or rounded shape not the formazan crystals (
