<p id="par0075">The effect of endophytic elicitors supplemented MS-medium was tested for the proliferation and accumulation of protocorms biomass from the seeds culture of 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic>. The treatment of similar concentration of different endophytic elicitor supplemented in the full strength of MS-medium exhibits remarkable effects on the accumulation of protocorms biomass during the seed culture. The proliferation and accumulation of protocorms biomass were found varied on elicitor supplemented medium (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Seeds began swelling within 3 weeks after the inoculation (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a), and emergence and elongation of first leaf/shoot commenced within 3 months of culture 
 <italic>via</italic> the pathways of protocorms development on the tested medium (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b). MS-medium (control) and MS-medium supplemented with elicitor of endophytes such as 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> induced the significant growth of protocorms biomass from the seeds. The fresh biomass of protocorms was significantly found higher on this medium from 170.39 to 183.90â€¯g than the MS-medium supplemented with elicitor of 
 <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>.
