<p id="par0055">Anticancer effect of the extract toward human cervical cancer (HeLa) and brain tumour (U251) cell lines was determined using MTT colourimetric assay [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From the cell suspension, 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells in 100 μl of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) were dispensed into the well of a 96-well cell culture plate and incubated under the cell culture conditions at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h to allow for adherence and growth of cells. The medium was replaced by 100 μl of four cytotoxic concentrations (100, 200, 400 and 800 μg/mL) of extract and re-incubated for 24 h. Then, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to every well and re-incubated for next 4 h. The formazan crystals of living cells were dissolved by the addition of 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The plate was read in a microplate reader (iMarkTM, Bio-Rad) at 595 nm. Commercially available cisplatin was used as the positive control for which above-mentioned procedure was followed.
