 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>,

They were spread over the Muller Hinton Agar (MHA) nutrient medium plate using a sterilized cotton wool swab and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The antimicrobial effect was carried out using the well-diffusion method [

Three wells were filled by 100 μl of stock solution of plant extract (1 mg/mL in 4% DMSO), one well was filled by DMSO as a negative control, and gentamicin was used as a positive control. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the clear zone of inhibition (diameter) around the point of application of each sample solution was measured in millimetre (mm).
