<p>The air-dried plant powder (100 g) was macerated into methanol (1:10

 <italic>v</italic>) for 24 h. After that, ultrasound-assisted extraction (KQ-500DE, Kunshan Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd., Kunshan, China) was performed on the macerate for 30 min, followed by filtration using Whatman filter paper grade 1. The same procedure was repeated twice with the remaining residue. The overall filtrate was concentrated in a rotary evaporator at reducing pressure and temperature (&lt;45 °C) to afford 7.68 g of crude methanolic (MeOH) extract. Partitioning was prosecuted following the protocol previously described by Parsaee et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, the resulting MeOH extract was first suspended in distilled water. Then, the aqueous solution obtained was partitioned by successive depletion among solvents of increasing polarity including n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and finally water. Dried extracts were obtained after evaporation of residual solvents to yield residues of 1.8 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.5 g, and 1.6 g, respectively. MeOH extract and fractions were kept at 4 °C until further use.
