<p>Except for the n-butanol fraction (PH-n-BuOH), other fractions showed potential strong activities (MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/mL) against 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic>. The antibacterial activity of plant extracts is considered very interesting (highly active) if MIC &lt; 0.1 mg/mL, active or moderately active if 0.1 ≤ MIC ≤ 1 mg/mL, and low if MIC &gt; 1 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, no highly active extract was obtained from the present study. However, since recorded MICs varying from 0.125 to 1 mg/mL, these suggested moderate activity against studied drug-resistant bacteria. The best activities were obtained with PH-MeOH and PH-n-hexane against 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic>, and the two Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, the antibacterial activity of PH-MeOH and subsequent partition fractions from the fruits of 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> (Euphorbiaceae) is being reported in this study for the first time. However, the antibacterial properties of many plants of the family Euphorbiaceae have previously been reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Few studies have documented the antimicrobial properties of plants from the genus 
 <italic>Plukenetia</italic>. The present investigation, therefore, provides valuable information for the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic>. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> solvent fractions was probably due to the presence of naturally occurring bioactive components. The nature of the solvent of extraction, the amount of various chemical components in the extract, as well as the possible interactions between them, are some factors that can influence the activity. The differences in sensitivity recorded for the same extract with different bacteria strains could be explained by intrinsic differences in the chemical composition of the bacterial cell wall and/or in the genetically resistant elements, which may/not be transferable between strains such as plasmids or transposons [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the differences recorded for the same bacterium and different fractions can be due to the qualitative and quantitative differences of antimicrobial active principles or by differences in the mechanisms of action of bioactive constituents [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Indeed, the active ingredients targeting the bacterial cell wall must find complementary receptors for their interaction that are appropriate for their action, while those acting inside the cell must be both able to cross the membrane and find target elements in the cell [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among the five bacteria tested, Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>) were found to most resist the effects of the test samples. These results were consistent with the common observations that Gram-negative bacteria are usually more resistant to botanicals than their counterpart Gram-positive ones. The resistance of Gram-negative bacteria towards antibacterial substances was owed to the presence of an outer membrane that takes part in the natural resistance by acting as an effective permeability barrier [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Common biological effects, comprising antibacterial activities, of 
 <italic>P. huayllabambana</italic> were related to derived oils, commonly known as sacha inchi oils. For instance, sacha inchi oil-related products have been reported to exhibit anti-adherent activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], anti-aging effects [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The fact that PH-n-Hex was found to be the most effective fraction could probably be linked to its oil extraction capacity. Accordingly, in addition to its notable antibacterial effects, we have selected the lipophilic fraction (PH-n-Hex) to evaluate the possible mechanisms of action, as well as the identification of potentially bioactive components via GC–MS analysis.
