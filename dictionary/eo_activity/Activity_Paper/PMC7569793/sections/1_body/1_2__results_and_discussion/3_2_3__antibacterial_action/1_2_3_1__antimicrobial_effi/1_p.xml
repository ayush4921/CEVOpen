<p>Due to their chemical and structural diversity, plant-derived components act on different targets in bacteria cell structure including membrane, cell wall, and/or on molecular targets (ions or protons, proteins, DNA/RNA) by several mechanisms of action [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01111-f003">Figure 3</xref>), PH-n-Hex decreased bacterial counts over 24 h when compared to the starting inoculum. With increasing sample concentrations, a concentration-dependent trend towards greater bacterial killing was observed. The overall effect was bacteriostatic: PH-n-Hex inhibited the growth and reproduction of bacteria but did not kill them. This may point out the effect on bacterial metabolism. Like any bacteriostatic agent, a clinical application would require a collaboration of the bioactive agents with the host immune system to oust pathogenic bacteria from the body. However, high concentrations (&gt;4MIC) could induce bactericidal effects.
