 <caption>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Cartoon representation of the homology model structure of TMPRSS2 which has been energy-minimized using UCSF Chimera. The figure zooms into the region containing the catalytic triad Ser441 (S441), His296 (H296) and Asp345 (D345), and the substrate binding residue Asp435 (D435) in the S1 subsite of the enzyme. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Alignment of protein sequences for TMPRSS2 and hepsin (PDB 1Z8G) which was used as a template to model the structure of TMPRSS2. (
   <bold>c</bold>) General Ramachandran plot of the energy-minimized model structure of TMPRSS2, which displays the torsional angles, phi (φ) and psi (ψ), of the amino acid residues in the protein.
