<p>To date the 3D structure of TMPRSS2 has not been experimentally determined, and thus, we have used SWISS-MODEL [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] webserver (
 <uri xlink:href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive</uri>) to perform homology modeling of TMPRSS2. We submitted the TMPRSS2 protein sequence (NCBI reference sequence NP_005647.3) to SWISS-MODEL and selected the crystal structure of human protein hepsin (PDB 1Z8G) [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] as the template to build the model structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Note that hepsin (PDB 1Z8G) is also a Type II transmembrane trypsin-like serine protease, and it shares 38% sequence similarity with TMPRSS2 (NP_005647.3) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Subsequently, UCSF Chimera [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used to minimize the energy of the TMPRSS2 model structure obtained from SWISS-MODEL. Thereafter, the energy-minimized TMPRSS2 model structure was assessed using the structure assessment tool within SWISS-MODEL. In the TMPRSS2 model, 94.19% of the amino acid residues were found to be in the Ramachandran favoured regions in the Ramachandran plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f002">Figure 2</xref>c) and the model structure has a MolProbity [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] score of 1.50.
