<p>π-π stacking. This interaction occurs between two aromatic rings and can be majorly classified into two types, namely, face-to-face and face-to-edge. In the case of face-to-face type of π-π interaction, the distance between the centroids of the two participating aromatic rings should be &lt;4.4 Å and the angle between their ring planes should be &lt;30°. In the case of face-to-edge type of π-π interaction, the distance between the centroids of the two participating aromatic rings should be &lt;5.5 Å and the angle formed by the ring planes should be in the range 60° to 120° (
