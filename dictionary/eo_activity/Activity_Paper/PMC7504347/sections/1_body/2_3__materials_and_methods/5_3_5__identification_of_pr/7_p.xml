<p>Hydrophobic interactions. The geometric criteria for the formation of hydrophobic interactions between atoms in protein and ligand are as follows [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The distance between a carbon atom in protein or ligand and a carbon, halogen or sulfur atom in ligand or protein, respectively, should be ≤4 Å. Furthermore, we ensure that the involved atoms in a hydrophobic interaction between protein and ligand do not form hydrogen, chalcogen or halogen bonds between them [
