<p>Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method was used to compute the binding energy of the interactions between the protein-ligand complexes for the top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. From the 180 ns trajectory obtained from the MD simulation, 80 snapshots were obtained between 100 ns to 180 ns of the simulation at an interval of 1 ns along the trajectory, and thereafter, the binding energy was computed using g_mmpbsa [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. g_mmpbsa computes the Gibbs free energy of binding (ΔG
 <sub>binding</sub>) using MM-PBSA method as described by the following equation:
 <disp-formula>ΔG
  <sub>binding</sub> = G
  <sub>complex</sub> − (G
  <sub>protein</sub> + G
  <sub>ligand</sub>)
 </disp-formula> where G
 <sub>complex,</sub> G
 <sub>protein</sub> and G
 <sub>ligand</sub> represent the total binding energy of the protein-ligand complex, the free protein and the unbounded ligand, respectively.
