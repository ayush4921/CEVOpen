<p>In the second stage, we prepared the target proteins for docking with prepared ligands. For TMPRSS2, the 3D structure is yet to be determined experimentally, and thus, we built a homology model of TMPRSS2 using SWISS-MODEL [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f002">Figure 2</xref> displays the TMPRSS2 model structure with the catalytic triad S441, H296 and D345 and the substrate binding residue D435 in the S1 subsite. For cathepsin L, the crystal structure (PDB 5MQY) with 1.13 Å resolution was used for docking after energy-minimization using UCSF Chimera (
