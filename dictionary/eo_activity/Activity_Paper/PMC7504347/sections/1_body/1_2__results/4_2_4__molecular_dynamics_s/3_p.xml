<p>Also, R
 <sub>g</sub> value of cathepsin L in complex with C1, C2 and C3 is stable throughout the MD simulation implying C1, C2 and C3 do not induce any major structural changes to cathepsin L and cathepsin L remains structurally stable in complex with these inhibitors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f009">Figure 9</xref>a). Cathepsin L in complex with C1, C2 and C3 has an average R
 <sub>g</sub> value of 1.700 ± 0.010 nm, 1.706 ± 0.007 nm and 1.705 ± 0.008 nm, respectively. Similarly, RMSD value of the Cα atoms of cathepsin L in complex with C1, C2 and C3 become largely stable after 80 ns (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f009">Figure 9</xref>c shows the RMSF value per residue for cathepsin L in complex with C1, C2 and C3. As in the case of TMPRSS2, R

In order to quantify the stability of the inhibitors C1, C2 and C3 bound to cathepsin L we have also computed the RMSD of C1, C2 and C3 (
