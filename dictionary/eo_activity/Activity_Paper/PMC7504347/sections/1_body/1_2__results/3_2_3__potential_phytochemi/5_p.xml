<p>Phytochemical C4, rugosanine B, has a binding energy of −8.2 kcal/mol. C4 is a cyclopeptide alkaloid produced by the bark of 
 <italic>Ziziphus rugosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Various parts of 
 <italic>Ziziphus rugosa</italic> have been reported for their antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f007">Figure 7</xref>d shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C4. The pyrrole ring present in C4 forms a N-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with residue D162. Moreover, C4 forms C-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with A138, D162 and L69. Also, the residue W189 forms a face-to-edge type of π-π stacking interaction with C4. Further, C4 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues G23, C25, G67, M70, A135, A138, D162, H163, G164, W189 and A214.
