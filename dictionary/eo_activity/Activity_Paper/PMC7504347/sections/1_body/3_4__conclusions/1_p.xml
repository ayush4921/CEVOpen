<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to humankind. As of 27 July 2020, COVID-19 has led to more than 650,000 deaths worldwide. Due to the absence of approved therapeutics or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, several countries have been forced to implement partial or complete lockdown measures to restrict infection spread; however, such measures have in turn resulted in an economic catastrophe. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop antivirals and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to protect humankind. In this direction, protein-ligand docking and MD simulation are powerful computational methods to expedite the search for anti-COVID drugs by rapid identification of promising lead molecules. Here, we have used molecular docking and MD simulations in the search of natural compound inhibitors of two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, that are key host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection [
