<p>Plant-based natural products have made immense contributions to drug discovery [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Specifically, ~40% of the small-molecule drugs approved to date by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are either natural products or natural product derivatives. Recently, there are reports from China of successful use of traditional Chinese medicine and associated herbs in treatment of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. On similar lines, there have been suggestions to tap the rich legacy of traditional Indian medicine and information on phytochemicals of Indian herbs in the search for anti-COVID drugs [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previously, some of us have built IMPPAT, the largest resource to date on phytochemicals of Indian herbs [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this work, we perform molecular docking using a large library of 14,011 phytochemicals compiled mainly from IMPPAT to identify potential natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Subsequently, we have also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the stability of protein-ligand complexes for the top phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L identified in this work.
