<p>The SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises ~30,000 bases with 14 open reading frames (ORFs) coding for 27 proteins [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other 
 <italic>betacoronaviruses</italic> with the 5′-region coding for non-structural proteins and the 3′-region coding for structural proteins. Important structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 coded by the 3′-region include the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, the matrix (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The 5′-region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains the replicase gene which codes for two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are proteolytically cleaved by two important non-structural proteins, 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>), to produce functional (non-structural) proteins. Other important non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for the viral life cycle include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. Accordingly, the 4 non-structural proteins, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, RdRp and helicase, along with the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 are among the most attractive targets for anti-COVID drugs [
