<p>Due to an increased resistance and adverse side effects exhibited by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, plant-derived bioactive compounds are considered as a potential source of anticancer agents with less side effects and cost effectiveness. Not only in cancer treatment, phytochemicals of plant origin are used by most countries in the treatment of various medical conditions. Bioactive phytochemicals are known to have anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidants, and antiplasmodial properties. Therefore, more efforts are being made by researchers to explore different plant extracts and identify the potent active principle compounds. Present research outcomes create a baseline for the validation and standardization of plant-derived drugs.
