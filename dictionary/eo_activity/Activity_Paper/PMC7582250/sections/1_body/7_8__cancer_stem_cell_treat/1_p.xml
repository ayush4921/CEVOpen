<p>Stem cells are unspecialized body cells that have the ability to replicate and make well-differentiated specialized cells. These cells are isolated from inner mass of a cell, which is 5â€“8 days old. The use of stem cells in a clinical setup is restricted due to ethical, legal, and religious controversies [

 <italic>D. anomala</italic> regulates the cancer stem cell activities is not clear, but various studies show effective regulation of cancer stem cell signaling pathways. However, many plant-derived anticancer compounds target the surface targeting antibodies of cancer stem cell (CSC), such as those found on breast cancer stem cells (anti-CD133, CD44, and anti-EpCAM). These anticancer compounds may also target the ABC cassette, immune-evasion antibodies, and cytokines [
