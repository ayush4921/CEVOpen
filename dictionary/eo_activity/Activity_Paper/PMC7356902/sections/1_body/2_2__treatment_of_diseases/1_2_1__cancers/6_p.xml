<p>There are more than 1300 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurane diterpenoids that have been identified, most of which belong to the genus 
 <italic>Isodon</italic>, and many possess anticancer potential. Sarwar et al. provide a review of the plant sources, biological targets and mechanistic pathways of 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurane diterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They indicate that the anticancer activities of such compounds are chiefly contributed by the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle arrest, and metastasis. The key regulators in each process were discussed in detail; for example, the most common metastatic target proteins are matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor.
