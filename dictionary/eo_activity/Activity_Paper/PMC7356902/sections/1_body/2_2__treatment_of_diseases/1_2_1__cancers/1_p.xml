<p>Due to the high morbidity and mortality of oral cancer, there is a demand to develop drugs for inhibiting local invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. It has been reported that Withaferin A (WFA), a steroidal lactone isolated from 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, could inhibit the migration of cancer cells at high cytotoxic concentrations. Interestingly, Yu et al. further prove that WFA in a relatively low concentration of 0.5 ÂµM inhibited oxidative stress-mediated migration as well as invasion in oral cancer Ca9-22 cells, and they suggest that it has the potential to inhibit metastasis in oral cancer therapy [

 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the basis of their results, they propose that luteolin-7-O-glucoside inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.
