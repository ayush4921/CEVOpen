<p>Liver failure frequently leads to hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which has a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Baek et al. studied the effect of 
 <italic>Rheum undulatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> extract mixture (RG) on HE based on their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Firstly, they identified seven bioactive ingredients in RG that had been predicted to be effective in treating neurological diseases. Then, they used a CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced HE mouse model to unravel the therapeutic mechanisms of RG. Based on their results, RG consistently relieved HE symptoms by preserving bloodâ€“brain barrier permeability, and thus offers considerable potential for treating chronic liver disease as well as HE.
