<p>Oxidative stress is one of the main processes in human disorders. Wang et al. contributed a review on bioactive compounds for treating oxidative stress-related human disorders involving the toxic reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), an advanced lipid peroxidation end product [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A number of related disorders are listed, such as cardiovascular injury, eye damage, liver injury, neurotoxicity, neurological disorder and energy metabolism disorder in order to discuss their prevention and treatment by bioactive compounds from particular medicinal plants, and finally, possible strategies for future research and applications combating deleterious effects induced by 4-HNE are proposed.
