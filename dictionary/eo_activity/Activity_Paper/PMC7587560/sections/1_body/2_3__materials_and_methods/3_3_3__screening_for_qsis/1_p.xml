 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 was activated in 5 mL fresh LB medium and cultured at 28 °C for 24 h. This suspension was added to fresh LB medium containing 0.85% agar, and kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/mL. Next, 50 μL C6-HSLs (40 nmol/L), used as exogenous signal molecules, was coated on the surface of the solidified medium. The agar plates without C
 <sub>6</sub>-HSLs were used as negative controls. The testing sample (20 µL) was pipetted onto sterile paper discs (6 mm). These disks were placed on the solidified agar plates and 20 µL sterile methanol was used as a negative control. The reporter plates were incubated at 28 °C for 1–2 days.
