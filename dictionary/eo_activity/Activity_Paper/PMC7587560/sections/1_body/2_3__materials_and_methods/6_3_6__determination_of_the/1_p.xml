<p>MIC is defined as the lowest concentration which showed inhibition of visible growth of the tested bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The MIC of CFEE was determined against the tested bacterial strains using the broth macrodilution method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, USA (2006). Bacterial strains were inoculated into 20 mL LB medium supplemented with diluted extracts at final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/mL, and were incubated at their optimum culture temperature for 24 h. The absorbance of the media before and after incubation was measured at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. Sub-MIC concentrations were selected for anti-biofilm and anti-QS activity analyses.
