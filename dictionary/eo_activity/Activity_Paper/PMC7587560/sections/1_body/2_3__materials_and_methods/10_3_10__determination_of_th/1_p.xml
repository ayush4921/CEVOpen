<p>Overnight cultures of tested bacterial strains incubated in LB medium were diluted to a final density of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL with fresh media, and 1 mL was dispensed into each well of a 24-well microtiter plate together with a piece of coverslip with 0.2 mm thick and 13 mm diameter (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Plates were statically incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Coverslips with a mature biofilm of tested strains were then placed in LB medium supplemented with 200 or 400 µg/mL CFEE and statically incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A group of bacteria without CFEE was used as a negative control. Coverslips were then gently washed with sterile distilled water, stained with safranine, and observed and photographed using a microscopic imaging system.
