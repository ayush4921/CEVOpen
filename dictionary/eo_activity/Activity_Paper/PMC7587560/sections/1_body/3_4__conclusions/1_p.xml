<p>At present, many kinds of natural compounds have been studied to use as new sources of QSIs. Chinese herbs have attracted much attention because of their safety and affordability. A screen of 18 different Chinese herbs for QSI active substances found that, the alcohol extract of 
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> flower had strong QSI activity. CFEE could inhibit the yields of violacein produced by 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited biofilm production by 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, and the rate of inhibition positively correlated with CFEE concentration. CFEE could also inhibit biofilm formation of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 at concentrations greater than 200 μg/mL. But it is interesting that CFEE significantly increased the biofilm production of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), in a concentration-dependent manner (25 to 100 μg/mL). Although the amount of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilm increased in the presence of CFEE, the structure of the biofilm changed and became loose. These results show that CFEE can interfere with the normal biofilms formation of the test strains, and can also destroy the mature biofilms of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, indicating that CFEE was a potential QSI that could be considered for medicinal development as a novel antimicrobial agent.
