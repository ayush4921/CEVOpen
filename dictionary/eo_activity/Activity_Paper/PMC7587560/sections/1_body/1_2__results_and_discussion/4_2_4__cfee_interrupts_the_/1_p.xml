<p>To validate the QSI activity of CFEE, the swarming ability of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 under different CFEE concentrations was examined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Swarming circles of the tested bacterial strains were assessed on soft agar plates containing 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL CFEE, respectively; diameters of the swarming circles are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04727-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The diameter of planktonic circle produced by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 was 9.02 cm in diameter and covered the entire surface of the plates in the absence of CFEE. However, with increasing CFEE concentrations, the diameter of this planktonic circle decreased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The inhibition rate was up to 90.80% with 200 μg/mL CFEE. In the absence of CFEE, the diameter of planktonic circle formed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was 4.61 cm in diameter, and this diameter also decreased with increasing CFEE concentrations. The inhibition rate of swarming circle diameters in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was up to 88.94% with 200 μg/mL CFEE. Therefore, CFEE can interfere with the swarming abilities of both 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 without affecting their growth, but the two strains show different degrees of QS interference by CFEE. This result is the same as we previously reported for polyphenols of 
 <italic>Rosa rugosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and is also consistent with the report by Liu et al. on naringin extract [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is likely that the chemical compositions of extracts from different plants are not identical and may contain different types of polyphenols. Thus, the QSI activities of different extracts may vary, even to the same bacterial strain/species.
