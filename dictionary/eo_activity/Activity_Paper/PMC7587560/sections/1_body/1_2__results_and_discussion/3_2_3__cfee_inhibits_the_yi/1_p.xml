<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CFEE was 1000 μg/mL. All experiments relating to the determination of QSI activities were performed at concentrations below the MIC. To verify the QSI activity of CFEE, violacein production of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 at different CFEE concentrations was determined. The violacein production and biomass were represented as the absorbance of OD595 and OD600, respectively. The yields of violacein did not change significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1) at CFEE concentrations below 200 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Increasing CFEE concentrations from 100 to 400 μg/mL, significantly increased the inhibition of violacein production from 5.43% to 67.0% (0.01 &lt; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, the biomass of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 was not significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5) inhibited by the concentrations of CFEE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the observed decrease in violacein production is not due to CFEE inhibiting growth of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026, but is likely due to CFEE interfering with violacein synthesis, which is regulated by QS.
