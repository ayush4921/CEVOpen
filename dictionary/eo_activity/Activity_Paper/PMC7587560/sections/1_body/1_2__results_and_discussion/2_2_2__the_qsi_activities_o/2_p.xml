<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, a ring without purple pigment, approximately 4.27 cm in diameter appeared around the filter paper loaded with CFEE, but there was no transparent ring around the filter paper (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). This indicated that the purple suppressor ring was caused by anti-QS phenomenon rather than bacteriostatic action. Therefore, it was concluded that CFEE was a potential QSI and may contain some compounds with QSI activities. Organic extracts from plants were reported to show very promising antibacterial properties correlated with their phenolic compound content [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, due to the developing bacterial resistance, researches on some antibacterial compounds have turned to their anti-QS activities, which can block the bacterial resistance. Medicinal plants contain numerous bio-active molecules, including terpenoids, polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, polyamines, cytokinins, and polysaccharides, and these can be useful to counterbalance bacterial resistance by targeting QS signaling pathways [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, the QSI activities of CFEE were further explored, and the small molecule compound composition of CFEE was analyzed.
