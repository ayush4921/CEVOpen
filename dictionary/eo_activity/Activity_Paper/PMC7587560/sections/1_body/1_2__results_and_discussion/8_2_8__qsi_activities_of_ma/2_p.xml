<p>UPLC-MS/MS results in this study revealed that organic acids are one of the principal components of CFEE. None of these organic acids have been reported to have QSI activity, except malic acid which has been reported to have inhibitory effect on AI-2 QS system of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results demonstrate for the first time that malic acid and succinic acid have inhibitory effects on the AI-1 QS system of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026. Therefore, malic acid and succinic acid may play major roles in the QSI activities of CFEE and could have potential value as antibacterial compounds.
