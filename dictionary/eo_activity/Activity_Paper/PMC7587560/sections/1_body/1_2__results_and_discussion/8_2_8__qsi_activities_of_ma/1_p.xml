<p>Malic acid and succinic acid are two very cheap and readily available organic acids. Therefore, the MIC and anti-QS activities of these two compounds were directly tested. The MIC of succinic acid and malic acid in 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 were 1200 and 800 μg/mL, respectively. Anti-QS activities of the two compounds were tested at concentrations lower than 800 μg/mL (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, 3) were 1.89 ± 0.16 cm, 3.06 ± 0.11 cm, 4.67 ± 0.23 cm, respectively. This suggested that the QSI activities of malic acid and succinic acid were stronger than that of CFEE, with succinic acid displaying the strongest QSI activity. These findings indicate that CFEE-mediated inhibition of violacein production is due to the polyphenol, malic acid, and succinic acid contents of CFEE.
