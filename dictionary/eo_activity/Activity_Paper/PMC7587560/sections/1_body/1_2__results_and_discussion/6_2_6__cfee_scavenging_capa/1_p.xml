<p>CFEE had a scavenging effect on mature biofilms formed by

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Untreated by CFEE, mature biofilms had a higher bacterial density and were thicker than those treated with CFEE. When the mature biofilms were treated with 200 μg/mL CFEE, the biofilms become thin and loose. Treatment with 400 μg/mL CFEE almost completely destroyed all mature biofilms formed by both 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. This was consistent with early measurements of biofilm productions in this text.
