<p>While most of the phenolic acid compounds in CFEE have previously been reported to be AI-1 type QSIs [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], QSI activities of organic acids have rarely been reported. Organic acids are one of the principal components of CFEE and are important raw materials used in the food, medicine, and chemical industries. Therefore, organic acids were selected for further analysis and identification of potential new QSIs.
