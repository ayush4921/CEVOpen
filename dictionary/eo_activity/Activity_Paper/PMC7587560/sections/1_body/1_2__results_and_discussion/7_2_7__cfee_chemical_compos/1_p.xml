<p>The chemical composition of CFEE was determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-heated electrospray ionization (HESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The total ion current of CFEE is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04727-f006">Figure 6</xref>, and each peak was assigned a number. In the negative mode, 23 peaks were detected. The acquired raw data were analyzed using Compound Discover 3.2 with the metabolite databasemz, and revealed 21 compounds corresponding to 21 chromatographic peaks, respectively. Furthermore, the molecular weights of chromatographic peaks 2 and 10 could be accurately displayed, but the comparison results of the fragment ion information in the database could not infer the compounds.
