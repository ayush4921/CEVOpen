<p>Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the large arteries [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since atherosclerosis was regarded as a chronic inflammatory state, the effect of HO-1 modulation in the disease has been studied extensively. Case reports on deficiency of 
 <italic>HMOX1</italic>, a human gene encoding HO-1 enzyme, showed vascular injury and early atherosclerotic changes along with inflammation and nephropathy, suggesting the importance of HO-1 in vascular health [

 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The protective role of HO-1 induction against atherosclerosis was further supported by various animal studies. HO-1 overexpression by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer successfully inhibited atherogenesis in a hypercholesterolemic animal model [
