<p>Withaferin A (
 <bold>85</bold>) is one of bioactive steroidal phytochemicals, withnolides, which is responsible for the bioactivities of 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, also known as “Ashwagandha”, “Indian ginseng” or “winter cherry”, a frequently used medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine (Indian traditional medicine) [
 <xref rid="B262-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>]. Withaferin A (
 <bold>85</bold>) induces HO-1 expression in endothelial cells via upregulation and increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B262-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>]. Ginsenosides are unique steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins that are present exclusively in the genus 
 <italic>Panax</italic> [
 <xref rid="B263-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. More than 150 natural ginsenosides have been reported [
 <xref rid="B264-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>], and they share a common tetracyclic structure, but the number and position of sugar or hydroxyl moiety may vary among ginsenosides [
 <xref rid="B265-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. Ginsenoside Rb1 (
 <bold>86</bold>) was reported to have a protective effect against oxidative stress by increasing HO-1 expression through an estrogen receptor-related PI3K/Akt/Nrf2-dependent pathway in human dopaminergic cells [
 <xref rid="B266-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. Ginsenoside Rg18 (
 <bold>87</bold>) attenuated neuroinflammation in BV2 microglia and amyloid-β-induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y neurons via Nrf2/HO-1 induction [
 <xref rid="B267-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Another type of steroidal glycoside, furotrilliumoside (
 <bold>88</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>Trillium tschonoskii</italic> also upregulated HO-1 expression via Nrf2 that might act as a natural agent to treat inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B268-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>]. Structures of the the steroids (
