<p>Chemoprevention is defined as a pharmacological approach used to suppress or reverse the disease progression [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Antioxidants in fruits and vegetables, such as polyphenols, have been proposed as primary chemopreventive agents [
 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many of the natural compounds have shown the ability to induce HO-1 without cytotoxic effects. Although several reviews have dealt with natural HO-1 inducers [
 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], none of them categorized and visualized their chemical structures of the up-to-date list of HO-1 inducers. Given the importance of chemical structures of natural compounds on their antioxidant ability, it is necessary to provide the chemical structure-based classification of HO-1 inducers. Here, we provide a compilation of knowledge on natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds in foodstuff or medicinal herbs focusing on the diseases in which HO-1 induction could exert preventive or therapeutic effects by modulating various signaling pathways.
