<p>Since the discovery of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by Tenhunen et al. in 1968 [
 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], three HO isoenzymes (HO-1, HO-2 and HO-3) have been reported in mammals [
 <xref rid="B2-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Heme oxygenase (HO) mostly exists in two forms, HO-1, the inducible form, and HO-2, the constitutive form [
 <xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HO-3 is a pseudogene derived from the HO-2 transcript, and has any intron [
 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. HO-1 and HO-2 degrade heme in an identical stereospecific manner to biliverdin with the concurrent release of carbon monoxide (CO) and iron [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among those three proteins, only HO-1 was shown to be inducible by a variety of stimuli such as oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B6-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, the constitutive nature of HO-2 made it less attractive as a drug target compared to HO-1.
