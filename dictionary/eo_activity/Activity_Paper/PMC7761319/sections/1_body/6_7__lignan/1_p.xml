<p>Sesamin (
 <bold>96</bold>) and its stereoisomer episesamin (
 <bold>97</bold>) are bioactive lignans found in sesame oil [
 <xref rid="B277-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. They are readily metabolized by cytochrome P-450 to yield a series of metabolites, and the metabolites were screened for antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="B278-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. The most potent antioxidant metabolite, SC-1 (
 <bold>98</bold>) was capable of protecting against oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death in part through induction of HO-1 via Nrf2/ARE activation [
 <xref rid="B278-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. Honokiol (
 <bold>99</bold>), a phenolic lignan originally isolated from 
 <italic>Magnolia obovate</italic>, significantly inhibited cyclosporine A-induced and Ras-mediated survival of renal cancer cells through the downregulations of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B279-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. It implies honokiol (
 <bold>99</bold>) may help to prevent tumor-promoting effects of an immunosuppressant drug, cyclosporine A in transplant patients [
 <xref rid="B279-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. Another phenolic lignan isolated from 
 <italic>Magnolia officinalis,</italic> magnolol (
 <bold>100</bold>) inhibits 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages, which is mediated by HO-1 activation, and thereby it is plausible for treatment of periodontitis [
 <xref rid="B280-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. 
 <italic>Saururus chinensis</italic>, an oriental medicinal herb has been used to treat jaundice, pneumonia, edema, fever and several inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B281-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>]. Sauchinone (
 <bold>101</bold>), a diastereomeric lignan isolated from 
 <italic>Saururus chinensis</italic> protects vascular inflammation [
 <xref rid="B282-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>] and significantly inhibit NO production and inflammatory mediators expression [
 <xref rid="B283-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>] via HO-1 induction. Another lignan isolated from 
 <italic>Saururus chinensis</italic>, saucerneol D (
 <bold>102</bold>) suppresses LPS-induced activation of dendritic cells through the induction of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B284-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. Lariciresinol (
 <bold>103</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>Rubia philippinensis</italic>, has a dimeric structure of a phenylpropanoid with a core structure of tetrahydrofurano ring, and exerts potent antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B285-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. The antioxidant potential of lariciresinol (
 <bold>103</bold>) is due to the increased transcriptional and translational levels of antioxidant enzymes by activating Nrf2-mediated HO-1 induction via p38 signaling [
 <xref rid="B286-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. Structures of the lignan natural products (
 <bold>96</bold>â€“
 <bold>103</bold>) are presented in
