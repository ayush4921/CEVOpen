<p>p38, the other member of MAPK family, plays an important role in redox regulation [

 <xref rid="B61-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and autophagy [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] via regulating HO-1. An in vitro study using a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, revealed that the inhibition of p38 suppressed the induction of HO-1 by nitric oxide in a dose-dependent manner [

 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The induction of HO-1 by p38 is also correlated with Nrf2 activation. Khayandirobilide A, a natural small molecule with anti-inflammatory property, induces HO-1 expression by p38 MAPK/Nrf2 signaling in RAW264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells [
