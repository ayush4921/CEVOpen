<p>HO-1 gene (
 <italic>Hmox1</italic>) is located on chromosome 22q12, and is regulated by several transcription factors including Nrf2, NF-κB and AP-1 [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This feature makes HO-1 a converging node in antioxidant mechanism [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and serves as a critical signaling protein of ferroptosis regulating iron and ROS (reactive oxygen species) homeostasis [

 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Nrf2, for instance, is a family member of Cap ‘n’ Collar-basic leucine zipper transcription factor (CNC-bZIP) and is considered as the most pivotal regulator of HO-1 in the brain and nervous system [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Without oxidative stress, Nrf2 is located in the cytoplasm by its negative regulator Keap1 that induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Nrf2 [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Under oxidative stress conditions, Keap1 is dissociated from Nrf2 and thus Nrf2 moves into the nucleus, binds to the antioxidant response elements (AREs) sequence of the HO-1 promoter region and initiates the transcription of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B75-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Once expressed, HO-1 activates a cascade of antioxidant signaling that affects the oxidative status of the cells and protects cells from oxidative challenges [
 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Knockdown experiments confirmed that downregulation of Nrf2 significantly inhibited H-Ras-induced HO-1 transcription [
