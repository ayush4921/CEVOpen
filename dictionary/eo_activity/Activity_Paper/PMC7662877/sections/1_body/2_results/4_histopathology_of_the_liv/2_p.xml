<p id="p0105">Histopathological examination was performed on the kidneys and liver of the males and females to detect morphological damages on them. The histological sections performed are presented in Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for the liver in male and female rats respectively, while Figures 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> represent the histological sections of kidneys of the male and female rats respectively. Observation of these cuts did not reveal any abnormalities on the kidneys at doses 0 and 250 mg/kg body weight/day in both males and females, but at doses 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day in both sexes cell lysis was observed. Concomitantly, the observation of the liver reveals some slight alterations, namely leukocyte infiltration and cell lysis at all doses and in both sexes.
