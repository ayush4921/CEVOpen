<p id="p0115">The results of the serum and urinary biochemical parameters of rats treated with methanol extract from 
 <italic>P. capense</italic> fruits are presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The extract did not affect urinary urea levels in either sexes. Serum urea levels were not modified in female rats, while an increase in serum urea was observed in male rats in all test groups (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day). Total serum and urinary proteins were not modified in males, while in females, there was a significant increase at 1000 mg/kg body weight/day and a significant decrease at 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day respectively. Serum creatinine levels were not modified in either sexes, as it was the case of urinary creatinine levels in female rats; while the male rats showed a significant and progressive decrease of urinary creatinine at doses 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. The amount of ALAT was not modified by the extract in either sexes, while that of ASAT was not equally modified in males as opposed to females. We observed a significant decrease between the control dose and two test groups (the groups of animals which received 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight/day). The lipid profile of the rats obtained through the evaluation of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol showed a progressive and significant decrease in the quantity of triglyceride at different doses in both sexes; an increase in the amount of LDL cholesterol in female rats but with a decrease of the same parameters in male rats at all doses was equally observed. No changes were observed in the concentration of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol in either sexes.
