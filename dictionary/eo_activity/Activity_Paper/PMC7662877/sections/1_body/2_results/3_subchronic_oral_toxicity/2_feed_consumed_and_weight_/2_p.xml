<p id="p0095">The amount of feed consumed was recorded during the test period and it appears in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref> that there was no significant variation in the test group compared to the control group. However, the result shows the ability of the extract to induce an increase in weight in male rats at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight/day and a slight weight gain at dose 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. In female rats the extract induced a slight weight gain at 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight/day.
