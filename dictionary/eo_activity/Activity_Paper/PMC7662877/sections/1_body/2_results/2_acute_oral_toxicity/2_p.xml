<p id="p0090">During the acute toxicity study, there was no mortality recorded in animals after receiving a single dose of 5000 mg/kg body weight of 
 <italic>P. capense</italic> fruit methanol extract. Also, no signs of toxicity in general appearance (reduction of locomotion, stool appearance, drowsiness, salivation, reaction to noise), were observed in animals receiving this dose after 14 days of observation. Based on the OECD principle, it can be stated that the LD50 of the methanol extract from 
 <italic>P. capense</italic> fruits is greater than 5000 mg/kg body weight.
