<p id="p0150">The performance of an experiment in which rats are exposed to a toxic product results in damage, either by an increase or decrease in the relative weight of the organs of metabolism such as liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, and lung (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Busari et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, there was virtually no significant difference in the relative weight of liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, and lung organs between the test groups and those of the control group. So, based on the relative weight of the organs we can conclude that the methanol extract from
