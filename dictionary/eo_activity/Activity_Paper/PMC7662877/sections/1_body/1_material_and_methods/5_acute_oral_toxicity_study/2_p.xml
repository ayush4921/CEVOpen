<p id="p0040">The acute oral toxicity of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>Piper capense</italic> fruits was performed according to the protocol described by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2008, Guideline 425 Limiting Test (paragraph 26). The test was performed on five (5) 
 <italic>Wistar</italic> strain female rats. Once the group was formed, the animals were acclimatised for 07 days after which they received a single dose of 5000 mg/kg body weight of the methanol extract of the 
 <italic>Piper capense</italic> fruits by endogastric gavage. These animals were then observed with particular attention to their behaviour and any other signs that might indicate the toxic effect of the plant extract for 4 h after gavage. After 48 h, LD50 was determined from the data obtained and the animals were left for observation for an additional fourteen (14) days before being terminated for macroscopic observation of the different organs (
