<p>The analyses were performed using a JASCO modular HPLC system (Tokyo, Japan, model PU 2089) coupled to a diode array apparatus (MD 2010 Plus) and a FinniganMAT LCQ (ThermoQuest Corp./FinniganMAT; San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer module linked to an injection valve with a 20 µL sampler loop. The column used was a Kinetex-C18 (15 × 0.46 cm, i.d., 5 µm, 100 Å, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and at a temperature of 30 °C. The mobile phase consisted of binary solvent system of water/formic acid 99/1 (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B). The gradient system adopted was: starting point at 95:5
