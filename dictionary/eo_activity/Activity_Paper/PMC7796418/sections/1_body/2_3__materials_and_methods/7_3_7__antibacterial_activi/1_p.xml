 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>syringae</italic> ATCC 19310 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 were used to determine MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) through microdilution method using 96-well microtiter plates [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Bacterial cultures were incubated overnight at 26 °C and 37 °C, respectively, in Tryptic Soy Broth (OXOID Ltd., Hampshire, UK). One hundred μL of sterile medium were used together with 100 μL of sample to perform serial dilutions of extracts, EO, rosmarinic acid and eugenol, previously dissolved in ethanol (50 mg/mL of stock solution), into all micro-wells.
