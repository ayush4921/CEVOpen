<p>Previous research found in literature reported rosmarinic acid levels in 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. cultivars, varied from 0.06 mg/g to 12.7 mg/g on the dried matter, with caftaric acid levels ranging from 0.002 mg/g to 0.49 mg/g [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our results highlighted an interesting composition of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> that could be suggested as an alternative for 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, with reference to the content of rosmarinic acid.
