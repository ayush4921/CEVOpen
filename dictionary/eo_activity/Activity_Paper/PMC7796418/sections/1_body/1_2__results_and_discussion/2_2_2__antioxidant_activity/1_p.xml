<p>All extracts exhibited a noteworthy antioxidant capacity in both performed tests (DPPH and ABTS). In particular, EO showed the highest radical scavenging activity in both assays (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00084-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.7 ± 0.1 µg/mL against DPPH and 3.18 ± 0.29 µg/mL against ABTS, both close to the value obtained with the positive control (Trolox). This direct action of EO against the propagation of the prooxidative radical reaction could be due to the abundant presence of eugenol, although it should not be forgotten that the total antioxidant capacity of EO could also be the result of the complex interaction between the components in which synergistic or antagonistic actions intervene. In effect, the 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO, even though it consists of about 44% eugenol, is also characterized by a good amount of cyclohexadiene-like components (~12% β-elemene and δ-elemene) that could work synergistically to offer high protection against oxidative processes [

 <sub>50</sub> lower than EO and comparable to the positive control (

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, eugenol has been already studied for the treatment of irritant contact dermatitis [
