<p>The tests performed against the Gram-positive bacteria considered (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> ATCC 6538) did not show any noteworthy activities for the extracts and rosmarinic acid, while eugenol, already well known in the literature for its antibacterial capacity [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], exhibited a MIC value under the 2000 Î¼g/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00084-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Regarding the Gram-negative bacteria, instead, 
 <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>syringae</italic> is the most polyphagous bacterium in the 
 <italic>P. syringae</italic> complex that primarily affects woody and herbaceous host plants. The data obtained revealed noteworthy phytopatogenic activity of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO, and eugenol, against 
 <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>syringae</italic>, pointing out this extract as an interesting candidate for future deeper investigation for phytoiatric application. Eugenol is an active substance yet approved by European Parliament and Council in 2013 for the formulation of plant protection products [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the strength of our results, the EO of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> could also become a promising active substance for plant protection as potential succedaneum of clove oil, already included in European Regulation 540/2011 [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and with eugenol as main compound. These considerations may be of interest for both the development of a local economy and the international trade of this species. Moreover, previous literature was not reach of antimicrobial studies about 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> extracts, and the few founded highlighted the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO using different methods [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or adopting a method that is not clearly decipherable and reproducible [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, these data could enrich the panorama of the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> extracts.
