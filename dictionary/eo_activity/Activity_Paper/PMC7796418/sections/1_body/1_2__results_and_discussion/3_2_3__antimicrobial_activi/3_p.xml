<p>Starting from literature data regarding the effect of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., we investigated its potential alone and in combination with fluconazole against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> clinical strains [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Due to the increasing levels of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. resistance to antifungal agents, the research of other remedies, more effective and safer than the current ones, is of great interest [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The synergistic effect of eugenol in combination with fluconazole was already described in literature [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Taking this fact into account and considering the composition of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO, this crude extract could be a new potential remedy against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. resistance.
