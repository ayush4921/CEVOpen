<p>Ecuador is well known for its biodiversity and is considered among the 17 megadiverse countries, counting about 10% of all plant species in the world and having the third highest density of endemic ones: about 4000 out of a total of 20,000 [

The aromatic plants of Amazonian Ecuador represent an appropriate renewable source for the production of essential oils and flavors, and an interesting economic alternative to sustainable development, with the perspective of generating wealth for this region. Numerous studies have been conducted in the Amazonian area of Ecuador, particularly describing the chemodiversity of essential oils as well as other natural bioactive molecules that may find application in food, beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides [

However, about 50% of all the scientific publications on the botanical native species are related to only eight families (Arecaceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Orchidaceae, and Euphorbiaceae), while the remaining 246 are scarcely studied, with few or no publications on either phytochemistry or ethnopharmacology. As a result, many species are still little explored [

To complete this scenario, it should be noted that the overharvesting of crude drugs in the wild for the formulations of pharmaceutical and herbal products has often led to the depletion of valuable natural resources, and any program that attempts to promote their use must incorporate strategies for the sustainable sourcing of raw materials. The relationship between tropical biodiversity, conservation, and human health is complex and should not be oversimplified. The most effective way in which health and conservation can be combined to serve the needs of local and international communities is by incorporating this complexity into a package of complementary activities including the development of natural products [

Within this context, the cooperation among University of Ferrara (Italy), Amazonian State University (Ecuador), and other Ecuadorian Universities was born to perform, over the years from 1996 to now, various research activities on endemic species of the Amazon region, studying in particular essential oils of well-known genera of traditional medicine, such as
