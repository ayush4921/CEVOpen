<p id="par0240">Based on the high degree of homology of the genome (&gt; 96 %) and the receptors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, this review was attempted to summarize the plant species and their bioactive compounds with anti-viral potential against coronaviruses, which can be used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. The literature review suggested more than 70 compounds from 62 plant species with anti-viral activity against coronaviruses that might exhibit treatment potential for COVID-19 disease. Several of these anti-viral activities have been predicted from studies on molecular docking of bioactive compounds of different medicinal plants with proteases and spike protein of</p>
