<p id="par0115">The S protein is a glycosylated protein that is responsible for homotrimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle and mediates viral entry into host (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Bosch et al., 2003</xref>). S protein exists as two subunits (S1 and S2) on the viral particle due to cleavage of S protein by host furin‚Äêlike proteases during viral replication (
