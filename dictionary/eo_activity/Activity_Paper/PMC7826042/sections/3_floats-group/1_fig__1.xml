   <bold>Schematic diagram of SARS-CoV structure and its genomic organization.</bold> The top panel depicts the structure of SARS- coronavirus, wherein the spike protein, envelope, and nucleocapsid are shown. Bottom panel: The genome organization map, which consists of genes encoding the structural spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein in 5สน-3สน direction within the 3สน proximal 1/3
   <sup>rd</sup> of the genome. A variable number of different ORFs (ORF 1a and 2a) appearing to be virus- or group-specific, encoding nonstructural proteins, are also present on the proximal end. The figure was made with the help of Biorender.com.
