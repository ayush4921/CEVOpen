   <bold>MERS-CoV structure and genomic organization.</bold> The top panel shows the structure of MERS- coronavirus, wherein the spike protein, envelope, and nucleocapsid are shown. Bottom panel: The genome organization map of MERS-CoV, wherein the genes encoding the structural spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein in 5ʹ-3ʹ direction are shown within the 3ʹ proximal 1/3
   <sup>rd</sup> of the genome. The genome size of MERS-CoV strain was reported to be 30,114 nucleotide (nt) long, including the 3ʹ and 5ʹ UTRs. The MERS-CoV also contains 5ʹ-untranslated region (UTR), replicase complex ORF1ab, S gene, ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, E gene, M gene, N gene, ORF8b gene and 3ʹ UTR. The figure was made with the help of Biorender.com.
