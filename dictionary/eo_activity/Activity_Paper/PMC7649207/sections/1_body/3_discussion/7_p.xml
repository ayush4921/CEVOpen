<p>In this paper, rFIP-mco can significantly reduce the expression levels of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. On the effect of TNF-α, rFIP-mco exhibits reduction activity, which is similar to the effect of FIP-gmi on TNF-α, suggesting rFIP-mco can inhibit inflammatory response. Diverse bioactivities of FIPs from different origins may indicate that they have different immunomodulatory mechanisms while binding to the cytokines. ACA from

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), different responses to FIPs may be associated with small changes in protein structure and folding, to the formation of homo-, di-, tri-, and tetra-mers of rFIPs, or might be relevant to the post-translational modification, all of which can possibly affect receptor binding. As previously referred, different biological activities to cancer cells by FIPs may be related to the structural differences at the loop DE and loop FG. Significant conformation changes were observed between FIP-fve and LZ-8 at the two loop regions of the fibronectin type ΙΙΙ (FNΙΙΙ) domain which may be potential active sites, while the loops of FNΙΙΙ-containing proteins are also usually involved in the recognition of cytokine receptors (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). To elucidate the divergence, it is essential to determine the crystal structure of FIP-mco which is already underway now.
