<p>As reported in FIP-nha and LZ-9, it is concluded that each FIP has its own unique bioactivity profile (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In our study, it also demonstrated this point. They are diversified in biological activity and possess independent features, behind which the possible cause in structure differences is very interesting. For subsequent work, further study on rFIP-mco using animal models is underway. Further function mechanism of FIPs on cancer cells and cytokines is also an interesting aspect and deserves deep study on crystal structure. As a new member of the branch family of FIPs, the found and biological activity determination of FIP-mco from the precious rare edible mushroom 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH has enormous research and application value. It will promote the study of the protein divergence in the FIP family, the molecular mechanism of FIPs on cytokines and cancer cells. FIP-mco possesses wide application prospect as antitumor adjuvant in medical and pharmaceutical area, and also in health care and food industry.
