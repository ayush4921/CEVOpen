  <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
 </xref>) against 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH genome was performed, a putative FIP protein (scaffold3t326) was obtained. The putative FIP protein shared 50% identity with the reported immunomodulatory protein ACA (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and this candidate was designated as FIP-mco. According to the 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH genome information, the coding sequence (CDS) of FIP-mco was identified and optimized for 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> X33 codon usage preference, the putative CDS of FIP-mco was subsequently synthesized (Sangon, Shanghai, China) with restriction enzyme site 
 <italic>EoR</italic>I at the 5’ end and 
 <italic>Not</italic>I at the 3’ end. Synthesized FIP-mco CDS was digested and cloned into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites in pPICZαA expression vector (Invitrogen, California, USA), resulting in the recombinant plasmid pPICZαA-fipmco. The recombinant plasmid pPICZαA-fipmco was transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B, and the positive colonies were isolated and confirmed by sequencing with 5’/3’ AOX primers. The verified pPICZα-fipmco was linearized by SacI digestion. Transformation of the linearized DNA was performed according to the pPICZαA manual by Invitrogen. Transformed cells were spread onto YPD plates supplemented with 100 ìg/mL Zeocin, the positive colonies were isolated, and were confirmed for integration by PCR with 5’/3’ AOX primers. The correctly integrated isolates were used for protein expression and purification.
