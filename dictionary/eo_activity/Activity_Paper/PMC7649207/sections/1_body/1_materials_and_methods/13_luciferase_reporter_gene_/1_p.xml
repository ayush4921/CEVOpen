<p>The pRL-TK and NF-κB reporter plasmid pGL4.32, and dual luciferase reporter assay system were all purchased from Promega. THP-1 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and co-transfected with NF-κB reporter plasmid (80 ng/well) and pRL-TK (8 ng/well) as an internal control. After 12 h of incubation, the cells were serum deprived for 12 h and subjected to LPS stimulation with or without rFIP-mco. The cell lysates were prepared with passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured by Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and normalized by the transfection efficiency calculated by the Renilla luciferase activity from pRL-TK.</p>
