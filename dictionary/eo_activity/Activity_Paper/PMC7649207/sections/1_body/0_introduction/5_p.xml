<p>To our best knowledge, until now, ten FIPs have been extracted from fruit body or mycelium: LZ-8, FIP-fve, FIP-vvo, FIP-gts, ACA, APP, PCP, FIP-her, FIP-gts, and YZP. Eleven FIPs have been identified using homologous cloning method: FIP-cve, FIP-gap1, FIP-gap2, FIP-gat, FIP-gja, FIP-gmi, FIP-gsi, FIP- tvc, FIP-cru, FIP-gat, and LZ-9. As the development of Next Generation Sequencing, genome mining has been applied as a new tool for searching potential FIPs. FIP-nha, FIP-bbo, FIP-sch2, FIP-sch3, FIP-lrh, FIP-dsq2, c13717, FIP-vv082, and FIP-ppl were cloned directly by genome mining.</p>
