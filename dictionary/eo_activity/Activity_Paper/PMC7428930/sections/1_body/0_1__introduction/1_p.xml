 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species, Rutaceae, are the popular edible ingredients in Asian countries and are used as spices for spicy cuisine and medicinal herbs for treating many syndromes. In Korea, three 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species, 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>bungeanum</italic>, 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>schinifolium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic>, were distributed as “Zanthoxyli Pericarpium,” which are used as pungent condiments, spicy seasoning of foods, and medicinal herbs for stimulating intestinal motility and treating dyspepsia [

 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species contain bioactive alkaloids, aromatic and aliphatic amides, and phenolic compounds with anti-inflammation, antiplatelet aggregation, antioxidant, and antitumor activities [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, three 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species have different chemical profiles affecting the quality of biological activities and characteristic flavours and hence should be separately used [
