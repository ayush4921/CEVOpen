<p>A calculated degree of lipophilicity and TPSA data can be used to choose compounds according to their permeability through membranes, including the blood-brain barrier, to guide them to the proper location. It was demonstrated that membrane permeability in a variety of systems, including model liposome bilayers, various cells, and epidermal tissue, correlated strongly with data regarding hydrocarbon-water partition coefficients [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. TPSA values for selected compounds were defined in accordance with the main fragments of compound structures. The determined log
 <italic>P</italic> values were highest for dodecyl ester groups in positions 3 and 5 of the 1,4-DHP and lowest for short alkyl chain containing amphiphiles.
