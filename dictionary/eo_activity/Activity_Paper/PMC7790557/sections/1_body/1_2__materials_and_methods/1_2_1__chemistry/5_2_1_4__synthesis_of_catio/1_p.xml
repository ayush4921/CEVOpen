<p>Briefly, 3,4-dihydro-2(1
 <italic>H</italic>)-pyridone synthesis employed a four-component reaction using Meldrum's acid by a heterocyclization with the corresponding 
 <italic>β</italic>-ketoester and the corresponding aldehyde. The obtained 3,4-dihydro-2(1
 <italic>H</italic>)-pyridones were treated with bromine giving the respective 6-methylbromides, which in subsequent reaction with pyridine or amine provided the target compounds 
 <bold>28</bold>–
