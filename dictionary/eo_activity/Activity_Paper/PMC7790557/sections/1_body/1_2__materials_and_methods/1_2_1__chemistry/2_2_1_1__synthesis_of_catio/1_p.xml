<p>Briefly, the elaborated synthesis of the cationic 1,4-DHP 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>–
 <bold>25</bold> involved three sequential steps. The first step was the synthesis of the corresponding 2,6-dimethyl 1,4-DHP derivative in a two-component Hantzsch-type cyclization using 1.0 eq of the corresponding aldehyde, 1.2 eq of an ammonia source, and 2.0 eq of the corresponding acetoacetate for symmetrically substituted 1,4-DHP derivatives or 1 eq of the corresponding acetoacetate and 1.0 eq of the corresponding 3-aminobut-2-enoate for unsymmetrically substituted ones. The second step involved the bromination of the methyl groups of the 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-DHP derivative with N-bromosuccinimide, and the third step was the nucleophilic substitution of bromine of the 2,6-dibromomethylene-1,4-DHP by N-heterocycles or amines yielding the target compounds. The first step for the synthesis of the parent 1,4-dihydropyridine in the case of compound 
 <bold>26</bold> involved the reaction between 1.0 eq of the corresponding aldehyde, 2.4 eq of ammonium acetate, and 4.0 eq of the corresponding acetoacetate. More detailed synthetic procedures and characterization of the original compounds are described in the Supplementary data.
