 <italic>(1) Modification of Ester Alkyl Groups</italic>. Compounds possessing short alkyl chains in the ester groups at positions 3 and 5 of the dihydropyridine ring and organic heterocyclic cations in the methylene groups in positions 2 and 6 had very low cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines HT-1080 and MH-22A and high calculated LD
 <sub>50</sub> values (comp. 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold>). It means that the compounds were almost inert to the noncancerous cell line NIH3T3 and cancer cell lines HT-1080 and MH-22A. This refers to several groups of the mentioned type of compounds possessing short alkyls in 3,5-ester substituents (methyl, ethyl, and also the more elongated propoxyethyl groups): comp. 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, and 
 <bold>7</bold>. Additionally, 3,5-bis(diethyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-DHP amphiphiles comprising substituted pyridinio moieties in positions 2 and 6 (compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>) have moderate cytotoxicity, around 3300 mg/kg. In most cases, for the 3,5-bis(diethyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-DHP compounds, it was not possible to calculate IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the cancer cell lines HT-1080 and MH-22A due to rather low cytotoxicities; calculated LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold> were &gt;2000 mg/kg (for NIH3T3 cells).
