<p>These three groups were selected after analysis of their structure-activity relationships as synthetic lipid-like amphiphilic compounds. Previously, the 3rd group representatives—(2-amino-3-alkoxycarbonylalkyl)trialkylammonium halides—were synthesized, and their ribonucleic acid (RNS) transfection activity was demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This group covers synthetic lipid-like compounds on the basis of a 
 <italic>β</italic>-aminovinylcarbonyl (AVC) moiety: a conjugated pentade system connected with a lipophilic carbon atom chain and a cationic part (alkylammonium or pyridinium type). These compounds are proposed as an open-chain system compared to the cationic 1,4-DHP or pyridone heterocyclic systems. Structurally, the 2nd group molecules—the cationic pyridone derivatives—are heterocycles which comprise a cyclic AVC system and an additional intracyclic carbonyl group and an extracyclic cation. Previously, the 1st group representatives—1,4-DHP derivatives containing pyridinium moieties—were presented as promising tools for delivery of DNA into target cells [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is noteworthy that, due to cross-conjugation of two AVC systems of the 1,4-DHP cycle, its N-H group is influenced by two electron-withdrawing vinylcarbonyls.
