<p>It has been proposed that the equation from the correlation of IC
 <sub>50</sub> (the concentration of a substance that causes 50% toxicity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>) could be applied to estimate unknown LD
 <sub>50</sub> values for a new compound from IC
 <sub>50</sub> values measured as basal cytotoxicity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This estimated LD
 <sub>50</sub> gives prior information regarding compound properties and would be used to select promising compounds and a starting dose for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The evaluation of cytotoxicity of the abovementioned 3 types of amphiphilic compounds 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolinium bromide (MTT) and crystal violet (CV) assays on two monolayer tumor cell lines, namely, HT-1080 (human fibrosarcoma) and MH-22A (mouse hepatoma). Additionally, the compound influence on “normal” mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3) was estimated for the studies of structure-activity relationships and exploration of the effect of substituents. The results are presented in Tables
