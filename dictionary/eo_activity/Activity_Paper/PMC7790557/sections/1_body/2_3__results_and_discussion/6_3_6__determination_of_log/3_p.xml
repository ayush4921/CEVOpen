<p>Log
 <italic>P</italic> values which surpass 5, according to Lipinski's Rule of Five, characterize compounds as lipophilic [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. According to the obtained data for lipid-like amphiphiles, in some cases, the values of log
 <italic>P</italic> were &lt;5, in particular for compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>28</bold>, and 
 <bold>29</bold>. These compounds comprised short alkyl moieties in the ester groups. Log
 <italic>P</italic> values close to 5 were obtained for compounds 
 <bold>36</bold>, 
 <bold>41</bold>, 
 <bold>42</bold>, and 
 <bold>47</bold>, namely, 4.70, 5.63, 5.44, and 5.40, respectively. Log
 <italic>P</italic> values for dicationic 1,4-DHP amphiphiles possessing longer alkyl chains or fluorinated alkyl groups in the ester moieties were determined in the 11–24.5 interval, while for long alkyl ester moieties containing 3,4-dihydropyridone amphiphiles, log
 <italic>P</italic> values were determined in the 6–15 interval. The difference could be due to the number of alkyl groups. Log
 <italic>P</italic> values for other open-chain com12pounds were determined in the 6–11 interval.
