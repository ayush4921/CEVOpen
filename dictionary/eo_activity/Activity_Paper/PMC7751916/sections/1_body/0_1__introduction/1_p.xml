<p>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, E.C.3.1.1.7) enzyme plays a vital role in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AChE is also one of the targets for several cholinergic toxicants, plant glycoalkaloids, and drug candidates [1–3]. Acetylcholine (ACh) is converted to choline and acetic acid molecules in synapses via the AChE enzyme. Modern AD therapy targets enhance cholinergic neurotransmission by way of AChE inhibitors (AChEIs). Widely used AChEIs are galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine [4,5]. However, these drugs are unfortunately less effective to block AD progression, and they also have side effects [6]. Also, the discovery of novel, effective, and therapeutic drug candidates targeting AChE is one of the widespread issues in medicinal chemistry.</p>
