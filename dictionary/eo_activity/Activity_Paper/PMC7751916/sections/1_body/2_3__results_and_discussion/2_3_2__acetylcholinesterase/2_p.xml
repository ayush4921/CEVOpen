<p>The compounds 1 and 2 having a bicyclic ring showed considerable AChE inhibitory effects with low Ki values. When these two compounds compared with each other, it shows that oxygen atom was more favorable than the sulfur atom. Diazole (3) and tetrazole (6) derivatives were found more effective than triazole (5) derivative against the AChE enzyme. The compound 4 having 5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol ring showed favorable enzyme inhibitory potency with Ki value of 23.71 ±2.95 nM in contrast to other five-membered compounds 3–6.</p>
