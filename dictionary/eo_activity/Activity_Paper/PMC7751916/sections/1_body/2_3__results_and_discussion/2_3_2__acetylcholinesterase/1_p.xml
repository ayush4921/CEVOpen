<p>In this study, the compounds 1–6 were screened against the AChE enzyme due to significant reports on AD of phenolic natural or synthetic compounds. IC50 and Ki values of the reference drug TAC were 40.76 nM (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and 37.45 ±3.12 nM (Ki) towards AChE, as shown in Table. The compounds inhibited the AChE enzyme in nanomolar concentration in the range of Ki values of 22.13 ±1.96 - 62.11 ±6.00 nM and with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 28.76–57.27 nM. The compounds 2 and 4 were found potent AChE inhibitors with the Ki values of 22.13 ±1.96 nM and 23.71 ±2.95 nM, respectively, while the compound 5 was the least inhibiting compound with the highest Ki value of 62.11 ±6.00 nM. On the other hand, the compound 1 was also considered as one of the potent inhibitors with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 28.76 nM against AChE.
