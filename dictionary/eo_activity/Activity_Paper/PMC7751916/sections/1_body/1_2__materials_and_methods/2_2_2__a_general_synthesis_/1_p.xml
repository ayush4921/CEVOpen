 <italic>H</italic> -tetrazole-5-thiol for 6 (1.1 g)] was dissolved at room temperature in fresh methanolic NaOH solution (0.4 g, 25 mL methanol) and stirred for 10 min. Then, 2-bromo-4’-hydroxyacetophenone (9.3 mmol, 2 g) was put into the reaction flask. After the final mixture was stirred for several hours at room temperature, it was taken into the water (50 mL). The white solid obtained was filtered, washed with water three times, and then dried. The compounds were purified by crystallization using suitable solvents such as ethanol (1–4, 6 ) and ethanol: DMF (5).
