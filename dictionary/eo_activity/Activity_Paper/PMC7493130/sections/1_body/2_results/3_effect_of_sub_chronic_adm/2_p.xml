 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> on body weight changes of rats following sub-chronic treatment are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Rats treated with the ethyl acetate fraction of the leaf of DM at 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg had percentage increase in body weight of 15 %, 13 % and 10 %, respectively. Similarly, animals treated with the ethyl acetate fraction of the bark of the plant at 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg had their body weight increase by 23 %, 14 % and 15 %, respectively
