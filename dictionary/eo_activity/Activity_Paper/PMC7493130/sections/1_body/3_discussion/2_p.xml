<p id="par0135">Safety studies on herbal product have been assessed by performing acute toxicity test amongst other toxicity testing using laboratory animals [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Water, butanol and ethanol are all known to extract high polar compounds from plant materials. However, this present studies involve an activity guided experiment, thus methanol extraction was used. Methanol, a polar and an amphiphilic compound dissolves both polar and non-polar constituents of plant extracts [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the acute toxicity study, no any sign of acute toxicity or instant mortality was seen in any of the rats tested following single oral administration of 5000 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> body weight of 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the oral LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the extracts of the plant parts was considered to be greater than 5000 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. Earlier report has observed substances having an LD
 <sub>50</sub> value higher than 2000 mg/kg to be relatively safe for use [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This indicates that 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> crude methanolic extract has low toxicity and safe when administered orally. Similarly, in an earlier study, a low toxicity of the crude methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>D. mespiliformis</italic> with LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 620 mg/kg following intraperitoneal administration was reported in mice [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Measurement of haematological parameters plays is crucial in assessing the physiological and pathological status in man and animals. Thus alteration in normal values of these parameters could occur following ingestion of some toxic plants [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the sub-chronic study for 28 days, no significant alteration was observed in all the haematological parameters of the treated rats when compared with the control group except for group treated with the fraction of leaf ethyl acetate of the plant at 750 mg/kg that had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher values of neutrophil, basophil, eosinophil, monocyte and lymphocyte compares to control group rats.
