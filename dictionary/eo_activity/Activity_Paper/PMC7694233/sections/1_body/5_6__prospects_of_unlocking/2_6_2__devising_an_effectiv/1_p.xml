The development of cultivation, preharvest, and postharvest protocols to enhance the production of indigenous plants for consumption will impact the four pillars of food security, namely access, supply, availability, and utilization, which is essential for a food secured country [

 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> will include a wide range of stakeholders such as farmers, transporters, wholesalers, and retailers as well as the consumers. Presently, the sales of
