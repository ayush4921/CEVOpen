<p>From a molecular perspective, 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> is currently under-studied. A starting point could be to collect the range of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> varieties for development as well as to characterize them as a principal source of primary germplasm. Considering the urgent need for food-nutrition as well as the need for an immediate intervention to increase agro-biodiversity, 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> could form a significant source of accessible plant genetic resource(s). Generally, there is a need to fully elucidate the intra-and inter-genetic relationship in wild plants as well as the identification of unique attributes existing across different geographic populations using relevant biotechnological tools [
