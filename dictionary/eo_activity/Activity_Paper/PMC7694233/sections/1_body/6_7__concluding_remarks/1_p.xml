 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> has been traditionally used by rural peoples in southern Africa. Based on the rich pool of nutrients in the fruit, it remains an affordable, accessible, and nutritionally superior alternative to some relatively expensive “exotic” fruits. Evidence also suggests that 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> has the potential to meet the immediate nutritional requirement as it is edible in the fresh stage upon harvesting. This strongly suggests its ability in providing dietary diversity, especially in resource-limited communities. In addition, the agroforestry benefits of this fruit tree to the smallholder farmers could contribute toward increased farm productivity and reduction of farm inputs such as organic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. Based on preliminary data, the commercial potential of the oil from 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> seeds needs to be further explored. However, several challenges associated with the potential commercialization of the fruit tree currently exist. Some of these include inadequate information on the effective cultivation protocols and agronomic aspects, lack of holistic research approach as well as inadequate political will and policy framework. Prospects of unlocking the potential of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> fruit tree need to include effective value-chain, effective agro-processing, and application of appropriate biotechnological methods for plant improvement and cultivation. Overall, the successful implementation of an ideal 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> fruit requires multidisciplinary research that covers fields and expertise in plant breeding, micropropagation, and agronomy as well as pharmaceutical, toxicological, and phytochemical aspects. There is also a need for appropriate socio-economic and marketing policies. Finally, sufficient investments by governments, non-governmental organizations, and other relevant stakeholders remain pertinent.
