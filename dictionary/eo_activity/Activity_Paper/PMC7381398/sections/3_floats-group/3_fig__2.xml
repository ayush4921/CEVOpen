  <p>Different approaches for using plant-based biomolecules against SARS-CoV-2. Plants are a store house of active metabolites, and identification of these metabolites through targeted and untargeted metabolomics is important. These metabolites can be tested for their antiviral activity and released for treating viral diseases. On the other hand, plant based edible vaccines can be synthesized by expressing viral epitopes in plants. These vaccines are easy to store and propagate. (Image created using
