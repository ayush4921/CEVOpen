<p id="p0065">Plants are primarily under-studied for their use in therapeutic purposes for treating infectious diseases; however, the traditional medicines have taken complete advantage of the entire plant kingdom. The gap between conventional treatment using herbs and extracts and the knowledge on the bioactive compounds present in those plant extracts, as well as their mode of action leading to disease recovery, needs to be bridged. Advances in science and advent of next-generation scientific research and discovery had delivered several tools, techniques, approaches, and strategies that can be effectually used in dissecting the metabolomic profile of plant species to identify the potential compounds that could possess anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. Computational methods, including molecular modeling, docking, structure analysis,

 <italic>.</italic> The intervention of genomics and biotechnological approaches to modulate the genes underlying biosynthesis and accumulation of these therapeutic biomolecules gains importance in the current scenario (

The identification of unique compounds present in plants may be laborious, but once identified, screening the compounds for therapeutic applications in treating COVID-19 infected patients, devising appropriate strategies for optimized production and purification of such compounds, and pursuing further validation studies in the laboratory and clinical trials may be expedited keeping in view the eco-friendliness and safety aspects of plant-based drugs. Also, the availability of a repository of plant-based therapeutic biomolecules will play an important role in confronting future health emergencies.
