<p id="p0060">CRISPR/Cas9 method enables precise editing of genes, particularly this applies to knock out the enzymes that utilize the target biomolecule as a precursor for further processing and to facilitate rate-limiting processes for over-production of desired metabolites. Transient approaches, including RNA interference or virus-induced gene silencing, could also assist in finetuning the biosynthetic machinery to achieve a higher level of production. Stable transformation of genes and overexpression in the plant system could be achieved through several approaches existing for genetic transformation. 
 <italic>Agrobacterium-</italic>mediated transformation is one such reliable approach where the gene of interest is cloned into the Ti-plasmid and transferred to a plant for integration into the genome [
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This approach has been widely used in crop improvement for stress tolerance and agronomic traits. Given the broader application, this could be easily adapted for producing target biomolecules in diverse plant systems, where further downstream processing and purification is easy and straightforward. For instance, extracts of Chinese medicinal plants, 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> and 
 <italic>Magnolia officinalis</italic> have anti-inflammatory properties, but since they are endangered species, their use in therapeutics is restricted. In such a case, studying the biosynthetic pathways and engineering them into a model plant species such as maize, tomato, rice, and tobacco reduces the pressure on parent medicinal plants [

Some natural compounds may require chemical modifications to increase their potency so that they can be used as a therapeutic drug. For example, a naturally occurring saponin, glycyrrhizin, was found to inhibit the replication of coronavirus, but modifying its glycoside chain enhances the antiviral activity by ten folds [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, increased antiviral activity was observed for tomentins and quercetin-7-rhamnoside as compared to their non-modified precursors [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These reports accentuate that biotechnology can also bridge the gap between the identification of naturally derived compound(s) and their usage as the therapeutic drug with a reduced timeline and increased efficacy. Also, the administration of plant-based drugs either through topical application or oral intake reduces the stringencies associated with ultra-high purification and storage issues. This will simultaneously reduce manufacturing as well as downstream processing costs.
