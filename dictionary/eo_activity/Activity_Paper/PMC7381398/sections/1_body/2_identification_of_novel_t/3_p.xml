<p id="p0050">The interaction between Spike (S) Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human alveolar epithelial cells. Different plant-derived lectins such as Griffithsin and 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> agglutinin lectin interact with S protein and inhibit the binding onto the host cell [
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Simultaneously, phytoestrogens, especially Diadiazin, Genistein, Formontein, and Biochanin A were found to have a high affinity towards the substrate-binding domain β (SBDβ) of Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5). It is the host-cell receptor that interacts with S protein of COVID-19 and leads to the entry of the pathogen into the host cell. These phytoestrogens have been reported to act as competitive inhibitors against Spike protein by binding onto the active site of HSPA5 [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recently, 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> compound, Withanone (Wi-N) was found to weaken the binding between ACE2-RBD complex and was thus proposed to control the virus entry into the host cell [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] had also shown that Wi-N and caffeic acid phenethyl ester of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> interact with the highly conserved protease, M
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2. These reports justify that plant-based anti-COVID drugs could save time and cost for designing/developing new therapeutic molecules; however, large-scale screening of plants for identifying such potential biomolecules is imperative. Such compounds once identified will be processed to the further steps for laboratory trials and clinical trials followed by large-scale production, purification, and application at the end-user level.
