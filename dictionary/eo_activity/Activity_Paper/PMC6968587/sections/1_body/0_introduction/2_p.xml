<p>We have found 1-heteroaryl-2-aryl-

 </xref>. During the development of new JNK3-selective inhibitors, we sought to maintain three interactions of the previous scaffold; 
 <italic>hydrogen bonds in the hinge region</italic>, 
 <italic>hydrophobic interaction</italic> of the aromatic ring, and the 
 <italic>hydrogen bond</italic> of phenol in the benzimidazole scaffold, thus attempting to reduce the molecular weight. Therefore, we discarded benzene from the benzimidazole scaffold, retaining the hydrogen bond-possible moiety on 5-membered ring with final design and synthesis of the 3-alkyl-5-aryl-1-pyrimidyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazole derivatives (
