 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Both subfamilies of phenolic acids have identified compounds in either free or glycosylated forms. Caffeic acid and ferulic acid are the most abundant cinnamic acids, while within the benzoic acids it is protocatechuic acid. β-resorcylic and γ-rosorcylic acids have also been referenced, although these are more unusual.
