<p>Flavonoids are universally found in 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. in 
 <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated form. To a large extent, they have been reported in three species, namely: 
 <italic>B. pinnatum</italic>, 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> and 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00444-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The flavonol glycosides were shown as the most abundant subfamily of flavonoids, showing a restricted accumulation on leaf tissues [

 <xref rid="B90-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Both kaempferol and quercetin glycosides were found in 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Other flavonoid subfamilies, such as flavones and catechins, have also been reported, and a number of anthocyanins have been isolated from the flowers of different species [

 <xref rid="B96-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], which are stored in the foliar idioblasts of 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and 
 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> [
