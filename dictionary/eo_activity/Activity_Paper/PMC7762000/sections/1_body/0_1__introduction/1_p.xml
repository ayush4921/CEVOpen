<p>The genus 
 <italic>Kalanchoe</italic> (Adanson, 1736 [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) belongs to the Crassulaceae family and comprises 150 to 200 succulent species native to Madagascar and naturalized across Africa, South America, and Asia [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Kalanchoe constitutes a complex genus with an intricate taxonomy, not yet clearly elucidated. Two different trends have been remarkable throughout the published literature concerning both its nomenclature and systematics [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Authors disagree whether the classification is based on a single genus called 
 <italic>Kalanchoe</italic> (sensu lato) or three separate sections: 
 <italic>Kalanchoe</italic> (sensu stricto), 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> Kahl. (Salisbury, 1805 [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), and 
 <italic>Kitchingia</italic> (Baker, 1881 [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). However, other authors propose a three-subgenera classification of the genus 
 <italic>Kalanchoe</italic>, due to different evolutive arguments, morphological traits [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and molecular analyses [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], including 
 <italic>Kalanchoe</italic>, 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Calophygia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Amongst the different subgenera, the subgenus 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> includes around 25 species, endemic to Madagascar [
 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that gained much interest on plant science research, as they are considered model plants for different physiological features: the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], vegetative reproduction [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], plant cell regeneration [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and a source of therapeutical compounds [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, the most relevant feature associated to this subgenus is the use of their constitutive species in the traditional medicine worldwide, thus considering 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. as medicinal plants, due to their associated bioactivities [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
