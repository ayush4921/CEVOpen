 <italic>Bryophyllum pinnatum</italic> (Lam.) Oken [

 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; however, there is an extensive variety of other species that have also been exploited in Ethnomedicine, such as: 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum</italic> (Raym.-Hamet et Perr.) Berg. [

 <italic>B. × houghtonii</italic> D.B. Ward (syn. 
 <italic>B. daigremontianum × tubiflorum</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Leaf and root-derived formulations have been mostly used for the treatment of several common illnesses such as burns, wounds, insect bites, skin diseases, cough, fever or several infections, and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, and neurological and neoplastic diseases (
