<p>CAM photosynthesis is an advantageous adaptative strategy that enables plant adaptation to arid ecosystems, as it is the case of the whole Kalanchoe genus [

 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> species present a flexible CAM regime, with no time restriction on CO
 <sub>2</sub> uptake, which is fixed at night [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. present a highly specialized asexual reproductive mechanism, based on the symmetric plantlet development along the leaf margins or leaf tips of adult plants (

 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such clonal-spreading reproductive mechanism is driven by a complex phenomenon that combines both embryogenic and organogenetic events that has not been fully elucidated to date [

 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. contribute to the invasiveness of these species. It allows them a rapid colonization of unexplored territories with high adaptative efficiency, which has contributed to their worldwide naturalization [
