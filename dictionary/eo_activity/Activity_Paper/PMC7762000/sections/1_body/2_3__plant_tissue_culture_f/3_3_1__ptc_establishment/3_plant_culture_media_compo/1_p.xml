<p>Plant culture media composition plays a crucial role in the success of PTC protocols, as the nutrition of cultured plant materials depends directly on its ingredients [
 <xref rid="B143-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. As a general rule, plant culture medium formulations contain a series of inorganic nutrients, divided into macro- and micronutrients according to their requirements for plant physiology, along with organic nutrients, such as vitamins [
