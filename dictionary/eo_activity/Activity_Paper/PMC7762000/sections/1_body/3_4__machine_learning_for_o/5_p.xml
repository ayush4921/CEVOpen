BAP concentration was assessed as the critical factor guiding this phenomenon on B. daigremontianum, B. × houghtonii and B. tubiflorum; thus, predicting a minimal BAP concentration required for the development of different organogenetic responses (0.35 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>). On the contrary, the application of auxins, such as indoleacetic acid (IAA), was outlined as an inhibitory factor on the indirect shoot regeneration on B. tubiflorum, whereas no IAA influence was reported on
