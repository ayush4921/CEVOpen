<p>Along with this review, we provided evidence about the multifactorial behavior of PTC methodologies and the production of secondary metabolites (

Therefore, the elucidation and characterization of such phenomena may require the development of complex experimental designs, to reveal relevant interactions between factors, which are not feasible due to cost and time. Furthermore, the analysis and interpretation of these complex experimental designs is difficult and, in many cases, limited or incomplete [
