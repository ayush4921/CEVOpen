 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In mice, cannabidiol induced signs of hepatotoxicity, possibly of a cholestatic nature; hepatotoxicity gene expression arrays revealed that it differentially regulated more than 50 genes, many of which were linked to oxidative stress responses, lipid metabolism pathways and drug metabolizing enzymes.
