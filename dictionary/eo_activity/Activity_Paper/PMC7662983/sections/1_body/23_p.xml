<p>A protein fraction from 
 <italic>Ulva intestinalis</italic> containing 51% of proteins and 22% of polysaccharides was analyzed and tested for the anti-aging potential, fibroblast proliferation and collagen and hyaluronic acid production on human fibroblast cell lines. A significant increase in collagen and hyaluronic acid production per cell, and a reduction in cell proliferation without increasing cell mortality were demonstrated [
