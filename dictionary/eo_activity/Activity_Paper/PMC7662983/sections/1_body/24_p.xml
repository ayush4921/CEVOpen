<p>UVB-induced skin damage in mice was reduced by dietary corn silk [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Oral administration decreased epidermal thickness, wrinkle formation, and positive staining for PCNA, Ki67, and 8-OHdG, and increased collagen staining. Pro-inflammatory NF-κB target genes and MMP-9 expressions were lowered, whereas TGF-β/Smad signaling increased. Low skin lipid peroxidation and blood DNA oxidation levels and high blood glutathione were detected in parallel with higher levels of catalase, SOD1 and glutaredoxin.
