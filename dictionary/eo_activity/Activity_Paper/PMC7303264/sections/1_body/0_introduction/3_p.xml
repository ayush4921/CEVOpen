<p>Interestingly, cashew fruit is tasty and rich in minerals, vitamins, and some essential nutrients. It has high vitamin C, nearly to five times higher than oranges and also with high minerals content. The fruit comprises of some volatile compounds, e.g., esters, terpenes, and carboxylic acids (

Cardanol (decarboxylated anacardic acid) and cardol are found as the main components of commercial cashew nut shell liquid. Cardanol is extensively used as a synthon for the synthesis of several polymers and agricultural products (

As defatted, cashew kernel flour is a good source of protein and minerals. Furthermore, it can serve as low-fat fabricated food and animal feed. Animal or poultry feeds are mostly formulated using a substantial amount of cashew fiber. Besides, cashew fiber along with cashew nut shell liquid, both possess high anacardic acids contents and therefore can be utilized in functional food formulations (
