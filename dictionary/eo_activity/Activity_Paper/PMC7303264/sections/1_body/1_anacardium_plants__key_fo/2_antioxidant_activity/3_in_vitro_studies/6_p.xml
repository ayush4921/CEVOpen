<p>The antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> leaf extract was measured and exerted noticeable activity in treating RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Leaf extract administration (0.5 and 5 μg/mL doses) reduced oxidative damage in macrophage cells. Moreover, oxidative damage attributes induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells was inverted by leaf extract (

Results indicated that antioxidant activities of cashew nut, kernel, and testa phenolics extracted increased with the increasing roasting temperature. The highest activity was observed in nuts roasted at 130°C for 33 min, as revealed by DPPH, ORAC, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), FRAP, and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays (

 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> were investigated for antioxidant activity using FRAP and DPPH assays (
