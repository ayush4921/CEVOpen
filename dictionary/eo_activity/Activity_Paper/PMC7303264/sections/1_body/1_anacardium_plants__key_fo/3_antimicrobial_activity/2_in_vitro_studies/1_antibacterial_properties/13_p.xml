<p>In the study by Muraina et al. (
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>), 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> leaf extract (10,000 μg/mL) was used against 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> spp., using the broth microdilution method. The antibiotic tylosin (1,280 μg/mL) was used as a positive control and acetone as a negative control. The authors obtained a significant result for the extract as an anti-mycoplasm product (MIC = 310 μg/mL).
