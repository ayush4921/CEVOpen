 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> cashew bark oil (heated and raw-−1,600 to 0.7812 μg/mL) as well as 16 isolated compounds (anacardic acids, cardols and cardanols) were investigated by Himejima and Kubo (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Using microdilution method, the following strains were tested: 
 <italic>B. subtilis, Brevibacterium ammoniagenes, S. aureus, S. mutans, E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>. The oil's best result was obtained against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (heated: 6.25 μg/mL and crude: 12.5 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (heated: 3.13 μg/mL and crude: 3.13 μg/mL). The isolates obtained MIC values ranging from 0.39 to 100 μg/mL, with 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> being the most susceptible strain. Kubo et al. (
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>) isolated from 
 <italic>A. occidentalis</italic> cashew, and tested through microdilution, a series of anacardic acids and (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-2-alkenyls against 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>, obtaining MIC values ranging from 200 to 800 μg/mL.
