<p>The liquid from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> cashew bark was evaluated as a food additive for ruminants, where prior to its addition to feed, cashew nut shell liquid was tested by microdilution (0 to 50 μg/mL). The lower MIC values were obtained (1.56–6.25 μg/mL) against 
 <italic>Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Ehrlichia ruminantium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens</italic> and moderate values (25 to 50 μg/mL) against 
 <italic>Streptococcus bovis</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus ruminis</italic>. Four of the tested bacteria (
 <italic>Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Elenomonas ruminantium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Megasphaera elsdenii</italic>) were insensitive to cashew nut shell liquid (MIC ≥ 50 μg/mL). The bacteria 
 <italic>Fibrobacter succinogenes, Prevotella ruminicola</italic>, and 
 <italic>Succinimonas amylolytica</italic> were sensitive to the cashew nut shell liquid (MIC: 3.13 to 12.5 μg/mL). Thus, cashew nut shell liquid inhibits rumen-specific bacteria and its activity is promising (
