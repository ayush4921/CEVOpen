<p>Menezes et al. (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) extracted tannins from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> stem bark and evaluated by cavity diffusion its antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> at 1:1, 1:2, to 1:16 μg/mL, with inhibition halos ranging from 11 to 17 mm. In the presence of 5% sucrose, the bacterial anti-adherence effect was observed using concentrations from 1:8 to 1:512 μg/mL, obtaining in some cases, a better effect than 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (1:16–1:32 μg/mL).
