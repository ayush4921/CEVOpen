<p>Muzaffar et al. (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>) tested anacardic acid (0 to 100 μM) against 
 <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. A strong conidial germination inhibition was observed by counting colony forming units in samples treated with anacardic acid (75 μM-−70%), while no inhibition was observed in the control containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-−0.1%).
