 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> cashew hexane and anacardic acid (both 20 mg/mL) extracts. When using agar diffusion, 18- and 16-mm halos were obtained for the extract and 16 mm for the acid, while microdilution analysis revealed MIC values ranged from 20 to 1:256 mg/mL. The amoxicillin control (20 mg/mL) inhibited total growth in the strains (
