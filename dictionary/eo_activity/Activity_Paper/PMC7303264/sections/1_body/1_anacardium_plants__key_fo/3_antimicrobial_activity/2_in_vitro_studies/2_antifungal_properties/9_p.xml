<p>Investigations reporting the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Anacardium</italic> species mostly highlighted the 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> species, in a similar manner to the antibacterial activity. The hydroethanolic extract was the most commonly tested extract type with the bark being the most commonly investigated plant part through microdilution and against opportunistic 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. pathogens. No 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have been reported and no reports have been found against dermatophyte fungi. As observed in ethnobiological research, the medical use of this genus is the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms and skin disorders and, therefore, studies carried out involving fungi which act with this pathogenesis profile are of extreme relevance.
