<p>These studies using the 
 <italic>A. occidentalis</italic> species prioritized the evaluation of hydroethanolic and methanolic extracts, using mainly the stem bark from the species. The method chosen for most of the tests was microdilution, followed by disk diffusion. Moreover, isolated compounds have already been evaluated, mostly anacardic acids. In addition to 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic>, two other species, 
 <italic>A. microcarpum</italic> and 
 <italic>Anacardium humile</italic> were tested against bacteria.
