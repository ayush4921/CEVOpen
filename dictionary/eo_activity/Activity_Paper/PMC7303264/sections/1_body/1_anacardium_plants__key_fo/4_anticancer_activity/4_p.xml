<p>Anacardic acid-induced Aurora kinase A autophosphorylation was shown in an 
 <italic>in silic</italic>o approach, and this effects was attributed to its ability to bind and induce structural changes on the enzyme (
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>). Furthermore, Schultz et al. (
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>) stated that anacardic acid displayed effective inhibition toward estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-expressing breast cancer cells proliferation, regardless of endocrine/tamoxifen sensitivity, while no effect was observed in ERα-negative cells. In addition, cell cycle progression inhibition and apoptosis induction in ERα -expressing cells was stated ERα-dependently. In short, as anacardic acid inhibited ERα-expressing breast cancer cells proliferation, but not the primary HuMECs, this finding reveals of utmost interest for further delineation of medical actions in cancer therapy.
