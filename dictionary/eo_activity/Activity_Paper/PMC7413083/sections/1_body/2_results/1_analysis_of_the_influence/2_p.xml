<p>In the case of utilitarian redundancy, there was no positive correlation between the genus variable and the Redundancy establishment (OR = 2.21, CI [0.27–17.79], 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.44). On the other hand, the chances of a pair being redundant increased when they were species of the same family (OR = 1.94, CI [1.06–3.53], 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results confirm the hypothesis that there is influence of the taxonomic affiliation, in terms of family, on the establishment of utilitarian redundancy (see 
 <xref rid="table-5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).
