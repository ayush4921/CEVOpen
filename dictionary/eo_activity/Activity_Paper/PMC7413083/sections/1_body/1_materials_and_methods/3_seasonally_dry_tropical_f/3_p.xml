<p>The Igrejinha community has only one church that is Protestant, and just as in the communities described above, most people are adept of Christian Religious Doctrines. On the other hand, the inhabitants of the Batinga community affirm they are descendants of indigenous peoples and perform various healing and magico-religious rituals that rely on the use of plant species. The nearest Hospitals and health posts are restricted to Catimbau Village, an urban area that is about 20 km away. Access is possible from private vans who make the transfer at certain times of the day. Access to health services is difficult and part of the population prefers to treat themselves with medicinal plants.</p>
