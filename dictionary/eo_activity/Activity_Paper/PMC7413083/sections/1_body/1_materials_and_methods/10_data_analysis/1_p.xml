<p>The identification of utility equivalents and utility redundancies between the Caatinga and Atlantic Forest areas was performed through a similarity analysis (Jaccard). A binary matrix was constructed by gathering data from the interviews, setting the plants as objects and the therapeutic indications as descriptors. When a plant was used for a given therapeutic indication, the cell was filled with value 1. When a plant was not used for a given therapeutic indication, the corresponding cell had the value zero. In relation to utilitarian equivalence, the analysis now considered the pairs formed by plants of the same species, in cases in which the same species occurred in both regions, sometimes not considered. When considering pairs of the same species, the objective was to verify if plants that include the same biological entity, and that naturally share common traits, contribute to a scenario of overlapping medicinal uses among taxonomically close plants.</p>
