<p>Although 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Santoro (2014)</xref> have not performed chemical analyzes to demonstrate this interpretation, there is evidence of the importance of phylogeny for character distribution responsible for certain pharmacological activities. 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Rønsted et al. (2012)</xref>, for example, have shown a correlation between phylogenetic proximity and the diversity and inhibitory activity of alkaloids to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In this sense, the selection of redundant plants from the same family would be partly explained by the sharing of an evolutionary past that culminated in similarities in terms of biosynthetic pathways responsible for secreting compounds of medicinal value (
