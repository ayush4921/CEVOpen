<p>The prediction that local experts from the different regions, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, have great chances of selecting the same genus or the same botanical family to treat similar diseases was confirmed, indicating that knowledge production in plant-based medical systems is influenced by intrinsic characteristics of the botanical species. There are indications in other countries that the selection of medicinal plants suffers this type of taxonomic influence. 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Saslis-Lagoudakis et al. (2012)</xref>, for example, analyzed the medicinal flora of three distinct regions, Cape region (South Africa), Nepal and New Zealand, and found a close phylogenetic proximity between species used to treat similar diseases.
