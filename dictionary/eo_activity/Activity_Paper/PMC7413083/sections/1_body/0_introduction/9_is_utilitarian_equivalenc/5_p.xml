<p>Following this perspective, the present study tried to test the following hypotheses:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>In distinct medical systems, taxonomically close species tend to present utilitarian equivalence. It was expected that pairs of species with the same taxonomic affiliation, in terms of genus and/or family, would be more likely to be utility equivalents than taxonomically distant plants.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Within a medical system, taxonomically close species tend to present utilitarian redundancy.</p>
