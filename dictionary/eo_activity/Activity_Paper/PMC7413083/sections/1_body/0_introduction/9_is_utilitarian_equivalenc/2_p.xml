Therefore, it does not apply to cases of overlapping uses that are a consequence of the diffusion of knowledge among different peoples (

This distinction is important because one of the main applications of studying ethnobotanical convergence is bioprospecting. Therefore, closely related plants that are used by different populations for the same end may have similar chemical characteristics that justify such convergence (
