<p id="Par51">In conclusion, our results confirm the promising potential of NADESs as solvents for extraction of the biologically active constituents of popular medicinal plants and confirm the suggestion that NADES can improve the biological effects of bioactive extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Best extraction results for total phenolics for the studied plants were obtained using XXGlH, but surprisingly these extracts were inactive against all tested microorganisms and were not subjected to further studies of in vitro cytotoxic and genotoxic activity. The most effective were the extracts with CAPD. The presence of citric acid and some synergistic effects with 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> constituents may play a role, as CAPD extract of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> was much more active compared to the respective 
 <italic>P. major</italic> extract.
