<p id="Par46">After estimation of the cytotoxicity of the studied NADES solvents and extracts, CCL1 cells were subjected to Comet assay. CCL1 cells were treated with the four tested NADES and extracts of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. major</italic> with XXGly and CAPD, for 24 h at optimal conditions. Both the pure NADES and the NADES extracts were applied to the monolayer cells at concentrations of IC
 <sub>50</sub>, ½IC
 <sub>50</sub> and ¼IC
 <sub>50</sub>, estimated by MTT tests (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Untreated cells were used as negative control while CCL1 cells treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 5 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> were used as a positive control for genotoxicity.
