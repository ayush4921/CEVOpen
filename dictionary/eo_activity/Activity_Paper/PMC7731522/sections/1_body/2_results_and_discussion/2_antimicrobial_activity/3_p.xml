<p id="Par43">In most cases where antimicrobial activity was observed, it was much higher than the one of the traditional ethanol extracts. Such antimicrobial potentiating effects of NADESs was also observed in the case of propolis NADES extracts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and some synergistic effects are also to be considered. Especially in the case of the CAPD extract of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic>, the increased effect compared to the other extracts can be partly explained by the effect of the presence of citric acid as an element of the NADES. In the literature there are indications that NADES containing organic acids possess higher antimicrobial activity, since some organic acids present many pharmacological effects [
