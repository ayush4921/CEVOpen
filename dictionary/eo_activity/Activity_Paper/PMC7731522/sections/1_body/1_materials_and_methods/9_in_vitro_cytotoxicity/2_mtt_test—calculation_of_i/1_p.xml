<p id="Par34">The MTT test was conducted according to Annex C, ISO 10993-5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cells with a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> ml
 <sup>−1</sup> were seeded in 96-well plates (flat bottom, 100 µl/well). For cells to start exponential growth (log phase), plates were incubated for 24 h. After entering the log phase cells were exposed to NADES and their extracts at concentrations ranging between 2 and 0.004% volume fraction for 24 and 72 h. PBS was used as a solvent and 4 wells were used for each treatment. MTT (0.5 mg/ml final concentration) was added to each well, followed by a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. The medium above the cells was removed and 100 μl/well 2-propanol supplemented with 5% formic acid were used to dissolve the formed formazan crystals and as a blank solution. Absorption was measured at 540 nm (reference filter 690) on a microplate reader ELx800 (BioTek Instruments, Inc., United States). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (inhibitory concentration 50 which reduces vital cells by half) were calculated with a non-linear regression analysis (inhibition dose–response model, variable slope) using the GraphPad Prizm software. Untreated cells were considered as negative control and normalized for 100%.
