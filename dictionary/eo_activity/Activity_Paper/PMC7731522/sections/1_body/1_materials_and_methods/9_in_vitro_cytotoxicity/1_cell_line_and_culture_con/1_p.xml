<p id="Par33">The cell line CCL-1™ (mouse fibroblasts, NCTC clone 929, ATCC—American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA) recommended in Annex C of ISO 10993-5 (ISO 10993-5:2009 2017) for evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity was cultured in sterile cell culture flasks and controlled environment (incubator Panasonic MCO-18AC, Japan) at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and approx. 95% humidity. The cultivation medium MEM was supplemented with 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10
 <sup>5</sup> Units/l penicillin G sodium and 100 mg/l streptomycin sulphate. Cells were sub-cultivated at a seeding density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup> 1–3 times per week after reaching 80–90% confluence. Sequentially, applied solutions of 0.05% EDTA in PBS (1–2 ml, 5–10 min) and 0.25% (w/v)/0.53 mM trypsin/EDTA (1–2 ml, 5–10 min) were used for the detachment of the cell monolayer and cell separation.
