<p id="Par26">The NADESs density was determined as follows: 2 ml of NADES were put in a volumetric flask at 20 °C and the weight of the liquid was measured. The density was calculated using the formula: ρ = m
 <sub>NADES</sub>/V
 <sub>NADES</sub>, where ρ is density, g/ml at 20 °C, m
 <sub>NADES</sub> − weight, g at 20 °C and V
 <sub>NADES</sub> − volume in ml at 20 °C (2 ml). For each solvent the procedure was performed in duplicate.
