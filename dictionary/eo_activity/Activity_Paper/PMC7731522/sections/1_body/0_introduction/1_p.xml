<p id="Par21">One of the most important aims of green chemistry has been to find green solvents for extraction of bioactive compounds from natural sources in order to replace the currently used hazardous organic solvents. One of the eco-friendly alternatives are deep eutectic solvents (DES) and particularly the natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES). DES are mixtures of organic compounds that have melting points lower than those of the individual components of the mixture and are liquid at ambient temperature. In the case of NADES, the constituents of the eutectic mixture are natural compounds: primary metabolites, which are easily available, non-toxic, biocompatible and sustainable [

This property, however, poses a serious problem to the recovery of the active ingredients from the extract. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that NADESs retained or even improved the biological activity of dissolved substances [

Therefore, the NADES could function as an active ingredient, and the extract could be directly used as part of cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations, bypassing the difficulties of solute recovery. The aim of the present study was to apply selected NADES for extraction of two popular Bulgarian medicinal plants: the mountain tea
