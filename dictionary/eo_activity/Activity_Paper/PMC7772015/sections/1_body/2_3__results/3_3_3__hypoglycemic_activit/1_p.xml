<p>Between groups analysis showed no significant difference in baseline fasting BGL throughout groups. Although 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg AIRE reduced BGL at 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr and 6
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to their baseline values, this reduction was not a significant reduction in the three groups given different doses of AIRE at all time points. GLC 5 mg/kg, however, reduced BGL more significantly at 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr, 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr, and 6
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to each groups (negative control, three test groups with three different doses of AIRE) and baseline value. In general, a significant difference in BGL was not found when groups that received different doses of AIRE were compared with each other at all time points (
