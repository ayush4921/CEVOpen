<p>Significant reduction in BGL was observed in the GLC received group at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day compared to the diabetic control, and also, BGL was reduced dramatically compared to 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg aqueous fraction at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day. The AIRE 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg reduced fasting BGL significantly at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day compared to the baseline value. Fasting BGL was reduced significantly at doses of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg aqueous fraction of AIR at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day compared to the 100 mg/kg treated group and the diabetic control (
