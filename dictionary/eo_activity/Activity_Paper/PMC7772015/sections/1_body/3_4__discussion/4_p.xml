<p>A single dose of AIRE ranging from 100 mg/kg to 400 mg/kg and GLC 5 mg/kg were given to mice in the normoglycemic model. In this model, BGL of mice was reduced by different doses of hydromethanolic crude extract of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> root at the 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr and 6
 <sup>th</sup> hr compared to the baseline value, but a significant difference was not noticed. When different doses of the hydromethanolic root crude extract, baseline value, and negative control group were compared to GLC, GLC reduced the fasting BGL significantly at 2
 <sup>nd</sup> hr, 4
 <sup>th</sup> hr, and 6
 <sup>th</sup> hr. These findings are almost similar to the antidiabetic activity study reports by Belayneh and Birru [
