<p>Among the solvent fractions (aqueous, chloroform, and hexane), the single dose of the aqueous fraction revealed by far the most credible antihyperglycemic activity in STZ-induced diabetic mice compared to the baseline, diabetic control groups, chloroform-treated groups, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-treated groups. The chloroform and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fractions did not demonstrate a noticeable antihyperglycemic activity. This could suggest that common antidiabetic phytochemical constituents such as polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and chromium were associated to aqueous polar solvent, water, and likely to be contained in neither chloroform nor hexane [
