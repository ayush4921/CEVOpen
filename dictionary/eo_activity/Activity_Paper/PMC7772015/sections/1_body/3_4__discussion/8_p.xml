<p>Among the three single different doses of aqueous fractions, AQA 400â€‰mg/kg showed highest blood glucose lowering activity. The investigation implied that the single dose and repeated daily doses of aqueous fraction and repeated daily doses of crude extract have a comparable blood glucose lowering ability. Moreover, in repeated daily dose experiment, the GLC-treated group showed a significant reduction in BGL at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day compared to groups that received various doses of aqueous fraction and crude extract of

Compared to groups treated by both repeated daily doses of crude extract and aqueous fraction of AIRE, the bodyweight of the diabetic control group was reduced significantly after two weeks of treatment. Compared to the baseline bodyweight of the mice, there was a significant increase in bodyweight of the mice following repeated daily doses of aqueous fraction and crude extract at 14
 <sup>th</sup> day. The loss of bodyweight in STZ-induced diabetic mice was significantly improved by GLC (
