<p>Antihyperglycemic mechanism(s) of action of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> might be attributed to potentiating of the effect of insulin either by escalating the release of insulin from 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-cells of pancreas, increasing the utilization of glucose by peripheral tissue, reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, inhibiting metabolic degradations of carbohydrates, or by preventing oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, the present study recommends more in-depth molecular studies to determine the precise mechanism of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> to lower blood glucose.
