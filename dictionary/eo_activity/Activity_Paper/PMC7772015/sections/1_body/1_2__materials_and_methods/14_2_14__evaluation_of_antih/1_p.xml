<p>Overnight fasted STZ-induced diabetic mice were grouped into 6 groups (6 mice per groups) at random. Then, group 1 used as diabetic control received 10 ml/kg DW; groups 2, 3, and 4 used as diabetic test groups received three doses of aqueous fraction (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg, respectively); group 5 diabetic positive control was treated with 5 mg/kg GLC, and group 6 normal control was treated with 10 ml/kg DW once daily for 14 days. At baseline, BGL and bodyweight of the mice were determined prior to starting treatment on the 1
 <sup>st</sup> day of treatment (three days after STZ injection) and after that on 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day [
