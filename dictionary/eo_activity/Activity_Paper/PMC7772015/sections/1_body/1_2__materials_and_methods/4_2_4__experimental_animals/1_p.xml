<p>Swiss albino male mice which were healthy weighed 20–30 g and aged 8–12 weeks were used in the study, and healthy female mice having similar weight and age to males were used for the acute oral toxicity study. The mice used for the study were acquired from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. The mice were stayed in light and dark cycle (12 hours of each cycle) which is a standard condition for laboratory animals and permitted open access to standard pellet diet and water ad libitum. Acclimatization of the mice to the laboratory conditions was performed for 1 week prior to the start of the experiment.</p>
