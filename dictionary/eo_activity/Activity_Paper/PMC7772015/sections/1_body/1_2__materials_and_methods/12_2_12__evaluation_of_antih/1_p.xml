<p>Overnight fasted STZ-induced diabetic mice and normal mice were grouped into 6 groups (5 groups of mice having diabetes and 1 group of normal mice, 6 mice in each group) at random. The diabetic control and normal controls were given 10 ml/kg DW; three different doses of root extract were given to diabetic treatment groups, whereas the diabetic positive control group received 5 mg/kg GLC all dosed once daily for 14 days. BGL and bodyweight of the mice were determined prior to starting treatment on the 1
