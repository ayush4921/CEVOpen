<p>Blood samples were taken from the tail vein of each mouse by cutting the tip of the tail aseptically in all mice models. Blood glucose level (BGL) was measured by the i-QARE DSW Taiwan glucometer, and measurement was carried out in triplicates so that the average value could be taken. And the reduction of the blood glucose level in percentage was calculated via the following formula: (G
 <sub>b</sub> − Gp)/G
 <sub>b</sub> × 100, where G
 <sub>b</sub> is the BGL at 0 hr (baseline blood glucose level), and Gp is the blood glucose level after treatment.
