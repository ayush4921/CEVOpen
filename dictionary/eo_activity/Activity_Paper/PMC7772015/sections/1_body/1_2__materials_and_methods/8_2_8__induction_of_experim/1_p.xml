<p>Inductions of diabetes were performed by using streptozotocin (STZ). First, STZ was dissolved in 0.1 M cold citrate buffer (pH = 4.5). Dose of 150 mg/kg of the freshly prepared solution was administered intraperitoneally to 16 hr fasted mice. After ½ hr of STZ administration, food and water were permitted freely to the mice. After 6 h of STZ administration, solution of 5% glucose in a quantity of 1 ml/kg was given to the mice for the next 24 hr to prevent death resulting from hypoglycemic shock. Mice were screened for diabetes after 3 days of STZ injection, and fasting BGL &gt; 200 mg/dl was included in the study as diabetic mice [
