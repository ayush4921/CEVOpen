<p>Four wells, each of 6 mm diameter, were bored in the inoculated plates using a sterile cork borer. 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the 20% test solution of the extracts dissolved in methanol, positive control, and negative control was poured into the respective wells. Chloramphenicol and methanol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Thus inoculated plates were put inside the incubator at 35 ± 2°C. After 18–24 h, the plates were evaluated for the zone of inhibition (ZOI). The diameter of each ZOI was measured in millimeters by digital Vernier Caliper.
