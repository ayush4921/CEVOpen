 <italic>(1). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)</italic>. A set of 12 sterilized labelled vials containing 1 mL of presterilized Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) were prepared. 1 mL of the respective extract solution was added to 11 vials only, and the first vial was used as negative growth control. After complete homogenization, 1 mL of the solution containing nutrient broth and extract solution was transferred to the second vial containing 1 mL of nutrient broth. In the same manner, two-fold serial dilution was prepared up to the 10th vial. Thereafter, 1 mL of content was discarded from the 10th vial and the 11th vial was used as positive control. Now, all the vials except the 1st and last contain equal volume, i.e., 1 mL, gradually decreasing concentration of the solution. To all these vials, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of bacterial suspension (turbidity equal to a 0.5 McFarland standard, supposed to have 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL) was put into each vial and mixed thoroughly. The vials were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. MIC was taken as the lowest concentration that prevented the growth of bacterial culture [
