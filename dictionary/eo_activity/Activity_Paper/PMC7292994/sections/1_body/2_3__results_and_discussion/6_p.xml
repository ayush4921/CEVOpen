<p>Several experiments have demonstrated considerable amount of antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> leaf, fruit, seed, and bark extracts against different bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The ZOI produced by the ethanolic and hexane extracts of barks of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> showed antibacterial activities against different bacteria. The ZOI produced by the extract against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> both were 11.67 mm and against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was 17.33 mm for ethanolic extract and 17 mm for hexane extract [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, in another study, the methanolic extracts of the fruits produced 7 mm ZOI against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and the MBC value was 2.5 mg/mL and 23 mm ZOI and MBC value &gt;10 for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The methanolic extract of bark showed 28.7 mm ZOI against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
