<p>The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values ranged from 0.78 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL. The lowest MBC value of 0.78 mg/mL was exhibited by fruit extracts against MRSA and the highest, i.e., 50 mg/mL, was by seeds (wild) and fruits for 
 <italic>S. epidermidis.</italic> The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The MBC value of 1.56 mg/mL was obtained for fruits (wild and cultivated) and seeds (wild) against 
 <italic>B. subtilis;</italic> seeds (wild and cultivated) against MRSA; and fruits (wild and cultivated) and bark (wild and cultivated) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Similarly, the MBC value was 3.12 mg/mL for seeds (wild and cultivated) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The MBC values of the extracts against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> were comparatively higher (
