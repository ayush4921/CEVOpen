<p>Methanolic extracts of fruits, seeds, and bark of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> were tested against various bacteria. Antibacterial properties of the extracts were compared with chloramphenicol as positive control. The diameter of zone of inhibition (ZOI) produced by the extracts on the particular microorganisms was measured in mm for the estimation of their antibacterial activities. Amongst the organisms tested for antibacterial properties, fruit and seed extracts showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia faecalis</italic>, MRSA, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and the bark extract against MRSA and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> only, while the extracts did not produce any ZOI for the rest of the organisms.
