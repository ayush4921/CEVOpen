<p>Antimicrobial activity was assessed as described in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In brief, two-fold serial dilutions of the agents were prepared in DMSO using sterile 96-well microdilution plates with flat-bottom wells. Antibiotics ciprofloxacin and miconazole were used as positive control for bacteria and fungi, respectively. For bacteria, 5% DMSO was used as the solvent control for all the experiments, while for 
 <italic>C. albicans,</italic> 2% DMSO was used. The MIC was calculated by IC
