<p>Infectious diseases are the major cause of morbidity and mortality and thus a serious public health problem in developing countries. Despite the arsenal of antibiotics available, the situation is worsening due to emerging drug resistance. Antimicrobial resistance in a hospital setting is a major issue these days due to the extensive use or misuse of these drugs. Hence, there is an urgent need to find new molecules to treat infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An attractive strategy for finding such molecules would be to test plants used to treat infectious diseases in traditional systems of healing, since medicinal plants have been a source of many pharmaceutical drugs for a range of diseases, including viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections, as well as for cancer [

However, plant selection based on ethnobotany and traditional practices such as Ayurveda, Yunani, Siddha, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Japanese Kampo medicine increases the probability of finding bioactive molecules that may be subsequently developed clinically [
