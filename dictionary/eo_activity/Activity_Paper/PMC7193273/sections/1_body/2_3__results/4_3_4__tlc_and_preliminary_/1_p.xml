<p>All the plant extracts were subjected to TLC, to generate fingerprints. Using methanol : dichloromethane (95 : 5, v/v) as mobile phase, numerous absorbing bands were observed under UV light (254 nm and 360 nm). Furthermore, after exposing the plates to 5% sulphuric acid in ethanol, spots were visualized, and the reaction products were compared under UV light. Interestingly, with or without derivatization, several extracts show similar fingerprints (observed colour as well as Rf), signifying the presence of similar chemical classes. Most of the plant extracts exposed to 254 nm UV light show orange, yellow, pink, green, or blue fluorescence, confirming the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure 2</xref>). Select plant extracts such as 
 <italic>A. anceps, A. tomentosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>B. albiflora</italic> show similar Rf values and band patterns (blue or green fluorescence at 360 nm, converted to yellow, blue, or blue-green fluorescence after exposure to sulphuric acid) confirming the presence of coumarins (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> extract forms dark zones under UV 254 that disappear at 360 nm, suggesting sesquiterpene lactones. Several plant extracts such as 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum, D. integrifolia, E. acuminate, J. adhatoda, K. pinnata,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mukorossi</italic> did not show any bands under UV initially but form clear bands of blue, light green, or brown colour after exposure to sulphuric acid, confirming the presence of saponins. Three plant extracts: 
 <italic>C. wallichii, J. adhatoda,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. polyphylla,</italic> show blue colour fluorescence turning to green or gray after exposure to sulphuric acid, confirming the presence of alkaloids. Only one extract, 
 <italic>R. arboreum</italic>, shows the presence of tannins, while extracts such as 
 <italic>B. albiflora, C. serratum, D. integrifolia,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. tithymaloides</italic> contain sterols and glycosides. The TLC fingerprints suggest the presence of several groups of phytochemical constituents, but which of these constitute the bioactive compounds responsible for the detected activity requires further study.
