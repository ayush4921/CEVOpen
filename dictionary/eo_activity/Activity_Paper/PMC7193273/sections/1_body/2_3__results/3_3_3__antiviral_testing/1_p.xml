<p>All of the plant extracts (listed in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were tested against three different viruses i.e., yellow fever, chikungunya virus (CHIKV
 <bold>),</bold> and enterovirus 71. One-third of the plants were active against these viruses. Among them, 
 <italic>K. pinnata</italic> (EC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, SI = 4.29)
 <italic>, A. tomentosa</italic> (EC

 <italic>P. polyphylla</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.74 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, SI = 1.75) were active against CHIKV, 
 <italic>C. serratum</italic> was active against yellow fever virus, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, SI = 5.94) was active against enterovirus 71 (
