<p>Since there is a renewed interest in the search for plant-based medicines using traditional knowledge (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we tested eighteen crude ethanolic/methanolic plant extracts against a panel of microbes: two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>), four Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, S. enterica</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic>), and one fungal species: 
 <italic>Candida albicans.</italic> Out of these 18 plant extracts, those of 
 <italic>Clerodendrum serratum</italic>, 
 <italic>Sapindus mukorossi, Ampelocissus tomentosa, Dicrocephala integrifolia, Boerhavia diffusa</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhododendron arboreum, Justicia adhatoda</italic>, and 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> were active against a wide range of pathogens as crude extract at concentrations of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Upon further serial dilution of active plant extracts, most of the plant extracts (especially of 
 <italic>S. mukorossi and D. integrifolia</italic>) rapidly lost their activity. This might be due to low potency compounds, low concentrations of potent compounds, or coloured compounds in the extracts that interfere with spectrophotometric endpoints at high concentrations. However, some of the plant extracts, such as 
 <italic>A. tomentosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Aleuritopteris anceps</italic>, displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC of 35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 649 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC of 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 38 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively). Furthermore
 <italic>, R. arboreum</italic> and 
 <italic>J. adhatoda</italic> were found to be active against 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> (MIC of 285 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 326 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively) (
