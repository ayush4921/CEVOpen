<p>Efforts have been made to develop new vaccines against parasitic platyhelminthes and nematodes. Nonetheless, an efficient vaccine has not been successful because it fails to provide protective immunity. Given that no new effective anthelmintic compounds are becoming available, combined with the lack of a vaccine and emerging resistance problems against the currently available antiparasitic drugs, research into alternative sources of drugs is urgently needed. Since no human anthelmintics have been developed from plant sources so far, there is hope that new anthelmintic molecules can be found in plants that exhibit broad-spectrum activity, excellent safety, and therapeutic profiles and also display significant activity against different developmental stages of parasites [
