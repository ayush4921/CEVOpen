<p>Another major limitation in our study (due to time and financial constraints) is that we could only test methanolic/ethanolic plant extracts and single plant parts. Some bioactive constituents are preferably extracted by nonpolar solvents such as chloroform or hexane, or by mild polar solvents such as ethyl acetate. In our study, we only used one polar solvent (methanol) on 
 <italic>D. integrifolia</italic> and this might explain why we could not observe significant antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, despite this plant being used traditionally in the treatments of wound infections and other infectious ailments. The choice of an appropriate solvent is crucial for bioactivity. Solvents used in the extraction techniques and the extraction scheme change the quantity and the efficacy of the extracted phytoconstituents. For example, in the case of the famous antimalarial drug artemisinin, the hot water extract of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> was ineffective in rodent mouse models infected with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>, while the ether extract did show promising results.
