<p>Similarly, another important viral disease (yellow fever), transmitted by mosquito bites, causes sporadic outbreaks with a case fatality rate of 15â€“50%, with no known cure. Though effective vaccination is available against this disease, due to inadequate coverage of vaccination in African regions and threats of re-emergence in its endemic habitat, new drugs are urgently needed. In our study, we have found an interesting activity of 
 <italic>C. serratum</italic> against the yellow fever virus for the first time. Though anticonvulsant, antidiabetic, and antimalarial activity had already been reported on 
 <italic>C. serratum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], no one examined its activity against the yellow fever virus thus far. The development of new anti-yellow fever drugs from bioactive compounds obtained from these plants and the topical use of bioactive compounds present in 
 <italic>C. serratum</italic> such as lupeol and pellitorine might be explored for the prevention of virus infection through the bite of the mosquito vectors.
