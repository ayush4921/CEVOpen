<p>The GMP facility is responsible for the manufacturing, control, and release of the drug products, according to ATMP regulation. The product is then released and shipped to the CAR-T unit. CAR-T cells are shipped in the form of frozen cells to the clinical center. The pharmacy unit will receive, register, and handover the cells to the TE for temporary storing. The final process involves cell thawing for the administration to the patient. This step may be performed either by the TE that will provide the cells to the clinical unit or directly by the clinical unit.</p>
