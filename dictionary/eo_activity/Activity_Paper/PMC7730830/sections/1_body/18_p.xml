<p>Czernicka et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] looked for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors among 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> terpenoids. Diethyl-ether extract of fresh ginger rhizomes was shown to contain three bioactive compounds (ar-curcumene, α-sesquiphellandrene, and α-zingiberene). The authors searched for the best extraction technique. Hydrodistillation, supercritical fluid extraction, and shaking maceration yielded high amounts of the volatile components. To identify the potentially active inhibitors, the TLC-bioautography technique coupled with TLC-HPLC-MS approach was used by the authors.
