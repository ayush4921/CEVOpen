<p>A different problem was investigated by Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The authors looked for the effective compounds against mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which is the vector for arboviral diseases (dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya). They tested the 
 <italic>Connarus suberosus</italic> (a species common in the Cerrado biome in Brazil) root wood ethyl acetate extract and 28 compounds from the quinone class for development of a larvicide. Embelin and rapanone, isolated from the plant extract, were active against mosquito third-instar larvae. Eight quinones demonstrated larvicidal activity. Tectoquinone was the most active compound and was selected for formulation trials to develop a non-toxic prototype larvicide to control the mosquito development.
