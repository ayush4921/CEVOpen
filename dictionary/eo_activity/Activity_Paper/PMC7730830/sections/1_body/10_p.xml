<p>Kowalik et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] documented the influence of extracts from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Potentilla alba</italic>, differing in polarity, on human colon cancer cells and non-cancer colon epithelial cells. This plant species is used in Ukrainian medicine to reduce the blood level of thyroxin. In the present work, the authors revealed the cytotoxic properties of the extracts and their antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP tests). Importantly, the extracts showed opposite effects on the proliferation of cancer and normal cells.
