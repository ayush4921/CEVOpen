 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] isolated sesquiterpene (6-
 <italic>O</italic>-isobutyryl-britannilactone) with a high anti-melanogenesis activity from ethanolic extracts from flowers of 
 <italic>Inula britannica</italic>, a plant species widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It was confirmed that this compound was highly safe as no cytotoxicity was observed at high concentrations. Melanin production was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by this lactone (in vitro studies). A significant reduction in melanin biosynthesis was also observed in an in vivo model (zebrafish embryos). The authors discovered safe and effective natural compound for skin whitening and preventing abnormal hyperpigmentation.
