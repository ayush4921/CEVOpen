<p>Both extracts of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> revealed an increase in urine volume that appeared to vary with dose and nature of the extract. The aqueous extract produced a better diuretic effect compared to the 80% methanol extract, particularly with increasing dose, FSAE400 vs FSME100 (27.4%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and FSME200 (24.6%, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that the secondary metabolites responsible for increasing urine output could be more polar. In addition to the cumulative diuretic effect of the plant, the highest dose of aqueous extract produced significant diuresis at the third hour, showing the dose-dependent effect of the plant. This may also suggest that the maximal effect of the aqueous extract may reach at this time point.
