<p>Loop diuretics like furosemide increase urinary flow rate and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride by inhibiting Na

 <sup>−</sup> symporter and carbonic anhydrase enzyme.
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The result obtained from this study showed a marked excretory effect both on water and electrolytes, typical of saluretic diuretic types.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The larger doses of both extracts of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> produced similar diuresis and saluretic (Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>–</sup>) excretion profile to that of furosemide. The diuretic activity is considered to be good if the diuretic index is greater than 1.50, moderate if the values is between 1.00 and 1.50, mild if the values lies between 0.72 and 1.00 and nil if the value is &lt;0.72.
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Both extracts accordingly, at all doses, have shown a moderate diuretic activity as evidenced by the diuretic index values. The aqueous and 80% methanol extracts at 400 mg/kg displayed a diuretic activity of 97% and 92%, respectively, compared to the reference drug, furosemide (10 mg/kg).
