<p>Several studies have explained that flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids, tannins, alkaloids, and organic acids were responsible for the diuretic activity of a plant extract.

 <sub>1</sub>R antagonists.

Moreover a number of compounds including a flavone, 4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone-3-ol, were identified from leaf extract of this plant and, flavones are known by their effect of diuresis.
