<p>Five hundred grams of the pounded fresh leaves of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> were macerated with 1000 mL of 80% methanol and allowed to stand at room temperature for 72 h using shaker. Seventy-two hours later, the macerate was filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 1. The methanol was then evaporated from the extract under reduced pressure using Rota vapour (BUCHI Rota vapour R-200, Switzerland) at 40°C. The extract obtained was filtered and frozen at −20°C and lyophilized until dried. The yield of the dry extract was found to be 10.5% (w/w).
