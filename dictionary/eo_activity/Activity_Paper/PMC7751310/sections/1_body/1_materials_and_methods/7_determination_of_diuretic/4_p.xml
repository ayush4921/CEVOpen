<p>The following parameters were calculated in order to compare the effects of extracts with those of the vehicle and standard. The urinary excretion, independent of the animal weight, was computed as total urinary output divided by total liquid administered (formula −1). The ratio of urinary excretion in test group to urinary excretion in the control one was used as a measure of diuretic action of a given dose of an agent (formula −2). A parameter known as diuretic activity was also calculated as the ratio of diuretic action of the extracts in the test group to that of the standard drug (formula – 3)
