<p>The second node of each plant was used to determine stem cell width and length. The 2nd node was excised from the stem and sectioned by using CS-05W Crimping cross-section monitor (Ushiyama Denki, LTD). Cross and longitude sections were directly observed under DN-200 Digital Microscope. Cells width and length were measured by the Scope Image 9.0 software (by Bioimager, Inc.). Values shown in
