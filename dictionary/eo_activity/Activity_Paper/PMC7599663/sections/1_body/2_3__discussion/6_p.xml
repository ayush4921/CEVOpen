<p>Besides 
 <italic>pal</italic>, chalcone synthase (
 <italic>chs</italic>) is also involved in the polyphenol synthesis pathway, which synthesized chalcone naringenin backbone from a molecule of CoA-ester type of cinnamic acid (e.g., coumaric or ferulic acid) and three molecules of malonyl-CoA. Many previous studies have shown that 
 <italic>chs</italic> gene can be induced by both biotic and abiotic stresses such as light/UV light or by circadian rhythms. Thain et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported that the active rhyme of 
 <italic>chs</italic> gene was different from other genes related to photosynthesis, especially genes coding for enzyme chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (CAB), which constituted the photosynthetic complex. 
 <italic>chs</italic> expression occurred earlier than that of the 
 <italic>cab</italic> gene, which transcriptional level usually was higher at the end of the dark cycle, just before the plant is exposed to light. Together with the previously published results, it has hypothesized that the expression of 
 <italic>chs</italic> during the dark period might be a preparation for the polyphenol accumulation, which will be utilized by plants in the daylight [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In this study, we found that, at the transcription level, the 
 <italic>chs</italic> gene expression in 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> grown under different LED conditions was lower than that under FL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01344-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). This might be influenced by the sample collected time (daytime), since the 
 <italic>chs</italic> gene was only high expression at the end of the dark cycle.
