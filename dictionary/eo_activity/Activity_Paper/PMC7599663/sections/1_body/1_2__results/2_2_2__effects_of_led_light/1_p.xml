<p>Our results showed that not only wavelength type, but the ratio also influenced flavonoid accumulation in 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic>. The red wavelength caused a decrease in the total flavonoid contents by 1.25 mg/g, compared to the control (1.56 mg/g) (

 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> plants, about 1.81 mg/g compared to 1.56, 1.25, and 1.44 mg/g in the FL, red, and blue LEDs, respectively (

On the other hand, the BRW142 induced the lowest total flavonoid contents (1.06 mg/g) compared to the control, followed by BRW151 (1.14 mg/g), red light (1.24 mg/g), and blue light (1.43 mg/g), while BR strikingly exerted the highest flavonoid contents by 1.81 mg/g. Overall, among all LEDs treatments, BR light has significantly enhanced the flavonoid contents than other light treatments.
