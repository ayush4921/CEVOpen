<p>Moreover, cardol (5-pentadecyl resorcinol) was the major compound identified in a fraction of SBP, exhibiting cytotoxicity against human colon, liver, gastric, lung, and breast cancer cell lines [

Kustiawan et al. also found that cardol isolated from SBP has been used to treat human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, induced changes in cell morphology, increased the expression of apoptotic proteins (caspase-3 and caspase-9) and also cleavage of pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) [
