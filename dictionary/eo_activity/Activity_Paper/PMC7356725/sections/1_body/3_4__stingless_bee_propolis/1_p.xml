<p>Propolis (a resin-like substance, colloquially known as bee glue) is a substance that bees produce by mixing salivary secretions, beeswax, pollen and other resins harvested from botanical sources, mainly trees [

 <italic>Melipona fasciculata</italic> and 
 <italic>Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides</italic>) and it is mixed with additional material (soil or clay) [

 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> propolis, studies have also shown that SBP has higher antimicrobial activities [
