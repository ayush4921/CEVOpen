While Kothai and Jayanthi have synthesized silver nanoparticles using SBP mediated green synthesis, and the produced nanoparticles exhibited significant anticancer activity against human lung cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B101-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to study the efficiency of SBH too in the green synthesis for nanoparticles used as a treatment. Furthermore, we hypothesis that using SBH in nano-size formulations as an immune booster would be a promising approach for inflammatory-based conditions in the future. Since previous studies have shown that the effective nanoparticle size to target immune cells is approximately 50 nm [
