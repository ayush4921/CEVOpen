<p>Stingless bees produce their honey and store it in small resin pots in the hive. In traditional practices, honey pots were commonly squeezed to obtain the honey [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This method led to several disadvantages such as damaging the pot and reducing the productivity of the bees. In fact, honey obtained by squeezing the pot produced SBH contaminated with bee bread, which promoted souring of the honey and produced inconsistent honey products [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To overcome this, current practices in stingless beekeeping promote the hiving method with a monolayer honey pot induction system that utilizes suction pumps to aspirate the honey pot by pot without damaging the pots [

However, so far there are no standard methods for harvesting other stingless bee products. Beekeepers harvest each of these products by removing it directly from the hive. Menezes et al. have suggested a good method for harvesting unfermented pollen from stingless bees by moving a colony of stingless bees to a another location and stimulate the foragers to accept a new hive, build new pots and leaving the old hive empty [
