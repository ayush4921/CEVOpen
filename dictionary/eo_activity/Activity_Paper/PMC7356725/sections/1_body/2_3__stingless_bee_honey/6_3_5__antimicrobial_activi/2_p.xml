<p>Another characteristic of SBH resides in the lower invertase (breaks down sucrose into fructose and glucose) and sucrose levels than 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey, which has been suggested to have a strong inhibitory effect on four Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>B. subtilis, M. luteus, B. megaterium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. brevis</italic>, and two Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. syringae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings were supported by another study that compared the antimicrobial inhibitory effects of Ethiopian SBH, 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey and the most common antibiotics (vancomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin, ampicillin and methicillin) against 
 <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, this study has shown that the inhibitory effects of SBH against all these bacterial strains were stronger than the effects of 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> honey and the antibiotics tested. Altogether, these interesting results suggest that SBH can be a promising candidate towards novel treatments for inflammatory conditions dependent on microbial growth. The microorganisms that have, so far, been examined following treatment with SBH are summarized in
