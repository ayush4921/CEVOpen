<p>Potent novel antimicrobials are also of interest to treat biofilms. The antibiofilm properties of a total of 57 SBHs were examined along with Medihoney
 <sup>Â®</sup> (an antibacterial wound gel) as a reference and showed an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation in one species of honey, 
 <italic>Tetragonisca angustula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, the identified honeys were able to destroy a 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm, mediated by two proteins, 
 <italic>T. angustula</italic> biofilm destruction factor-1 (TABDF-1) and TABDF-2 [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These results indicate that certain honey species may be suited to develop for anti-biofilm applications and even novel wound dressings for specific (i.e., 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) infections. In another study using 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected wounds, SBH (
 <italic>Trigona</italic>) was shown to synergize with the antibiotic ampicillin to inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There was also higher bactericidal activity in the combined treatment, compared to either agent alone, including antibiotic-resistant strains [
