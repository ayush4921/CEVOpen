<p>In addition to the conventional common properties of SBH that were mentioned above, a recent study showed that one of the components of SBH (i.e., phenylalanine) may be able to trigger the upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (
 <italic>BDNF</italic>) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 (
 <italic>ITPR1</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B78-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Therefore, SBH displayed capabilities in improving spatial working memory, spatial reference memory and memory consolidations. Another study also suggested that SBH improves memory and reduces anxiety, in addition to its potential to reduce triglyceride, LDL, and normalize blood glucose in rats with metabolic syndrome [
