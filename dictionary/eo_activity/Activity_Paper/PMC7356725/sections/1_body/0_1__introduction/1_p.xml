<p>Stingless bees (
 <italic>Meliponines</italic>) belong to the genus Apidae, which is a family of social bees from the superfamily Apoidea. Stingless bees are the highest developed species of bees that have been identified in 80 million years old parts of amber [

 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hand collecting honey bees was an important traditional practice in many ancient populations as it was the only way to get honey and it still persists among some people in forest areas [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date there are more than 500 known stingless bee species, of which approximately 40 species have good potential as honey producers [

 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These species are distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions as follows: approximately 391 species in the Neotropical region of South America, 60 in the Indo-Malayan region of Asia, 50 in the Paleotropical region of Africa and 10 in the Australasia region of Australia [
