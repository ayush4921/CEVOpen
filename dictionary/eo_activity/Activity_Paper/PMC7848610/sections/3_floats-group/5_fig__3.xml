  <p>Measure of astrocyte survival following hypoxic treatment. (a) Effect on survival of astrocytes after 3 h exposure to (i) normoxicor (ii) anoxic conditions. (b) Effect on survival of astrocyte after 6 h of (i) normoxic or (ii) anoxic conditions. Each bar is expressed as mean Â± SD (n = 3). Significance with student 
   <italic>t</italic>-test indicated **p &lt; 0.01. All the cells that appeared red (bright or dull) are dead cells while most of the green cells are live cells. Some cells which appeared green but had round shape were counted as dead cell because the round shape indicated that cells were dying. Green cells with altered star-shape were the astrocytes that have lost their morphology and were counted as live cells.
