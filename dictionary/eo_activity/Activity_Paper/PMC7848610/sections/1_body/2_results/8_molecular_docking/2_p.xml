 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows that the 4 ligands (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) possess good binding potential towards hGS. Aridanin showed the best binding potential with a minimum binding energy of -8.6 Kcal/mol, followed by naringenin (-8.3 kcal/mol), scopoletin (-7.1 kcal/mol), and ferulic acid (-6.4 kcal/mol). The binding affinity of the ligands having the lowest RMSD value (zero for upper bound and lower bound RMSD) with hGS showed a good binding pose and was considered and documented. Docking conformation was only analyzed for aridanin because unlike the other compounds, aridanin, a triterpenoid saponin, is a marker compound of 
 <italic>Tetrapleura tetraptera</italic> and it has the best binding affinity with hGS. The result of docking analysis of aridanin from PLIP (
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) explicated its interactions with hGS through the formation of ten hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residues TRP 130, GLU 134, ALA 191, ASN 194, GLN 205, PRO 208, ASN 255 and TYR 336 (
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), two hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with amino acids GLY 132 and SER 257 (
 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and one salt bridge formation with the amino acid residue ARG 319 (
 <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).
