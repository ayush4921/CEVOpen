 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Also, MMP contributes to determining the driving force for calcium entry into the mitochondria and the extent of ROS production [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Under hypoxic condition, the mitochondria of astrocytes like other cells, are vulnerable to the production of free radicals that leads to the reduction in ATP generation which could result in cellular damage as observed in mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, pretreatment of astrocytes with TT increased the MMP of astrocytes subjected to anoxia probably by increasing the energy capacity of the inner mitochondrial membrane and attenuating oxidative stress. Zorova et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] posited that the higher the MMP, the higher the synthesis of ATP, since the energy capacity of the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes high. Therefore, a decrease in MMP will cause a reduction in mitochondrial ROS, however, this decrease must not be sustained inappropriately. Sustained inappropriate low levels of MMP could lead to reductive stress which is as detrimental as oxidative stress to mitochondrial homeostasis [
