 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and their integrity is therefore of utmost importance. During oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthase uses mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) to produce ATP [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MMP provides the driving force for the production of cellular energy in the mitochondria, making ATP a compound buffering MMP. In hypoxic conditions, oxidative phosphorylation is halted, ATP generation is arrested and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [
