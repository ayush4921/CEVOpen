<p id="par0210">Cells were seeded into groups as previously described. After treatment, cells were stained with 2.5 mg/mL JC-1 at 37
 <sup>ยบ</sup>C for 15 min. Thereafter, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and the dye was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for another 10 min before imaging using an Invitrogen Floid microscope (Fisher Scientific, Sweden). Stained polarized mitochondria were detected with red fluorescence while the loss of mitochondrial integrity was detected with green fluorescence. The fluorescence was read on a plate reader (Infinite 200Pro Tecan, Switzerland) with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and the absorbance at 530 nm and 590 nm. The JC-1 fluorescence values were first normalized separately to their respective controls for red and green signals before the relative MMP was calculated.
