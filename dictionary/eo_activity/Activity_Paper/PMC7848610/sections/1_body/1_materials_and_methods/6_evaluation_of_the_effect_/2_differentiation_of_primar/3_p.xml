<p id="par0135">Briefly, isolated neural stem cells (NSCs) were cultured in poly-
 <sc>d</sc>-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) coated culture dishes in neurobasal media (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). The media was supplemented with Neural Survival Factor-1, N2 supplement, bovine serum albumin, glutamine, 25 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), penicillin and streptomycin solutions, and gentamycin. The expression of neural stem cell markers, SRY-Box Transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and Nestin, and lineage-specific markers, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) were assessed for NSCs characterization using western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Almost 99 % of fNSCs showed immunoreactivity towards SOX2 and Nestin, and were negative for both GFAP and MAP2. Differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes was achieved by withdrawing neurobasal media and growing NSCs in miminum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained in MEM with FBS for atleast 21 days before using them for the experiments. Following trypsinization at the confluency of 80â€“90 %, cells were seeded for experiments in 8 well chamber slides or 12 well plates.
