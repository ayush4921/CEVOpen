<p id="par0230">Human glutamine synthetase was optimized for protein-ligand interaction studies by deleting all hetero atoms, ligands, and water molecules using Chimera software. The protein and ligands were loaded onto PyRx software in preparation for docking. The amino acid residue in the binding pocket, which includes the active site of hGS [
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] was selected along with the ligands and toggled to set the grid parameters. The three-dimensional affinity grid parameters were set at 19.120, -13.908, -34.861 (x, y, z respectively) on the geometric center of the target protein and 40.177, 35.676, 36.044 (x, y, z respectively) as dimensions (Ǻ). Autodock vina from PyRx was used in docking the ligands into the binding pocket of the protein to get the binding energy data. Protein-ligand complex was generated using PyMol software in PDB format, the complex was uploaded on “Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (
