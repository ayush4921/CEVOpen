<p id="par0225">Out of the compounds that were quantified from TT by HPLC, the most abundant phytochemical compounds from four different classes of phytoconstituents, namely, aridanin (saponin), ferulic acid (phenolic acid), naringenin (flavonoid), and scopoletin (coumarin) were selected as ligands (except aridanin which was selected based on the premise that it is a marker compound of
