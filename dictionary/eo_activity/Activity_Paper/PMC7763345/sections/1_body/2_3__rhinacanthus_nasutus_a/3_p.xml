<p>Herbal remedies and traditional medicines for the treatment of cognitive decline have been used for centuries, and many have been shown to have positive effects on neurons in a laboratory setting, such as

 <italic>Mucuna pruriens</italic> [

 <italic>Bacopa monnieri</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. 
 <italic>Rn</italic> is lesser known for its neuroprotective effects; however, there has been much research suggesting that it could be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disease [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that 
 <italic>Rn</italic> has potent antioxidant effects in cultured neuronal cell lines subjected to hypoxia [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and that 
 <italic>Rn</italic> can counteract the cytotoxic effects of glutamate and amyloid-β (Aβ) [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We, therefore, hypothesized a reactive oxygen species inhibiting model (

 <italic>Rn</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Many other studies have shown that 
 <italic>Rn</italic> possesses potent antioxidant effects, with the crude leaf extract showing similar free radical scavenging properties to the standard Trolox and prevent reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced hemolysis of red blood cells [
