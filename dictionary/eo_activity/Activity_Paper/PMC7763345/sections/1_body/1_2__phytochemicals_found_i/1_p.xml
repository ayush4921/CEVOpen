 <italic>Rn</italic> has been identified as an important medicinal plant due to its medicinal properties for various disease conditions. This has led to the characterizing of the active ingredients responsible for exhibiting these medicinal properties (
 <xref rid="nutrients-12-03776-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Kodama et al. 1993 has reported the isolation of a naphthopyran derivative 3,4-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-2H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-5,10-dione which also possess antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several phytochemicals including β-amyrin, glutinol, lupeol, stimasterol, sitosterol, umbelliferone, 2-methylanthraquinone, wogonin, oroxylin A, (+)-praeruptorin, p-hydroxy benzaldehyde, methyl vanillate, syringaldehyde, Dehydro-α-lapachone and novel compounds rhinacanthin A-D, G-Q, (RnA-D and RnG-Q) rhinacanthone, 4-acetonyl-3,5-dimethoxy-p-quinol have been isolated by Wu et al. 1998 from the roots, stem and leaves of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> [

 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rhinacanthin S (RnS) and RnA isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> showed acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity, respectively [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. RnC has also been found to attenuate renal oxidative stress and protect against streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic nephropathy in rats [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Based on the antiviral property of the plant, several research groups have succeeded in isolating and examining the activity of phytochemicals from the roots and aerial parts of 
 <italic>R. nasutus</italic>. Sendl et al. 1996 has reported the isolation of two naphthoquinones, RnC and RnD, from the whole plant and their antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The lignans Rhinacanthin E and F (RnE and RnF) isolated from the aerial part of the plant have been reported to have significant activity against the influenza virus under in vitro conditions [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An antiviral study by Ngoc et al. 2019 with a novel naphthoquinone analog rhinacasutone and seven other known compounds like rhinacanthone, RnC, RnD, RnN, RnQ and RnE and heliobuphthalmin indicated that RnC, RnD, RnN and RnQ exhibit significant antiviral activity against influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (PR8), Anti-Human Rhinovirus 1B (HRV1B), and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Kwak et al. 2018 has isolated trans O-coumaric acid, 2,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, p-hydroxy phenethyl trans-ferulate, 2,3-bis[(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-1,4-butanediol,8,8′-bisdihydrosiringenin glucoside, dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol-4-β-D-glucoside and (-)-dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol from the aerial parts of the plant. Among which, 2,3-bis[(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-1,4-butanediol and 8,8′-bisdihydrosiringenin glucoside were found to have significant neuraminidase inhibitory activity [
