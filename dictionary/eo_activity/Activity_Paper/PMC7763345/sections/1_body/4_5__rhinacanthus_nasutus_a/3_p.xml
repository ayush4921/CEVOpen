<p>One of the complex events leading to diabetes is the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). AGEâ€™s are the products of the Maillard reaction wherein the proteins are glycated when exposed to sugar molecules, as well as from the degradation products of glucose like methylglyoxal, glycolaldehyde, 3-deoxyglucosone and acts as an important biomarker in diabetes. Elevated levels of AGEs are considered as one of the risk factors for the damage occurring to pancreatic beta cells that secrete insulin [
