<p>Other than reducing the glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol level, administration of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> can also stimulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα), fat adiponectin, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) protein expression [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Expression of PPARα and GLUT4 are highly downregulated in individuals affected with diabetes, and both play a major role in the regulation of glucose, lipid metabolism and transports glucose from the circulation into insulin-sensitive cells, respectively [

 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. PPAR agonists were also found to improve against insulin resistance and to reduce the level of TG and glucose [

 <italic>Rn</italic> extract administration could be the reason behind its antidiabetic effect. Further, the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of RnC by in silico approach suggests that the phytochemical is devoid of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and non-toxic, suggesting it is safe to use as an antidiabetic drug [
