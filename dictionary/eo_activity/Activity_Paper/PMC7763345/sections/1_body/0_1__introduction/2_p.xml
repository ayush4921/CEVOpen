<p>Several reports have revealed the folklore and traditional medicinal practices using 
 <italic>Rn</italic> ranging from antioxidant, antimicrobial to anticancer and neuroprotectant. The rhinacanthin-rich leaf extract has been reported to have antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. mutans, S. epidermidis, P. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Traditional usage of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> in the treatment of skin diseases caused by fungi has been reported, showing that the leaf extract has fungicidal activity by acting on the cell wall causing its degeneration and death [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The leaf extract of the plant also showed significant larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti</italic> and prevented the emergence of larvae to adults [

 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Further, a formulation containing root extract of the plant has also been prepared for the control of mosquito vectors [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Rn</italic> was found to exhibit significant antioxidant activity in cell-free in vitro studies as well could ameliorate oxidative stress and improve the antioxidant status in experimental rats [

 <xref rid="B10-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, methanol extract of the root was reported to exhibit a cytotoxic effect against oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and promyelocytic leukemia cells while showing lower-level cytotoxicity to normal cells [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ethanolic extract of the plant was shown to exhibit hepatoprotective activity against aflatoxin B1 induced toxicity in Wistar rats by enhancing the glutathione level and modulating the activity of serum enzymes [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, the root extract inhibited lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation by reducing the level of nitric oxide (NO) in RAW264.7 macrophage cells [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-12-03776" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, 
 <italic>Rn</italic> root extract has also been reported to have a neuroprotective effect against hypoxia as well as glutamate-induced cell death in HT22 cells by bringing back the redox homeostasis [
