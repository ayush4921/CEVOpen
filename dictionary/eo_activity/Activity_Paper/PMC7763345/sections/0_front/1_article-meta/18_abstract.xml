  <italic>Rhinacanthus nasutus</italic> (L.) Kurz (Acanthaceae) (
  <italic>Rn</italic>) is an herbaceous shrub native to Thailand and much of South and Southeast Asia. It has several synonyms and local or common names. The root of 
  <italic>Rn</italic> is used in Thai traditional medicine to treat snake bites, and the roots and/or leaves can be made into a balm and applied to the skin for the treatment of skin infections such as ringworm, or they may be brewed to form an infusion for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. 
  <italic>Rn</italic> leaves are available to the public for purchase in the form of “tea bags” as a natural herbal remedy for a long list of disorders, including diabetes, skin diseases (antifungal, ringworm, eczema, scurf, herpes), gastritis, raised blood pressure, improved blood circulation, early-stage tuberculosis antitumor activity, and as an antipyretic. There have been many studies investigating the roles of 
  <italic>Rn</italic> or compounds isolated from the herb regarding diseases such as Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and infection with bacteria, fungi or viruses. There have, however, been no clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of 
  <italic>Rn</italic> in the treatment of any of these disorders, and the safety of these teas over long periods of consumption has never been tested. This review assesses the recent research into the role of 
  <italic>Rn</italic> and its constituent compounds in a range of diseases.
