  <p>The second group is related to herbal antimicrobial agents, such as clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallows, and garlic. These biomaterials can act as free radical scavengers and can therefore block the production of ROS. A brief list of essential biomaterials that can act as antimicrobial agents without any toxicity is shown in
