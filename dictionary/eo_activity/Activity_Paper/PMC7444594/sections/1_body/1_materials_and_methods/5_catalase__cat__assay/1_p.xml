<p>Catalase activity was measured by homogenizing the aerial parts and fruit samples prepared in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8), EDTA (0.1 mM) and DTT (1 mM). CAT was assessed according to the method used by [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The activity was measured in a solution containing 59 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.1 ml enzyme extract. At 240 nm decrease in absorbance was recorded after interval of 20 seconds. Change in absorbance of 0.01 per min defined CAT activity of one unit. Enzyme activity was expressed on a fresh weight basis.
