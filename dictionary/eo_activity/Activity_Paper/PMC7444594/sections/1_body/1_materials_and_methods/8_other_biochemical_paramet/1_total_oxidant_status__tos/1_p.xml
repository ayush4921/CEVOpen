<p>The method of [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] was used to determined TOS. The assay is established on ferrous ion oxidation into ferric ion. The presence of oxidants in the sample in acidic medium and ferric ion measurement produced by xylenol orange was measured/observed [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The assay is based on two mixtures R1 (stock xylenol orange solution (0.38g in 500μL of 25Mm H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) 0.4g NaCl, 500 μL glycerol and volume up to 50Ml with 25mM H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4,</sub> sample extract and R2 (0.0317 g o-dianisidine, 0.0196 g ferrous ammonium sulphate (II). Absorption measured at 560nm after 5 minutes by using a spectrophotometer.
