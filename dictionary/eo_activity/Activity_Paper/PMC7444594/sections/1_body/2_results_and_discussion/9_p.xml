 <italic>pentandrus</italic> var. 
 <italic>pterophorus</italic>. The main carotenoids such as zeaxanthin, b-carotene, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin as well as lycopene are prepared synthetically in nutraceutical industry [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Furthermore, Lycopene is suggested as one of the efficient carotenoids group for quenching ability. The plants used in the current study detected pigments in Zygophyllaceae taxa can be characterized for the above mentioned applications which can be utilized as supplements or medicines.
