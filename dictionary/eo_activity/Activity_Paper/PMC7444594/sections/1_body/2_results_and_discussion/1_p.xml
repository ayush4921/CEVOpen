<p>The present study is based on the analysis of biological activities of extracts from thirteen plant species of Zygophyllaceae, remarkably important angiosperm family with many taxa being used in folk medicines. There is a scarcity of data in the literature about these plants. As such making a comparison of the results obtained in the present studies was difficult. Nonetheless, a few papers reported some biological activities of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>terrestris</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>harmala</italic>, and few species of 
 <italic>Fagonia</italic>. The present investigation explores the presence of enzymatic constituents such as SOD, POD, APX, CAT, esterase, alpha amylase, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and other phytochemicals like AsA, TOS, TAC, TSP, TPC, TF, tannins and pigments. Selected plants also provided evidence for the anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory potential of varying extent in seeds and aerial parts. The difference in pro-oxidants and antioxidants causes oxidative stress and chronic diseases in the body [

 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. POD helps in scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing cell oxidative injury [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The highest values of peroxidase and catalase were depicted in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>harmala</italic> (2597.8±0.4 units/g f. wt. and 555.0±5.0 units/g f. wt., respectively) as shown in S1a and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231612.s001">S1B Fig</xref>, respectively. Plant species having high antioxidant activities can be utilized for different therapeutic applications for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced diseases.
