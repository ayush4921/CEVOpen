<p>Cordyceps coffee beans were prepared and provided by Coffeesidae Co., Ltd. (Hanam, Korea) as detailed in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Phellinus mushroom powder diluted in 5 times (w/w) 
 <italic>d</italic>-water at 80∼90°C for 3 h and filtered. Chaga mushroom powder diluted in 5 times (w/w) 
 <italic>d</italic>-water at 50∼ 60°C for 12 h. Phellinus mushroom and Chaga mushroom extracts were mixed at the ratio of 6:4 (w/w). Cordyceps mushroom powder was mixed with 3 times (w/ w) 
 <italic>d</italic>-water, and the Phellinus and Chaga mushroom extract mixture were added at a ratio of 6:4. Protease mix (M/A=1:1) was then added [3% (w/w)] to the mixture, and reactions were incubated for 5 days at 50°C. The mixture was then extracted with 3 times (w/w) 
 <italic>d</italic>-water for 6 h at 70∼80°C, and filtered to obtain the final Cordyceps complex. The dried coffee beans were immersed in the above Cordyceps complex at a ratio of 2:1 (w/w) for 3 days at 25∼33°C. Since the Cordyceps complex was almost completely absorbed into the green coffee beans without residuals, the beans were dried in a hot air dryer (60°C) without additional filtration. The beans were dried until they reached a moisture content of 12%, which was measured by checking every 30 min after the first 18 h of drying.
