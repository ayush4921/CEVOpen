  <italic>Measurement of α-glucan</italic>:
 </bold> To quantify α-glucan, 0.1 mL and 2 mL ice-cold 2 M KOH were added to a tube and mixtures were stirred using a magnetic stirrer in an ice-water bath for 20 min to dissolve the starch/glycogen. Eight milliliters of 1.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8) was then added and mixed using a vortex. A total of 0.2 mL of amyloglucosidase (1,630 U/mL) and invertase (500 U/ mL) (Megazyme assay kit, Cat. No. K-YBGL, Megazyme Inc.) was immediately added and mixed, and the tubes were incubated at 40°C in a water bath for 30 min. After centrifuging the mixture at 11,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min, 0.1 mL of the supernatant was removed and added to 0.1 mL of 200 mM sodium acetate buffer and 3 mL of GOPOD and the mixture was incubated at 40°C for 20 min. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm.
