<p>In this study, we developed a functional coffee from the medicinal mushrooms Cordyceps, Phellinus, and Chaga. We used Cordyceps as the main raw material; however, when Cordyceps raw materials are simply mixed with coffee powder or when the extracts are added to espressos, the coffee aroma is hindered by the unpleasant scent of Cordyceps, which decreases the desirability of the coffee to the consumer. During preliminary experiments, we selected Phellinus and Chaga mushrooms as ancillary ingredients, because these mushrooms could suppress the scent of Cordyceps and provided the functional component β-glucan to the coffee. Finally, we applied a new pretreatment process to the green coffee bean itself using the three mushrooms, which successively produced a functional coffee containing high levels of Cordycepin and β-glucan without an undesirable aroma. The process of development, quality characteristics and biological activities of our Cordyceps coffee are reported in this study.</p>
