<p>The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> (NCBI No. NK9714231) was found to possess a total length 156,533 bp and had the circular structure. It was the typical quadripartite structure the same as many plants, including 87,437 bp large single-copy region (LSC), 18,096 bp small single-copy region (SSC) of and a pair of 25,500 bp inverted repeat (IR) regions. The total of 132 genes was successfully annotated, which contained 87 protein-coding genes, 37 transfer 
 <italic>RNA</italic> genes, and 8 ribosomal 
 <italic>RNA</italic> genes. Here, 19 genes were found in one of the IR, which included eight protein-coding genes (
 <italic>rps19</italic>, 
 <italic>rpl2</italic>, 
 <italic>rpl23</italic>, 
 <italic>ycf2</italic>, 
 <italic>ndhB</italic>, 
 <italic>rps7</italic>, 
 <italic>rps12</italic>, and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>), seven 
 <italic>tRNA</italic> genes (
 <italic>trnI-CAU</italic>, 
 <italic>trnL-CAA</italic>, 
 <italic>trnV-GAC</italic>, 
 <italic>trnI-GAU</italic>, 
 <italic>trnA-UGC</italic>, 
 <italic>trnR-ACG</italic>, and 
 <italic>trnN-GUU</italic>) and four 
 <italic>rRNA</italic> genes (
 <italic>rrn16</italic>, 
 <italic>rrn23</italic>, 
 <italic>rrn4.5</italic>, and 
 <italic>rrn5</italic>). The overall nucleotide composition of chloroplast genome sequence is: 31.5% (A), 32.1% (T), 18.5% (C), 17.9% (G), and the total GC content of 36.4%, respectively.
