  <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> is an important and widely distributed medicinal and edible plant, which has great economic value in the medical and food industries in the whole world. The complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> was found to possess a total length 156,533 bp and had the circular structure. It was the typical quadripartite structure the same as many plants, including 87,437 bp large single-copy region (LSC), 18,096 bp small single-copy region (SSC) of and a pair of 25,500 bp inverted repeat (IR) regions. The total of 132 genes was successfully annotated, which contained 87 protein-coding genes, 37 transfer 
  <italic>RNA</italic> genes, and eight ribosomal 
  <italic>RNA</italic> genes. Nineteen genes were found in one of IR, which included eight protein-coding gene, seven 
  <italic>tRNA</italic> genes, and four 
  <italic>rRNA</italic> genes. The overall nucleotide composition of chloroplast genome sequence is: 31.5% (A), 32.1% (T), 18.5% (C), 17.9% (G), and the total GC content of 36.4%. The phylogenetic analysis result showed that 
  <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> was close to 
  <italic>Carnegiea gigantean in</italic> the phylogenetic relationship by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method in this study.
