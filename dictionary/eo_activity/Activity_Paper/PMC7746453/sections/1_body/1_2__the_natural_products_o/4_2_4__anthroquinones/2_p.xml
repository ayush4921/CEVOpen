 <bold>43</bold>) were isolated from mangrove-derived aciduric fungus 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. and inhibited HBsAg secretion more effectively than that of the positive control, 3TC, in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with 13% inhibition by 3TC, compounds 
 <bold>36</bold> and 
 <bold>42</bold> at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M inhibited HBeAg secretion by 17 and 35%, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>36</bold> showed much stronger antihepatitis B virus activity than that of the positive control, lamivudine, strongly inhibiting the secretion on HBsAg and HBeAg of HepG 2.2.15 cells. These results showed that extremophiles are a valuable resource of bioactive compounds, and that pH regulation is an effective strategy to induce metabolite production in aciduric fungi [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found that 1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (
 <bold>44</bold>), Rubiadin (
 <bold>45</bold>), and Anthraquinone bile acid conjugates (
 <bold>46</bold>) have significant anti-HBV effects on HepG2.2.15 cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of them were 12.41, 8.03, 17.05, and 8.13 g/mL, respectively. When the drug concentrations were 8 g/mL, the inhibitory rates of HBeAg were 61.42%, 43.79%, and 69.30%, respectively. The inhibitory rates of HBsAg secreted by cells were 6.15%, 23.34%, and 43.38%, respectively. Particularly, compound 
 <bold>45</bold> could not only significantly decrease HBeAg and HBsAg secretion level and inhibit HBV-DNA replication but also inhibit the proliferation of the cells and HBx protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, which might become a novel anti-HBV drug candidate. Mohammad K et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported that anti-HBV potential of AV-derived anthroquinones, possibly via HBV-DNA polymerase inhibition for the first time. Although aloin B 
 <bold>(47)</bold> exhibited novel antiviral effect, aloe-emodin (
 <bold>48</bold>) appeared as the most promising anti-HBV natural drug with CYP3A4 activating property towards its enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Lan et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] found that hypericin 
 <bold>(49)</bold> could significantly reduce the expression of HBV-DNA and the expression level of HBsAg and HBeAg, which was similar to lamivudine, 3TC. The chemical structures of compounds 
 <bold>36</bold>~49 are shown in
