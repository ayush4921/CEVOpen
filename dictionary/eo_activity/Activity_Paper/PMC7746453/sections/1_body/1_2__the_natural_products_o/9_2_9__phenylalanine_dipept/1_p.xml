<p>Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] isolated and modified the phenylalanine dipeptide Matijin-Su (
 <bold>133</bold>) with anti-HBV activity from 
 <italic>Dichondra repens</italic> Forst, and four derivatives were screened with anti-HBV activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] found that compound 
 <bold>101</bold> could inhibit the replication of HBV-DNA, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.33 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, and inhibit the replication of various mutant HBV strains. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] synthesized a series of MTS derivatives with anti-HBV activity by the design of the Matijin-Su (MTS). One of the preferred MTS derivatives (Y101) was conducted in the clinical preclinical study and received the clinical approval of the CFDA.
