<p>Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] found that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Piper longum</italic> L. fruit had good anti-HBV effect, and erythro-1-[1-oxo-9(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-8,9-dihydroxy-2
 <italic>E</italic>-nonenyl]-piperidine (
 <bold>98</bold>), threo-1-[1-oxo-9(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-8,9-dihydroxy-2
 <italic>E</italic>-nonenyl]-piperidine (
 <bold>99</bold>), piperine (
 <bold>100</bold>), guineesine (
 <bold>101</bold>), and (2
 <italic>E</italic>,4
 <italic>E</italic>)-N-isobutyleicosa-2,4-dienamide (
 <bold>102</bold>) had significant inhibitory effect on the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg on HepG 2.2.15 cells. 3
 <italic>β</italic>,4
 <italic>α</italic>-dihydroxy-1-(3-phenylpropanoyl)-piperidine-2-one (
 <bold>103</bold>), isolated from 
 <italic>P. longum</italic> ethanol extract, had significant anti-HBV activity and could inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.80 and 0.21 mM, respectively. The selectivity of compound 
 <bold>103</bold> on HBeAg inhibition was up to 16.4, which was better than that of positive drug, 3TC, and has a good development prospect [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Zeng et al. [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] obtained a quaternary ammonium alkaloid DHCH (
 <bold>104</bold>) from 
 <italic>Corydalis saxicola</italic> Bunting, which could significantly inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg on HepG2.2.15 cells, with TI of 7.32 and 6.77, respectively. Further study showed that compound 
 <bold>104</bold> could reduce the levels of cccDNA and DNA in dose and time dependence manner, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.08, 7.62, and 8.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. The chemical structures of compounds 
 <bold>98</bold>~104 are shown in
