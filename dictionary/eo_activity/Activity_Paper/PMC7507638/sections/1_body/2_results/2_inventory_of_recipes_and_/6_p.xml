<p id="Par47">The most frequently cited species were 
 <italic>Pteleopsis suberosa</italic> Engl. &amp; Diels, 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> L., 
 <italic>Cyanthillium cinereum</italic> (L.) H. Rob, 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke with respectively 29.36, 26.61 and 22.94% citation frequencies respectively. The most frequently mentioned species did not necessarily belong in order to the most represented botanical families. Their respective frequencies of involvement in the composition of the recipes (Cpr) were 25.81, 23.39, 20.00, 20.00 and 20.00% respectively and their pairs of relative loyalty indices (herbalists/Traditional healers) were (93.75%; 6.25%), (89.66%; 10.34%), (100.00%; 00.00%), (68.00%; 32.00%) and (96.00%; 4.00%) respectively. Among these species, 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> L. was the only plant strongly cited by both market herbalists (66,67%) and traditional healers (33,33%) and involved in about 20% of the recipes provided (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Also, it should be noted that even if 
 <italic>Cyanthillium cinereum</italic> (L.) H. Rob and 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke seem to be two species widely used by herbalists, traditional healers did not use them so frequently.
