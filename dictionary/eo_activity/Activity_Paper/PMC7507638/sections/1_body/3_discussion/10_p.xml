<p id="Par59">The frequent involvement of leafy stems in recipes could be explained by the fact that the phytochemical compounds responsible for antifungal effects are more concentrated in these plant organs than others. Chemical groups are reported to be more abundant in this plant organs, where secondary metabolites are synthesized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Castillo et al. reported that terpenes, tannins, flavonoids, essential oils, alkaloids, lecithin and polypeptides are the chemical compounds with antifungal properties in plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. These properties observed with coriander essential oil on Candida spp. strains are reported by Freires et al. to be related to monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes present in the leaves of this plant [

In addition, ethnobotanical surveys conducted in Benin on medicinal plants sold in Benin have shown that leaf stems are the most commonly used plant organs by medicinal plant sellers, that decoction is the most recommended method of preparation by traditional practitioners and that the oral route is the most commonly used for the administration of medicinal plant recipes [
