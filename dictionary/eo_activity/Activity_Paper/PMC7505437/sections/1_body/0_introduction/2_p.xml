<p>ROS are eliminated mainly by antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT, and POD, and secondary metabolites, including phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and tocopherols. OË™

In particular, some -SH groups that maintain the secondary structure and tertiary structure of the enzymes are liable to be injured if an undue amount of ROS in plants is generated under severe abiotic stresses [
