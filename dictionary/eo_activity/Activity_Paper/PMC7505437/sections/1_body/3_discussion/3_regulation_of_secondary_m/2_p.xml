<p>When facing environmental stresses, the increased ROS content swiftly triggered a change in the secondary metabolism. First, the glucuronic acid moieties on baicalin and wogonoside were removed by Î²-glucuronidase, and baicalin and wogonoside were rapidly converted to baicalein or wogonin as a result of increased activities [

Chrysin, with only C-5 and C-7 hydroxyl groups, could also receive a hydroxyl group and was converted into baicalein, norwogonin, and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8,2',3' -tetramethoxy flavone with more hydroxy groups. The contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and chrysin are all high in the natural state, and furthermore, these reactions are fulfilled by only one step; therefore, the reaction was swiftly performed. Second, ROS can increase the activity of phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) [
