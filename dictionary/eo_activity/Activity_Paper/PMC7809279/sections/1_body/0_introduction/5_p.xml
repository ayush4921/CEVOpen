<p id="Par6">Here, we used four chloroplast gene sequences (
 <italic>matK</italic>, 
 <italic>rbcL, ndhF</italic> and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>) and three combined sequences including 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>, 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1, ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> of 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> species to develop unique identification fragments of a certain species of 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> based on phylogenetic analyses and SNP site analyses. Furthermore, the barcode genes were comprehensively analyzed to obtain standard DNA marker fragments of 
 <italic>Orchidaceae.</italic> Therefore, this study provided a novel approach, based on the SNP barcode, to accurately and rapidly identify 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> plants. This technology replenishes traditional methods of identification in 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> plants. This is the first study to report a strategy for developing specific DNA barcodes of 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> plants, laying the foundation for the conservation, evaluation, innovative utilization and protection of 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> germplasm resources.
