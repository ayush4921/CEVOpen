<p id="Par11">There must be some genetic variation based on their species differences since the data used to analyze were obtained from different species. The basic indicators of genetic diversity, displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, worked out in accordance with pairwise nucleotide differences and nucleotide diversity, and the validity of these indexes were verified by two neutrality tests, like Fu’s 
 <italic>Fs</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup> and Tajima’s 
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. The 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> sequences had revealed maximum genetic diversity cumulatively on the base of Eta value, revealed 2314 mutations within all sequences. While the 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> sequences only had 322 mutations variations in all sequences. The significance of genetic diversity was verified by both neutrality tests, which confirmed that all sequences had significant difference but no very significant difference based on the probability value (p-value) of Fu’s 
 <italic>Fs</italic> test and Tajima’s 
 <italic>D</italic> test (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
