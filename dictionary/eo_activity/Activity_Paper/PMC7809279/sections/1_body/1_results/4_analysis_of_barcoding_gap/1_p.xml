<p id="Par14">An ideal DNA barcoding sequence for species identification should satisfy that inter-specific genetic variation is significantly greater than intra-specific genetic variation. In order to more accurately assess individual chloroplast genes and combined sequences in the 
 <italic>Orchid</italic> genus species, and to verify the applicability of candidate sequences, the barcoding gap was analyzed according to frequency distribution showed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. The results revealed that the 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> gene showed better performance in a single gene, while the combined sequences of 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> showed the best performance. The results of the Best Close Match of several candidate barcodes based on genetic distance are showed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Among the single genes, the accuracy rate of 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> gene for 
 <italic>orchid</italic> plant identification is 89.32%, with 3.38% fuzzy identification rate and 6.25% error identification rate. The 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> gene exhibits the highest identification rate and lower error rate of 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> sequence. The accuracy of 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> sequence was 89.6%, with 2.8% fuzzy identification rate and 1.12% error identification rate. The accuracy rate of 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> sequence was 88.78%, with 2.33% fuzzy identification rate and 2.8% error identification rate. The data indicated that 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> were suitable for the identification of 
 <italic>Orchids</italic> at the level of genus and species, while the combined sequences of 
 <italic>matK</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> and 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> were qualified at the genera and species levels.
