<p id="Par15">Based on SNP sites, species-specific barcodes were developed and the appropriate fragments were blasted into the NCBI database. Based on the 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> sequence, the specific barcode of species 
 <italic>Dendrobium scoriarum</italic> was obtained. Knowledge about specific barcodes of species 
 <italic>Neuwiedia thelymitra</italic>, 
 <italic>Spiranthes sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Epiblema cocflorum</italic> based on 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> sequence was obtained. Based on the combined sequence 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> + 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>, the specific barcodes of 
 <italic>Liparis loeselii</italic>, 
 <italic>Cremastraa ppendiculata</italic>, 
 <italic>Spiranthes siensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Anathallis obovata</italic> were obtained, whereas 
 <italic>Liparis loeselii</italic> and 
 <italic>Cremastra appendiculata</italic> had two specific barcodes. Two-Dimensional code can be scanned by electronic equipment from DNA fragments that can be used for species identification. It can provide theoretical support for subsequent researchers. Using the Two-Dimensional code coding method, the species-specific barcode obtained was converted into two-dimensional barcode image, which was conducive to the conversion of barcode information (Figs.
