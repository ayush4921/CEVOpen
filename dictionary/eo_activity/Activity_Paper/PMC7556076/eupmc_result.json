    "The leaf latex of <i>Aloe pulcherrima</i> has been used as remedy for diabetes mellitus. This was carried out to determine <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antidiabetic activities of the leaf latex of <i>Aloe pulcherrim</i>a. <i>Methods</i>. Sucrase and maltase inhibitory activity of the leaf latex of <i>A. pulcherrima</i> was determined in glucose oxidase assay, and <i>α</i>-amylase inhibitory activity was determined in dinitrosalicylic acid assay. Normoglycemic, glucose-loaded, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were treated orally to determine blood glucose lowering activity of the latex. Effect of the latex on serum lipid level and body weight was measured in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Additionally, DPPH assay was used to determine free radical scavenging capacity of the latex. <i>Results</i>. Antioxidant activity of the latex was concentration dependent; the strongest inhibition was measured at 800 <i>μ</i>g/ml (80.57%). The leaf latex of <i>A. pulcherrima</i> inhibited sucrase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.92 <i>μ</i>g/ml), maltase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 11.81 <i>μ</i>g/ml) and <i>α</i>-amylase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 14.92 <i>μ</i>g/ml) enzymes. All doses of the leaf latex induced hypoglycemic effect after 4 h in normal mice, and low dose of the latex did not show significant effect after 6 h. Glucose reduction of the leaf latex of <i>A. pulcherrima</i> was significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in oral glucose-loaded mice compared to the vehicle control. Blood glucose level of diabetic mice was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduced on week one and weak two in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. Glucose reduction increased with increasing the doses of the leaf latex of <i>A. pulcherrima</i> on week one (<i>p</i> < 0.05 (200 mg/kg), <i>p</i> < 0.01 (400 mg/kg), and <i>p</i> < 0.001 (600 mg/kg)). Administration of the leaf latex of <i>A. pulcherrima</i> for two weeks significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) improved diabetic dyslipidemia and body weight of diabetic mice. <i>Conclusion</i>. The study confirmed that the leaf latex of the plant showed a significant antidiabetic activity justifying the traditional uses of the plant."
