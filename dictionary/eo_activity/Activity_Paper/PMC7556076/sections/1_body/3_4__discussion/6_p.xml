<p>In this study, medium and high doses of the latex significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) reduced blood glucose level after one and two hours of oral glucose loading in the glucose tolerance test. Glucose reducing effect of the low dose was delayed and significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) after two hours. The result showed that medium and high doses of the latex had fast onset and greater glucose reduction. This is comparable with significant postprandial glucose reducing effect of the leaf latex of
