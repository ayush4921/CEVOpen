<p>Administration of the latex for two weeks to STZ-induced diabetic mice showed prominent blood glucose reducing compared to diabetic control. Glucose reduction effect was increased with increasing the doses of the leaf latex of 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 200 mg/kg; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 400 mg/kg; and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 600 mg/kg on week one), indicating that low and medium doses of the latex had less cummulative effect on week one. Thus, cummulative glucose reduction with the latex was time and dose dependent (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, low dose, and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, medium and high dose on week two). The relative variation in blood glucose reduction among doses might be due to variation of the amount of secondary metabolite content in the leaf latex of 
 <italic>Aloe pulcherrima</italic>. The findings showed that the plant was endowed with glucose lowering potential, and the effect was concordant with dose-dependent antidiabetic activity of the leaf latex of 
 <italic>Aloe megalacantha</italic> [

 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> leaf gel at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg has been safe and effective as 50 mg/kg metformin [

 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> leaf gel showed protective effect on diabetic-induced renal and liver damage, and hence, leaf gel of the plant and its derivative might be preferable in comorbid diabetic patients [
