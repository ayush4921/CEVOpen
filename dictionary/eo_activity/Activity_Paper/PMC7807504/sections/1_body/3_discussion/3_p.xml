<p id="Par37">The study presented herein study demonstrated that oral, 60-day treatment of male rats with supra-therapeutic doses of the thyrotropic botanical drug, PADE (8 and 40 times exceeding median therapeutic dose recommended for clinical trials), led to dose-depended alterations in male reproductive functions. PADE treatment decreased the number of motile spermatozoa and the time of their movement. PADE treatment decreased the spermatogenesis index and increased the number of pathologic forms of spermatozoa. This study also demonstrated that PADE treatment of male rats for 60 consecutive days reduced Leydig cell nucleus diameters and an increasing number of pyknotic nuclei in these cells. Studies aimed to determine whether PADE effects on the male reproductive system can be reversed in progress.</p>
