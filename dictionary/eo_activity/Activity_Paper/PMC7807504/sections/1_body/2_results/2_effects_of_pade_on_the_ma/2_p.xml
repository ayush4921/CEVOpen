<p id="Par28">Oral treatment of male rats with PADE at a dose of 125 mg/kg caused pronounced effects on male reproductive organs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Relative decreases were observed in the total number of spermatozoa produced, but differences were not statistically significant. The decrease in the number of motile spermatozoa in groups receiving low and high doses of PADE and the spermatozoon movement’s duration in the group receiving PADE 125 mg/kg were statistically significant (
