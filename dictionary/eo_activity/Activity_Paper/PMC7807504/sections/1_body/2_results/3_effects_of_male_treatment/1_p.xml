<p id="Par30">The effect of PADE treatment of male rats on fetal development was examined on day 20 post-fertilization (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Five to 8 dams were inspected in each group. Repeated treatment of male rats with low and high doses of PADE did not have a significant impact on fetal development. Control and PADE treated groups had approximately the same numbers of the implantations and live fetuses per dam. Fetuses had similar weights.
