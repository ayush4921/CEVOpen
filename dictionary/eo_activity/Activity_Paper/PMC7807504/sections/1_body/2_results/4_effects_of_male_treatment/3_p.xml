<p id="Par34">An open-field test on day 21 after birth evaluated the offspring’s motor-sensory reflexes. All pups from the treated groups demonstrated similar behavioral and locomotive reflexes as their counterparts in the control groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of lines crossed by pups nor in the grooming and head dipping activities between PADE-treated and control groups. However, there was a minor increase in the rearing and defecation activities in the groups of pups born from PADE-treated fathers. Differences were not statistically significant.
