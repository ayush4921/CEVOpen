<p id="Par44">Oral administration of supratherapeutic PADE to male rats for 60 consecutive days resulted in a decreased number of motile spermatozoa, decreased sperm mobility time, and an increased number of pathological forms of spermatozoa, while did not significantly affect the ability of males to fertilize naïve female rats. PADE administration to male rats did not adversely affect the prenatal development of the offspring born from male rats treated with PADE mated with naïve females. The supratherapeutic treatment of male rats with PADE did not affect offspring survival, weight gain, and motor activity. PADE should be prescribed with caution to men of reproductive age. More studies are needed to determine whether PADE could affect man reproductive functions.</p>
