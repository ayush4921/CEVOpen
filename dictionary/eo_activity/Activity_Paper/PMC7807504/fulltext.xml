Nowadays, patients frequently use medicinal herbs as complementary or alternative options to conventional drug treatments. These patients may benefit from treatment of thyroid dysfunctions with <italic>Potentilla alba</italic> L. preparations. While it has been reported that <italic>Potentilla alba</italic> preparations have low toxicity, nothing is known about their ability to affect reproductive functions in patients of childbearing age.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Male Wistar rats were orally treated with a thyrotrophic botanical drug, standardized <italic>Potentilla alba</italic> Dry Extract (PADE), at doses 8 and 40 times higher than the median therapeutic dose recommended for the clinical trials, for 60 consecutive days. Male Wistar rats receiving water (H<sub>2</sub>O) were used as controls. After completing treatment, half of the PADE-treated and control males were used to determine PADE gonadotoxicity, and the remaining half of PADE-treated and control males were mated with intact females. Two female rats were housed with one male for two estrus cycles. PADE effects on fertility and fetal/offspring development were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Herein, we report that oral treatment of male Wistar rats with PADE before mating with intact females instigated marked effects on male reproductive organs. Treatment significantly decreased the motility of the sperm and increased the number of pathological forms of spermatozoa. Additionally, a dose-dependent effect on Leydig cells was observed. However, these PADE effects did not significantly affect male fertility nor fetal and offspring development when PADE-treated males were mated with intact females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">PADE treatment of male rates negatively affected sperm and testicular Leydig cell morphology. However, these changes did not affect male fertility and offspring development. It is currently not known whether PADE treatment may affect human male fertility and offspring development. Therefore, these results from an animal study need to be confirmed in humans. Results from this animal study can be used to model the exposure-response relationship and adverse outcomes in humans.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Herbal drug toxicity</kwd><kwd>Male reproductive health</kwd><kwd>Preclinical drug evaluation</kwd><kwd><italic>Potentilla alba</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>FSBIU VILAR</institution></funding-source><award-id>0576-2019-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krepkova</surname><given-names>Lubov V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">Thyroid gland dysfunction is a common medical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nowadays, many patients choose to use medicinal herbs and herb-based medications as an alternative or complementary treatment for various diseases and conditions including thyroid dysfunctions. Various medicinal herbs affect thyroid gland function. Gotu Kola (<italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, L.), Ashwagandha (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (L.) Dunal), and Guggul (<italic>Commiphora mukul</italic> (Arn.) Bhandari) are effective for the treatment of hypothyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are also medicinal herbs that have thyroid suppressive properties and can be recommended for the treatment of hyperthyroidism: bugleweed (<italic>Lycopus virginicus</italic>, L.), gypsywort (<italic>Lycopus europaeus,</italic> L.), Lemonbalsam (<italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>, L.), Rosemary (<italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, L.) and Sage (<italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>, L.), and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Patients with thyroid dysfunctions may also benefit from using preparations from <italic>Potentilla alba</italic> L.

Three to 4-month-old female (180&#x02013;200&#x02009;g) and male (200&#x02013;250&#x02009;g) Wistar rats were obtained from the animal nursery &#x0201c;Andreevka,&#x0201d; a branch of FSBIS of the Scientific Center of Biomedical Technologies of the Medical and Biological Agency, Russia. Animals were housed in the VILAR biomedical clinic for at least 3 weeks before experiment initiation. Animals were housed five rats of the same gender in a plastic cage before mating and one male and two females during mating.

The low PADE dose represented a dose approximately equal to median effective dose for rats (20&#x02009;mg/kg, ED<sub>50</sub>) and 8 times higher than median therapeutic dose recommended for clinical trials (3.1&#x02009;mg/kg). High dose administered to experimental animals was 40 times higher than therapeutic recommended for clinical trials. The dose of the extract was calculated based on body weight, which was determined when the animal was last weighted. The animals were weighed once a week. Male rats receiving water (H<sub>2</sub>O) were used as controls. Twenty to thirty male rats were used in each group. After completing the treatment, half of PADE-treated and control males were used to determine PADE gonadotoxicity, and the remaining half of PADE-treated and control males were mated with intact females. Two female rats were housed with one male for two estrus cycles. Vaginal smears were evaluated daily for the estrus cycle and the presence of sperm. At the time of insemination, females were separated from males. All experiments described in this study were repeated twice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Investigation of PADE effects on male fertility</title><p id="Par18">The effects of PADE treatment on male fertility were evaluated by measuring fertility and pregnancy indexes. The fertility index was calculated as following the number of pregnant rats divided by the number of fertilized rats and multiplied by 100.

The functional conditions of spermatozoa were evaluated by assessing sperm motility and the percentage of pathologic forms. Sperm was obtained immediately after euthanizing rats by vortexing a longitudinally cut-open epididymis in 10&#x02009;ml of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) for 2 min. The sperm suspension was placed into the hemocytometer. Total and motile spermatozoon numbers were counted. A minimum of 200 spermatozoa per animal was counted.

PADE treatment decreased the number of motile spermatozoa and the time of their movement. PADE treatment decreased the spermatogenesis index and increased the number of pathologic forms of spermatozoa. This study also demonstrated that PADE treatment of male rats for 60 consecutive days reduced Leydig cell nucleus diameters and an increasing number of pyknotic nuclei in these cells. Studies aimed to determine whether PADE effects on the male reproductive system can be reversed in progress.</p><p id="Par38">PADE is a multi-constituent botanical drug. It comprises of catechins, gallic acid, coumaric acid, polysaccharides, phytosterols, and polymeric proanthocyanidins of unknown structure. It has been reported that treatment of mice with gallic acid prevents DNA fragmentation and testicular tissue atrophy induced by cyclophosphamide administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Green tea catechins have a positive effect on sperm viability, morphology, motility, fertility rate, and gamete quality of experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The long-term treatment of male rats with &#x003b2;-sitosterol resulted in decreased testicular weight and sperm concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A more recent publication investigated the effects of phytosterols on the adrenal and reproductive functions of Japanese male quails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Quail chronically fed with phytosterols significantly reduced testicular weight and testosterone levels. Additionally, it has been reported that phytosterols reduce testosterone levels in male rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that phytosterols present in PADE are partially responsible for the male reproductive system&#x02019;s harmful effects. It is also possible that such components of PADE as gallic acid and catechins ameliorate effects of phytosterols on male reproductive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Our experiments conducted in rabbits demonstrated that PADE had a selective toxic effect on experimental animals&#x02019; pituitary glands. This resulted in a decrease in the size of basophilic cells in the adenohypophysis and dose-dependent spermatogenesis inhibition, potentially due to a decreased synthesis and secretion of gonadotropic hormones (unpublished pathohistological data). Based on the data presented above, it can be concluded that it is likely that phytositosterol is responsible for the toxic effects of PADE on the male reproductive system and the observed changes could be in part a result of reduced production of testosterone.</p><p id="Par40">The majority of patients with thyroid dysfunction are female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Offspring born from PADE treated males was healthy.</p><p id="Par42">What are the clinical implications of the adverse effects observed in this study? Specifically, should PADE be prescribed to male patients with thyroid dysfunction? The reliability of studies investigating spermatotoxicity in animals was investigated by Elizabeth Rayburn and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. They examined 235 FDA-approved small molecule drugs with spermatotoxic effects, and only 49 had documented negative impact on men&#x02019;s reproductive health. Notably, 155 medications were determined to be spermatotoxic in animals but had no human data. Authors concluded that current animal studies assessing drug spermatotoxic effects are not particularly good predictors of the drug effect on men&#x02019;s reproductive health. Currently, we can only speculate whether dose escalation in clinical trials (e.g., median therapeutic dose and dose exceeding therapeutic dose by 5 times) will have similar effect on men&#x02019;s reproductive system. Potentially, results from this animal study can be used to model the exposure-response relationship and adverse outcomes in humans.</p><p id="Par43">Although many medicinal herbs have transient effects on the male reproductive system, there is a potential risk of impaired spermatogenesis when PADE is used in doses exceeding the recommended therapeutic doses. This study suggests that PADE treatment of reproductive age men should be avoided or recommended with caution. The doses prescribed to these patients should not exceed the therapeutic dose. Treating physicians should consider whether the expected benefits of PADE treatment to the male parent exceed possible risks to male fertility and reproductive health as well as potential effects on fetal and offspring development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">Oral administration of supratherapeutic PADE to male rats for 60 consecutive days resulted in a decreased number of motile spermatozoa, decreased sperm mobility time, and an increased number of pathological forms of spermatozoa, while did not significantly affect the ability of males to fertilize na&#x000ef;ve female rats. PADE administration to male rats did not adversely affect the prenatal development of the offspring born from male rats treated with PADE mated with na&#x000ef;ve females. The supratherapeutic treatment of male rats with PADE did not affect offspring survival, weight gain, and motor activity. PADE should be prescribed with caution to men of reproductive age.
