<p>Having extensively reviewed the literature on the bioactivities and compounds isolated from mushrooms native to North America, we can now attempt to answer the questions posed at the beginning of this review. (i) Do similar species found in North America and elsewhere exhibit similar bioactivities and produce similar group of bioactive compounds? Based on subjective approach of bioactivity-guided investigations on selective species, similar species found in North America and elsewhere indeed produce similar bioactivities. For example, this is true for the commonly 
 <italic>studied I. obliquus and P. ostreatus</italic>. Furthermore, compounds such as grifolin, neogrifolin and confluentin produced in North American 
 <italic>A. flettii</italic>, are also made by other 
 <italic>Albatrellus</italic> genus found elsewhere [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, a better answer can only be obtained by using more advanced and objective method such as Quadruple Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry to globally examine the metabolites produced and using multiple biological screening assays to simultaneously monitor different bioactivities. (ii) Do similar species found in North America and elsewhere exhibit distinct bioactivity and produce distinct compounds? Again, the answer to this question would come from more advanced approaches described above. (iii) Do new species found in North America produce new compound(s)? Due to limited number of studies on mushrooms native to North America, it is currently unknown whether new species found in North America produce new compound(s). However, based on very limited study (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), it is likely that new medicinal compounds are produced by new species found in North America. (iv) Based on the answers to (i) to (iii) above, is it worth exploring mushrooms native to North America for medicinal properties and for new compounds? We believe that North American mushrooms are worth further exploration. This is based on the fact that there are many species, including new species, in North America whose bioactivities have never been previously reported (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, novel compounds have been isolated from North American mushrooms despite the very limited number of studies (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00251-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
