<p>The purpose of this comprehensive review is to provide an up-to-date information on the bioprospecting efforts on mushrooms native to North America. With literature searches and the information gained, we aim to critically answer the following questions: (i) Do similar species found in North America and elsewhere exhibit similar bioactivities and produce similar group of bioactive compounds?, (ii) Do similar species found in North America and elsewhere exhibit distinct bioactivity and produce distinct compounds?, (iii) Do new species found in North America produce new compound(s), and (iv) Based on the answers to (i) to (iii) above, is it worth exploring mushrooms native to North America for medicinal properties and for new medicinal compounds?</p>
