<p>As mentioned briefly in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-molecules-26-00251">Section 3.4</xref>, there has been a lack of interest amongst scientists in the West, especially in North America, in studying bioactive polysaccharides for use as medicinal compounds [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, with recent advances in identifying biosynthetic gene clusters and transcriptomic studies including those in fungi, it is now possible to produce compounds including large polysaccharides using heterologous expression systems by genetic engineering [

 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Such efforts are expected to enable large scale production of pure bioactive polysaccharides, thereby overcoming some if not all of the problems previously encountered [
