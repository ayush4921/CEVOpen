<p>Two small molecules, syringaldehyde and syringic acid with molar mass of 182 g/mol and 198 g/mol respectively, were isolated from ethanol extract of the fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>E. granulatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The possible toxicity of both compounds was evaluated on macrophage Raw 264.7 cells and HL-60 cells. The authors found that both syringaldehyde and syringic acid had no effect on Raw 264.7 and HL-60 cells viability of up to 25 μg/mL and 31.25 μg/mL respectively [

 <italic>A. flettii</italic> [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A lanostane-type triterpene named 3, 11-dioxdanosta-8,24(Z)-diene-26-oic acid with molar mass of 468 g/mol was isolated from 
 <italic>J. hirtus</italic>. This triterpene effectively inhibited the growth of two Gram positive bacteria; 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Three new bisnaphthalene subclass compounds called urnucratins A–C were isolated from the North American cup fungus 
 <italic>U. craterium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Urnucratin A (348 g/mol) was found to be active against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, vanocymin-resistant 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A new lanostane triterpenoid named 3-oxo-24-methyl-5α-lanost-8,25-dien-21-oic acid (468 g/mol) with activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was isolated from 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> native to North America [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The same study also reported isolation of four known lanostane triterpenoids and one known ergostane steroid with anti-bacterial activity [
