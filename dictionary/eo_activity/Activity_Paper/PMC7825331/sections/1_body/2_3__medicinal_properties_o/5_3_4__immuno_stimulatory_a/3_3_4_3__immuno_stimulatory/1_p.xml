<p>As with animal studies, there is currently no clinical studies evaluating the immuno-stimulatory effect of North American mushrooms. There are also limited clinical studies evaluating immuno-potentiating effects of mushrooms collected from elsewhere. Two of the most notable medicinal mushrooms. 
 <italic>T. versicolor</italic> and 
 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> (Maitake mushroom), had been clinically investigated for such purposes. As described in 3.2.3, both PSP and PSK are immuno-potentiating anticancer polysaccharides isolated from 
 <italic>T. versicolor</italic> that had undergone many clinical studies and this has been critically reviewed recently [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, its polysaccharide extract was administered to 34 breast cancer patients on a phase I/II clinical trial. Cytokine analysis in patients’ peripheral blood showed signs of both immuno-stimulatory and –inhibitory effects [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. There was no dose-limiting toxicity observed in patients, suggesting that the extract is safe. The authors concluded that the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharide should be classified as immuno-modulatory rather than immuno-stimulatory.
