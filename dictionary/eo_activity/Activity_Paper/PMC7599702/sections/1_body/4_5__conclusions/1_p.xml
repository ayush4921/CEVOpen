<p>This study presented the successful bio-fabrication of silver nanoparticles in an economical and environmentally safe manner. The medicinal plant of 
 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic> was explored to isolate the endophytic 
 <italic>Streptomyces laurentii</italic> which mediated the biogenic synthesis of the stable and spherical Ag-NPs of the 7â€“28 nm size range. These particles showed wide spectrum activity against the representative clinical pathogens (
 <italic>S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>), as well as anti-tumor activity against the human cancer colon cell line. We applied biocolloidal silver as nano-finishing materials for multifunctional textile fabrics. EDX and SEM analysis proved the homogenous loading of Ag-NPs onto the fabric surface was achieved. The Ag-based fabrics exhibited durable broad-spectrum antibacterial activity that lasted after 10 cycles of repeated washing. These treated fabrics are recommended to be used clinically as textiles or dressings.
