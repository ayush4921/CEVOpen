<p>Consequently, the biogenic Ag-NPs demonstrated selective toxicity towards cancer cells (Caco-2), as they demonstrated an anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells at low concentrations. On the contrary, nanoparticles affected the survival and population of normal cells (Vero) only if used in very high concentrations, this window can be used medically for the selective activity of nanoparticles against cancer cells. Consistent with these results, Hamouda et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported the cytotoxic potential of bio synthesized Ag-NPs against the human breast cell line (MCF-7) and human colon (HCT-116) cancer cell line, recording IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.147 and 5.369 Âµg/mL, respectively. Silver nanoparticles may cause cell death by the interaction of the liberated silver ions with the cellular components, resulting in the production of ROS, and oxidative stress that ends in apoptic death [
