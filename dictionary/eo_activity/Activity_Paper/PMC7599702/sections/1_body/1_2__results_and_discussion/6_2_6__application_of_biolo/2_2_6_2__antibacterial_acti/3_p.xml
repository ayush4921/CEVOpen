<p>Evidently, smaller nanoparticles have a large surface area, which increases their degree of contact with the bacteria, leading to the formation of larger inhibition zones [

Although the antibacterial activity of treated tissue decreases by washing, the current study demonstrated that even after 10 cycles of repeated washing, the fabric retained the nanoscaled silver cover, and was still able to inhibit bacterial growth (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00641-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, Ag-NPs could separate from the fabric due to high temperatures and mechanical vibration during washing [
