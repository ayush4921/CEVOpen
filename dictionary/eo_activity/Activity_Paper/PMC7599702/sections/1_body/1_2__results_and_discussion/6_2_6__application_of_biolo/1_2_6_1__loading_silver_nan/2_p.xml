<p>While nano-treated fabrics appeared to retain their structure, their surface was coated with Ag-NPs that merged with the textile fibers and dispersed uniformly across the surface of the tissue. Recently, Haiting et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] authenticated the deposition of Ag-NPs evenly distributed across the surface of a treated cotton cloth. In our study, the small size of the Ag-NPs (7â€“28 nm) gave rise to their successful adhesion to the tissue surface, since the smaller the particles, the more deeply they penetrated the tissues and tightly adhered to the cotton fibers.
