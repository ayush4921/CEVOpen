<p>The biocidal properties of the biocolloidal Ag-NPs suspension were evaluated based on zones of inhibition (mm). Ag-NPs were proven to be a promising and effective antibacterial agent in a dose-based mode against selected pathogens involving Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of nanoscaled silver particles was previously inferred by the formation of growth inhibition zones around an agar well [

The actinobacterial biomass filtrate (as a control) was checked for their activities as antimicrobial agents and did not exhibit any activities against the tested pathogenic bacteria, indicating their absence of active antibacterial metabolites.
