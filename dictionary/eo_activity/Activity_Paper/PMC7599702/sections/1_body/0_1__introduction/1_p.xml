 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Metals and metal oxide nanoparticles have been fabricated by different approaches, including chemical, physical, and biological methods. However, biological methods are preferred over chemical and physical ones due to their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, non-harsh conditions, and in not producing hazardous by-product compounds [
