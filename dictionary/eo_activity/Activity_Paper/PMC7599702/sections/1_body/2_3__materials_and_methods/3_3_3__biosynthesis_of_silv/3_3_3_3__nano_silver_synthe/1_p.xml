<p>We added 1 mM aqueous solution of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> to 100 mL of the collected biomass filtrate and incubated overnight at 35 °C in static and dark conditions [

The resultant yellowish brown Ag-NPs was subjected to oven-drying at 100 °C for 24 h. The actinomycetes biomass filtrate, as well as AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> were running with the experiment as negative controls.
