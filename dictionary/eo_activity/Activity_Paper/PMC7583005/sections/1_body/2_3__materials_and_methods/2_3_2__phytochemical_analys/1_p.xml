<p>The phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> extract was made by 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilyl, silylating agent of trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). 0.003 g of the crude extract of 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> obtained by adding 200 μL of 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), afterward the extract was heated at 37 °C for 30 min. 0.1 μL of this the crude extract was injected into apparatus for analysis. The analysis was effectuated using GC-MS. Model 5973 purchased from Brand Agilent Technologies. Helium was used the column carrier gas with a typical pressure range (psi) of 0.9 mL/s. Graphite furnace temperature program was made between 70–270 °C at 4 °C/min and maintained at 270 °C for further 20 min. The injector temperature was set to 280 °C and the detector temperature was set to 290 °C. The injection was made with respect to the fractionated mode.
