<p>Although the liver excised from all treated animals after 28 days of dosing was subjected to histological examination for analyzing the following injuries, bile ducts, hepatic vein, the artery in the portal area, and hepatic fat had no modification detected when compared to the control mice (

The spleen plays a crucial role in the body to help in blood filtration in which red blood cells are recycled. The results of histological examination of the spleen tissue excised from animals treated with a dose up to a maximum of 2000 mg/kg body revealed no structural changes (

As a result, no morphological changes were noticed when compared to the control mice treated with distilled water during the whole period of dosing (

These results were also supported by the biochemical parametersâ€™ findings (urea and creatinine) since no modification was reported for them. These findings could confirm the safety of the extract studied up to 2000 mg/kg body since no adverse effect is noticed for the hematopoietic system [
