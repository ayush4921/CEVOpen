<p>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is one of the most used, less expensive, and sophisticated separation techniques and its advancement with high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) based on the full capabilities of TLC made us far easier in the field of the natural product and phytochemical analysis. The direct coupling of the compound library or active constituents separated on the TLC plate with visualizable enzyme reactions can be used for activity screening, and the assay based on direct screening of activity-oriented constituents is known as a TLC-bioautography assay. This technique provides quick access to information concerning both the localization of the bioactive compounds present in complex plant matrices and defines their biological activities. Such TLC-based bioautography through enzymatic reaction provides us the initial stage to develop activity-based screening of phytochemical constituents from herbal medicine. The bioautographic analysis coupled with mass spectroscopy (MS) techniques is purposed to a rapid, high-throughput, and target-directed isolation and identification of active molecules based on their enzymatic activity from fractions or multicompound mixtures.
