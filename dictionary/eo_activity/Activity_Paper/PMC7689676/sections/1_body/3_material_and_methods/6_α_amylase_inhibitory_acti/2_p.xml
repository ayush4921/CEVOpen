 </sup> Briefly, 40 μL of the sample from each batch was mixed with 40 μL of amylase solution (4 units/mL in sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.7) in each defined well of 96-well plate. The obtained mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, 40 μL of starch solution (0.1%) was added to the mixture. After 10 min, 20 μL of hydrochloric acid (I M) was added to stop the enzyme and substrate reaction and 100 μL of iodide solution (5 mM iodine +5 mM potassium iodide in distilled water) was added and the absorbance was measured at 580 nm. Acarbose was used as the standard.
