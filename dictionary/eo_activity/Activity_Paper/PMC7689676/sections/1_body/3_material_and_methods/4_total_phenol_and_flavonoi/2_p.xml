<p>The total phenol content of the different samples was determined by using the Folin Ciocalteu (FC) method with some modifications.

 </sup> Briefly, 5 mg/mL stock solution of extract was prepared in methanol from each batch of BGR-34. An amount 500 μL of stock solution from each batch was mixed with 2.5 mL of FC (1:10, v/v). After mixing, 2.5 mL of sodium bicarbonate solution (7.5%) was added and allowed to stand for 30 min with intermittent shaking. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer. The total phenolic content in BGR-34 was calculated from a calibration curve of standard gallic acid (10–1000 μg/mL), and the result was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent/gm of extract (mg GAE/gm extract).
