 </sup> Briefly, 5 mg/mL stock solution of extract was prepared in methanol from each batch of BGR-34. An amount 500 μL of stock solution from each batch was mixed with 1.5 mL methanol. After 5 min, 0.1 mL aluminum chloride (10%), 0.1 mL sodium acetate (1 M), and 2.8 mL water were added. After incubation for 40 min, absorbance was measured at 415 nm using a spectrophotometer. The total flavonoid content in BGR-34 was calculated from a calibration curve of standard rutin (10–1000 μg/mL), and the result was expressed as mg rutin equivalent/gm extract (mg rutin/gm extract).
