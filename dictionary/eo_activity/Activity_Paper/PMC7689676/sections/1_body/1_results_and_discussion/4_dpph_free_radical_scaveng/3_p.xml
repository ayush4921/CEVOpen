<p>The DPPH assay is the most used method for the assessment of the antioxidant capacity of natural products through spectrophotometric techniques based on the quenching of stable colored radicals. BGR-34 is rich in secondary metabolites and includes phenol and flavonoid that have antioxidant activities owing to their redox characteristics. Dietary phenols and flavonoids have enough ability to scavenge with free radicals induced by oxidative stress. These polyphenols that strengthen the efficacy of the antioxidant enzyme defense system have several types of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT). These enzymes are known for their pivotal role in suppression of the excessive ROS by breaking the autoxidative chain reaction, quenching the trace elements, and preventing the overall cellular injury. Apart from this, maintaining a normal level of glutathione is important for diabetic patients. Diabetes induces an alteration in glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity, and where diabetic nephropathy is often linked to low renal glutathione levels.
