<p>Polyphenols are the most abundant antioxidants in medicinal plants as well as in the daily uses of the human diet. A study cited by Aryaeian et al. on T2DM cited that phenol and flavonoid exert antioxidant and antidiabetic activity through enduring the role of the antioxidant defense system, pancreatic β-cell, and cAMP to function properly.
