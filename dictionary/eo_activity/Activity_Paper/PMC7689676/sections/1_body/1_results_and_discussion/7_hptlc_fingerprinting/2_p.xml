<p>Herbal products contain several verities of secondary metabolites with large chemical diversity, and it is very difficult to target a particular constituent concerning their biological activity. In these cases, TLC fingerprint profiling of herbal products is very useful and widely used for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The compounds separated on the TLC plate at different

 </sup> Moreover, in HPTLC fingerprinting of BGR-34, the plate was developed in the defined solvent system 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol:water:glacial acetic acid (6:3:1, v/v/v) and scanned at 254 and 366 nm before derivatization and at 540 nm post derivatization. HPTLC chromatographic analysis of different batches of samples showed 9, 7, and 11 prominent spots at different values at 254, 366, and 540 nm, respectively. The chromatographic profiling revealed that several major and minor constituents present in the methanolic extract of BGR-34. The constituent intensity was identified according to their AUC value/peak intensity (
