<p>Berberine and palmatine are the well-known natural isoquinoline alkaloidal compounds present in the roots, rhizomes, stem, and bark of 
 <italic>Berberis aristata</italic> and 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> of BGR-34. The bioautographic result reveals that berberine and palmatine are the major constituents of BGR-34, which shows inhibitory potential against α-amylase. An extensive search in electronic databases revealed their action to improve insulin resistance and show a reversal effect against hyperglycemia. The study, cited by Cicero, reported that berberine and palmatine exert their antidiabetic potential by affecting glucose metabolism, increasing insulin secretion, stimulating glycolysis, suppressing adipogenesis, inhibiting mitochondrial function, activating the 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and increasing glucokinase activity. The previous studies support that berberine and palmatine not only inhibit α-amylase activity in hyperglycemia but also increase the glucose uptake by muscles, which leads to a reversal effect on hyperglycemia. These isoquinoline alkaloids also protect the injury of hearts that occurs due to oxidative and inflammatory stress. The herbal formulation containing berberine and palmatine is considered as safe due to the low incidence of adverse reactions, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, and transient increases in the plasma bilirubin level.
