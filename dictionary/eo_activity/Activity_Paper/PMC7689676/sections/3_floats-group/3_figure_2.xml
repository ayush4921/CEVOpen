  <p>TLC-bioautography. Panel (I) represents DPPH scavenged treated TLC bioautogram of three different batches of BGR-34 where (I-A,A
   <sub>1</sub>,A
   <sub>2</sub>) is showing yellow spots against the dark purple color background, (I-B,B
   <sub>1</sub>,B
   <sub>2</sub>) represents the normal view (control TLC) of plates before DPPH scavenging, and (I-C,C
   <sub>1</sub>,C
   <sub>2</sub>) represents scrapped DPPH active spots from TLC plates. Panel (II) represents α-amylase-treated TLC bioautogram of three different batches of BGR-34 where (II-A,A
   <sub>1</sub>,A
   <sub>2</sub>) is showing dark blue/violet spots at the brown color background, (II-B,B
   <sub>1</sub>,B
   <sub>2</sub>) represents the normal view (control TLC) of plates before amylase treatment, and (II-C,C
   <sub>1</sub>,C
   <sub>2</sub>) represents scrapped α-amylase active spots from TLC plates. Panel (III) represents α-glucosidase-treated TLC bioautogram of three different batches of BGR-34 where (III-A,A
   <sub>1</sub>,A
   <sub>2</sub>) is showing white/ceramic spots against the purple color background, (III-B,B
   <sub>1</sub>,B
   <sub>2</sub>) represents the normal view (control TLC) of plates before α-glucosidase treatment, and (III-C,C
   <sub>1</sub>,C
   <sub>2</sub>) represents scrapped α-glucosidase active spots from TLC plates.
