<p>A single individual of 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> was used as a sampling object from the Chongqing (105°17 ′E;28°10′N) city. Fresh leaves of the individual were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a refrigerator (−80 °C) until DNA extraction. The voucher specimen (JMZ001) was laid in the Herbarium of Northwest University and the extracted DNA was stored in the −80 °C refrigerator of the Northwest University. We extracted total genomic DNA from 25 mg silica-gel-dried leaf using a modified CTAB method (Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina,San Diego, CA) was used to perform the genome sequence. We used the software MITObim 1.8 (Hahn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and metaSPAdes (Nurk et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) to assemble chloroplast genomes. We used 
 <italic>S. occidentalis</italic> (GenBank: NC_038222) as a reference genome. We annotated the chloroplast genome with the software DOGMA (Wyman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and then corrected the results using Geneious 8.0.2 (Campos et al.
