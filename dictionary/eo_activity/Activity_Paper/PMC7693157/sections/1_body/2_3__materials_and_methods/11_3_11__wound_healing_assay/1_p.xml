<p>Inhibition of cell migration and metastasis was evaluated by wound healing assay [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. HeLa cells were seeded in 24 well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with concentration values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the different plant extracts obtained from the MTT assay and 0.1% DMSO (solvent control) for 2 h in serum-free medium. A scratch was made with a 200 µl pipette tip. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and fresh medium was added. Wound closure was observed immediately (0 h) using an inverted microscope (CKX53, Olympus) and at different time intervals (24 h and 36 h). Cell migration and percentage wound healing were also calculated using Sketch and CalcTM
 <sup>®</sup> along with Gimp2.10.10
 <sup>®</sup> software measuring the distance between wound closures. The experiment was independently performed in triplicates.
