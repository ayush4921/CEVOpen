<p>Further analysis for apoptosis was performed using a FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a total of 5.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> of HeLa cells were cultured before being treated with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, obtained from the MTT assay of the studied crude extracts, for 48 h. For the qualitative analysis, cells were seeded on the surface of a sterile glass coverslip placed in a twelve-well plate and incubated overnight before treatment. Treatment-free cells were grown as negative controls. Then, cells were washed twice with 1× binding buffer and further incubated for 15 min with 200 µL of the binding buffer containing Annexin V-FITC and PI in the dark. Visualization of samples was carried out using a fluorescence microscope (CKX-53 Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Apoptotic cells stained with green fluorescence and dead cells labelled with red fluorescence correlating to annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, respectively. Four random fields of view for each sample were captured.
