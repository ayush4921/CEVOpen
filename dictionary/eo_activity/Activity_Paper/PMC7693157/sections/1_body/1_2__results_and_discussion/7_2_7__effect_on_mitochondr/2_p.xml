<p>Mitochondria play an essential role in the physiological metabolism of cells and energy supply for cell survival [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) is one of the sequence processes that integrated during apoptotic pathway. Results in this study revealed that the four studied plant extracts showed significant disruption of the MMP compared to the untreated. These findings confirm that cells undergo apoptosis after treatment with these extracts by potential MMP alteration which represent is a key step in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
