<p>According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f010">Figure 10</xref>, it can be observed that no direct DNA strand breakage was caused by IC
 <sub>50</sub> levels of the three of the studied plant extracts—IC, EG and DP—compared to the untreated cells and vehicle control (0.1% DMSO). While IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the plant extract XA might interfere with low DNA damage. Several parameters including percentage of DNA in comet tail (% tail-DNA), tail length (TL), and tail moment (TM) were used in the past to monitor DNA strand-breakage with the comet assay. In this study, the percentage of tail-DNA was used to quantify DNA strand-breakage in Hela cells after 24 h of treatment with the plant extracts. Data in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, confirmed the results as IC, EG and DP exhibited percentage (% tail-DNA) &lt;10% which represent the value for undamaged nuclei, while XA shown value (% tail-DNA) of 19.04 ± 2.10% that indicate low-damaged nuclei [
