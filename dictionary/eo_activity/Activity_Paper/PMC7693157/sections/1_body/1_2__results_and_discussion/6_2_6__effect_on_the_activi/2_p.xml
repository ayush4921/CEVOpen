<p>One of the important measures that play essential roles in apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation is caspases which are a family of cysteine proteases, causing cleavage of cellular protein [

Examination of the activities of caspase 3/7 in HeLa cells with the four studied plant extracts has shown a marked increase in the activity of caspase 3/7, which confirm the effect of these extracts in apoptotic cell death as observed previously in cell cycle analysis and Annexin V.
