<p>To investigate whether the apoptosis effect induced by the four studied plant extracts is dependent upon the caspases activation, the caspase 3/7 activity examined on HeLa cells treated with the concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the four studied extracts for 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f007">Figure 7</xref>). DP expressed a significant effect on activation of caspase 3/7 up to 7.17 ± 0.72 fold compared to the untreated cells. As well, EG efficiently enhanced the caspase 3/7 activity by 5.15 ± 1.14 fold, while cells treated with XA and IC expressed an increase in the activities of caspase 3/7 by 3.60 ± 0.58 and 4.75 ± 0.92 fold compared to the untreated cells that expressed only 1.12 ± 0.19 fold increase in activity.
