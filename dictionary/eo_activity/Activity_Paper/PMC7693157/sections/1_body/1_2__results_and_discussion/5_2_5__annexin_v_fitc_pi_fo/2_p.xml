 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f006">Figure 6</xref>B–C shows the distribution of HeLa cells within four different quadrants (Q1 = early apoptosis, Q2 = late apoptosis, Q3 = necrosis, Q4 = live) and represent one of three sets of independent experiments conducted. Cells that are undergoing apoptosis will shift from the viable quadrant (Q4) to the early apoptosis quadrant (Q1), and eventually end up in late apoptosis quadrant (Q2). On the other hand, cells that undergo necrosis will shift from viable quadrant (Q4) to the late necrosis quadrant (Q3). Un-treated cells showed a percentage of 92.8 ± 1.06% for viable cells, 4.06 ± 0.73% for dead cells, 2.11 ± 0.30% for late apoptosis and 1.04 ± 0.09% for early apoptosis. XA and IC expressed increase in the late apoptotic population to 18 ± 2.08% and 7.05 ± 2.6%, respectively. While EG and DP showed significant increase in the late apoptosis to 31.50 ± 1.26% and 35.6 ± 1.42%, respectively.
