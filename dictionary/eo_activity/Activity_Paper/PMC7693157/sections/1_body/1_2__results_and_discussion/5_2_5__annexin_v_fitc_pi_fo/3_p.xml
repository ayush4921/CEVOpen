<p>As well, a considerable increase was shown in necrotic cells, with percentages of 15.30 ± 2.35%, 22.40 ± 3.82%, 16.90 ± 3.36% and 25.50 ± 4.54%, upon treatment with XA, IC, EG and DP, respectively. Lastly, early apoptotic cells, represented by Q1, displayed only a slight increase in cell distribution as a result of treatment with the studied extracts XA, IC, EG and DP to percentages of 2.51 ± 0.34%, 5.99 ± 1.36%, 7.05 ± 1.23%, 4.11 ± 0.89%, respectively. Phosphatidyl-serine (PS) on the outer layer of the plasma membrane acts as a recognition site of phagocytes during the early stage of apoptosis [

In this study, it was observed that the percentage of cells undergoing late apoptosis increased significantly, thus confirming that apoptosis was one of the major modes of cell death induced by the four studied plant extracts, especially EG and DP extracts.
