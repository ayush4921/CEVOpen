<p>Cell migration in vitro, or cell metastasis in vivo, represents one of the main features of malignant tumors that leads to increase in the mortality rate in cancer disease [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, wound-healing assay showed that the four studied plant extracts significantly inhibited the cell migration in HeLa cells when treated with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. DP and EG showed more potential and continuous effect in the inhibition of wound closure up to 36 h. These findings could represent potent anticancer agents that inhibited cancer metastasis.
