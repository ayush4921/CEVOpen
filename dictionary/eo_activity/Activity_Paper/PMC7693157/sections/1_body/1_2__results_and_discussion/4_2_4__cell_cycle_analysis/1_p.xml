<p>To investigate the mechanism of growth inhibition, the effect of the four studied crude extract on the cell cycle distribution of HeLa cells were analyzed after 48 h of the treatment of cells with the concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> obtained from the MTT assay, followed by fixation and PI staining. The cell cycle arrest was analyzed using flow cytometry. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f005">Figure 5</xref> show an obvious alteration of the distribution of different phases. The cell population was seen to be increasingly accumulated at the SubG0/G1 phase upon treatment with the studied extracts. Compared to the untreated cells that showed a percentage of 6.02 ± 1.94% in this phase, XA and IC showed a considerable increase with percentages of 18.03 ± 1.94% and 14.91 ± 1.16%, respectively, while EG and DP significantly increased the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase with percentages of 38.88 ± 2.84% and 44.51 ± 1.73%, respectively. The data showed that there was no significant change in cell arrest in all other phases. The results suggest that HeLa cells underwent apoptosis upon treatment with the studied plant extracts.
