<p>On the other hand, after 48 h treatment of the non-tumor HEK293 cells with 50 µg/mL of each crude methanol extract, there was only a negligible effect on the cell growth. The cell viability was 80.90%, 73.88%, 71.89% and 70.26% after cell treatment with XA, IC, EG and DP extracts, respectively. Only for concentrations above 100 µg/mL, a decrease by more than 50% in cell viability could be seen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Upon treatment of cells with a concentration of 100 µg/mL of EG and DP, cell viability decreased to 49.16% and 49.44%, respectively. While at a higher concentration of 200 µg/mL of XA and IC extracts, cell viability decreased to 48.05% and 47.30%, respectively. However a concentration of below 30 µg/mL could be considered safe for healthy cells with cell viability more than 90%.
