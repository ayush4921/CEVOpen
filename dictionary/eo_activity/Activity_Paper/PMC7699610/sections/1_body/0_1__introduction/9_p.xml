<p>Terpenes are the most abundant group of secondary plant metabolites; they are the main constituents of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05430" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These metabolites are biosynthesized from the mevalonate (classical) and the methylerythritol phosphate (alternative) pathways. Their basic structure is made up of isoprene units (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>), from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). From the arrangement of isoprene units, the classes of these constituents are defined as follows: monoterpenes (C
 <sub>10</sub>), sesquiterpenes (C
 <sub>15</sub>), diterpenes (C
 <sub>20</sub>), triterpenes (C
 <sub>30</sub>), and tetraterpenes (C4
 <sub>0</sub>) [
