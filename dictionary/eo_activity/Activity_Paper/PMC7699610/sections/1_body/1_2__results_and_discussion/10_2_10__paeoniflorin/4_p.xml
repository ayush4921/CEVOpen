<p>The inhibition of NF-κB p65, ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK activation correlated with a decrease in the TLR4 receptor mucosa, but not in the expression of TLR2 or TLR5. According to the in vivo results, paeoniflorin reduced the expression of TLR4, blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, and reduced the production of IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells from macrophages stimulated by LPS [
