<p>Pretreatment with all doses of carvacrol reduced abdominal hyperalgesia, colon myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, lipid peroxidation, and levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. The authors observed a reduction in macroscopic and microscopic damage (

The treatment with carvacrol induced a significant increase in catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. The antioxidant system is a set of molecules and enzymes that react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inactivate them to prevent oxidative stress [
