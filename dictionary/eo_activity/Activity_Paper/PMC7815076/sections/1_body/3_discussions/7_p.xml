<p>It has been suggested that enhanced production of free radicals and oxidative stress are central events to the development of diabetic complications. Use of antioxidants reduces oxidative stress and alleviates diabetic complications.
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Alloxan produce hyperglycemia by selective cytotoxic effect on pancreatic beta cells, via disruption of the cell membrane integrity. The pancreatic beta - cells are known to be involved in the storage, synthesis, and release of insulin, peptide hormone regulating protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. One of the intracellular phenomena for its cytotoxicity is through generation of free radicals as reviewed by Ijaola et al.

 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) to have regenerated remnants of the already Alloxan- destroyed cells. It probably prevented the destruction of beta cells of islets in the pancreas.
