<p>Alloxan is a specific toxin that destroys the pancreatic Î²-cells, provoking a state of primary deficiency in insulin without affecting other types of islets and is used in the laboratory to induce both T1DM and T2DM in animals. The diabetic effect of Alloxan is due to an excess in the production of free radicals. This excess leads to toxicity in pancreatic cells, which, in turn, reduces the synthesis and release of insulin while concurrently affecting other organs, such as the liver. Increased lipid peroxidation products and decreased plasma or tissue concentrations of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione have been well documented in the literature on Alloxan induced diabetes.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The increase in fasting blood glucose concentration is an important characteristic feature of diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, there were elevations in fasting blood glucose (FBG) level in diabetic group. The results of the present study on diabetic rats following daily oral administration for 28 days with aqueous leaves extract of 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) (dose: 250mg/kg and 500mg/kg) demonstrated significant reduction in fasted blood glucose level after 21 days of treatment. This result is in agreement with other studies.

 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) (dose: 250mg/kg and 500mg/kg) have a significant antihyperglycemic effect on Alloxan-induced diabetic rats in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
