Hence, it was thought that investigations of these medicinal properties should be scientifically authenticated to validate the traditional claims. In the present study, in order to establish the scientific basis for the utility of the said plant in the treatment of diabetes, evaluation of antihyperglycemic and pancreatic damage effects of aqueous leaves extracts were performed in Alloxan-induced diabetic rats.
