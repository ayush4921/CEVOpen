 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A review on the mode of action of flavonoids
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> discussed about the various effects of the drug candidates in regulating diabetic syndromes. It has been demonstrated that flavonoids act against diabetes mellitus either through their capacity to avoid glucose absorption (inhibition of α-glucosidase activity in the intestine), or to improve glucose tolerance. Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that flavonoids can act as insulin secretagogues or insulin mimetics, probably by influencing the pleiotropic mechanisms, to attenuate the diabetic complications, besides, the drug candidates have been found to stimulate glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, and regulate activities of enzymes involved in metabolism of carbohydrate pathway.
