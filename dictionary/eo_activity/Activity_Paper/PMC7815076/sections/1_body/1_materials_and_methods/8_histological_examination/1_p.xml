<p>The fixation process started quickly after removal of the sample. On labeling tape, label the plastic sample jar with the names of the experimental group members, date, and type of sample. The vial filled about 2/3 full with the fixative, the experimental rats were sacrificed and pancreas were removed then placed into separate vials. After overnight fixation, pancreases were washed with tap water to remove excess fixatives for several times. The water was removed from tissue block by the process of dehydration with increased concentration of ethanol 70% (2hrs), 80% (1hr), 90% (1hr), absolute alcohol (I, II and III for one and half hours each, and IV overnight). Prior to sectioning, tissue was cleared in two changes of xylene I (one and half hours) and xylene II (for two and half hours). Then tissue was infiltrated with three steps of paraffin wax I, II, and III for one and half hours, two and half hours, and overnight, respectively. After infiltration, the tissue was allowed to solidify in a mold, embedded within a small cube of paraffin forming tissue blocks, whereby each tissue block was labelled and stored at room temperature. The microtome drove a knife across the surface of the paraffin cube and produced a series of thin sections of very precise thickness.</p>
