<p>Tissue blocks were sectioned in ribbons at a thickness of 5 µm with Leica rotary microtome (LEICA RM 2125RT, Germany). The ribbons of sections were taken at every 5th section and put onto the surface of a warm water bath at temperature of 40°C. The floating ribbons over the surface of warm water were mounted onto pre cleaned slides. The slides containing paraffin wax sections were arranged within the slide holder and placed in an oven with temperature of 40°C overnight, to fix the tissue to the slides. The tissue sections were washed with tap water for five minutes and stained progressively with Harris haematoxylin for 10 minutes, then washed under running tap water for five minutes. The slides were immersed in acidic alcohol for differentiation and controlling over stained haematoxylin, for 1–3 seconds, and then put in Sodium bicarbonate until they became blue. Then, the slides were counter stained with eosin for one minute and then washed in tap water for five minutes. The sections were dehydrated with increasing alcohol concentration of 80%, 95%, absolute II and I for three minutes, each. The dehydrated sections were cleared with xylene II and I for three minutes each and permanently mounted on microscopic slides using DPX and cover slips and then observed by light microscope for investigations of any histological change, thereby the histology of the treated groups were compared with histology of the control group.
