<p>Cytotoxicity is generally used to predict potential toxicity using cultured cells that may be normal or transformed cells such as mouse peritoneal cells [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The test typically involves short-term exposure of cultured cells to test compounds to identify how the compound may affect basal or specialised cell functions, before performing toxicological studies in whole organisms. It can also provide an understanding of the carcinogenic and genotoxic nature of herb-derived substances and extracts. The capacity of a plant extract to inhibit cellular growth and viability can also be determined as an indication of its toxicity [
