<p>Toxicity testing can reveal some of the risks that may be associated with the use of medicinal plants especially in sensitive populations [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several related plants from the genus 
 <italic>Parinari</italic> have been assessed for toxicological activity in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems. These plants are 
 <italic>P. exelsa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. capensis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. congenis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic>, 
 <italic>P. campestris</italic>, and 
 <italic>N. macropylla. N. macrophylla</italic> is fairly toxic [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and phytochemicals obtained from 
 <italic>P. capensis</italic> have been found to possess potent antifungal and antimalarial effects [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>P exelsa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic>, 
 <italic>P. congenis</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. campestris</italic> are nontoxic [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Generally, most species in the genus are nontoxic and this observation aids in predicting the safety profile of 
 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> leaves. Toxicological screening using some of the most important body cells such as red blood cells and immune cells is essential in determining the plant's safety profile.
