<p>The exploration of bioactive and disease-mitigating chemical constituents from traditional medicinal plants has been gaining a tremendous amount of attention in the field of drug discovery. The qualitative analysis of the ADBB revealed the presence of phytochemical constituents such as flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, terpenoids, and carbohydrates. Awasthi and Mitra [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also reported the presence of chemical constituents such as triterpenoids (
 <italic>α</italic>-amyrin acetate, 
 <italic>β</italic>-amyrin acetate, and friedelin), steroid (
 <italic>α</italic>-spinasterol), steroid glycoside (
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside of 
 <italic>β</italic>-sitosterol), and 3
 <italic>β</italic>-palmitoxy-olea-12en-28-ol from the bark of 
 <italic>D. butyracea</italic>. These phytoconstituents are known to possess useful biological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and wound-healing actions and, as a result, have led to enormous attention in pharmaceutical industries [
