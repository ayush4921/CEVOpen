<p>The analgesic activity of ADBB was assessed using the hot plate method, which is a thermal-induced pain state model. This method is useful for demonstrating the centrally mediated analgesic activity, which predominantly focuses on changes above the spinal cord level [

 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. There was an increase in reaction time at all time points compared to baseline values within the same treatment groups. A dose-dependent increment in reaction time was observed, and the highest reaction time was noticed for 
 <italic>D. butyracea</italic> (200â€‰mg/kg), which was quite comparable to that of the standard drug diclofenac. This finding suggests that ADBB possesses centrally mediated antinociceptive activity. The analgesic activity of ADBB may be attributed to the presence of phytoconstituents such as tannins, terpenoids, glycosides, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds. Several phytoconstituents such as tannins, flavonoids, and triterpenoids were reported to possess analgesic properties [
