<p>The exact mechanism behind the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>D. butyracea</italic> is not known. However, the presence of various phytochemical constituents such as flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, and glycosides in ADBB may have contributed to its anti-inflammatory action. Many studies have reported the anti-inflammatory role of flavonoids. Flavonoids can inhibit the expression of isoforms of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase, which are responsible for the production of various inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They also inhibit the regulatory enzyme protein kinase by competitively binding to ATP at catalytic sites on the enzymes and show the inhibition of the inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Tannins are also reported to show anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX-1) enzyme [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Terpenoids are reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF- 
 <italic>α</italic>), prostaglandin synthesis, COX enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase enzymes, and cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Amyrin acetate, which is also present in the bark of 
 <italic>D. butyracea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], has been reported to possess an anti-inflammatory property by inhibiting the activity of COX-2 enzyme [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>β</italic>-sitosterol-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside has been also reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages by reducing the production of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effect of ADBB could be due to the presence of these phytoconstituents.
