<p>The analgesic activity of plant extract was determined using the hot plate method as described previously by Khatri et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the method description partly reproduces their wording. Wistar rats of different groups were treated orally with standard drug diclofenac and plant extract, as mentioned in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Rats were placed on the hot plate which was maintained at 55 ± 1°C. The latency time or reaction time was recorded before the administration of extract/standard drug (0 min) and after 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, and 180 min of extract/standard drug administration.
