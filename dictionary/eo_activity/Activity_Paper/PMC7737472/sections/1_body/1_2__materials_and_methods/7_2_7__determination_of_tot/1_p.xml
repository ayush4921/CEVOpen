<p>The total phenolic content in ADBB was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Gallic acid was used as a standard in the determination of total phenolic content. The quantitative estimation was performed with the help of the equation (
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.013
 <italic>x</italic> – 0.164) obtained from the standard curve. The total phenolic content was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram dry extract weight.
