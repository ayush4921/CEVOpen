<p>The dried bark of 
 <italic>D. butyracea</italic> (25 g) was macerated twice with distilled water in the sample to solvent ratio 1 : 7 (w/v) for 48 h at room temperature. Then, the extract obtained was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (Büchi Rotavapor, Germany) to obtain the dried extract for further study. The percentage of extract yield was calculated by using the following formula:
