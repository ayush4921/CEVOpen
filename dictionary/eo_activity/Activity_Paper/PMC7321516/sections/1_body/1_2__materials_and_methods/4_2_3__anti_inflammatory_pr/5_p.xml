<p>Alkaloids are a group of compounds that exhibit biodynamic activities in both humans and animals and possess one or more atoms of nitrogen in their heterocyclic ring [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Alkaloids are one of the largest classes of secondary metabolites in plants, and many studies have been conducted to investigate their anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A number of alkaloids, including isoquinoline, diterpene, and indole, exhibit good anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as isotetrandrine and cepharanthine have suppressive effects on the release of histamine and production of NO [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Cepharanthine further inhibited HIV replication in chronically infected monocytic cells, suppressed inflammatory cytokine production, and caused neural cell death [

 <italic>Dendrobium crepidatum</italic> inhibited the production of NO in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) activated macrophages, besides having protective effects on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A number of alkaloids possess significant anti-inflammatory properties, with some showing greater potential compared to aspirin [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The fact the 
 <italic>A. africana</italic> contains a substantial amount of alkaloids, especially in the flowers (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), could hint the potential use of this medicinal plant in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
