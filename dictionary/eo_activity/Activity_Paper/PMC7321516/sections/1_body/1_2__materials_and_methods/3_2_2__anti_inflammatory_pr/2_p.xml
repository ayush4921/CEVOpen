<p>In a study that evaluated the systemic anti-inflammatory effect, hexane extract of

 <italic>africana</italic> significantly inhibited (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that acute inflammatory responses were suppressed by the hexane extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic>. The anti-inflammatory effect of the extract could be due to inhibition of the release of and/or actions on a number of chemical mediators, including histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostanoids, and kinins, which play key roles in the mediation of acute inflammation induced by phlogistic agents [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] further investigated and found that the hexane extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> effectively suppressed acute inflammation during the exudative phase. Hexane extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> significantly inhibited (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] also observed that the hexane extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> relieved rheumatic pain and suppressed the inflammatory response initiated due to tissue injury.
