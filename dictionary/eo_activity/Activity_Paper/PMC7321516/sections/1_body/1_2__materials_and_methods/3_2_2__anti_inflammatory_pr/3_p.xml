<p>In another study, ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> at a dose of 146.97 mg/kg prevented the formation of carrageenan-induced edema in rats, indicating significant (
 <italic>p</italic>=0.05) anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The study further stated that the extract also reduced paw size to 5.70 ± 0.16 mm from 6.75 ± 0.09 mm. The possible mechanism of action of the extract is inhibition of the action of serotonin and histamine or the synthesis of cyclooxygenase, since the inflammation caused by carrageenan is closely linked to the action of prostaglandins [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] emphasized that the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of action of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. africana</italic> were similar to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, indomethacin, and aspirin.
