<p>Analysis of the phytochemical composition of the plant indicates that the species is rich in a broad range of secondary metabolites, explaining its efficacy in treating inflammation-related diseases as well as other health conditions affecting different African communities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The therapeutic phytochemicals in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> include flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, sterols, phenolic compounds, and glycosides (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Essential oils from the leaves of the plant are rich in monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, and germacrene, which are important therapeutic ingredients [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The broad range of antimicrobial and biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, haemostatic, oxytocic, gastroprotective, antiulcer, wound healing, anticancer, antihypertensive, and antidiabetic potentials may be attributed to these groups of active therapeutic components of the plant [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Typical secondary metabolites in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> that exhibit great anti-inflammatory potential include monoterpenes such as carene, terpenes including 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, and sesquiterpenes such as 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene and tannins among others (
