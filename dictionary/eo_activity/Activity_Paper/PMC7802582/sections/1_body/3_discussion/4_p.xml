<p>The essential oil had an inhibitory action on the multiplication of the parasite with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9.94 µg μg/ml. The reduction in the number of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites was concentration‐dependent. In a previous study, the anti‐
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> activity of nutmeg essential oil was demonstrated with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 24.49 µg μg/ml. Other studies have shown that the extract of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> had antimicrobial activities but also cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Furthermore, according to these earlier studies, essential oils of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> were more potent against Gram‐positive bacteria (Orlanda &amp; Nascimento, 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The essential plant oil was thought to have effects on parasites such as 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, and this was proved in the current study. Although further tests on its efficacy at large scales are necessary, the present study shows the potential of 
 <italic>D. kotschy</italic> essential oil as an alternative treatment. These in vitro pharmacological data attribute to the essential oil a potent anti‐
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> activity coupled with an absence of toxicity to the host. There are no previous published studies on the effect of the essential oil against the RH strain of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> in a mouse model. In this study, the mouse model, we found that essential oil significantly reduced the parasite number.
