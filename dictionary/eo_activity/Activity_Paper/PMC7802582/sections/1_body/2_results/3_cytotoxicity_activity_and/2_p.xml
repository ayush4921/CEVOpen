<p>The MTT assay showed that different concentrations of both essential oils of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> had no cytotoxicity comparatively with the negative control cells (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Thus, positive control and different concentrations of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> were used for further experiments against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> in vitro.
