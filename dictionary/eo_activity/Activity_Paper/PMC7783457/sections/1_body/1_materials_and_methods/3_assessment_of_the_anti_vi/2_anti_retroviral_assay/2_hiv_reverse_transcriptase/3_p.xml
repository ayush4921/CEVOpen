<p id="p0035">Reaction mix consisted of 20 μL diluted HIV-1-RT (6 ng) to which 20 μl of ‘BhAVI-23’ extract was added with varying concentrations. The mixture was incubated for 5 min followed by addition of 20 μl of reaction mixture containing dNTPs, template and primers in a reaction buffer. The samples were incubated (1 h at 37 °C) at room temperature. HIV-1-RT (6 ng, 20 μL) without any extract acted as a positive control. Post incubation, whole reaction mix (60 μL) was transferred into streptavidin coated well of micro-plate, and mixture was further incubated (1 h, 37 °C) in dark. After the removal of solution, wells were gently washed using washing buffer. 200 μL working solution of anti-DIG-POD (digoxigenin-peroxidase) was added per well followed by plate incubation (37 °C, 1 h). After the incubation, the wells were washed with washing buffer. Finally, to each well 200 μL of ABTS substrate solution was added and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Quantification of the sample absorbance was done employing a microplate reader at 405 nm.</p>
