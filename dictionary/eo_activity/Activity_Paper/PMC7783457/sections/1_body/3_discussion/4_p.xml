<p id="p0105">Different compounds detected during head-space analysis have been reported for their anti-viral activities. Tumerones detected have been reported to have activity against H5N1 influenza virus, whereas, coumarins have been shown to possess activity against RNA viruses like HCV, HIV and influenza virus. Eugenol has been found to display direct inhibitory activity against both intracellular and extracellular viruses including Herpes Simplex virus [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Carvacrol has been reported to be active against HSV-1 by direct inhibition of virus particle. This compound possessed anti-murine norovirus activity too [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The α and β-pinene detected are naturally found in black cumin and clove, respectively. The α-pinene has been reported to display prominent antiviral activity against IBV, SARS-CoV as well as HSV-1 [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The β-myrcene detected possessed anti HSV-1 activity [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Besides, linalool which was detected in the infusion has been reported earlier for its activity against Influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recently, antiviral activities of borneol and isoborneol derivatives against Influenza A virus has been reported [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Terpinen-4-ol found has been reported for its significant activity against Influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thymoquinones and curcumin have been reported for their antiviral activity and could boost immune response [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Curcumin has also been reported for its potential health importance in severe pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Cinnamaldehyde was one of the major compounds detected in ‘BhAVI-23’ infusion and shown to inhibit adenovirus type 3 &amp; influenza A/PR/8 virus in earlier reports [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Selection of target proteins of virus for docking study is an important step during evaluation of compounds for antiviral activity. Different viral proteins are responsible for crucial functions in viral entry, replication and its assembly and spread to other host cells. Main protease (Mpro) is required to cleave the polyprotein into different nonstructural proteins required for viral activity. Spike protein is required for recognition and high affinity binding with the functional ACE-2 receptor of the host cell while endoribonuclease degrades polyuridine sequence of viral RNA to prevent detection of virus by host immune cells [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. RNA dependent RNA polymerase is required to generate multiple copies of viral genome. Different researchers have carried out 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> docking analysis of number of essential oil compounds for the SARS CoV-2 proteins mentioned above.[
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] These include the major compounds detected in BhAVI-23 extract. β-myrcene showed highest docking score (−98.7 kJ/mol) normalized for molecular weight with main protease. In case of endoribonuclease, endo-borneol showed highest docking score (−91.8 kJ/mol), while for rest of the 4 proteins, eugenol showed highest docking score [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Docking study exclusively for eucalyptol with main protease has been reported earlier [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. They obtained full fitness as well as binding affinity values of −2291.07 and −6.04 kcal/mol, respectively. They concluded that eucalyptol showed significantly high binding affinity, however, further validation is required to confirm the interaction of eucalyptol with main protease [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Screening of different natural derivatives of coumarin for the selective inhibition of Mpro has also been performed earlier and the ΔG values ranged from −6.80 to −8.57 kcal/mol [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Besides, in another docking study thymoquinones displayed binding affinity values for COVID-19 Mpro and ACE-2 as −4.7 and −5.5 kcal/mol, respectively [
