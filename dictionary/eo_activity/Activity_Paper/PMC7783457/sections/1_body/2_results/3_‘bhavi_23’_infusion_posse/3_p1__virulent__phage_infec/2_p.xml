<p id="p0075">P1 virulent phage is a temperate bacteriophage that is known to infect 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and some other bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A novel P1 virulent bacteriophage based qualitative screening assay was employed to further assess the antiviral potential of the ‘BhAVI-23’ infusion and the observations are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> . Almost complete absence of growth of bacteria 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was observed when phage and bacteria were co-incubated together indicative of complete lysis of host bacteria (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Interestingly, ‘BhAVI-23’ extract inhibited the infectivity of P1 (vir) bacteriophage as manifested by reduced plaque forming ability at the non-cytotoxic concentration of 1.75% of the infusion resulting in almost comparable bacterial growth (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The negative control (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> co-incubated with BhAVI-23 extract) is displayed in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D. These observations further corroborated the anti-retroviral activity as mentioned above.
