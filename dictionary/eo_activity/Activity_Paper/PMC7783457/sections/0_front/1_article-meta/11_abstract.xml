  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Viruses cause many life threatening human diseases. Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health care systems worldwide. As a disease preventive approach and to bring relief to the severity of the symptoms, a infusion termed as Bhabha Anti-Viral Infusion-23 (‘BhAVI-23’) was conceptualized and formulated which comprised of 23 selected spices and herbals.</p>

  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro antiviral potential of the formulation, BhaAVI-23.</p>

  <title>Material and Methods</title>
  <p>The 
   <italic>in-vitro</italic> anti-viral potential of BhAVI-23 was assessed through inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as through a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriphage based screening assay system. Anti-diabetic potential was assessed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and the bioactive volatile components were detected through headspace gas chromatography followed by molecular docking analysis.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The infusion displayed prominent anti-viral activity as evident from significant (57%) inhibition of the HIV1-RT as well as through reduction in the infectivity of P1 (virulent) bacteriophage. The infusion also exerted profound protection (∼64%) to non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin. Headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of at least 47 major compounds. Docking analysis indicated possible interaction of α-pinene and eugenol with SARS-CoV spike protein.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>This ‘BhAVI-23’ infusion displayed prominent 
   <italic>in-vitro</italic> anti-viral and anti-diabetic potential in different model systems. These attributes have relevance as diabetic patients are more prone to COVID-19 morbidity. ‘BhAVI-23’ opens the avenue for its potential inclusion as a supportive health care system upon due regulatory approval during the current pandemic.
