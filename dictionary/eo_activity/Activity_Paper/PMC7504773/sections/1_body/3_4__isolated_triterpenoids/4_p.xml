<p>In a similar way, three oleanane type triterpenoids; euphorimaoid A and euphorimaoid B, were reported from the aerial parts of

 <italic>E. alatavica</italic> by Rushangul et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] resulted in the isolation of nine compounds, including alatavolide and alatavoic acid reported for the first time.
