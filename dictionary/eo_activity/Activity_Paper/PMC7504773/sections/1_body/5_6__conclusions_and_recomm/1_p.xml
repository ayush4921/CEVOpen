<p>In this review, we report the ethnomedicinal, phytochemistry, and anticancer studies of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, with an emphasis on triterpenoids and their anticancer properties. Traditionally, 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species have been used for the management of several diseases and ailments ranging from infectious to chronic diseases such as cancer. Their successes have been attributed to the chemical diversity of their isoprenoid constituents such as triterpenoids. As a result, several studies have reported the isolation of different classes of triterpenoids with the majority of them being taraxanes, euphane, tiricallane, cycloartanes, oleanane, and some with rare skeletal structures such as eupulcherol A. This enriches the structural diversity of the 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species. These triterpenoids have also been demonstrated to be cytotoxic via different mechanisms of action, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and inhibition of excessive metastasis production of reactive oxygen and effects on angiogenesis.
