 <italic>(Euphorbiaceae</italic>) and contains several other subgenera and sections with over 2000 species [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The species in this genus, and to a larger extent of the spurge family, are characterized by the production of a milky irritant latex [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genus consists of species of great economic importance, which makes it a complex genus with great research potential.
