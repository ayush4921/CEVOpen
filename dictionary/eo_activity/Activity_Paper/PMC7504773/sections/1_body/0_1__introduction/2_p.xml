<p>Their successes in traditional medicine usage have been attributed to a wide variety of chemical compositions of its members, such as essential oils, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons [

As a result, these chemical constituents are now providing lead compounds for drug discovery because of their therapeutic applications, such as cytotoxic, antitumor, antiviral properties, multi-drug-resistance-reversing, and anti-inflammatory activities as well as their great structural diversity, resulting from various polycyclic and macrocyclic skeletons, including but not limited to jatrophane, ingenane, daphnane, tigliane, lathyrane [
