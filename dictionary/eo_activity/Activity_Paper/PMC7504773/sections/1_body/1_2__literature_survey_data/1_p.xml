<p>In order to investigate the ethnomedicinal uses, biological activities, and isolated triterpenoids of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, an extensive online literature search was conducted using terms like ‘
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> medicinal uses’ and ‘
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> triterpenoids’ on the online databases such as Scifinder, Springer Link, Scopus, Wiley online, PubMed, science Direct, and Google Scholar. The search resulted in over 900 reports mainly of the English language, which we accessed at our institution. The reports contained information of early documents and reviews on 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> uses dating back to ancient times as well as current reports. The retrieved information was conceptualized, carefully read, critically analyzed searched for explanations of medicinal uses of 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, their biological activities, isolated triterpenoids, and their pharmacological properties. Correct plant names were further confirmed from the plant list. Hence, the results presented in the current review are interpreted, analyzed, and documented only in the context of the literature information obtained.
