<p>Thethiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay of cycloart-23(
 <italic>E</italic>)-ene-3β- 25-diol (
 <bold>62</bold>) exhibited significant activity on MDA-MB468 cell line (LD50 = 2.05 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), while cycloart-23(
 <italic>Z</italic>)-ene-3β,25-diol (
 <bold>63</bold>) was the most active compound on the MCF-7 cell line (LD50 = 5.4 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). [

 <italic>E. resinifera</italic> against MCF-7, U937, and C6 cancer cell lines, using paclitaxel as a positive control also revealed that 11

 <italic>β</italic>-ol (
 <bold>37</bold>) displayed the highest potency against MCF-7, U937, and C6 with IC50 values of 37.36, 47.17, and 46.89 μM, respectively. These observations suggest that introducing a hydroperoxy group in the structure of 11
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroperoxyeupha-8, 24-diene-3
 <italic>β</italic>-ol (
 <bold>37</bold>) may inhibit its cytotoxic activity [
