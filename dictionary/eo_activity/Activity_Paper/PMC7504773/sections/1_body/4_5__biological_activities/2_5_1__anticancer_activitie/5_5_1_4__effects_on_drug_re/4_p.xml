<p>Other studies have shown that lupenone (

 <bold>100</bold>) inhibited the MCF-7 cells activity, which was consistent with the previous studies. In addition, it showed significant inhibition of tyrosinase with IC50 values of 71.4 μM [

Nevertheless, further studies revealed that the compound excites the melanogenesis in B16 2F2 and B16 melanoma cells through the activation of tyrosinase enzyme expression. This expression occurs through the nitrogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases phosphorylation [

 <italic>E. ebracteolata</italic> triterpenoid, ebracpenes B displayed modest activity with an IC50 value of 0.89 μM against lipase. On further analysis, it was found to exhibit competitive inhibition for binding sites of lipase [
