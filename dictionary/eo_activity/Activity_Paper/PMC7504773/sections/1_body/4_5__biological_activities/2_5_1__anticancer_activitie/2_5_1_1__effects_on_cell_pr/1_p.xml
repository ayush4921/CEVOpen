<p>As a common feature, cancer undergoes uninhibited simple differentiation and proliferation of cells resulting in complex and abnormal cell division, progression, and multiplication [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Hence, an effect on this change is a better strategy in finding cancer treatment. Studies on the ability of kansenone (
 <bold>27</bold>) triterpenoid, isolated from 
 <italic>E. kansui</italic> to express suppression of cell proliferation were performed by Fangfang et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. From the results, kansenone (
 <bold>27</bold>) not only exhibited significant anticancer activities against the cancer cells but also showed cell arrest at the G0/G1 phase. It was further demonstrated to damage the mitochondria as well as up-regulating the apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. From the observations, they concluded that kansenone (
 <bold>27</bold>) causes cell death (apoptosis) by inducing damage to mitochondria and cell receptor death.
