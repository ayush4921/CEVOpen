<p>Furthermore, the anticancer screening of new tetra-hydroxylated triterpenoid (1
 <bold>27</bold>–
 <bold>130</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>E. sieboldiana</italic> was studied. The results revealed that a pentacyclic triterpenoid (
 <bold>127</bold>) inhibited growth of HeLa cells with reduced toxicity. Cell growth and cell proliferation inhibition observed for this compound was attributed to the G1 phase arrest. It was also found to cause stimulation of apoptosis in cervical carcinoma. Further studies showed that the compound deactivates the tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced IKK phosphorylation NF-kappa B (TNF-α–TAK1–IKK-NF-κB) axis, and further inhibited and regulated the NF-κB target genes involved in cell death and cell growth. The effect of this compound on NF-κB of the test cells was; however, found to be through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The destruction of migratory HeLa cells was further deduced from the observations made. From the findings, they concluded that since the compound shows potential anticancer activities, it could be a good anticancer agent [
