<p>The biological evaluation of isolated compounds from

 <italic>Z</italic>-decadienoyl)-20-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylingenol (1 μg/mL) killed all the embryos it was tested against. While for those that survived, pericardial edema was witnessed when they were treated with a reduced concentration of the test compound [

 <italic>E. helioscopia</italic> have been reported to exhibit good anti-inflammatory inhibition activities in murine microglial cellosaurus (BV-2) cells which are associated with inflammation disorders. This study relates to usage of this species in traditional medicine for treatment of anti-inflammatory infections. Hence, the species could be used for the discovery of anti-inflammatory drugs [
