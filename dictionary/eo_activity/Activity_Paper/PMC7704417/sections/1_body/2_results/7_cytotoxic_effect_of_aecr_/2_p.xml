 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> indicates the cytotoxicity of AECR-AuNPs on colorectal cancer (Caco-2) cells. At 24 h, the % viability of cells treated with AECR-AuNPs were significantly increased and decreased (p &lt; 0.05) when compared to 5´-Flurouracil and the vehicle control, respectively, at all concentrations tested. It was noted that higher concentrations (125 and 250 μg/mL) of AECR-AuNPs were cytotoxic, with less than 50 % cell viabilities. However, at 48 h, there were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) in the % cell viability of cells treated with higher concentrations of AECR-AuNPs (62.5, 125 and 250 μg/mL) when compared to the 5´-Flurouracil. A significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in the % cell viability was observed in cells treated with all tested concentrations of AECR-AuNPs, as well as 5´-Flurouracil when compared to the vehicle control.
