 <sup>−1</sup> for the AECR. Similar compounds were present in the spectra of both AECR-AuNPs and AECR, however a slight shift was noted in the AECR-AuNPs peaks when compared to the AECR. The 3350.83 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> band peak in the FTIR spectra corresponds to O—H stretch in AECR which shifted to 3281.03 cm
