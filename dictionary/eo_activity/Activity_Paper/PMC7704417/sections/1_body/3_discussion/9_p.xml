 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, further suggests the use of

 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] on the chemopreventive potential of 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaf fortified diet against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea induced colorectal cancer in rats. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of the AECR-AuNPs against breast cancer (MCF-7) and colorectal cancer (Caco-2) cells were more evidenced at higher concentrations (125 and 250 μg/mL) at 24 h, and at all concentrations tested at 48 h (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The AECR-AuNPs was however more sensitive to the Caco-2 cells than the MCF-7 both at 24 and 48 h. In comparing the effect of AECR-AuNPs to the standard drugs (Fulvestrant and 5´- Fluorouracil) used for both cell lines, the AECR-AuNPs showed good cytotoxic activities, and thus can be used as possible anti-cancer agent. The enhanced cytotoxic effect of AECR-AuNPs against MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells could be due to the presence of phytochemicals on the surface of the AECR-AuNPs, and the small size of the AuNPs which aids their uptake by the cells.
