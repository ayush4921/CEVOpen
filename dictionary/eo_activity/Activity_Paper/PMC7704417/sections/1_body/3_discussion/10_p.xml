<p id="par0205">To confirm the cytotoxic effect of the AECR-AuNPs on both cell lines as demonstrated in the MTT viability assay, the cellular morphology was investigated using an inverted light microscope. Plant synthesized gold nanoparticles have been reported to induce cancer cell death by means of apoptotic properties including membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage and morphology changes and chromatin condensation [

 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) indicates that the treatment is cytotoxic to the cells. These changes were however more pronounced in the Caco-2 cells at 24 h. This confirms the MTT cytotoxicity results where treatment with AECR-AuNPs was more sensitive to Caco-2 cells. The cytotoxic effect of AECR-AuNPs on MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells, as demonstrated by changes in the cell morphology, suggest that the AECR-AuNPs can be used as possible therapeutic agent for both breast and colorectal cancers.
