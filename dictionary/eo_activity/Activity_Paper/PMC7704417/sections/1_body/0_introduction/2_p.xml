<p id="par0025">Cancer is a disease in which genes responsible for the regulation of cell cycle are compromised [

Consequently, the cells keep proliferating and eventually form a growth or tumour which can obstruct blood flow or exert immense pressure on neighbouring tissues, thereby preventing their normal functions. Parts of the tumour can dissociate from the primary tumour and metastasize to another area in the body where a new growth develops [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Developing an effective cancer therapy has been challenging due to high rates of metastasis. Chemotherapy is available for cancer treatment, but the major limitation is low specificity, and thereby affecting normal tissue as well [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although surgery is the first line of therapy for certain cancers, such as colon and breast cancers. In some, surgery is not always possible or must still be followed by chemotherapy, to assure the extinction of all tumour cells. Radiation therapy also can damage nearby tissue. There is thus an increasing demand for targeted anticancer therapy with less effect on healthy tissues.
