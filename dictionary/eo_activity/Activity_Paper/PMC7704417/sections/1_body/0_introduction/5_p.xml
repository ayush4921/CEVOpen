<p id="par0040">Studies have demonstrated cytotoxicity of medicinal plant-mediated AuNPs against different cancer cells [

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>], this potential could be linked to the naturally-inherent phytochemicals in the plant and the specificity afforded by the AuNPs. The use of AuNPs synthesized by means of medicinal plant extract has two advantages: firstly, that the phytochemicals responsible for its medicinal characteristics may become part of the AuNPs, and secondly, the nanoparticles reside longer in the tumor than medicinal plant extract and therefore will have a superior effect. The leaky walls of blood capillaries in tumors and lack of an effective draining system in most tumors [
