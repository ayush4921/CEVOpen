<p id="par0095">The reducing power assay was carried out according to a method described by Oyaizu [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Each sample (2.5 mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M) and 2.5 mL potassium ferricyanide (1%), and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Then, 2.5 mL trichloroacetic acid solution (100 mg/L) was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant (5 mL) was mixed with 5 mL distilled water and 1 mL 0.1 % ferric chloride solution, and the absorbance was read at 700 nm against blank. The reducing power was calculated from a standard curve obtained using varying concentrations of quercetin (0.2–1 mg/mL), and the results presented in mg quercetin equivalent per g extract.
