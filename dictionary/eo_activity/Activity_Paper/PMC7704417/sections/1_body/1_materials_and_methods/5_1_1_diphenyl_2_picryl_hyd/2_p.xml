<p id="par0085">The radical scavenging activity of AECR and AECR-AuNPs was performed using the DPPH assay, according to a method by Shirwaikar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with some modifications. Two mL each of AECR, AECR-AuNPs or quercetin (standard) was added to 2 mL 0.1 mM DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> (in methanol). An equal volume of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> and methanol served as a control. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 30 °C for 20 min, and the absorbance read at 517 nm. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the samples was calculated as follows:
