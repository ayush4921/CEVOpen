 <italic>C. rubens</italic> (1 mL, 3.125 mg/mL) was added to 4 mL aqueous solution of tetrachloroauric acid (1 mM) on a hot plate, with continuous stirring, at 50 °C for 20 min. The synthesized nanoparticles were washed twice with distilled water by centrifugation at 12,000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to remove excess and unbound plant material in the reaction mixture. The synthesized biogenic AuNPs were then freeze-dried to obtain a powdered form, and stored at −20 °C.
