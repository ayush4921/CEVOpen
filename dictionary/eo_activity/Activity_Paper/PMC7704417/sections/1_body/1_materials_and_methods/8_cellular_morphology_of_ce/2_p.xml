<p id="par0110">The cellular morphological changes of MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells treated with AECR-AuNPs at 24 were examined using an inverted light microscope. The cells were grown in a 12-well culture plate to 70 % confluence for 24 h, and the spent media was removed from each well. The cells were then treated with the highest concentration of AECR-AuNPs (250 μg/mL) or with positive controls. DMSO (0.1 %) was used as vehicle control for both cells. Cell morphology of both cell lines was examined at 24 h treatment with AECR-AuNPs for possible morphological changes. The cells images were taken at x20 magnification on an inverted light microscope (ZEISS Axio Vert.A1, USA).</p>
