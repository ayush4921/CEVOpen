 <p>The lipophilic compounds product (LCP), which was isolated and purified from 
  <italic>Eucalyptus viminalis</italic> plants, has shown earlier broad antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. To study secondary compounds responsible for the pharmacological activities, chemical composition of the LCP was studied with application of ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined with photodiode array detector and high-resolution Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (UPLC-PDA-HRMS/MS). There were found thirty two compounds: twenty phloroglucinol derivatives (isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol, macrocarpals, sideroxylonals, etc.), eight ursane type triterpenoids (loxanic acid, dehydroursolic acid lactone, dehydroursolic acid lactone acetate, two isomers of p-coumaroyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone and two isomers of feruloyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone), sequiterpenoid (S)-Î²-macrocarpene and three unknown phenolics. The major compounds of the LCP were pharmacologically active macrocarpals A and B, dehydroursolic acid lactone and its derivatives. It is supposed that previously discovered antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of the LCP is due to the high contents of these secondary compounds.
