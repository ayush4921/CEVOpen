<p id="p0135">There are many speculations regarding of the initial compound in the biosynthesis pathway of various phloroglucinol derivatives, but the experimental biochemical evidences were not obtained yet. It was assumed that their precursor can be 4,6-diformyl-2-isopentanoyl-phloroglucinol (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Shang et al., 2016</xref>), jensenone and grandinol, or both compounds together (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brezáni and Šmejkal, 2013</xref>). Since most macrocarpals are adducts of isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol with various moieties of mono- and sesquiterpenes, it seems that the more likely precursor of phloroglucinol derivatives is precisely isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At least this assumption is justified enough for the biosynthesis of various macrocarpals and sideroxylonals in

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al. (2019)</xref>, where most phloroglucinol derivatives of different Eucalyptus species were identified as various macrocarpals and sideroxylonal A.
