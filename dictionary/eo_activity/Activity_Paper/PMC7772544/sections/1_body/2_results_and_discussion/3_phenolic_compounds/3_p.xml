<p id="p0095">Fourteen phloroglucinol derivatives were tentatively identified as macrocarpals (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Their mass-spectra contained major m/z value that corresponded to the [M−H]
 <sup>-</sup> ion and intensive MS/MS fragment of parent ion with m/z 207.03 [C10H7O5]
 <sup>-</sup>, which is a diagnostic ion for this group of phloroglucinol derivatives (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Eyles et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Okba et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of the diagnostic fragment indicates that all detected macrocarpals have the same phenolic unit isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol and differ only in the mono- or sesquiterpene part of the molecules (
