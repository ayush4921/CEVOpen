<p id="p0070">Based on the high-resolution measurement of ions with Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS in the negative and positive scan mode, the elemental compositions of the monoisotopic masses of detected compounds were calculated with the maximum tolerance of mass error at 2 ppm. The UV and MS spectral data (measured [M-H]
 <sup>−</sup> or [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> and MS/MS fragments of the parent ion) were applied for identification or tentative characterization of the compounds with application of mass-spectrometry databases “Metlin” (
