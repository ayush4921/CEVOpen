<p id="p0065">The UPLC system was combined with a Thermo Fisher Scientific high resolution Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer 2.5 equipped with heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. The mass spectrometer operated in negative or in positive ionization mode and ions scanned in the range m/z 150–2000. The HESI conditions were as follows: sheath gas flow rate was set at 60, the auxiliary gas flow rate at 20, spray voltage at 3 kV, capillary temperature at 380 °C, and S-lens RF level at 60.0. The settings for full scan mode were: microscans 1, resolution 140,000 FWHM (full MS) and 34,599 FWHM (data dependent MS2). AGC target 3 × 106 and maximum IT 200 ms. Pierce™ ESI negative ion and Pierce™ ESI positive ion calibration solutions (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) were used to the mass-spectrometer calibration. The data was processed with Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser software (Version 3.0.63, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).</p>
