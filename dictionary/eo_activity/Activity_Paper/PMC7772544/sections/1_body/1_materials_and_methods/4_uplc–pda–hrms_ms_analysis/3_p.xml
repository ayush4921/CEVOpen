<p id="p0060">The UPLC system (Acquity UPLC® 2.9.0, Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) consisted of a sample manager, a binary solvent manager, and a photodiode array detector (PDA). The Acquity UPLC® BEH Phenyl column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters Corporation, Wexford, Ireland) was used. Two eluents, 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) were used in a gradient program: 0–0.5 min, 0.1 % B in A; 0.5–10.0 min, 0.1–95.0 % B in A (linear gradient); 10.0–13.0 min, 95.0 % B in A (isocratic); 13–15 min, washing and stabilization of the column. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and the injection volume was 5 μl. The PDA detector operated in the range 190–500 nm.</p>
