<p>In the THF-6 group, patients took two capsules of THF-6 (250 mg/capsule) and one placebo diclofenac tablet three times a day after meals. In the diclofenac group, patients took two placebo THF-6 capsules and one diclofenac tablet (25 mg/tablet) three times a day after meals. Enrolled patients were instructed to avoid other analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs (including other NSAIDs), and other treatment modalities (e.g., acupuncture) while participating in the trial. Omeprazole tablets (20 mg/tablet) were prepared as rescue therapy in case of adverse gastrointestinal consequences following the administration of the study drugs. Patients were prematurely withdrawn from the trial if they developed intolerable knee pain necessitating other medications or treatment modalities, used other analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs, had severe adverse drug reactions or allergic reactions to the study drugs, or were lost to follow-up.</p>
