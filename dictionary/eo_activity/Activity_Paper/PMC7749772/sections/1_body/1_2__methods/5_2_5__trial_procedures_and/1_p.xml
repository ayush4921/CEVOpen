<p>The trial consisted of a one-week run-in phase followed by a four-week treatment phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the one-week run-in period, eligible patients were instructed to discontinue all pain relief medications (including NSAIDs and other analgesics). At the beginning of the treatment phase, eligible patients with at least moderate pain intensity were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either THF-6 (1,500 mg/day) or diclofenac (75 mg/day) (

The treatment group assignment was based on a randomization list prepared in advance by independent research staff with the use of a computer-based random number generator. Sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes containing the list were employed to safeguard allocation concealment. The envelopes were opened only after each patient had met the eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in phase. Both patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment allocation.
