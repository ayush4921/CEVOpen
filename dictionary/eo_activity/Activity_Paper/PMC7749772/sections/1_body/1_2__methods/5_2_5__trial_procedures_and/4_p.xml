<p>The primary efficacy metric was the change from baseline in knee pain as measured by a horizontal 100 mm VAS (rated on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse knee pain) [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The secondary efficacy outcomes included VAS stiffness (rated on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe stiffness), a 10-step stair climb test (SCT) (time in seconds to ascend and descend a flight of 10 steps) [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (which included 42 items across five domains; each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale and transformed to a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer knee problems) [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the patient's and the physician's opinions of overall improvement on a 100 mm VAS (rated on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better improvement). In patients with bilateral osteoarthritis of the knee, efficacy outcomes were assessed only for the knee with worse symptoms at baseline.
