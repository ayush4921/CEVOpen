<p>With 69 patients per group, the trial was estimated to have 90% power at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 based on a noninferiority margin of 10 [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and assuming a mean difference (MD) of 0 and a standard deviation (SD) of 20 [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Anticipating a 30% premature discontinuation or poor compliance, a total of 200 patients (100 per group) were planned to be enrolled in this trial.
