<p>The MIC and MBC values of the total plant root extract and fractions against the tested microorganisms are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. The results showed effective antibacterial activity of the root extract of 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> against the microorganisms. We observed low or no antibacterial activity from the aqueous and chloroformic extracts of the plant root. The methanol extract was used for fractionation and phytochemical analysis. In most cases, the ethyl acetate fraction of the methanolic extract showed a better antibacterial response against the tested bacterial strains.
