<p>The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> root exhibited significant activity against all tested bacterial strains, especially MRSA isolates. Compared to other studies, we additionally performed the fractionation procedure to obtain pure extracts. After the 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> crude extracts were fractionated, and the MIC and MBC values were measured for each fraction, all tested bacterial strains showed sensitivity to the ethyl acetate fraction (third fraction). Compared with the crude extract, the third fraction showed better antibacterial activity against almost all tested bacterial strains. However, of the fractions, petroleum ether fraction (first fraction) and dichloromethane fraction (second fraction) represented no antibacterial activities. Similar to the third fraction, the fourth methanolic extract fraction also showed antibacterial activity against MRSA and 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>. But, the antibacterial activity of the third fraction was higher than the fourth fraction.
