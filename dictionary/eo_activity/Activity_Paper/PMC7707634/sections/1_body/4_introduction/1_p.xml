<p>Major burn wounds can be a traumatic injury, and the affected patients need immediate treatment to limit potential complications and even death.

 </sup> Burn injuries initially damage the skin; the first barrier against various pathogens. Skin damage along with diminished local and systemic immune responses creates an environment for pathogens to colonize and grow rapidly on the burn wound surface. Infections and sepsis are the leading causes of death in patients with burn injuries.

 </sup> The burn wound surface provides a favorable environment for microbial colonization and proliferation.

 </sup> Typically, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic> (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>) are the first bacterial invaders to colonize the burn wound surface, followed by various bacteria from normal gut flora and infections during hospitalization.

 </sup> The mortality rate due to sepsis is high in patients with burn injuries. This is a type of body reaction that can eventually lead to death by triggering a syndrome known as multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.

 </sup> The discovery of multidrug-resistant organisms has encouraged researchers to seek novel drugs with higher efficiency, higher safety, and particularly lower costs.
