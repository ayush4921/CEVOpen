<p>According to the previously described protocol with some modifications [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00403" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the whole sunflower receptacles were ground into fine powder (1.5 kg) and extracted with the optimal extraction conditions. All filtrates were collected and dried to obtain crude extracts of 186 g. One hundred and fifty of gram of the crude extracts were suspended into water, three solvents (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol) with increasing polarities were successively used to partition plant extracts, the partitioning of each solvent was operated three times, the extract liquor were collected and concentrated by vacuum distillation at 60 °C, 0.8 MPa for 3–4 h. The remaining water was removed by using freeze dryer (Alpha 1-2 LD plus, Christ, Germany) with −52 °C, 0.052 mbar for 72 h. The dry fractions were obtained and recorded as petroleum ether fraction (PEF), ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), n-butanol fraction (nBUF) and water fraction (WAF). Then rutin was used as the standard to measure the flavonoids contents of dry fractions. All fractions were stored in airtight containers in the dark at −20 °C before use.
