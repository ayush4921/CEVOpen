   <p>RP-C18 column (150 × 210 mm, 1.8 μm; Welch) was used. The mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A) to 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (B). Gradient elution proceeded as follows: 0–0.5 min, 98% A; 0.5–6.5 min, 98% A → 2% A; 6.5–9 min, 2% A → 2% A; 9–9.3 min, 2% A → 98% A; 9.3–10 min, 98% A → 98% A). The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. Autosampler temperature was 10.0 °C, column temperature was 35 °C; injection needle height was 2.00 mm, and injection volume was 10 µL.</p>
