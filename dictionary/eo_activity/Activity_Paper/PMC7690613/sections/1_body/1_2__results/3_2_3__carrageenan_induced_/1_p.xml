<p>The anti-inflammatory effects of saffron ethanolic extracts was investigated by the mouse paw-edema test, and the findings are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01414-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Sub planter injection of carrageenan gradually increased edema paw volume of the saline-treated animals. However, as a positive control, diclofenac potassium attenuated paw edema volume by 88.87%, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01414-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Moreover, oral administration of saffron ethanolic extracts showed a significant (

SEE (800 mg/kg) produced an anti-inflammatory activity 1 h after administration and continued until the end of the experimentation, with the most prominent inhibition of 77.33% followed by PEE (70.50%) at the fourth h of the study. LEE and CEE exhibited moderate but significant (
