<p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of CEE, LEE, SEE, and PEE from in vivo grown 
 <italic>Crocus sativus</italic> L. to determine anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticoagulant, and antidepressant properties in mice. SEE and PEE were evinced as a safe natural remedy to treat pain, inflammation, depression, and the coagulation system. The above results clearly indicate that saffron is an excellent source of bioactive compounds having great potential as nutraceuticals and health benefits. These properties can be linked to intrinsic active compounds such as carotenoids and flavonoids found in the highest amounts in stigma and petals, respectively. However, further epidemiological investigations, laboratory research, and clinical trials are required to isolate the pharmacologically active molecules that contribute to the observed effects and to explicate the possible mechanism of action and effect of the plant on various critical illnesses and medicinal formulations.
