<p>Nitric oxide generated from sodium nitroprusside in aqueous solution interacts with oxygen to produce nitrite ions, measurable through the Griess reaction. The test was preformed according to Hossain and collaborators [

 <italic>μ</italic>L of sodium nitroprusside, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extract was added at different concentrations leading to a final extract concentration from 250 to 1.9531 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The blank was prepared by replacing extract with ethanol. At the end of the incubation time, 1.25 mL of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid and 0.1% N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in water) were added, and the absorbance was recorded after 5 min in the dark at 540 nm. Inhibition percentages of the nitrite oxide generated were measured by comparing the absorbance values of test samples versus control. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive standard control in the study.
