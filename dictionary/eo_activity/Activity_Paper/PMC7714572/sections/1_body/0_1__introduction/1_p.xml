<p>Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from deficiency of secretion (type I diabetes) and/or insulin action (type II diabetes) [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2017, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated about 425 million adults with diabetes all over the world with 16 million in Africa, the number of diabetic patients is still growing worldwide, and more than 629 million could be suffering in 2045 [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This may be due to some disadvantages provided by the most available treatment, including drug resistance (reduction of efficiency), side effects, and even toxicity [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Morbidity and mortality could be due to the complications often occurred in this disease [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Microvascular changes are the main consequence of chronic hyperglycemia and lead to blindness, amputations, kidney disease, anemia, cardiovascular attack, brain complications, impairment in immunological response, and gastrointestinal system [
