 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> extract in nicotinamide-/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The evolution of the body weight in the diabetic control group was lower compared to normal control. The administration of the plant extract for 15 days significantly improved the body weight gain compared to the diabetic control group only at the dose of 100 mg/kg from day 9 to day 15. The plant extract at the doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg did not significantly prevent the loss of body weight up to the end of the experiment. In contrary, the evolution of the body weight of animals in these groups, as in negative control group, was significantly low compared to the normal control.
