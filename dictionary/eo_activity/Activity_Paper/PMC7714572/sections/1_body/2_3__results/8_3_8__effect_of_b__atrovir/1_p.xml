 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> expresses the effects of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> on some oxidative stress parameters. The concentration of reduced glutathione significantly decreased (41.45%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in diabetic rats, whereas the catalase activity significantly increased (36.34%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared to normal control. The administration of the plant extract for 15 days significantly decreased the catalase activity by 34.02% (50 mg/kg), 39.95% (100 mg/kg), and 25% (200 mg/kg) in comparison with the diabetic control. The concentration of nitrites in the diabetic control group was higher than that of normal control (23.76%), and the plant extract significantly reversed this concentration by 53.68% and 50.08% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively, comparing to diabetic control rats.
