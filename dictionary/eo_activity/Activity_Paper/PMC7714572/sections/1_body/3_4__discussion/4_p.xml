<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in the mechanism of red blood cells damage [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] in the diabetic condition [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Previous studies reported the ROS generation in chronic high blood glucose levels, through several mechanisms including glucose autoxidation, the oxidation of protein [

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], or the nonenzymatic glycation of protein [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] that exacerbate oxidative stress. It is known that streptozotocin induced hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
