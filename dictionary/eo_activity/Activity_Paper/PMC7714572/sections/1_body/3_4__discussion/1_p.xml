 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> is largely used in Africa for many ailments [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but its effect on some pathophysiological aspect in diabetic state was not scientifically studied up to now yet. In this study, nicotinamide-/streptozotocin-induced type II diabetes was characterized by a hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, inflammation, and structural damage of the pancreas. The administration of hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> bark for 15 days to diabetic rats efficiently corrected the blood glucose level with the marked effect at the dose of 200 mg/kg, effective as the reference drug metformin (200 mg/kg) at the end of the experimental period. The hypoglycemic effect observed could be due to the reduction of insulin resistance noted in treated rats. It is well known that metformin is equally acted by increasing the insulin sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The plant extract may also act by stimulating the secretion of insulin and/or by increasing the insulin sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These actions have been attested in the present study by the rise in insulin sensitivity index observed at the end of the treatment. Antihyperglycemic effect may be attributed to the presence of substances as flavonoids, alkaloids, saponin, tannins, and triterpenes contained in the extract. In addition, the determination of phytochemicals of hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>B. artroviridis</italic> carried out by our research team revealed the presence of compounds such as myricetin and corilagin [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Corilagin acts by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization and stimulating pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic> cells to produce insulin [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] while myricetin enhances intracellular protein activity, encouraging glucose uptake consequently reduces insulin resistance [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These different compounds might react synergically to contribute to the observed hypoglycemic effect of the plant extract. Although the highest dose of the extract (200 mg/kg) expressed the best activity, considering the hypoglycemic effect by the end of the treatment, the dose of 100 mg/kg showed the most interesting effect since it presents progressive significant hypoglycemia activity from day 10 compared to the other treated groups.
