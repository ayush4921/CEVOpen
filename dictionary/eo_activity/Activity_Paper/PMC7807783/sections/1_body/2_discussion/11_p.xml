 </sup> showed significantly increased levels of urea and creatinine, indicating kidney damage in diabetic rats. The prolonged hyperglycemia in the diabetic condition is known to damage the kidney and leads to diabetic nephropathy. As an indication of kidney dysfunction, there was a significant increase in the plasma concentration of urea, BUN, uric acid, and creatinine in diabetic mice compared to control and metformin- and extract-treated diabetic mice.
