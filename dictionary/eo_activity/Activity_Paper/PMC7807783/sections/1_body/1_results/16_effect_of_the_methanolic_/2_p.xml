<p>The histological architecture in the diabetic group mice was altered compared to that of the normal architecture in the control mice. The diabetic mice muscle histomorphology showed the presence of mononucleated inflammatory cells and muscles replaced by the adipose tissue with nonhomogeneous fiber size distribution against homogeneous fiber size distribution in the control mice (

 </xref>a,b). In addition, in mice treated with metformin and the methanolic extract of the
