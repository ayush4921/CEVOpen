<p>After 5 days of diabetes induction by STZ, all mice were tested for the blood glucose level, and the levels above 200 mg/dL confirmed the induction of diabetes in the mice. The blood glucose levels of all the four groups were monitored on a weekly basis. The control group showed normal blood glucose levels throughout the experiment in contrast to the diabetic group, which showed a gradual increase in the blood glucose level every week, a sign of uncontrolled diabetes (

 </xref>). The treatment with metformin for 4 weeks could effectively reduce blood glucose in diabetic rats, and almost equal to the level of control mice at the end of the experiment (8th week). Similarly, the treatment with the methanolic extract of the
