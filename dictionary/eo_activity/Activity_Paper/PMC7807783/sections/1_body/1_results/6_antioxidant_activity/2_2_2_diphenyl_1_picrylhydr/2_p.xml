<p>The antioxidant ability of the different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> was determined by calculating the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, wherein the samples with the least IC
 <sub>50</sub> value show the robust scavenging activity against DPPH free radicals. Among the different solvent extracts from the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root, the methanolic extract showed the maximum DPPH scavenging activity with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (42.87 ± 1.5 μg/mL), followed by ethanol (46.24 ± 1.78 μg/mL), aqueous (57.04 ± 2.75 μg/mL), and chloroform extracts (60.55 ± 5.29 μg/mL) (
