 </sup> In brief, 150 μL of different concentrations of ascorbic acid (standard) and solvent extracts was taken in different test tubes; 2 mL of 0.1 mM DPPH in methanol was added; the total volume was made up to 3 mL with methanol, and the solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 30 min in dark; and the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm against the blank. The percentage of radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following formula: DPPH radical scavenging ability (%) = [{(Absref – Abssam)/Absref} × 100], and the samples were compared by calculating IC
 <sub>50</sub> values.
