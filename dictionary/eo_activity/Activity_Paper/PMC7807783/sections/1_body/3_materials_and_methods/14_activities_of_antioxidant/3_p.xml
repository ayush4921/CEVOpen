<p>For the determination of the activity of SOD, to 0.1 M Trisâ€“HCl buffer of pH 8.2, the enzyme sample and 0.2 mM pyrogallol were added and monitored at 420 nm for 2 min for the autoxidation of pyrogallol with and without the presence of sample in the reaction mixture. The quantity of enzyme used to inhibit 50% of autoxidation of pyrogallol is considered as 1 unit. The specific activity was expressed as U/mg protein.</p>
