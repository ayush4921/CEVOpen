 <caption>
  <p>(a and b) Vertical bar graphs showing the plasma concentration of urea and BUN (a) and uric acid and creatinine (b) in different experimental group mice. Note: All of the values are mean ± SEM. Mean values with the same superscript letters are not significantly different, whereas those with different superscript letters are significantly different as judged by Duncan’s multiple range test.</p>
