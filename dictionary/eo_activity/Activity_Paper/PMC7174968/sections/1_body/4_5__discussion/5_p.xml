<p>Although the phytochemical constituents responsible for the antidiarrheal effect are yet to be identified, and the amount of phytochemical constituents that are responsible for impeding gastrointestinal motility such as tannins [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] appear to increase with dose. This could possibly be the reason why significant antidiarrheal effect was observed at the higher doses of the crude extracts of both medicinal plants. However, at the lower and middle doses of the crude leaves extract of
