<p>The crude leaves extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> significantly prolonged the onset of diarrheal feces and decreased the frequency of wet feces defection only at the doses of 400 mg/kg.bw. This fraction produced the highest percentage of diarrheal inhibition (55.01%) at 400 mg/kg.bw, which was comparable with that of the standard drug (62.8 %). Contrastingly, the 100 mg/kg.bw and 200 mg/kg.bw tested doses of the extract did not possess significant antidiarrheal activity as compared to the negative control (
