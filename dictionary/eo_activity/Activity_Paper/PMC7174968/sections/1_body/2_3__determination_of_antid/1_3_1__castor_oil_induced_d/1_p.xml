<p>In order to determine the antidiarrheal activity of the medicinal plants, the method described by Umer et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was employed for this study. Swiss albino mice of either sex were deprived of food with free access to water for 18 h. Then, the mice were randomly allocated and treated with their respective doses. One hour later, all the mice were given 0.5 ml of castor oil orally with oral gavage. Then, the mice were separately placed in cages with the floor lined with transparent paper and changed every hour. The mice were carefully followed for 4 h to measure the time of onset of diarrhea, frequency of defecation, and weight of feces excreted by the animals. The antidiarrheal activity of each crude extract was reported with the percentage of fecal output and diarrheal inhibition as described in the following formula [
