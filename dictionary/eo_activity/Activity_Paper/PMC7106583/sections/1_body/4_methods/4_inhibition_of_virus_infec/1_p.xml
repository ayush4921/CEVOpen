<p id="Par40">The inhibition of virus infection assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Briefly, the plant extracts at the concentration that was determined in the cytotoxicity test outlined above and at two lower concentrations in two-fold dilution were mixed with PRRSV at 10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at a ratio of 1:1 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. DMSO (1%) containing medium mixed with PRRSV served as the control. Thereafter, the mixture of PRRSV and plant extracts as well as controls were inoculated in MARC-145 cells at a density of 5000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed and replaced with a fresh medium containing 10% FBS. The plates with MARC-145 cells were cultured under standard conditions for 24 h hpi, and supernatants were collected to quantify virus titer.
