<p id="Par34">The screening of plants as possible sources of antiviral agents has led to the discovery of potent inhibitors of in vitro viral replication, thereby increasing the probability of identifying new bioactive plant compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings suggest the appropriate species and concentration of plant extract that could effectively inhibit PRRSV replication, with both 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extracts being highly effective in inhibiting PRRSV infection in vitro by interfering with viral attachment and inhibiting viral replication and/or virus release, respectively. The modes of action of 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extracts against PPRSV require further investigation but are likely to be related to the natural compounds they contain. Therefore, it was speculated that both 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extracts are potential candidates for preventing PRRSV infection in pigs. However, the plant extracts used for testing antiviral activity was crude extracts. In future, we plan to purify the most effective Thai medicinal plant extracts (
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extracts) for screening the active compound that is highly effective against PRRSV.
