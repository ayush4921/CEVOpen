<p id="Par35">Thai medicinal plant extracts exhibit antiviral activity against PRRSV. 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>triandra</italic> extract effectively inhibited PRRSV infection. and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extract had the strongest antiviral activity against PRRSV replication. These activities can be presumably attributed to the total phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of these plant extracts. Although several previous studies have shown the antiviral activity of plant extracts against PRRSV, there are no reports on the antiviral activities of 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extracts against PRRSV. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> extracts against PRRSV activity in vitro. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of action of these plant extracts on PRRSV.
