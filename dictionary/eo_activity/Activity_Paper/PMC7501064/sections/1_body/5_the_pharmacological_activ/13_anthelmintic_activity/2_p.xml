<p id="par0180">Several studies have shown that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and its essential oil have anthelmintic action against earthworms, tapeworms, nematodes and cestodes (

 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Akhtar and Riffat, 1991</xref>). 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> induces oxidative stress against mature worms which was revealed by declining activities of an antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase glutathione as well as hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This plays a key role in the control of the overgrowth of helminthes (

 <xref rid="bib0670" ref-type="bibr">Salem, 2005</xref>). It has been reported in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds against 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, cercariae, miracidia and adult worms that they exhibit strong actions against the entire phases of the parasite as well as an inhibitory result on eggs. Black seeds reduce the action of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and glucose metabolism enzymes, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and consequently exhibit oxidative stress to worms (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil exhibits an additive effect in the treatment of schistosomiasis when it is given with praziquantel.
