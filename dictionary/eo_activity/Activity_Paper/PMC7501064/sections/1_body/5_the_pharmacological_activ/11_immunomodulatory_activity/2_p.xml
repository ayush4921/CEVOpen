<p id="par0160">The immunomodulatory effects are one of the most valuable properties of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>. Active constituents of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> augment the immunomodulatory properties through T cells and NK cells (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">El-Kadi and Kandil, 1986</xref>). Significant effects were shown with treatment of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil in most of the participating subjects by a 55% increase in CD4 and CD8 T cell ratios and improving the function of NK cells (
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Haq et al., 1999</xref>). 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil has a strong potentiating effect on the cellular immunity mediated by T cells, whilst suppressor activity on immunity mediated by B cells has been reported by other constituents. 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> stimulatory properties on cellular immunity are linked to the nature of the immune response (
 <xref rid="bib0670" ref-type="bibr">Salem, 2005</xref>). The effects of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and TQ on the cellular and humoral immunity have been compared and documented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> . I
 <italic>n vitro</italic> results of black seed soluble fractions on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells response to various mitogens were observed. It was found that major stimulatory results were not exhibited by components on peripheral blood mononuclear cells response to T cell mitogens phytohemagglutinin while components showed a stimulatory outcome on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells response to pooled allogeneic cells. Moreover, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> fractionated proteins illustrated stimulatory activity in lymphocyte cultures (
