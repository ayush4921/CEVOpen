<p>On the other hand, it is seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00110-f009">Figure 9</xref>, that radiation is an important factor in 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> antioxidant activity since it is showed that when solar radiation levels are higher, EC
 <sub>50</sub> (represented by sample circles size) decreases, which means a better antioxidant activity. This result is corroborated with both Takshak et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and Takshak et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] that showed an increase of antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Coleus forskohlii</italic> extracts when it was supplemented by UVB radiation. A similar result was observed to 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> through
