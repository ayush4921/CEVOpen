<p>According to the linear projection in four axes represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00110-f007">Figure 7</xref>, it is possible to observe blue and red circles, that represents 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> (MV) and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> (PA), respectively. Larger and smaller circles represent higher or lower SPF values. Thus, it is seen that the greater the amount of phenolics and flavonoids, the greater the diameter of the blue circles and, consequently, the greater the SPF of 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> extracts. It is also observed that RA presence favors a lower EC
 <sub>50</sub>, indicating better antioxidant activity, when it occurs.
