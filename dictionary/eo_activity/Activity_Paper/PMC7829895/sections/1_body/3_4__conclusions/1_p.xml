<p>In agreement with all obtained results, it was possible to conclude that, in general, seasonality did not directly affect polyphenols, flavonoids, and RA quantitative production in both species. The best month to harvest 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> was September and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> was July. It could also be concluded that higher concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids favor the increase of SPF in 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and concentration of RA influences the antioxidant activity of this species, while in 
 <italic>P. amboinius</italic>, the presence of flavonoids and RA maintained SPF values similar and when the phenolic compounds reached the maximum concentration in this species, the highest SPF value of the study was found (SPF = 14.79). Moreover, it was observed that solar radiation has a clearer influence in phenolic compound production and in the increase of SPF in 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> than in 
 <italic>P. amboinicus,</italic> and it favors the improvement of antioxidant activities of both species. In the case of precipitation, it does not seem to favor either photoprotective or antioxidant activities of both species studied.
