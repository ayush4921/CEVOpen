<p>Two 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains (Sierra Leonean chloroquine-sensitive (D6) and Indochinese chloroquine-resistance (W2)) were obtained from the Malaria Laboratories of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Nairobi, for this study. The culture medium was a variation of what was previously described by Trager and Jensen [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, the medium consisted of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% human serum, 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 25 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin (0.5 ml). Human type O
 <sup>+</sup> erythrocytes (&lt;28 days old) served as host cells, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 3% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, and 92% N
 <sub>2</sub>.
