<p>Similar findings have been reported in 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> extracts [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Other possible reasons for the lack of concurrence between 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays could be due to the asexual erythrocytic stage of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> used for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, thus possibility of the plant extract being more active on other stages of the parasite and a reduction in parasitemia.
