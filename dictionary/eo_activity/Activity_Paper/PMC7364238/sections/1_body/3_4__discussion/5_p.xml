<p>For the flower extracts of 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic>, moderate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 11-50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was observed. However, [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity for the same extracts, thus the lack of concurrence with this study. This could probably be explained by the fact that the potency of the plant is influenced by factors such as geographical location, agroecologic factors, and age of the plant among other factors [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All these factors influence the type and concentration of phytoactive principles responsible for pharmacologic activity. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> assays revealed that all the extracts were inactive (suppression &lt; 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml).
