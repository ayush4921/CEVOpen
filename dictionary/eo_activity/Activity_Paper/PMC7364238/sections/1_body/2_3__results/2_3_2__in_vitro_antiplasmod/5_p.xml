<p>There was significant difference (

 <sub>50</sub> values between water and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. pinnata</italic> (both strain), 
 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. africana</italic> assayed against W2 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Methanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. pinnata</italic> (both strains) and 
 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic> (W2) were observed to be more active than the aqueous while aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. africana</italic> assayed against W2 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> were observed to be more active than the methanol extracts (
