<p>Some medicinal plants used in Embu County have 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and/or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity. However, for some plants, e.g., 
 <italic>Senna didymobotrya</italic> (leaves and flowers), there was an absence of antimalarial activity, thus the need to sensitize the users against the use of these plants for malaria treatment. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity was observed in the majority of plants used to treat malaria, thus the need for caution when using these medicinal plants.
