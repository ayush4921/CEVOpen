<p>The observed variations among the different varieties could be ascribed to genetic variability [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, this chemical polymorphism of the studied varieties supports that these varieties could be considered as genotypes of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>. This phenomenon is known to exist for other species such as 
 <italic>Thymus carnosus</italic> [

 <italic>Salvia fruticose</italic> [

 <italic>Calotropis procera</italic> [

 <italic>Origanum libanoticum</italic> [

 <italic>Origanum syriacum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and 
 <italic>Cinnamomum osmophloeum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The exogenous factors such as precipitation, light, season, altitude, and soil characteristics can modify either the qualitative or quantitative amounts of the chemical compounds in the EOs [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the samples of the different varieties in the present study were collected from the same location in the same period; therefore, the exogenous factors can be excluded as controlling factors.
