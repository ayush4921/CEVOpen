<p>The air-dried leaves (200 g) of the six varieties were subjected separately to hydro-distillation using Clevenger-type apparatuses (Shiva Scientific Glass Private Limited, New Delhi, India) for three hours. The oil layer was collected using hexane, dried with 0.5 g of sodium sulfate (anhydrous), and stored in glass vials until GC-MS analysis. The six extracted EOs were separately analyzed via the GC-MS technique using the GC-MS instrument (THERMO Scientific ™ Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA) at the Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Center, Egypt [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The specifications of the used GC-MS instrument were adjusted according to the following conditions: TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific™ Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA), lined with a Thermo Scientific ISQ™ EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC-MS system was equipped with a TR-5 MS column with dimensions of 30 m × 0.32 mm, i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with a split ratio of 1:10 using the following temperature program: 60 °C for 1 min, rising at 4.0 °C/min to 240 °C, and held for 1 min. Both the injector and detector were held at 210 °C. An aliquot of 1 μL of diluted samples in hexane (1:10, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) was always injected. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 40–450.
