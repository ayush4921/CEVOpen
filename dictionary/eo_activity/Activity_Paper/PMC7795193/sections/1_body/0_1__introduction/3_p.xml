<p>The biological activities of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> leaves usually correlate to its essential oils (EOs) and volatiles that represent the main constituents of the leaves. Many compounds can be characterized from the EOs that are extracted from guava leaves around the world, especially the terpenoids, such as limonene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, eucalyptol, caryophyllene isomers, 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-murolene, selinene isomers, 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene, caryophyllene oxide, and epi-
 <italic>β</italic>-cubenol [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The EOs’ composition is reported to be affected by various exogenous factors, such as precipitation, light, season, altitude, and soil characteristics. In addition, various endogenous factors such as anatomical, physiological, and genetic characteristics can modify either the qualitative or quantitative amounts of the EOs’ chemical compounds [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The chemical polymorphism of the EOs from 22 genotypes of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> grown in two Brazilian environments was observed by de Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the chemical polymorphism in 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> that grows in Egypt is not well studied. Therefore, the present work aims to (i) construct the chemical profiles of EOs extracted from the leaves of six cultivated varieties of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> growing under similar environmental conditions in Egypt, and (ii) to establish a chemical-based relationship among the six varieties using chemometric analysis.
