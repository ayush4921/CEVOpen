<p>In general, most isoflavonoids exist in plants as glycosides. Setchell et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] suggested that hydrolysis of the sugar moiety is important for absorption of isoflavonoids. However, Zheng et al. [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that there was no difference between the absorption of aglycone and glycosides. Although some researchers found that the aglycone moiety was more systemically absorbed in the body [
