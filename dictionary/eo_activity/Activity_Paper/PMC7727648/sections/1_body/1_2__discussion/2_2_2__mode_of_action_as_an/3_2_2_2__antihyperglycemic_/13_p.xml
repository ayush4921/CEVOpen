<p>Meanwhile, daidzein has also been reported to show antidiabetic potential through multiple in vitro as well as in vivo antidiabetic studies. It has been reported to demonstrate its antidiabetic effects in terms of its regulation in carbohydrate metabolism, insulin modulation, and insulin resistance as well as adipocyte homeostasis and induced insulin secretion. Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] reported that daidzein inhibited carbohydrate digestive enzymes in vitro. Daidzein showed prominent inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of daidzein against α-glucosidase and α-amylase were 0.048 and 0.301 mmol, respectively, which suggested that daidzein was more effective than acarbose. An in vitro anti-diabetic activity of diadzein was further explained by promoting glucose uptake through glucose transporter 4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myocytes [

 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] evaluated the anti-adipogenic effect of a metabolite of daidzein known as 6,7,4’-trihydroxyisoflavone. It was found to suppress adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes via ATP-competitive inhibition of P13K. Therefore, it may have potential for development into novel treatment strategies for chronic obesity and diabetes. Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] reported that the genistein and daidzein supplements increased the insulin/glucagon ratio and C-peptide level with preservation of insulin staining β-cells of the pancreas in the NOD mice. In the liver, genistein and daidzein supplements resulted in lowering glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities, while increasing two lipogenic enzymes activities, malic enzyme and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) compared to the control group. Moreover, genistein and daidzein supplementation lowered the activities of fatty acid β-oxidation and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) in these mice. Genistein and daidzein also improved plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations compared to the control group. These results suggest that both isoflavonoids play important roles in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetic mice by downregulating G6Pase, PEPCK, fatty acid β-oxidation, and CPT activities, while upregulating malic enzyme and G6PD activities in the liver with the preservation of pancreatic β-cells. The supplementation of genistein and daidzein are seemingly helpful for preventing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) onset.
