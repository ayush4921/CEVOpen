<p>Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported on genistein acting as an insulin secretagogue. Jonas et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] reported that genistein stimulates an in vitro insulin release in normal mouse islets. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] claimed that genistein increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in both insulin secreting cell line (INS-1 and MIN6) and mouse pancreatic islets. This study was in line with the previous study done by Ohno et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] who reported that genistein improved and increased insulin secretion (in a dose-dependent manner up to 20 μg/mL) by increasing the calcium concentration into an intracellular medium that characterizes the primary signal in the regulation of insulin secretion and cyclic adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate (cAMP), an important molecule that acts as a type of cellular secondary messenger. When activated, the cAMP manifests a regulatory effect in multiple peripheral tissues, enhances insulin sensitivity, stimulates glucose uptake, and promotes gene expression. It might also generate ATP into cells and activate CaMK II. CaMKII participates in GSIS in several steps of this process such as the modulation of cytoplasmic content of ATP and the synthesis of insulin granules [

 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] demonstrated that genistein augments the insulin secretory function of pancreatic β-cells in clonal insulin secreting (INS-1E) cells. Neye and Verspohl [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] mentioned that genistein inhibited tyrosine kinase in the INS-1 cell line, which was in line with the study done by Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], who clarified that genistein amplified insulin secretion in INS-1 cells.
