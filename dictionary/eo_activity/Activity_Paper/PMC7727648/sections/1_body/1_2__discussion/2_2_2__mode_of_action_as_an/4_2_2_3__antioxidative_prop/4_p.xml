<p>It is suggested that the 5C position located on the A ring of genistein explains the antioxidant activity on β-cell proliferation since equol and 17 β-estradiol lack this hydroxyl group and were unable to stimulate β-cell proliferation. Importantly, when glucose (genistein) replaced the hydroxyl group at position 7C or at the 4C position with a methyl group (biochanin A), there was no difference in β-cell proliferation, suggesting that these structural parts are not important for demonstrating the antioxidants effects of genistein on β-cell proliferation [

 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] highlighted the importance of the prenylation of flavonoids to enhance various biological activities compared to the respective non-prenylated flavonoid. In line with this, the natural prenylated isoflavonoid alpinumisoflavone (AIF) has been explored for a number of biological and pharmacological effects (therapeutic potential). Reported data showed that AIF had a multitherapeutic potential with antiosteoporotic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, estrogenic and antiestrogenic, antidiabetic, and neuroprotective properties. In a nutshell, study on the biological activity of isoflavonoids is important and the structural specificity needs to be considered since the modification of the chemical structure to various metabolites through the addition of the sugar group or methyl group or prenylation mediates the antioxidant activity that is associated with the antidiabetic activity of isoflavonoids. The rising trends in the prevalence of diabetes complications indicate that recent medical treatments for the management of diabetes are not sufficient and that the practice of supplementary intake treatments including functional foods and their nutraceuticals could augment the effectiveness of diabetes management. Plant isoflavonoids based on in vitro and in vivo studies have been suggested to be as effective and beneficial alternatives for diabetes management and the prevention of its long-term complications.
