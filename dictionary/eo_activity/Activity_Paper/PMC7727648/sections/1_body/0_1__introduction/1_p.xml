<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder related to reduced sensitivity of tissue receptors toward insulin, abnormal insulin signaling, and deteriorating function of Î²-cells, which lead to abnormal glucose level, sub-clinical inflammation, and increased oxidative stress. DM develops when insufficient or no insulin level is produced (Type 1 diabetes mellitus) or released insulin in the body does not function properly (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), resulting in hyperglycemia [

Due to uncontrolled blood sugar, this pathogenic condition leads to long-term serious complications like micro- and macrovascular complications. Microvascular complications generally include neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (renal disease), and retinopathy (vision disorders) while macrovascular complications are coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. Due to aforementioned diabetes related complications, specifically macrovascular complications, the risk of ulcer, gangrene, and amputation is greatly increased and consequently affects the quality of life and increase the risk of mortality [
