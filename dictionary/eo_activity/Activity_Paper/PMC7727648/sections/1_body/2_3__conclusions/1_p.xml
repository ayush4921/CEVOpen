<p>Isoflavonoids are naturally derived phytoestrogen compounds that have been reported to exert in vitro and in vivo antidiabetic effects through multiple research studies with different mechanisms of actions. Biochanin A, genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and formononetin are the main promising isoflavonoids that have been thoroughly investigated for their antidiabetic potential. Among these isoflavonoids, genistein may represent a promising candidate for an alternative approach to prevent and treat diabetes. Biochanin A also opened up new horizons as it has been demonstrated to exert antidiabetic action by inhibiting aldose reductase as well as through PPAR α- and γ-modulation pathways that regulate glycemic balance. Structure activity relationship studies suggest that isoflavones that possess more than one hydroxyl groups attached to the aromatic rings may be a more effective antioxidant against peroxyl radicals. However, studies on these aspects of isoflavonoids are not sufficient and need to be re-evaluated using more appropriate methods and methodology. Hence, future studies are still warranted to understand the exact structural specificity of isoflavonoids that may bring specific antidiabetic activity toward a specific mechanism in treating diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, further investigations in human clinical studies are highly needed to obtain the optimum and specific dose and regimen required for supplementation with isoflavonoids in diabetic patients.</p>
