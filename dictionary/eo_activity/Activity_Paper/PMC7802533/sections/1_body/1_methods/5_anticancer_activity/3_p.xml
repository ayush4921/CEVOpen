<p>In vitro assessment of the oil antiproliferative activity was carried out using the Promega CellTiter 96
 <sup>®</sup> AQueous Non‐Radioactive Cell Proliferation (MTS) assay to evaluate the number of viable cells in media (Promega 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The oil was applied to test wells at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 mg/ml and incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for exposure period of 48 hr. After the completion of the incubation time, the MTS mixture (20 μl/well) was employed. A microplate enzyme‐linked immuno‐assay (ELISA) reader was utilized to read absorbance of the formazan product at 492 nm. Each point was performed in triplicates (Bardaweel et al.,
