<p>The identification of the methylated fatty acids was accomplished by mass spectrum elucidation (for GC‐MS), and comparison of the retention times (for GC‐MS and GC‐FID) and mass spectra to those of the commercial standards (for GC‐MS) (Supelco FAME mix C8–C24, Supelco 37 component mix, Supelco PUFA No. 3; Sigma Aldrich). C18:0 alkane was employed as internal standard. Standard curves were employed in the two analysis methods to determine the amount of individual fatty acids in Handal seed oil, and values are presented as weight %.</p>
