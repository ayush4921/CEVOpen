<p>Fatty acids composition of Handal (
 <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic>) seeds oil is demonstrated in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The fatty acid profile of Handal seed oil from Jordan desert is very rich in omega 6‐ polyunsaturated fatty acids, denoted as n6‐PUFA reaching a value of 75.15% by weight (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The highest contribution to n6‐PUFA is linoleic acid accounting for 74.77% of the total fatty acids (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Saturated fatty acids in Handal oil made up 14.33% of the oil and are mainly composed of palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0). Total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were 9.18% in which oleic acid (C18:1n9) is the major component as monounsaturated. Omega 3‐ and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at minor levels, that is, n3‐PUFA and OH‐PUFA were shown as 0.39% and 0.94%, respectively, in Table
