<p>Briefly, a 0.3 mM solution of DPPH in MeOH was prepared. To 1 mL of this solution, 3 mL of sample or extract solution in 10% aqueous MeOH at different concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350 μg/mL) was added. Subsequently, the mixture was shaken vigorously and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C in the dark until a stable absorbance value (
 <italic>A</italic>) at 517 nm was obtained, that was measured using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 25 UV/Vis spectrometer N.3903, Perkin Elmer instruments, Waltham, MA, USA). A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging (FRS) activity. The DPPH solution (1 mL), plus 10% MeOH (3 mL), was used as the control. The FRS% was calculated using the formula: [1 − (A
 <sub>sample</sub>/A
 <sub>control</sub>)] × 100. The curve of the % scavenging activity against the concentration was plotted for each sample using the MS Excel-based program to calculate the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value, i.e., the concentration (μg/mL or μM/L) of the sample required to scavenge 50% of the initial DPPH concentration. Each analysis was carried out in triplicate and the mean ± SD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) was calculated. Ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a standard antiradical agent. The lower the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value, the higher the sample antiradical activity. The antiradical activity was also expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents (AAEs) (
