<p>The chloroplast genome contains 114 unique genes, including 80 PCG, 30 tRNA and 4 rRNA genes. In addition, 18 genes contained one or two introns, which of those including 10 PCG genes (atpF, ndhA, ndhB, petB, petD, rpl2, rpl16, rpoC1, rps12 and rps16) possess a single intron, and 2 PCG genes (clpP, ycf3) harbor two introns; and 6 tRNA genes (trnA-UGC, trnG-GCC, trnI-GAU, trnK-UUU, trnL-UAA and trnV-UAC) harbor a single intron.</p>
