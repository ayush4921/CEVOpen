<p>NJ analysis was performed to estimate the relationship among the studied taxa (
 <italic>S. yangii</italic>, including wild type and cultivars “Lacey Blue” and “Blue Spire”, and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>) in comparison with 23 related 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species (
 <xref rid="cells-10-00112-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). 
 <italic>Lamium maculatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Lamium amplexicaule</italic> were applied as an outgroup. Finally, 50 additional sequences used for the NJ analysis were downloaded from GenBank (25 sequences of ITS2 and 25 sequences of 
 <italic>trnH-psbA</italic>). The manually adjusted alignment of 29 combined ITS2 and 29 
 <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> sequences was 540 characters long with 361/540 variable sites, 301/540 Parsimony-informative sites.
