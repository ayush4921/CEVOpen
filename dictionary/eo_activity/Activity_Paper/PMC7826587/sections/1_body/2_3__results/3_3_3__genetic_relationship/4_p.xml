<p>Despite the close genetic relationship, 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> are suggested to be separate species. Moreover, intraspecies genetic variation within the 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> taxon, between “wild type” 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and its cultivars (‘Lacey Blue’ and ‘Blue Spire’), was observed. Furthermore, the intermediate location of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> ‘Blue Spire’ between the two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species suggests that the ‘Blue Spire’ cultivar might have been created through hybridization between 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> during the cultivation process.
