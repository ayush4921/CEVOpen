<p>According to the phylogram reconstructed based on ITS2 and 
 <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> regions, the subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> was separated from other sages, yet clearly embedded in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The topology of the phylogram exhibiteds low interspecies genetic variation between subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> representatives indicated by short branches of the tree.
