<p>In our approach of an extended marker framework for DNA barcodes, a combination of 
 <italic>trnH</italic>-
 <italic>psbA</italic> and ITS2 barcodes showed sufficient discriminatory power to identify analysed plant organisms to the species level. The phylogram tree constructed with 
 <italic>trnH</italic>-
 <italic>psbA</italic> and ITS2 barcodes has shown the existence of a separate 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> clade, which is clearly embedded within 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>, which corroborates the findings of Drew et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], who formally transferred former non-
 <italic>Salvia</italic> genera, such as 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic>, to 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> and created a subgeneric designation within 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> for each of these former genera.
