<p>As noticed before, most of the published data from aerial parts of species belonging to subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> refer to the composition and activities of essential oils, indicating a significant variation [
 <xref rid="B67-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A thorough review of the chemical profile of essential oils from subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> is provided by Mohammadhosseini et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are very few reports, however, of non-volatile constituents from aerial parts of species belonging to subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic>, as a vast majority of them present an analysis of a whole-plant material.
