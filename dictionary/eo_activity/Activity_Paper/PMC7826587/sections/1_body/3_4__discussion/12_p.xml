<p>Although the DNA barcoding has been endorsed as the method of choice for land plant species identification, no consensus has been reached on which plant DNA sequences should be regarded as barcodes. The generally low rate of nucleotide substitution in plant mitochondrial genomes precludes the use of 
 <italic>cytochrome oxidase 1</italic> (
 <italic>CO1</italic>), a potential equivalent for the standard animal barcode, as a universal plant barcode [

 <xref rid="B77-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Instead, the search for a plant barcode has involved looking outside the mitochondrial genome and from the outset, many researchers have accepted that multiple markers will be required to obtain adequate species discrimination [
 <xref rid="B78-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Consequently, the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) Plant Working Group has recommended a core-barcode consisting of portions of two plastid-coding regions, 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>+
 <italic>matK</italic>, to be supplemented with additional markers as required [
 <xref rid="B75-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Limitations of the 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>+
 <italic>matK</italic> barcodes and idiosyncratic performance of different markers in different taxonomic groups were well discussed by Fazekas et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Using additional markers was also strongly suggested by these authors. Beyond the core 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>+
 <italic>matK</italic> barcode, the most widely used plastid barcoding marker is the intergenic spacer 
 <italic>trnH</italic>-
 <italic>psbA</italic>. This region is straightforward to amplify across land plants, and is one of the more variable intergenic spacers in plants [
 <xref rid="B79-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Another suggestion is supplementing the phylogenetic analysis of plants with the internal transcribed spacer from nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS) [
 <xref rid="B80-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="B81-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. A 20% gain in discriminatory power for full ITS and 10â€“15% gain even when just the ITS2 region is used is an observed and appreciable benefit [
