<p>We have amplified, sequenced, and uploaded to GeneBank four 
 <italic>matK</italic> (MT663156, MT663157, MT663158, MT663159) and four 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> (MT663160, MT663161, MT663162, MT663163) fragments obtained for cultivars: S.OBRL.01, S.OBRL.03, S.OBRL.11, and S.OBRL.12, respectively. However, they were not used for phylogenetic analysis as they possessed little (about 1%) genetic diversity within the 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> genus. We have also obtained novel DNA sequences for 
 <italic>trnH</italic>-
 <italic>psbA</italic> and ITS2 barcodes for our cultivars: S.OBRL.01, S.OBRL.03, S.OBRL.11 and S.OBRL.12, which ensured significantly higher species discrimination success in our study.
