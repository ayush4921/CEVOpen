<p>Yet, the phytochemical profiling alone is not sufficient to prove the taxonomic differentiation, especially if easily accessible organs (leaves) would be used for sampling. On the other hand, the results from molecular studies are independent from the sample type and coupled with parallel LC-MS profiling constitute a powerful tool in monitoring of taxonomically close and probably easily crossing species.</p>
