<p>Species of subgenus 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> range from southwestern to central Asia, with 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> being more distributed to the west and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> to the east. The ranges of the two species overlap in Northeastern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is suggested that both species can hybridise in natural habitats [
 <xref rid="B1-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Plants grown from seeds originating from botanical gardens or other plant collections where both species grow in short distance from each other also might be crossed. As both species are able to hybridise, it is not clear which cultivars are variants of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> or hybrids between 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This makes the seemingly simple determination of 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic> species unexpectedly complicated.
