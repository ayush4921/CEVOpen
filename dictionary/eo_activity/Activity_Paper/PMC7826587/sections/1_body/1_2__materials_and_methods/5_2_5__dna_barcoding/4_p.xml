<p>Alignments were assembled separately for each marker with the ClustalW algorithm under default conditions in MEGA 7 [
 <xref rid="B60-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and were then entered into the program Gblocks v.091b to objectively eliminate poorly aligned positions and divergent regions [
 <xref rid="B61-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Then, a final alignment was assembled by a combination of both alignments calculated for individual markers. The relationship among the taxa was estimated using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [
 <xref rid="B62-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and presented as an -rooted phylogram. Due to the large number of gaps in the dataset, a Pairwise deletion Gaps/Missing data treatment was applied. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [
 <xref rid="B63-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] according to the general recommendation. To estimate reliability of the tree bootstrap, a 1000-replication test was used [
 <xref rid="B64-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The analysis involved 29 nucleotide sequence combinations including 
 <italic>L. maculatum</italic> and 
 <italic>L. amplexicaule</italic> as an outgroup.
