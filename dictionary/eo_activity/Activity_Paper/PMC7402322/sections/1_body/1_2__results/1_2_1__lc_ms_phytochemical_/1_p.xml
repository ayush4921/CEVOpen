<p>The chromatographic analysis of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> methanol extract (COME) allowed the detection and tentative identification of 43 chemical constituents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04897-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The most representative chemical classes were flavonoids (21 compounds) and phenolic acids (12 compounds), while small amounts of coumarins, triterpenes, and anthocyanins were also identified (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-04897-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Detected flavonoids and phenolic acids were quantified using calibration curves built from reference standards, and the results were in alignment with previously published quantitative data on the same plant species [
