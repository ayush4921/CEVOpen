 <italic>Colebrookea oppositifolia</italic> Smith is the only species of the 
 <italic>Colebrookea</italic> genus (Lamiaceae). This plant, commonly known as “Indian squirrel tail”, is widely distributed in the subtropical regions of India, Nepal, Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand, and China, where it grows in hills and plains at altitudes of 250–1700 m [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The aerial part of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> consists on a branched shrub up to 1.5–3 m tall, with quadrangular stems and elliptic to ovate-elliptic darkish green leaves, 10–18 cm long × 3.5–7.5 cm large, acuminate, with crenulate to serrulate margins, whitish tomentose beneath. The plant shows tiny white flowers arranged in panicles of 1.5–11 cm-long upright spikes, that look hairy and resemble a squirrel’s tail [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Nepal, 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> is traditionally known as dhusure, dosul, dhulsu, or dhursuli, and its leaves are used mainly to treat ailments of the ocular region such as cataract, corneal opacity, and keratoconjunctivitis, and as anthelmintic [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In India and China, this herb has been extensively utilized as a traditional remedy for several other ailments, such as headache, fever, dysentery, peptic ulcer, dermatitis, and wounds [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], although its most frequent use is for the treatment of epilepsy, for which the roots of the plant are considered [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Medicinal preparations based on aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> are used by Dai people of the Yunnan province of China as anti-inflammatory, specifically for the treatment of fractures, traumatic injuries, and rheumatoid arthritis [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, studies on 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> have shown that the different parts of this plant could exert several other pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: the whole plant and the roots have been reported as effective as antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], anticonvulsant [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and antiulcer [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] agents, while the leaves have been investigated for their cardio-protective [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], anti-fertility [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, the phytochemical composition of this plant remains scarcely explored, and the majority of these bioactivities have not been attributed to specific compounds yet. Flavonoids such as apigenin, alnustin, mosloflavone [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and flavonoid glycosides such as negletein-6-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside and 5,7,2′-trihydroxyflavone-2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-d-glucopyranoside [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have been identified in the aerial parts, together with the terpenes phytol [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and (+)-14,15-dinor-9α-hydroxy-cis-labd-11(E)-en-13-one [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> is also a source of acteoside [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a phenylethanoid glycoside that possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, antitumor, and analgesic properties, and has been studied for its anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of the plant are still lacking, despite its traditional uses. Due to the importance of this medicinal plant in Nepal and due to the relatively scarce literature regarding its phytochemical composition and its biological activities, we selected 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> to proceed with our studies on the valorization of Nepalese medicinal herbs [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In particular, our aim was that to focus on possible natural sources of bioactive constituents or mixtures targeted on inflammation and/or cancer [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], considering that herbs may offer a safer, and often an equally effective, alternative treatment, especially for long-term utilization [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this paper, we reported for the first time the comprehensive characterization of the secondary metabolites extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> from Nepal, obtained by ultrasound-assisted methanolic extraction of the dried aerial parts. In vitro biological activity of the same extract was also evaluated, and results from anti-NF-κB (Nuclear factor-κB), anti-AP-1 (Activator protein-1), and cytotoxicity assays on human cells are here presented.
