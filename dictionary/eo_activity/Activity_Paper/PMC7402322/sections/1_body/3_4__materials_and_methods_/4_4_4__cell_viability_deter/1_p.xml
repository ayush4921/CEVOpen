<p>The influence of COME on cell viability was determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, cells [THP1-XBlue™-MD2-CD14 (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA)] were incubated for 24 h with increasing concentrations (1.25–20 µg/mL) of COME dissolved in DMSO. The solvent did not exceed the concentration of 0.1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). After 24 h incubation, the amount of metabolically active (i.e., live) cells was evaluated by Cell Proliferation Reagent kit WST-1 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Relative cell viability was calculated as the ratio of absorbance values of COME-treated to DMSO-only-treated cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of COME was determined by four parameter logistic (4PL) analysis from the obtained viability curve. For further analysis, the concentration of COME 2 µg/mL was considered as non-toxic.
