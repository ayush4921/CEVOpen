<p>Extraction of dried plant material was performed following a previously published protocol [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, 50 g of dried and grinded leaves were suspended in 250 mL of methanol and extracted at room temperature in an ultrasonic bath (Branson, Danbury, CT, USA) for 2 h, shaking the sample every 30 min to homogenize the mixture. Afterwards, the solid residue was recovered by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min and further extracted for other 30 min, using an additional 250 mL of methanol as described above. Finally, the liquid extracts were pooled, filtered and dried under vacuum at 40 °C to constant weight, and the dried residue was stored at −20 °C until analysis. The whole extraction procedure was performed in triplicate. The mean percentage yield of the crude COME obtained was 15 ± 1.3%.
