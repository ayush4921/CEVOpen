 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> is rather rich in many phytochemical compounds. One of the earliest studies carried out in 1896 identified myricetin and gallic acid as components of the leave extract [

More recently, a most comprehensive study investigating the phytochemical composition of the fruit extract identified 211 phytoconstituents including tannins, (iso)flavonoids, terpenoids, anthocyanins, and many others. Importantly, 180 of the 211 identified compounds were characterized for the first time in
