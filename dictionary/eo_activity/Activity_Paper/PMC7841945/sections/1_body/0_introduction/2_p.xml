<p>Edelweiss (
 <italic>Leontopodium nivale</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>alpinum</italic>) is a traditional medicinal plant in Central Europe, which was widely applied in human and veterinary medicine before the species was overexploited and became endangered. All parts of the plant were used to treat gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and heart conditions, most likely because of its antiinflammatory and antimicrobial properties.
