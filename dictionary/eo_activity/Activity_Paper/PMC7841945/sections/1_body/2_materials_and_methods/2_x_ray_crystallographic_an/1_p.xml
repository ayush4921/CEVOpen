<p>Emestrin was crystallized in methanol at 10 °C, and a suitable crystal was chosen for the analysis. The X-ray intensity data were measured on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer equipped with a multilayer monochromator, a Mo K/α Incoatec micro-focus sealed tube, and an Oxford cooling system. The structure was resolved by direct methods. Nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms were inserted at calculated positions and refined with a riding model. Bruker SAINT v8.38B software packages (2005–2019, Bruker AXS) were used for analysis with a narrow-frame algorithm for frame integration, SADABS (Sheldrick, G. M., 1996, SADABS, University of Göttingen, Germany) for absorption correction, OLEX2
