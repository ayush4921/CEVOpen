<p>The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of 
 <bold>1</bold> displayed signals of a pyridone core and an unsaturated and branched side chain. In addition, a very deep field-shifted methoxy signal (
 <sup>1</sup>H at 4.07 ppm and 
 <sup>13</sup>C at 65.05 ppm) was detected, which could be interpreted as a methyl ester of a hydroxamic acid moiety. The structure of the side chain was assigned by 2D NMR methods (correlation spectroscopy COSY, heteronuclear single quantum coherence HSQC, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation HMBC). Thus, the position of the unsaturated and branched side chain at carbon 2 was proved by correlation signals from carbon 2 to protons at 4, 9, 1′, and 3′ in HMBC. In addition, the proton at 2 gave correlation signals to carbons 8a, 9, 1′, and 3′ in HMBC. Comparison with the literature data of the known 
 <italic>N</italic>-methoxy-pyridone derivative YCM1008A proved the structure to be the same with the exception of an additional methyl and hydroxy group in the side chain

The position of the additional methyl group at carbon 6′ was assigned due to the correlation signals of the protons at 5′ and 7′ with the carbon 11′ in HMBC. The position of the hydroxy function was proved by the coupling signals of protons at carbon 8′ (δ
 <sub>H</sub> 2.61 ppm) and 12′ (δ
 <sub>H</sub> 3.60 and 3.43 ppm) in COSY. The configuration of the chiral centers could not be established by NMR methods.
