<p>The analyses of total phenolic compounds and flavonoid content were performed following a previous methodology of Folin-Ciocalteu (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Morales and Paredes, 2014</xref>) and the aluminum chloride method (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Simirgiotis et al., 2013</xref>) in microplate with some modifications. For total phenolic, a standard solution of gallic acid serial dilution (25–300 µg/ml in 10% EtOH) was used to prepare a calibration curve. Results were expressed as gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g of dry plant. Flavonoid content was calculated using a quercetin standard calibration curve (2.5–250 μg/ml in ethanol) and the results were expressed as mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g of dry plant. The absorbances for each methodology was determined using a microplate reader Synergy TM HT Multi-Mode.
