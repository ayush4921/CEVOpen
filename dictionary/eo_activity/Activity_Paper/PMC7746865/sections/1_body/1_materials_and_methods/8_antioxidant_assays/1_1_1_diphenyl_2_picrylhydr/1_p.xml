<p>The DPPH• (3.9 ml, 0.075 mM, in methanol) method reported by (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zeraik et al., 2016</xref>) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. copa</italic>. Briefly, 400 µl of a solution, (2 mg/ml for standards), plus 2 ml of DPPH solution were adjusted with the solvent methanol to an absorbance of 1.10 ± 0.02 at 517 nm. The mixture was homogenized using a vortex, allowed to react in the dark at room temperature for 20 min, after which time absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Gallic acid was used as a reference standard. The results were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration of infusion or standard in μg/ml required to inhibit 50% of DPPH radical present in solution).
