 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (CL strain expressing beta-galactosidase) was used throughout this study (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Andriani et al., 2011</xref>). Vero cells were infected with Tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes as previously described (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">San Francisco et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, Vero cell monolayers were cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera. Culture flasks of 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> (Nunc, Eas YFlasks, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) containing subconfluent cultures of Vero cells, were infected with Tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes (CL strain) in a parasite/cell ratio equal to 5:1. After 3 h of infection, cell cultures were washed with PBS to remove parasites that did not penetrate into the cell and cultures were re-incubated in RPMI-1640 medium at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Five days later, a pure population of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes released in cell culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation. 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (IFLA/BR/67/PH8) was propagated as promastigotes at 26°C in M199 media supplemented with 5% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1% hemin (25 mg/ml in 0.1N NaOH), 10 mM adenine and 10% FBS, pH 7.5 as previously described (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sauter et al., 2019</xref>). Antiprotozoal activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was evaluated as previously described (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gutiérrez et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, serial dilutions of each infusion were performed in 96 wells microplates, in the range of 1000 to 0.48 μg/ml in a final volume of 100 µl. Then, 100 µl of a suspension of trypomastigotes 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> ml
 <sup>−1</sup> were added and microplates were incubated 48 h. Finally, a substrate, the β-D-galactopyranoside was added, and the mixture incubated 4 h and finally, the enzymatic activity was recorded at 570 nm in a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Leishmanicidal activity was evaluated as described (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Loyola et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, serial dilutions of each infusion were performed as described above. Then, 100 µl of a suspension of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> parasites ml
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes were added and the microplates incubated 48 h. Finally, the number of live parasites were count in a Neubauer chamber.
