<p>In this study, 
 <italic>Artemisia copa</italic> infusion was assessed for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE using galantamine as the positive control (reference: galantamine 0.26 ± 0.03 μg/ml). The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and are expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (µg/ml). The inhibition of key enzymes has been a very useful strategy to know the pharmacological potential of herbal medicines. Moreover, inhibition of enzymes linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), such AChE and BChE (

 <italic>, A. copa</italic> showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.92 ± 0.08 µg/ml, while in the BChE assays the IC
 <sub>50</sub> results were 44.13 ± 0.10 µg/ml respectively. In previous reports the cholinesterase inhibitory activity of Algerian

 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> L.
 <italic>, A. fragrans</italic> Willd. and 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> Asso were evaluated and showed similar results against AChE but not activity against BChE (

 <italic>A. copa</italic> possessed the capacity to inhibit AChE and BChE enzymes.
