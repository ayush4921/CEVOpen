 <italic>A. copa</italic> using screening tests to evaluate their antioxidant, antiprotozoal and enzyme inhibitory properties against cholinesterase and high-resolution UHPLC-MS/MS for the chemical profiling for the first time. Additionally, molecular docking of the major compounds was investigated.
