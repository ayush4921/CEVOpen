<p>One of the most critical concerns in drug development is the metabolism that results in reduced potency, poor PK properties or bio-activation into reactive species. An effort was done by Wan et al. to develop a series of piperidine-based 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (11β-HSD1) inhibitors that may be useful targets for diabetes and obesity treatment [

 <bold>6</bold> and the unsubstituted piperidine 
 <bold>7</bold> (

 <bold>6</bold> has a tremendous impact metabolic stability. Due to fluorine substitution, the mouse liver microsome half-life (MLM) increased by up to 5-fold.
