<p>Fluorine is one of the halogens located in the main group 7A of the periodic table of elements and it is the most electronegative element, with a Pauling assigned electronegativity value of χ = 4.0. The electronegativity leads to more polarization of C-F bond (μ C−F = 1.41 D), less covalent and more electrostatic character. Usually C–F bond does interact with its environment via electrostatic/dipole interaction. Fluorine has the smallest atomic radius among the Period 2 elements. Due to the relatively small size of fluorine compared to the hydrogen atom, it can closely mimic hydrogen in non-fluorinated analogues allowing a fluorinated precursor to fit in a given enzyme receptor and hence giving similar or enhanced biological activity. Although the carbon-fluorine bond is stronger (105.4 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) than a carbon-hydrogen bond (98.8 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) providing a higher thermal stability, yet fluorine is still a better leaving group than hydrogen. This review summarizes the literature data published in the last two decades and dealing with the biological impact of introducing fluorine as a major appendage of benzazoles. The biological activity of the most important representatives of this class of compounds are discussed.
