<p>El-Abadelah et al. reported a synthesis of a set of 2-arylbenzimidazoles 
 <bold>36</bold> bearing both piperazine and fluorine. Their synthesis was based on mimicking the value of incorporating both fluorine and piperazine in ciprofloxacin in order to achieve a broad antimicrobial activity. The in vitro evaluation against 
 <italic>E. coli. S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed no significant antibacterial activity at concentrations ≤100 μM [
