<p>It is worthy to note that designing molecules targeting the inhibition of tubulin polymerization is a highly attractive approach in designing anticancer candidates. Kamal et al. synthesized benzimidazole-oxindole conjugates and evaluated them against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The conjugates with mono fluoro, difluo, or trifluoromethyl moieties show a considerable antiproliferative activities. Their finding implies that conjugate 
 <bold>31</bold> with a difluoro moiety at position 3 and 5 on phenyl ring showed a significant cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.59 Î¼M. Molecular docking studies have been performed to investigate the action mode of this compound and it indicated efficient binding with the colchicine binding site [
