<p>Singh et al. research teamâ€™s interest is focused on the preparation of several di and tri substituted bis-benzimidazoles which incorporate electron donating (OCH
 <sub>3</sub>) and electron withdrawing groups (F, Cl) on the phenyl ring and test their ability to induce DNA cleavage in the presence of mammalian topoisomerase I. Hoechst 33342 and Hoechst 33258 are examples of bis-benzimidazole derivatives which have strong binding affinity to DNA causing catalytic activity inhibition of many enzymes involved in DNA replication and synthesis. It is worth to notice that the first derivatives of Hoechst having di-substituted groups, having halogen atoms as substituents, at 2-position of benzimidazole were synthesized by his team. A considerable change in absorbance was noticed with a significant hyperchromicity and a red shift was observed in the binding ability of compound 
 <bold>35</bold> to CT-DNA. This observation was correlated to the presence of fluorine at the phenyl ring in the compound [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The small size of fluorine enables it to slip between the DNA base pairs and chelate with them leading to unwinding of the DNA strands resulting in the UV absorption hyperchromicity shift.
