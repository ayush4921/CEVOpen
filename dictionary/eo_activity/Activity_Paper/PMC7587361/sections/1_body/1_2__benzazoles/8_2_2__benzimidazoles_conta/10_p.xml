<p>In continuation of the abovementioned work, in 2005 Abdel-Jalil et al. replaced the aryl at 2-position with an aromatic ferrocenyl unit which was then converted into the hydrochloride salt to be tested against four different pathogenic 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. At least two derivatives showed interesting potency in comparison to that of azole-based (miconazole and ketonazole) antifungal agents [
