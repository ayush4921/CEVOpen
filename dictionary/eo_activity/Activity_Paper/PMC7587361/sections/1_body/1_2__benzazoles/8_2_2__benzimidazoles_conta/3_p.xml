<p>Zhang et al. synthesized a novel series of benzimidazole tertiary amine type of fluconazole analogues of potential antifungal activity. Fluconazole is an antifungal medicine used to treat infections caused by 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. The benzimidazole scaffold has been decorated with several moieties in order to achieve the optimal activity. For the purpose of improving the pharmacological properties, the phenyl has been substituted with chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, methyl and nitro moieties into target compounds which are believed to enhance the rate of absorption and in vivo drug transportation. It is worth noting that halo-benzimidazole possesses better activity in strain growth inhibition compared to alkyl benzimidazole. Compound 
 <bold>29</bold> containing a 2,4-fluorinated benzyl ring shows the highest antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans, S</italic>. 
 <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> fungi with MIC = 16â€“32 mg/mL [
