<p>As mentioned previously, fluorine is a popular element which has been used as a labeling agent in the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) field [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Fluorine-18 labeled analogues are known as PET radio-ligands to detect and quantify the amyloid deposit distribution in human brains which is used for the detection of the development of Alzheimer’s Disease. Neumaier et al. reported the synthesis of three different [
 <sup>18</sup>F] fluoroethoxy-substituted benzothiazole derivatives. Among several PET markers prepared, [
 <sup>18</sup>F]
 <sub>2</sub>-[4′-(methylamino)phenyl]-6-fluoroethoxyben-zothiazole, (
 <bold>24</bold>) appeared as an appropriate amyloid imaging agent in terms of biokinetics and binding affinity for amyloid plaques. Its lipophilicity, (log P
 <sub>oct</sub>) was 2.4 which agrees with the requirements for amyloid imaging agents such as PIB, SB13 and FDDNP so it can penetrate the blood brain barrier [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The in vitro binding affinity of 
 <bold>24</bold> exhibits Ki = 7.2 nM, which falls within the expected range for specific Aβ binding.
