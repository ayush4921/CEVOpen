<p>Feng et al. prepared six cyanine dye substituted benzoxazolyl or benzothiazolyl groups and investigated them for their in vitro antiprotozoal activities. The in vitro tests were done using 
 <italic>P. falciparum (K1</italic>), 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, 
 <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> and the cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated using rat skeletal myoblasts (L-6 cells). The high antimalarial activity of the four fluorinated benzothiazolyl trimethine cyanines 
 <bold>20</bold>, 
 <bold>21</bold>, 
 <bold>22</bold>, 
 <bold>23</bold> was attributed directly to the presence of the fluorine atom [
