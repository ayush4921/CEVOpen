<p>Noteworthy, Singh et al.â€™s finding [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] supported the notion that the presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorine, chlorine, or a combination of both, significantly affects the antibacterial activity. The systematic SAR done by the same research group showed that fluorinated variant 
 <bold>18</bold> containing two di-fluoro substituents offers the highest antibacterial activity against the six tested bacterial strains (both Gram-positive and gram-negative strains) except S. boydii strains. Moreover, the modification of substituents in the benzene ring also plays a vital role in their activity showing that the position of substituents at the benzene ring is critical in governing the antibacterial activity and fluorine has a potent effect in comparison to chlorine. For instance, placing fluoro group at positions-2 and 4 in the benzene ring enhance the potency unlike position-3 where activity is lost.
