<p id="par0005">Diclofenac (DCF) is a derivative of phenylacetic acid and an active member of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) group which is frequently prescribed drug during fever, inflammation and moderate pain conditions. It also acts as an antibacterial agent by inhibiting DNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mechanism of DCF action is believed to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase (COX) [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The liver metabolizes DCF to 4-hydroxydiclofenac and other hydroxylated derivatives. These metabolites undergo the process of sulfation and glucuronidation before they are finally excreted in the bile (35 %) and urine (65 %) [

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies on DCF induced hepatotoxicity revealed that it causes excessive free radicals formation and an unusual rise in the level of liver function markers in serum [
