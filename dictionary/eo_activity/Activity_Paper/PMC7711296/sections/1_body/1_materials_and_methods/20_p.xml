<p>To determine the antioxidant activity of methanol extract of three 
 <italic>Acantholimon </italic>species, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay was used. The antioxidant agents can convert DPPH with purple color into the yellow molecule, 1-1diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine by donating electron or hydrogen (Thambiraj et al., 2012
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). In detail, the extract (50 μl) at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 2000 µg/ml was added to 150 μl of 0.04 mg/ml DPPH (Sigma–Aldrich; St-Louis, USA) solution in methanol and incubated in the dark for 30 min. DPPH in methanol without the extracts served as a control. The blank was prepared in the same manner except that methanol was used instead DPPH solution to eliminate interference in each sample. The reduction of DPPH absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a plate reader (BioTek-ELx800, USA). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control. All determinations were performed in triplicate.
