  <p>Methanol extract of 
   <italic>A. serotinum</italic> decreased the colony formation of NCCIT cells. NCCIT cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. After 24 hr, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of extract for 14 days. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet to visualize the colonies for counting. Colony numbers (≥50 cells per colony) were counted. The experiments were independently repeated 3 times and plating efficiency ±SEM was calculated. *p&lt;0.05 shows significant differences as compared to the control (ctrl) as tested by the student’s t-test
