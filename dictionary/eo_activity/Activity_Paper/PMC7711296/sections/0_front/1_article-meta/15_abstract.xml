  <title>Objective:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Acantholimon</italic> is a genus of perennial plant within the Plumbaginaceae family. Here, we aimed to investigate anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial potential of methanol extract of three Iranian endemic species of 
   <italic>Acantholimon</italic> including 
   <italic>A. austro-iranicum, A. serotinum</italic> and 
   <italic>A. chlorostegium. </italic>

  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>MTT assay was used to evaluate the 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction was examined by annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit. Antioxidant activity was reported based on the DPPH-scavenging and DCF-DA assay. Antibacterial activity was measured by disc diffusion and micro-well dilution assay.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>MTT assay showed less cytotoxicity of methanol extracts against the HUVEC normal cell line (IC
   <sub>50</sub> values: 817-900 µg/ml) compared to cancer cell lines MCF-7, HT29, SH-SY5Y, NCCIT and A549 (IC
   <sub>50</sub> values: 213 to 600 µg/ml) that show the specificity of extracts toward cancer cells. Plant extract showed apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phases documented by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. According to antioxidant tests, extracts exhibited significant DPPH scavenging potential (IC
   <sub>50</sub> values: 30-37 µg/ml) and could protect against H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. Antibacterial activities showed a stronger inhibitory effect on 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
   <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>as Gram- negative bacteria (diameter of inhibition zone: 11-13 mm and minimal inhibition concentration (MIC): 3.175 to 12.5 mg/ml) compared to Gram-positive bacteria including 
   <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(diameter of inhibition zone: 3-7 mm and MIC: 25 to 50 mg/ml).

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>Our results suggested moderate cytotoxic and antibacterial potential and noteworthy antioxidant activity for the examined 
   <italic>Acantholimon</italic> species.
