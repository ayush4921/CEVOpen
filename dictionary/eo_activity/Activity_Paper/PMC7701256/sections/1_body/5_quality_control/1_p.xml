<p>The current edition of the Pharmacopoeia of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (2020 edition) uses thin layer chromatography to qualitatively identify caffeic acid and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the content of quercetin, which is used to control the quality of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>; however, caffeic acid and quercetin exist widely in plants and their specificity is not strong, so it is necessary to use advanced technology and analytical methods to establish a scientific and reasonable quality evaluation system to provide a basis for the production and quality control of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>.
