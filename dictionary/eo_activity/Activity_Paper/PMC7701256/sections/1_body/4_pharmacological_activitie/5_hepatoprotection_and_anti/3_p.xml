<p>In recent years, through the further study on the hepatoprotective mechanism of the total flavonoid extract of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al. (2017)</xref> have found that phosphorylated JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway can induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the process of liver fibrosis, and continuously secrete extracellular matrix ECM through positive feedback regulation of continuous activation of HSC; 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> flavonoids can down-regulate the expression of α-SMA, TGF- β1, IL-1β, and IL-6, inhibit the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway, and improve liver pathological changes. In addition, the abnormal expression of TGF-β1 and JAK2/STAT3 pathway is consistent, and the relationship of mutual regulation between them has not been reported, which is worthy of further exploration. 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al.’s (2017)</xref> study found that 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> flavonoids can significantly decrease the contents of TGF-β1, Notch-1, and α-SMA in liver tissue of rats with DMN-induced hepatic fibrosis, increased the expression of E-cadherin protein, inhibited the process of epithelial stroma transformation, and then reduced the secretion of extracellular matrix, preventing excessive deposition of fibrous hoof tissue. The mechanism is related to the regulation of TGF-β1/Notch signal pathway; some studies have shown that Notch-1 in Notch pathway is the effector gene of TGF- β1, and the flavonoids of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> may inhibit the EMT process induced by TGF-β 1 by blocking Notch signal pathway, so as to exert its anti-fibrosis effect.
