<p>The appropriate dose of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> water extract can effectively fight influenza virus and reduce lung inflammation, and it shows good antiviral effect by reducing the content of serum inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1, increasing the level of antibody IgA, IgG, IgG1b, and IgG2a, reducing lung index, and relieving lung inflammation in influenza mice (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>); the mechanism is mainly through humoral immune response, and the antibodies in the serum can effectively neutralize the virus, activate the cascade of complements, and limit the replication and spread of pathogens (

 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, could significantly inhibit pulmonary edema induced by influenza A virus in mice, but the exact mechanism of action is not clear; the experimental results show that when the dose of quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide is 6mg/ml, the inhibitory effect is stronger than that of the positive control drug ribavirin.
