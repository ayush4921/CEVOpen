<p>③ In China, 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> has made an outstanding contribution to the treatment of viral infectious diseases such as herpes zoster. The traditional Chinese medicine syrup made of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, sucrose, and benzoic acid is effective in clinical application. According to literature reports, 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> also has a significant effect on pertussis, an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. These applications show that 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> has great potential in the treatment of respiratory diseases. However, these reports are limited to clinical observation reports, and there is a lack of research on active constituents and potential mechanism of action. Although most studies have summarized the active constituents and action mechanism of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, they are not comprehensive and specific enough. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the basic research on antiviral, antitussive, and expectorant.
