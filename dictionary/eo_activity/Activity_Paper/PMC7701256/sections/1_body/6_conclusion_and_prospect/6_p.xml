<p>⑤ Although the quality standard of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> has been clearly stipulated in the current edition of the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China (2020 edition), it still needs to be further improved because of its weak specificity. A large number of scientific studies related to the determination of index components and the construction of fingerprints have made good progress, but more efforts are still needed to incorporate these results into the legal quality standards. It is necessary to establish a more reasonable and effective quality evaluation system, improve the quality of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, ensure the safety and effectiveness of clinical drug use, and provide a reference basis for better development and use of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> resources.
