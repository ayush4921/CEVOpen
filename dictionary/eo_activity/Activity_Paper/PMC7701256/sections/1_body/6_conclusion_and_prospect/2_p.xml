<p>â‘  At present, 80 chemical constituents have been isolated from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>. Among them, flavonoids are the main active constituents, accounting for 32.5% of the isolated chemical constituents. The existing studies on the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> are mostly focused on flavonoids, while the studies on other chemical constituents are less. For example, although the content of phenolic acids is much less than that of flavonoids, it still shows significant pharmacological activity, and according to the results of previous studies, phenolic acids may be the material basis of anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. In addition, as the most important and abundant active components in 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, the research on flavonoids is not deep enough; study on the basic substances of pharmacology is still in the crude extract stage, and the specific active compounds have not been isolated and identified, which makes it difficult to establish the relationship between the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities, thus affecting further research in all aspects. Therefore, in the future, we should strengthen the basic research on the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>.
