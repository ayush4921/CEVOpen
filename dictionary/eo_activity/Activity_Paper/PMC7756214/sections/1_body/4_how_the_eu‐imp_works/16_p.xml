<p>In order to test the suitability of the EU‐IMP to handle a potential crisis, a dry run was conducted in 2017 with members of the IRN, the EU‐ETF, EC, EMA, and MSs. This was based on a fictitious scenario involving the suspension of a CAP (containing the same substance as several NAPs) in a MS after receipt of several reports of suspected adverse drug reactions with a fatal outcome.

 </xref> The exercise confirmed the capability of the EU‐IMP to handle crisis situations. Additionally, the experience gained over these years has provided opportunities for improvement in several areas including process streamlining, communication, interactions, composition, success factors, and technical considerations. These have been translated into subsequent system enhancements with for example the inclusion in the IRN of a larger expertise (risk management, communication, quality), the increased duration of the IRN mandate, technical upgrades to allow recording of the IRN meetings and storing of audio material, and clarification of practicalities concerning the preliminary risk analysis (who drafts it, expected timelines, etc.), in case an incident risks escalating into a crisis.
