<p>An IRN teleconference was organized on the same or the day after the initial notification in 42% of the cases. For the remaining 58% of the cases, more information was needed prior to organizing an IRN teleconference. IRN recommendations have always been implemented within the shortest possible delay. For instance, when the IRN recommended that the issue should be addressed via a signal procedure, this was commenced at the following planned PRAC meeting, which happened within 1 month from the concerned IRN. When the IRN recommended to issue a stand‐alone press release, this was published within 1 week of the date of the IRN, but most commonly within 2 days.</p>
