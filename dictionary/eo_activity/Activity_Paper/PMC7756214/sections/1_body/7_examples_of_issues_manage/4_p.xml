<p>A second safety example concerns the notification of the MAH's intention to terminate several ongoing clinical trials with idelalisib, a cancer medicine used to treat adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or follicular lymphoma, due to increased risk of serious respiratory infections and associated deaths observed in three studies. Two IRN teleconferences were held in the days following the initial notification to agree that the issue could be handled via routine measures, specifically the prompt initiation (by the EC) of an Article 20 referral procedure. Through the IRN, the information gaps were identified, the available evidence was shared with international RAs, the relevance of the issue (observed in off‐label use) to the on‐label use was discussed, and engagement with the MAH on interim measures and proposed actions was initiated. The IRN agreed that the CTFG was to be consulted on the draft DHPC, LTTs had to be drafted and a press release

After giving due to consideration to the seriousness of the potential issue, as well as the incomplete evidence available, the PRAC resolved to adopt (within 1 week of the initial notification) a temporary measure (restriction of the indication in previously untreated patients with CLL and a certain genotype) and a DHPC.

 </xref> Four months later, after reviewing the complete dataset, consulting the relevant expertise within the referral procedure, and taking into consideration the absence of alternative suitable treatments, the PRAC recommended that the temporary restriction should be lifted. However, in order to better protect patients, risk minimization measures were strengthened. Warnings were added to the product information to request that treatment is not started in cases where there are ongoing systemic infections, and that effective monitoring of these and adequate prophylaxis specifically for
