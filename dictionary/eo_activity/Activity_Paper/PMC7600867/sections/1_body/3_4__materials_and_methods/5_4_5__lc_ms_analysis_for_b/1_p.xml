<p>LC-MS analysis was carried out using the Agilent 1200 Series analytical system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a photodiode array detector integrated with a 6130 Series electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. Each crude extract from the samples (1.0 mg) was first dissolved in 50% aqueous methanol (1.0 mL). Methanol was then added again to obtain a total solution volume of 100 μg/mL before filtering with a 0.45 mm hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter. The resultant filtrate was then subjected to LC-MS analysis with a Kinetex C
 <sub>18</sub> column (2.1 × 100 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) at 25 °C. Formic acid in water [0.1% (
