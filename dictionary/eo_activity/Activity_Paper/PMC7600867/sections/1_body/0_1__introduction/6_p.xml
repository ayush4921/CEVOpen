<p>The aim of this study was to compare the production of root tubers, which have medicinal qualities, from the culture seedlings (CSs) and seed seedlings (SSs) of red and white 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> by field testing seedlings propagated using the optimized in vitro culture of 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> (CS) and comparing the results to those of SSs. This was a follow-up study to previous research on 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic>. The results from this study will play an important role in improving the mass production of 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic>.
