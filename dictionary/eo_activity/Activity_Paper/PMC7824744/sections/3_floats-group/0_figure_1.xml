  <p>The protective effect of different concentrations of 
   <italic>Lignosus rhinocerus</italic> (LR) extracts against glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 cells. Viability of untreated control cells was set at 100%. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Treatment of cells with an LR ethanol extract (LRE) and LRE plus glutamate; (
   <bold>b</bold>) Treatment of cells with LRC and LRC plus glutamate; (
   <bold>c</bold>) Treatment of cells with LRH and LRH plus glutamate. Values are mean Â± SEM of at least three independent runs. Significant differences: 
   <sup>###</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. control; *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. glutamate alone.
