<p>From three extracts of the Tiger Milk Mushroom, only LRE showed the neuroprotective effect in hippocampal neuronal cells which is apparently mediated via inhibition of intracellular ROS accumulation and increases in both MMP and expression of antioxidant genes. In addition, LRE also had a neuroprotective effect in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> in an Alzheimer and a Huntington model. However, further studies to identify the bioactive components and exact mechanism of LRE are required to support their ability for the development of a neuroprotective supplement in the future.
