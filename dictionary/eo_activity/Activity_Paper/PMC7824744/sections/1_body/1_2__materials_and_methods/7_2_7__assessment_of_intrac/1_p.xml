<p>Intracellular ROS were determined using the CM-H2DCFDA (general oxidative stress indicator). After 14 h treatment, 10 μM of H2DCFDA was added to HT22 cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by washing three times with PBS. The fluorescence intensity (excitation = 485 nm; emission = 535 nm) was measured using an EnSpire® Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin–Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and the photographs were obtained using an Axio Observer A1 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p>
