<p>Transgenic worms, including CL2355 with a pan-neuronal expression of the Human Abeta peptide, and CL2122, a control worm, were used. This assay was slightly modified from Wu Y. et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-biology-10-00030" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both the synchronized L1 worms CL2355 and 2122 were transferred to an S-medium containing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> OP 50 as a food source. Each strain of worms was divided into a control group, a DMSO-treated group and an LRE-treated group at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL, and 50 µg/mL EGCG (dissolved in DMSO) as a positive control. All worms were kept at 16 °C for 36 h, and then shifted to 23 °C and incubated for a further 36 h. Increased temperature is required for the pan-neuronal Aβ1–42 expression in the strain CL2355. After the incubation, the worms were washed three times with an M9 buffer to completely remove 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50. Finally, around 40 worms were placed in the center of a chemotaxis agar plate (94 mm). Before placing the worms there, 1 μL of the attractant odorant (0.1% benzaldehyde in 99.8% ethanol) together with 1 μL of 1 M sodium azide, used as a worm paralyser, were added to one side of the plate. On the opposite side, 1 μL of the control odorant (99.8% ethanol) along with 1 μL of 1 M sodium azide were added. Then, all plates were kept at 23 °C for 1 h. After that, the worms were counted from both sides and the chemotaxis index (CI) was calculated by the following formular:
 <disp-formula>CI = (Na − Nc)/Nt
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>Na: Number of worms at the attractant position</p>
