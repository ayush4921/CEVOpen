<p>MTT assay, a colorimetric assay, was used to assess metabolic activity in the cells. Briefly, HT22 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. Next, the cells were treated with the group of treatments as mentioned above and incubated at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C for 14 h. After incubation, an MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 3 h more in the incubator. After that, the insoluble formazan was dissolved with 10% SDS and incubated in the incubator overnight. The MTT product was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. The percent of cell viability was calculated by the following formular.
