<p>In brief, total RNA was isolated from specific treatment cells using Trizol reagent). Using Accupower RT Premix (Bioneer), 1 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR reaction was performed by using the Green Star PCR Master Mix where SYBR Green was included (Bioneer). Then, the specific genes CAT, SOD1, SOD2 and GPx were determined by the Exicycler Real Time Quantitative Thermal Block (Bioneer). The specific primers were previously reported by our research group [
