<p>Potential contributions describe how nature could impact people and their quality of life, regardless of whether or not those contributions are actually received. Potential contributions are distinct from ecosystem functions or attributes because they are articulated and measured in relation to impacts on people (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In this assessment, we measure potential contributions based on current biodiversity and ecosystem extent. An alternate approach would be to consider potential contributions that could be available if an ecosystem changed (e.g., how much carbon could be stored if current cropland were converted to forest) or what might have been available at some time in the past (e.g., carbon storage given forest extent before European contact in the Americas). Under this alternate approach, however, potential contributions would remain unchanged with deforestation or other ecosystem conversion. It would also allow simultaneous accounting of potential contributions from conflicting land uses, for example, counting both potential carbon storage in forest and potential crop production from agriculture on the same parcel of land.
