<p content-type="flushleft">As part of the IPBES global assessment, we systematically reviewed trends in 18 contributions of nature to people. To evaluate each type of contribution of nature in a consistent manner, we developed a set of assessment questions. These questions address how nature and people coproduce the contribution, approaches for measuring the production of the contribution, links with other contributions, indicators used to represent the provision of these contributions, information about global trends in provision, and, where available, trends within different biomes and land-use types, as defined by IPBES. We also assessed how the impact on human wellbeing for a contribution of nature is defined, how the value of the contribution is measured, indicators of the impact of the contribution on quality of life, whether substitutes for the contribution are available, global trends on the impact on quality of life, and trends by user group.</p>
