<p>For the most part, global trends in environmental conditions have declined since 1970, due largely to increased anthropogenic drivers of environmental decline. For example, greenhouse-gas concentrations, ocean acidification, and soil fertility have worsened with increases in greenhouse-gas emissions and land uses that degrade soil (

For example, air quality, as measured by concentrations of particulate matter ≤2.5 μm, has generally improved in high-income countries, where concerted efforts have reduced air-pollution emissions (
