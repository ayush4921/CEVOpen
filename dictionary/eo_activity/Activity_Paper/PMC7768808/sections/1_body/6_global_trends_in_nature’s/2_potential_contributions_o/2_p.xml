<p>In contrast, some aspects of potential material contributions have increased. The global extent of land dedicated to bioenergy, food and feed, and materials has increased over the past 50 y (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, indicators of potential material contributions that account for stocks of natural resources, such as timber stands and fish populations, have declined (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, material contributions that depend on biodiversity and/or on indigenous and local knowledge are declining. For example, medicinal products that are wild-harvested are in decline, sometimes as a result of unsustainable overharvesting (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and populations of wild crop relatives and the diversity of local varieties of plant or animal species are also decreasing (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Increases in potential material contributions have led directly to declines in other types of contributions of nature. For example, conversion of forests, grasslands, and other habitats for agriculture has decreased the potential of those landscapes to provide contributions such as climate regulation (
