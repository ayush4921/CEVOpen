<p id="para0014">(a) Sample preparation, library construction and sequencing: For total genomic DNA extractions, samples of bacterial solutions (ca. 50 mL) in MFC-A and MFC-B were taken and then separated with a high-speed centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 mins) to harvest bottom bacterial “precipitate”. DNA was extracted using a QIAamp® DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to obtain an OD
 <sub>260</sub>/OD
 <sub>280</sub> ratio between 1.8–2.0 for analysis. After library construction, samples were mixed with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600-cycle) and loaded onto a MiSeq cartridge, then a 2 × 300 bp paired-end sequencing run was performed using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
