<p id="para0006">Regarding polyphenols in natural plants, over some thousand years, 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> green tea (GT) has been used as a traditional drink in China and India and become popular all over the world. In particular, UK has become one of the world's greatest tea consumer since eighteen century 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Based upon the degree of tea fermentation, 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> tea can be classified as GT (0%), yellow tea (10%−30%), Oolong tea (30%−80%) and red tea (80%−100%) 
 <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Medicinal values of tea have been well known (e.g., “Cha Jing” (Tea Bible) by Lu Yu of the Tang Dynasty), but potential health properties of tea polyphenols indicated anticancer, antioxidant validated scientifically within these 3–4 decades 
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Modern medicine used the theory of free radical and immunity to elucidate such specific effects of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> tea on human health. In summary, tea contained not only the essential nutrients of human body, but also the medicinal ingredients beneficial to the restoration of human health under certain pathological conditions 
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In fact, tea polyphenols as the main antioxidant components in 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> tea has been mentioned in medical literature. For instance, Bag et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and Henning et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> pointed out that tea polyphenols could prevent cancer by regulating the expression of genetic aberrations occurring in targeted DNA, modified histones and micro RNAs. Ding et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> also further indicated that Pu'er tea had a significant hypoglycemic effect on diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin. Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> even pointed out that theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF) in Puer and black tea could effectively inhibit SARS-CoV 3C-like protease. That is, tea polyphenols may be a potential source of anti-cancer and antiviral drugs with fewer side effects and lower prices. Moreover, recent studies also deciphered that abundant tea polyphenols in tea extract sufficiently provided a reliable source of electrochemically active RMs [
