<p id="para0016">For solid-liquid extraction, apparently the composition and content of the extract are directly associated to the solvent to be used. In this study, two types of solvents- pure water and 80% methanol were selected to extract 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> GT at room temperature and the chemical composition and content of the obtained solid extract powder would also be greatly different. Therefore, chemical constituents of water extract and methanol extract of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> GT were quantitatively analyzed by HPLC method for comparative assessment. According to Jiang et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> green tea extracts mainly contain tea polyphenols and alkaloids, while major contents of tea polyphenols are phenolic acids and catechins. Therefore, representative substances of these three categories were selected for standard quantitative analysis (i.e., gallic acid (GA), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, catechin) and caffeine (CAF, alkaloid)). According to the HPLC spectra in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> (A, B and C), the fingerprint peaks of standard GA, EGCG and CAF was responded at the retention time peak at 8 min, 17 min and 18 min, respectively, indicating that the green tea extracts contained these above-mentioned standards. As comparison of relative contents of three standard substances in the two different green tea extracts, the peak height of HPLC could be approximately represented as the relative contents of the three standard substances since the mass concentration of the prepared tea extract was identical. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>(D), the content of CAF in these two extracts was nearly equal, while the content of GA in the water extraction was relatively higher than that in the methanol extraction. However, as 
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicated, the content of EGCG was higher in MEOH than that in water, since EGCG was more soluble in MEOH than in water. In fact, Ahmad Muhamud and Amran 
 <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> indicated that EGCG contents in 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> GT were 0.9347 (MEOH extract) and 0.6705 (water extract) mg/mL. Furthermore, Oh et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> also mentioned that MEOH extract of GT could obtain 60–580 g major catechins/kg dry extract, but water extract was only 385 g major catechins/kg dry extract for 85 °C extraction. In addition, extraction through pure organic solvents was found to yield the highest content of catechins. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, some unknown substances at the retention time of 3 min and 21 min were exhibited; however, their contents in the water extraction were also relatively small. This was owing to the different solubility of these substances in two solvents with different polarity, which resulting in the different content in the extracts
