 <p>This first-attempt study deciphered combined characteristics of species evolution and bioelectricity generation of microbial community in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) supplemented with 
  <italic>Camellia</italic> green tea (GT) extracts for biomass energy extraction. Prior studies indicated that polyphenols-rich extracts as effective redox mediators (RMs) could exhibit significant electrochemical activities to enhance power generation in MFCs. However, the supplementation of 
  <italic>Camellia</italic> GT extract obtained at room temperature with significant redox capabilities into MFCs unexpectedly exhibited obvious inhibitory effect towards power generation. This systematic study indicated that the presence of antimicrobial components (especially catechins) in GT extract might significantly alter the distribution of microbial community, in particular a decrease of microbial diversity and evenness. For practical applications to different microbial systems, pre-screening criteria of selecting biocompatible RMs should not only consider their promising redox capabilities (abiotic), but also possible inhibitory potency (biotic) to receptor microbes. Although 
  <italic>Camellia</italic> tea extract was well-characterized as GRAS energy drink, some contents (e.g., catechins) may still express inhibition towards organisms and further assessment upon biotoxicity may be inevitably required for practice.
