 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>Nine compounds (
  <bold>MO1–MO9</bold>) containing the morpholine moiety were assessed for their inhibitory activities against monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Most of the compounds potently inhibited MAO-B; 
  <bold>MO1</bold> most potently inhibited with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 0.030 µM, followed by 
  <bold>MO7</bold> (0.25 µM). 
  <bold>MO5</bold> most potently inhibited AChE (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 6.1 µM), followed by 
  <bold>MO9</bold> (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 12.01 µM) and 
  <bold>MO7</bold> most potently inhibited MAO-A (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 7.1 µM). 
  <bold>MO1</bold> was a reversible mixed-type inhibitor of MAO-B (
  <italic>K
   <sub>i</sub>
  </italic> = 0.018 µM); 
  <bold>MO5</bold> reversibly competitively inhibited AChE (
  <italic>K
   <sub>i</sub>
  </italic> = 2.52 µM); and 
  <bold>MO9</bold> reversibly noncompetitively inhibited AChE (
  <italic>K
   <sub>i</sub>
  </italic> = 7.04 µM). 
  <bold>MO1</bold>, 
  <bold>MO5</bold> and 
  <bold>MO9</bold> crossed the blood–brain barrier, and were non-toxic to normal VERO cells. These results show that 
  <bold>MO1</bold> is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B and that 
  <bold>MO5</bold> is a dual-acting inhibitor of AChE and MAO-B, and that both should be considered candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
