  <p>Dialysis recoveries of MAO-B inhibition by 
   <bold>MO1</bold> (A) and AChE inhibition by 
   <bold>MO5</bold> and 
   <bold>MO9</bold> (B). The concentrations of the inhibitors used were approximately 2 × IC
   <sub>50</sub> values: 
   <bold>MO1</bold>, 0.06 µM; 
   <bold>MO5</bold>, 12.0 µM; 
   <bold>MO9</bold>, 24.0 µM; lazabemide, 0.12 µM; pargyline, 0.06 µM; and tacrine, 0.54 µM (tacrine was used as a reference reversible inhibitor). For recovery experiments, preincubated enzyme mixtures were dialysed as described in the text.
