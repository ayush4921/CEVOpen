 <bold>MO1, MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> were subjected to ROS assays using Hela cells. ROS levels significantly increased in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated Hela cells as determined by fluorescent image analyses (

 <bold>MO1</bold> and 
 <bold>MO5</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(C,D)</xref>) at 40 µg/mL resulted in significantly lower ROS levels than 
 <bold>MO9</bold> (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was markedly reduced by the lead MAO-B inhibitor 
 <bold>MO1</bold>, which suggested that the molecule can be highly recommended for the arrest of free radicals in the neurodegenerative disorders.
