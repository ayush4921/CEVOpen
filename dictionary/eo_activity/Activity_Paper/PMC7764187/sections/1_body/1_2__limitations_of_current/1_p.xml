<p>Currently approved drugs for AD include cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine). Cholinesterase inhibitors provide only symptomatic relief of behavioral deficits without modifying the complex pathologies in mild to moderate AD patients [

Cholinesterase inhibitors significantly improve the cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD but their efficacy for neuropsychiatric symptoms is still questionable. AD patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors experience adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, etc. [

The common adverse effects associated with AChE inhibitors are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight, though these can be minimized by slow dose escalation and administration with food. Other adverse effects of AChE inhibitors such as extrapyramidal symptoms, sleep disorder and cardiorespiratory adverse effects, are associated with central cholinergic over-activity whereas muscle cramps, weakness and urinary incontinence, are associated with peripheral cholinergic over-activity [
