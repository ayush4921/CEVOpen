<p>Preclinical studies: Total alkaloid extract (ashwagandholine, AG) of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> root has been studied for its effects on CNS [

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> attenuated the memory loss induced by STZ through the antioxidant mechanism [
 <xref rid="B154-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. The root preparation has been shown to have protective effects in neurodegenerative disorders by reducing stress induced degeneration in the brain hippocampus of rats [

 <xref rid="B156-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin differentially (40 mg/kg for 7 days) but favorably altered the AChE activity and enhanced M
 <sub>1</sub>- and M
 <sub>2</sub>-muscarinic receptor-binding in various brain regions [
 <xref rid="B157-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Withaferin A and Withanolide A suggested to have a potent immunomodulatory effect in BV-2 microglial cells by triggering the Nrf2 pathway, leading to production of the neuroprotective protein, such as heme oxygenase-1 [
