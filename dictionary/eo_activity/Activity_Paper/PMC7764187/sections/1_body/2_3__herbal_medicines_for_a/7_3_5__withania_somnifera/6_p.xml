<p>Treatment with 
 <italic>Withania</italic> root extract (1 g/kg, p.o for 30 days) reversed the AD pathology by upregulating the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, which enhanced the Aβ clearance and ameliorated the cognitive deficit in middle-aged and old APP/PS1 mice [
 <xref rid="B161-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Alcoholic extract of the 
 <italic>Withania</italic> leaf and its component withanone was neuroprotective against scopalmine induced changes in the brain [
 <xref rid="B162-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. An in-vitro, inhibitory effect on the fibril formation by Aβ peptide has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B163-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The increase in cortical muscarinic ACh receptor capacity might partly explain the cognition-enhancing and memory-improving effects of 
 <italic>Withania</italic>. The root extract and their chemical constituents such as glycowithanolides also possess anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which may be relevant in AD treatment [

 <xref rid="B165-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Furthermore, withanone, a chemical constituent from root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> showed improvement in cognitive functions by inhibiting amyloid processing and reducing the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (20 mg/mL) treatment mitigated the Aβ toxicity and mediated longevity in the AD model of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [
