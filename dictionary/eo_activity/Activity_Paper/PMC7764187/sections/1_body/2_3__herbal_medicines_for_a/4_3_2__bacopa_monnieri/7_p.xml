<p>Stough et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] reported significant improvement in verbal learning, memory consolidation and speed of early information processing following 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic> administration (containing 55% combined bacosides) for 12 weeks at a dose of 300 mg daily in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers (age 18–60 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 46). Since the effects were not observed until five weeks of treatment, the slow onset of action may be attributed to 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic>’s antioxidant properties and/or its effect on the cholinergic system. In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 54 elderly participants without clinical signs of dementia (mean age 73.5 years), similar 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic> treatment enhanced an auditory verbal learning test, delayed word recall memory scores and a stroop test relative to the placebo [

 <italic>Bacopa</italic> extract 125 mg was given twice daily for 12 weeks in a double blind, placebo-controlled manner. There was a significant improvement in mental control, logical memory and paired associated learning [

 <italic>Bacopa</italic> extract at the dose of 300 mg/kg, daily for 12 weeks improved memory acquisition and retention in healthy older Australians population [
