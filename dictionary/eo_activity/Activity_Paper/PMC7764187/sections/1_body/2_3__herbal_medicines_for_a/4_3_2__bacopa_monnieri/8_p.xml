<p>In children (age 6–8 years), 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic> syrup (350 mg 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic> powder), when administered three times a day for three months, resulted in significant improvement as compared to the placebo [

 <xref rid="B93-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] carried out a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 36 children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (mean age 8.3–9.3 years). Nineteen children received 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic> extract (standardized to contain 20% bacosides) at a dosage of 50 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. As compared to placebo, a significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in 
 <italic>Bacopa</italic>-treated children at 12 weeks as evidenced by improvement in sentence repetition, logical memory and paired associate learning tasks, which was maintained at 16 weeks (after four weeks of placebo administration).
