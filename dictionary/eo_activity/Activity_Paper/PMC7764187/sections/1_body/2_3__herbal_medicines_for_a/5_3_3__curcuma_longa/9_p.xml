<p>Chronic stress induces impairment of spatial cognition, neuroendocrine and plasticity abnormalities due to an increase in serum corticosterone levels. Curcumin exerts its neuroprotective effect by normalizing the corticosterone response, resulting in downregulating of calcium/calmodulin kinase II and glutamate receptor (NMDA-2B) levels [

 <xref rid="B133-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], where treatment with 300 mg/kg curcumin reversed spatial learning and memory impairment accompanied by hippocampal regeneration. Evidence also suggests that metals are concentrated in the AD brain and curcumin chelates iron and copper (but not zinc) bound to beta amyloid potentially contributing to amyloid reduction [

 <xref rid="B135-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], where aerosol-mediated treatment of young 5XFAD mice with curcumin averted Aβ buildup and memory deficits in adulthood as compared to the untreated mice.
