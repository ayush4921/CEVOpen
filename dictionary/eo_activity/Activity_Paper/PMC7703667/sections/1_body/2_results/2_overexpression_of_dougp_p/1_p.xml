<p>Studies have shown that UGPases, along with other polysaccharide synthesis-related enzymes, promote synthesis of structural or storage polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). If 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> has a similar function as the other UGPases, increased biomass is expected in 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression transgenic seedlings. Therefore, we investigated the growth of transgenic and wild-type 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> plants at different stages (3, 30, and 60 days after transplanting) by measuring the biomass of protocorms, and seedlings were determined. Interestingly, both higher growth rate and increased biomass of protocorms were observed in the transgenic seedlings compared to the wild-type ones after 3, 30, and 60 days after transplanting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Similar results were observed in the wild-type and transgenic seedlings on 3, 30, and 60 days after transplanting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, the weight of protocorms and the height of seedlings were around twofold of the corresponding ones of wild-type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C,D</xref>) after 60 days. Based on these results, we concluded that the overexpression of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> may increase the biomass of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> at both the protocorm and seedling stages.
