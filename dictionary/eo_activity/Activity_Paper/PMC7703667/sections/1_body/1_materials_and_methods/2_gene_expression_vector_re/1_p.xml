<p>The 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression construct (
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> OE) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (gene bank ID: KF711982.1) was used for this study. The plasmid was transformed into 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 1993</xref>). When the 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> culture OD
 <sub>600</sub> reached 0.8, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Before infection, the pellets were re-suspended in a liquid MS basal salt and adjusted to OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Two-month-old protocorms (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) were used for 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation. When performing infections, the protocorms were incubated in the 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> suspension at 28°C for 30 min with agitation at 50 rpm on a shaker. After infection, the protocorms were transferred to filter papers to remove spare liquid.
