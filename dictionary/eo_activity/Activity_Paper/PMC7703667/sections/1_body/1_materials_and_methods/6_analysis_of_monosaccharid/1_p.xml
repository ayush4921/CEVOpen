<p>Stems of 18-month-old wild-type and three independent transgenic 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> seedlings were dried at 80°C until constant weight. Then the dried stems were grounded to powder with a mortar at room temperature. Around 0.3 g of dry powder was used to extract water-soluble polysaccharides, which were then analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to the reported method (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the powder of each sample was pre-extracted with 80% ethanol at 80°C for 2 h. This process was repeated twice to further remove monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and ethanol-soluble materials. Then, the water-soluble polysaccharides were extracted with double-distilled water at 100°C for 2.5 h. The extraction was hydrolyzed with 3 M HCl, derivatized with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP), and monosaccharide content was analyzed by using HPLC.
