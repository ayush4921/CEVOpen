<p>To determine the effects of different stress on transgenic 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, plants of wild-type and three independent overexpression lines with a height of 2–3 cm were selected and cultured in a medium supplemented with mannitol (500 mM) for osmotic stress treatment. Freezing treatment was performed by treating plants at −20°C for 1 h. Ten or Twenty days after freezing or osmotic treatment, plants were harvested for chlorophyll and proline content and SOD enzyme activity tests. Results are presented as mean ± standard error calculated from three biological replicates.
