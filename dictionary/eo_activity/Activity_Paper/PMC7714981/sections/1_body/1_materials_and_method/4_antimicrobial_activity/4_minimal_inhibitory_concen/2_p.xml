<p id="p0060">In dilution technique, two fold serial dilutions of the extracts were prepared in concentrations ranging from 625 to 10,000 μg
 <italic>l</italic>mI. From each dilution of each extract, one milliliter of was mixed with 9 ml of Muller Hinton Agar. Ten microliter of each standardized broth cultures (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) was cultivated on the surface of the plates containing various concentrations of the extracts. The plates were then incubated according to growth requirement of each organism and observed for any visible bacterial growth. MIC was the lowest concentration of extract that resulted in no visible growth on the surface of the agar.
