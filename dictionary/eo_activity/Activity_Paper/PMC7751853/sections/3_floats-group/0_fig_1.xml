  <title>Suppression of cytokine-induced beta cell damage by bergenin.</title>
  <p>(A) The chemical structure of bergenin. (B) Cellular ATP levels of INS-1E cells treated for two days with bergenin in the absence of cytokine treatment. INS-1E cells were treated for two days with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, INF-γ, and TNF-α) in the presence or absence of bergenin (0.25–10 μM). (C) Dose-dependent effects of bergenin on cellular ATP levels after 48 hr treatment with cytokines. (D) Dose-dependent effects of bergenin on caspase-3 activity after 48 hr of treatment with cytokines. Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation of 12 independent wells for A-B. * indicates p &lt;0.05, ‡&lt;0.01, and §&lt;0.001 relative to cytokine-treated cells.</p>
