  <title>Bergenin suppresses cytokine-induced apoptosis in beta cells.</title>
  <p>INS-1E cells were treated with cytokines (IL-1β, INF-γ, and TNF-α) in the presence or absence bergenin (2–10 μM) for 48 hr, and were assessed for apoptosis inhibition. (A) Represents the flow cytometric analysis of INS-1E cells treated with bergenin in the presence of cytokines cocktail. The viable cell populations are in the lower left quadrant (Annexin V
   <sup>-</sup>/PI
   <sup>-</sup>); the cells at the early apoptosis are in the lower right quadrant (Annexin V
   <sup>+</sup>/PI
   <sup>-</sup>); and the ones at the late apoptosis are in the upper right quadrant (Annexin V
   <sup>+</sup>/PI
   <sup>+</sup>); and dead cells are in the upper left quadrant (Annexin V
   <sup>-</sup>/PI
   <sup>+</sup>). (B) Represents the live and apoptotic beta cell population after treatment with cytokines and bergenin. Data are represented the mean ± standard deviation of 2 independent experiments. * indicates p &lt;0.05, ‡&lt;0.01 and § &lt;0.001 relative to cytokine-treated cells.
