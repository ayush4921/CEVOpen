  <title>Inhibition of cellular nitrite production and restoration of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.</title>
  <p>INS-1E cells were treated for two days with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, INF-γ, and TNF-α) in the presence or absence of bergenin (0.25–10 μM). (A) Dose-dependent effects of bergenin on cellular nitrite production after 48 hr treatment with cytokines. Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation of 12 independent wells for nitrite production. (B) The glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was measured in “low glucose” (2 mM), and “high glucose” (16 mM) conditions in the presence of bergenin. Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation of six independent wells for insulin secretion. * indicates p &lt;0.05, ‡&lt;0.01, and §&lt;0.001 relative to cytokine-treated cells.</p>
