<p>Annexin V serves as a useful marker for the identification of apoptotic cells, since it binds to phosphatidylserine with high affinity in the presence of Ca
 <sup>+2</sup> whereas, propidium iodide (PI) intercalates with DNA/RNA of non-viable cells due to lack of membrane integrity. Annexin V-FITC + propidium iodide staining works as follows: the viable cells are negative to both the annexin V/ PI dyes, whereas the apoptotic cells are stained with annexin V-FITC only. Moreover, the cells that take up PI are considered as dead cells; while those positive for both the annexin V/ PI dyes are considered as late apoptotic cells [
