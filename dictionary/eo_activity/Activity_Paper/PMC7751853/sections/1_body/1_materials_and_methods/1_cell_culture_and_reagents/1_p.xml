<p>INS-1E is a derivative of INS-1 cells originally established from an x-ray induced insulinoma in rat [
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. INS-1E cell line was generously provided by Paolo Meda, Department of Morphology, University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland. The INS-1E cells were negative for mycoplasma contamination, and were verified by the Venor
 <sup>™</sup> GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). INS-1E cells were cultivated in complete medium composed of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 11 mM glucose, glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin, 50 mg/L streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 50 μM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. INS-1E cells were grown in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere, and were split every week. All cell culture reagents and supplements were obtained from Gibco (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). Whereas, recombinant rat IL-1β, mouse IFN-γ, and mouse TNF-α were purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cell Titer-Glo and caspase-Glo 3/7 reagents were purchased from Promega (Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA). Ultrasensitive rat insulin ELISA kit was purchased from ALPCO (Salem, NH, USA). Alexa Fluor® 488 Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis kit was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Waltham, USA). Bergenin and Griess reagent were purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, USA.
