<p>The main physiological function of beta cells is to secrete insulin following glucose exposure. In the current study, two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; however, addition of bergenin significantly restored insulin secretion in beta cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.73 Î¼M (
