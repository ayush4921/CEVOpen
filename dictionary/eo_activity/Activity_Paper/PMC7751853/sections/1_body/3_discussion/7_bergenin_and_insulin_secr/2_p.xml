<p>In the present study, bergenin exhibited multiple pharmacological activities simultaneously while protecting beta cells from the deleterious effects of inflammatory cytokine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241349.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Bergenin seems to be potentially influencing NF-ÎºB, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways, as evident from the inhibition of downstream effector molecules of these pathways, such as caspse-3, NO, ROS, and apoptosis. By inhibiting cytokine-induced NO production, bergenin was able to increase ATP levels, decrease ROS production, and increase insulin production.
