<p>Diabetes mellitus has reached an epidemic proportion globally, with 463 million people currently suffering from this disease according to the International Diabetes Federation [

Pancreatic beta cells are reported to have low antioxidant potential, and are sensitive towards reactive oxygen (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). This oxidative stress may ultimately lead to the impairment in beta cell insulin secretory function. In both type1, and type 2 diabetes, beta cells mass is significantly reduced due to apoptosis. The loss of beta cell identity is also reported to be one of the hallmarks of reduced functional beta cell mass [
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At early stages of diabetes, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in beta cells that eventually results in hyperglycemic condition in the diabetic patients. As such, at the time of disease diagnosis, beta cell population is reported to be decreased by 70–80% in type 1 diabetes, and about 50% in type 2 diabetes patients [
