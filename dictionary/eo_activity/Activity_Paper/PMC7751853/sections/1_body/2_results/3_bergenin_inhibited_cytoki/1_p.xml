<p>Nitric oxide is very reactive molecule, whose production is stimulated by IL-1β, and IFN-γ, leading to apoptotic beta cell death. Cellular nitrite production, a stable oxidized product of nitric oxide, served as a surrogate marker for the NO production in INS-1E cells. Two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail resulted in approximately 5-fold increase in the NO levels as compared to the untreated controls (
