<p>Oxysophoridine belongs to the quinolizidine alkaloid group and is one of the alkaloids extracted from the Chinese medicinal plant 
 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic> and 
 <italic>Siphocampylus verticillatus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This alkaloid has various known pharmacological activities, especially in the field of oncology [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and has anti-oxidative stress, strong anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis properties [

 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Studies investigating the anti-viral properties of this alkaloid have not been very successful but a recent study has reported that SARS-CoV-2 replication is inhibited by oxysophoridine in cell culture (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.18 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 40 μM) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Little-to-nothing is known about the anti-viral mode of action of oxysophoridine, however, and future studies are needed to determine how this alkaloid interferes with coronaviral replication.
