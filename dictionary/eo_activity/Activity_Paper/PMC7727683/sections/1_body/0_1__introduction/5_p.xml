<p>Therefore, considering the therapeutic anti-viral potential, including anti-coronaviral, of this class of natural products, the aim of this study was to review the antiviral activity of alkaloids against coronaviruses. This study looked at the various alkaloids which showed in vitro and in vivo anti-coronavirus activity, with emphasis on human anti-coronaviral activity. In silico analysis was then performed to study the affinity of the eleven identified alkaloids—with anti-coronavirus activity—for binding to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
