<p>Traditional herbal medicines and plant-based natural compounds are rich resources of new antiviral drugs. In fact, about 25% of commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants. Many traditional herbal medicines possess antiviral activity against a plethora of viral strains, exerting their antiviral activity on the virus life cycle, including viral entry, replication, assembly, and release, and also the virusâ€“host-specific interactions. Alkaloids have been reported as broad-spectrum inhibitors of animal and human coronaviruses. Whereas the mechanisms used by HHT, oxysophoridine and tylophorine, and tylophorine analogs to inhibit CoV replication are not known, lycorine modulates host factors to interfere with viral replication. On the other hand, tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine block virus translocation through the endolysosomal system or target viral RNA, inhibiting TGEV replication and act jointly with a JAK-family inhibitor for comprehensive anti-CoV activity. Indigo, on the other hand, inhibits the cleavage activities of the 3CLpro to interfere with virus replication. Lastly, tryptanthrin and indigodole B decrease virus yield and have potent viricidal activity. In particular, tryptanthrin was reported to block viral RNA genome synthesis as well as the activity of the papain-like protease 2 in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. As shown in the in silico simulations using biological targets related to SARS-CoV-2 and in some recent in vitro studies, the alkaloids provide an attractive prospect as anti-coronavirus drugs and warrants further investigation.</p>
