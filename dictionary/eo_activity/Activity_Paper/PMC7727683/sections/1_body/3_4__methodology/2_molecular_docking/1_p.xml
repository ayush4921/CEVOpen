<p>The X-ray crystal structure of the S-RBD protein of SARS-COV-2 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank [
 <uri xlink:href="www.rcsb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.rcsb.org</uri>] (PDB code: 6vw1) [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The protein structure was prepared using the default protein preparation tools integrated into the software. This was accomplished by adding hydrogen atoms to the amino acid residues, completing the missing residues, and applying force field parameters by using CHARMm forcefield [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. All of the protein structures were minimized using 500 steps employing a SMART minimizer algorithm. Also, binding pockets, together with the surrounding amino acid residues, were identified. The ligands were prepared using the ligand preparation protocol of Accelrys Discovery Studio [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The ionization pH was adjusted to 7.4, hydrogen atoms were added and no isomers or tautomers were generated from the ligands. Docking was carried out using Libdock software [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] in the interface of Accelrys Discovery Studio 4.0 [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Ten docking poses were generated for each ligand docked and were then thoroughly inspected for proposing the best binding mode. The top-ranked poses were selected for analysis.
