<p>In this study, the diversity and antimicrobial activities of the endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> were investigated for the first time. Our results illustrated that 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> harbored abundant fungal endophytes representing a high level taxonomic diversity. It was found that 13 out of 130 endophytic fungal ethyl acetate extracts exhibited inhibitory activities against at least one of the pathogenic microorganisms. Specifically, the strain F8158, which was identified as 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> cf. 
 <italic>harzianum</italic> (commonly used as a biocontrol strain in the agricultural production process), exhibited good antagonistic activity against different plant pathogenic fungi and has a potential application in the biological control. In addition, it is noteworthy that the strain F8157 (
 <italic>Thanatephorus cucumeris</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen) showed antibacterial and antifungal activity firstly and has the potential research value. Overall, it was indicated that the endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>C. japonicus</italic> may be of potential interest in screening bio-control agents and discovery of new bioactive compounds.
