<p>Consistent hyperglycaemia characterises type-2 diabetes (T2D), a condition caused by enzymatic degradation of carbohydrates and lipids in the cell, affecting glucose metabolism. Normalisation of blood glucose prevents hyperglycaemia and the development of diabetes complications. For diabetes patients, controlling postprandial hyperglycaemia is one of the main therapeutic targets. One way to do so is to reduce starch digestion rates by consuming low glycaemic index foods or intake of carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes inhibitors
