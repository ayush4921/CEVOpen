<p>The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the other extracts showed a mixed type of inhibition characteristics, since increasing the concentration of extracts resulted in a family of straight lines with different slope and y-intercepts, which intersected in the second quadrant, example in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(b)</xref>. This kinetic analysis indicates that these extracts can bind not only with the free enzyme but also with the enzyme-substrate complex. The equilibrium constants for binding with the free enzyme (K
 <sub>I</sub>) and with the enzyme-substrate complex (
 <italic>K
  <sub>IS</sub>
 </italic>) were obtained from the slope (

  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>/

 <sub>max</sub>) or the 1/

 <sub>max</sub> values (
 <italic>y</italic>-intercepts) versus inhibitor concentration, respectively (
