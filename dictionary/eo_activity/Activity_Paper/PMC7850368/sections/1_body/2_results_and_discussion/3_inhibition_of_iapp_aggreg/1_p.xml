<p>For the identification and quantification of amyloid fibrils 
 <italic>in vitro, e</italic>xtrinsic fluorescence of the ThT was used to monitor fibrillation kinetics in real-time. When ThT binds to β-sheet-rich structures such as amyloid fibrils, ThT displays enhanced fluorescence and a characteristic blue shift in the emission spectrum when bound to amyloid fibrils. The corresponding spectra are measured, and the fluorescence intensities of the dye are plotted as a function of time. Any deviation from the control sample along the time scale, that is, peptide aggregation in the absence of any additive, could be indicative of inhibition or acceleration of the aggregation processes.
