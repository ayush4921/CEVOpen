<p>This review report has revealed the efficacy of medicinal plants as an alternative therapy in tackling the development and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens coupled with the toxic effects of some antibiotics. However, this study shows the lack of adequate characterization of the chemical composition of the antimicrobial medicinal plants in Nigeria. Only a few of the medicinal plants studied in Nigeria have their bioactive components investigated using advanced analyses such as GC-MS and HPLC. The absence of such analyses makes the claims from ethnomedicinal and phytochemical screening studies invalidated. Due to enormous therapeutic possibilities buried in the medicinal plants, there is a need for research into unique fingerprints and novel compounds that can provide cure to the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) endemic in Africa and especially in Nigeria. Moreover, there is a need for innovative investigation of novel natural bioactive compounds for the development of chemical libraries useful for drug discovery and development pipelines. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of the synergy of two or more combinations of phytochemicals at a molecular level will decrease the use of antibiotics and help to prevent and overcome drug-resistant pathogens.</p>
