<p>Screening of chemical composition of medicinal plants revealed that they contain different bioactive compounds which include saponins, tannins, and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The main functional classes of phytochemicals with therapeutic potential include antioxidants, anticancer agents, immunity-potentiating agents, detoxifying agents, and neuropharmacological agents [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, each of the functional classes of the phytochemicals consists of a wide range of compounds at varying potency and sometimes with multiple functions [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Plants produce unique arrays of phytochemicals that frequently belong to existing biochemical motifs [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among the bioactive compounds, triterpenoids provide anti-inflammatory activity and tannins possess astringent, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity properties [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Saponins often have medicinal features as blood cleansers, expectorants, and antibiotics. At the same time, alkaloids have significant effects on the central nervous system (CNS), and glycosides are known for their ability to increase the forces of systolic concentration [
