<p>Pharmaceutically, the extraction involves the separation of constituents of plant and microorganism tissues using selective buffer solution or solvents according to standard protocols [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The crucial parameters that can influence the quality of an extract from the plant include parts used as a sample (leaf, bark, or root), solvent and its concentration used for extraction, and extraction method, while the effect of chemical constituents obtained from the extract depends on the nature of the plant material, its source, the extent of processing, and level of moisture, as well as particle size [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Factors that can influence the secondary metabolite composition and quantity in an extract include type and time of extraction, nature and concentration of the solvent, processing temperature, and polarity of analytes [
