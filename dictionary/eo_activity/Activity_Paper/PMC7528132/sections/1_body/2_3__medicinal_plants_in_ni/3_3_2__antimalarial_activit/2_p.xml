<p>A study on the anticoccidial effect of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>lucida</italic> on 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> parasites has suggested its potential as an anticoccidial drug for veterinary purposes, especially the poultry birds [

 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>lucida</italic> showed high binding affinity toward the selected histone deacetylases (class I HDAC and HDAC7 isoforms) and exhibited good druggable characteristics [
