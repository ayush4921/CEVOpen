 <italic>oleifera</italic> seeds using the cold extraction method and found the highest parasite inhibition activity in crude ethanolic extract. Besides, 
 <italic>Landolphia owariensis</italic> P.Beauv., a member of the family Apocynaceae, is used in southeast Nigeria for the treatment of malaria. A study has shown that methanol fractions of

 <italic>owariensis</italic> leaf in early, established, and residual infections in 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>-infected albino mice have the most significant antiplasmodial activity in all the models carried out, due to alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, and tannins present in the fractions [
