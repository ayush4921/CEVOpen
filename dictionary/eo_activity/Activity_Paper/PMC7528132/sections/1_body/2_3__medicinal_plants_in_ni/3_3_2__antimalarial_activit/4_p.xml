 <italic>Allamanda cathartica</italic> and 
 <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> are antimalarial plants [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>Alchornea laxiflora</italic> (Benth.), a member of the family Euphorbiaceae, is used traditionally in the treatment of malaria in Nigeria. Furthermore, the study has shown that root extract 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>laxiflora</italic> exerted significant antimalarial activity against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>berghei</italic> infection while ethyl acetate fraction exerted the highest activity against chloroquine-sensitive (Pf3D7) and -resistant (PfINDO) strains of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> infection in mice [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. 
 <italic>Enantia chlorantha</italic> has significant utilization in traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases which include malaria. However, another study has suggested that oral administration of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>chlorantha</italic> at relatively high doses may produce severe toxic effects [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A study on the acute and subacute toxicity of the medicinal plant 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>chlorantha</italic> carried out in mice showed a mean lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of 0.7 g·kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for ethanolic but 43.65 g·kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for aqueous preparations [
