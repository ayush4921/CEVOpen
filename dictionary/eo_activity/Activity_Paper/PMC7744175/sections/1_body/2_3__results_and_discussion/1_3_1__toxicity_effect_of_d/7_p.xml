<p>Cold aqueous extract was observed to have good antiproliferation effect on A549 compared to hot aqueous extract with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 414.29 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The finding was in line with several studies with hispolon-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells A549 and H66 but different in their levels of cytotoxicity. Ethanol extract from fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>Phellinus igniarius</italic> had IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 531.7 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml against A549 but had lower cytotoxicity against SGC-7901 (gastric cancer) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 110.7 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast with previous discoveries, 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> extract tested in the present study had lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value suggesting higher level of cytotoxicity activity against A549 cells compared to 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic>. However, each mushroom has specific ability against specific tumor cells depending on its bioactive constituents. As an example, total triterpenes of 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> were reported to be highly effective in inhibiting proliferation of MCF7 cells at concentration of 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] while polysaccharide extract of the same had immunomodulatory activity [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These conflicting findings were likely due to differences in the extraction methods and solvents used in the extraction protocol as differences in chemical composition yielded different outcomes. Nevertheless, the ability of cold aqueous mycelium extract against A549 cell was slower compared to other mushroom types which could be related to bioreactivity at cellular level from different extraction methods and parts of mushrooms sourced. As proven by several other studies, extracts from different parts of mushrooms (such as vegetative part) and harvest stages (different physiological stages) were reported to have different levels of bioactivities [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Various cytotoxicity levels in mushrooms against A549 cells have been reported from various sources and extract types such as polysaccharide extract of 
 <italic>F. fomentarius</italic> from fruiting bodies (IC
 <sub>50</sub> : 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml), ethanol extract of sclerotia of 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> : 301.1 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml), and aqueous extract of 
 <italic>L. rhinocerotis</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> : 41.13 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml) [
