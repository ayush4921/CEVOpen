<p>The cytotoxic effect of aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> affected morphological structures of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner after 72 hr of treatment exposure. At higher concentration of cold aqueous application, A549 cell line became refractile under microscopic observations as the cells progressively shrunk to smaller, rounder shape and started to detach. Some of dead cells were observed to become detached and floated in the medium after treatment of cold aqueous at concentrations of 500 and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. In hot aqueous extract, the changes occurred at the highest concentration (1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) tested. MRC5 cells showed insensitive reactions to hot aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic>. The extract triggered proliferation rate at the highest confluent level, causing cytotoxicity effect on A549 cells. Selective ability of hot aqueous extract could be related to inhibition of mitochondrial Complex 1, where a class of therapeutic drugs like lipophilic compounds tended to inhibit mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial respiration in tumour cells at relatively nontoxic concentrations [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This apoptosis is a physiological program which eliminates cells by disrupting morphological and physiological characteristics of cells shrinkage, chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies. This has been an approach used in establishing cytotoxic effects of most anticancer agents [
