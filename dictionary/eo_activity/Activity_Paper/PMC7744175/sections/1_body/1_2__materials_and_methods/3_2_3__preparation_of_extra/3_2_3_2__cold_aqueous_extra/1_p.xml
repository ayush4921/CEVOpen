<p>The extraction method for cold aqueous extract was adapted from Tseng and Mau [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ratio of mycelium sample to double-distilled water was 1 : 10. Ten grams of mycelium powder was added to100 ml of distilled water in a 500 ml flask while shaking vigorously. The flask containing the sample mixture was let to stand while stirring at 100 rpm for 24 hours at room temperature (25°C). Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The residue was reextracted by adding 100 ml of distilled water. The filtrates from two rounds of extractions were combined and freeze-dried. The extract obtained was stored at 4°C and used directly for cytotoxicity evaluation.
