<p>Cell viability was determined through MTT bioassay protocols adopted from Mosmann [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Following incubation in different concentrations of samples, an amount of 15 mg of MTT powder was weighed and diluted in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to obtain a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The MTT solution was filtered using 0.22 nm filter membrane into a Petri dish. Treated plates were retrieved from the incubator and 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>l MTT solution was pipetted into each well. The plates were reincubated in an incubator for 4 hours after which the solution was discarded leaving only the purple formazan crystals. An amount of 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l DMSO was added into all wells to dissolve the purple formazan crystals by gently resuspending until completely dissolved. Absorbance of the assay was measured using a microplate reader at 590 nm.
