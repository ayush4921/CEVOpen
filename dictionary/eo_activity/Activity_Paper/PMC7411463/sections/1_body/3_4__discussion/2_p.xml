<p>The causative factors resulting in hepatobiliary damage include alcohol, drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, excessive accumulation of fats, viral infections, exposure to toxic chemicals or carcinogens, and abnormalities in the immune system. These triggers might stimulate the emergence of the pathological phenomenon in the hepatobiliary system, such as structural and functional damages of tissues, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The hepatobiliary system is vulnerable to oxidative stress. Excessive production of free radicals in the mitochondria, peroxisome, and microsomes of the liver parenchymal cells damages Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and HSCs, as well as parenchymal cells themselves [

Hence, resolving the oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and preventing toxic damage to cells and tissues are important to manage hepatobiliary diseases.
