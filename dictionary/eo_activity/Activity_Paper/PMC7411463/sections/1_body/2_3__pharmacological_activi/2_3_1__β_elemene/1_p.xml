 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>, 204.34 g/mol) is a member of the elemene sesquiterpenoids derived from the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Its compound exerted beneficial activities against various types of tumor, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, gastric cancer, and sarcoma cancer [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Similarly, most experimental studies of 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene targeting hepatobiliary diseases have been related to cancer. In mice models transplanted with human HCC cell lines (H22 [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and MHCC97H cells [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]), 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene reduced the weight and volume of the tumor tissue. In particular, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene enhanced the sensitivity of the anticancer drugs by increasing the level of copper transporter 1, aiding in the uptake of oxaliplatin into liver cells [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Based on the underlying mechanisms of its anticancer effects, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells by increasing histone H1 protein in H22 cells [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and its treatment induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis of HepG2 cells by augmenting Fas and FasL mRNA and proteins on the cellular surface [
