<p>Preventing and treating hepatobiliary diseases with medicinal plants has had a long history. To date, many herbal medicines including 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> (milk thistle), 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic>, 
 <italic>Artemisia capillaris, Lysimachia christinae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> have been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in managing different indications related to liver and biliary dysfunctions without harmful side effects [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. From the hepatoprotective and therapeutic viewpoints, 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> (
 <italic>C. longa</italic>) deserves clinical attention. According to the TCM theory, the radix (Yujin in Chinese) and rhizoma (Jiang Huang in Chinese) of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> are commonly attributed to the liver meridian [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> for resolving pathological disorders in the hepatic, gallbladder, and biliary system. In addition, curcumin, a representative compound from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, was introduced as a promising candidate that exhibits anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antitumor activities which contribute to the treatment of viral hepatitis, stone, fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, etc. [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Due to the low absorption and bioavailability of curcumin, assuming that the effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> are largely attributed to the efficacy of curcumin might be misleading.
