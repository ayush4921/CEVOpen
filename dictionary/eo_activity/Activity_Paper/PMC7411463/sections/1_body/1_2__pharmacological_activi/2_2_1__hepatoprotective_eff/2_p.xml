<p>Carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>) is a representative toxic material that induces severe liver injury, which may result in hepatic cirrhotic changes. In rodent models, oral administration and intraperitoneal injection of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> increased the levels of the biochemical indicators (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TB)) and the hepatosomatic index with hepatic lobular disorganization. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> reversed these abnormal measures and improved the histological changes [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> lowered the levels of serum AST, ALT, and ALP, hepatosomatic index, and mortality in rats with diethylnitrosamine- (DEN-) induced carcinogenic liver injury [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, in the presence of thioacetamide (TAA) and aflatoxin, which are toxic carcinogens, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> recovered serum AST, ALT, protein, and albumin levels and decreased the hepatosomatic index in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and broiler chickens, respectively [
