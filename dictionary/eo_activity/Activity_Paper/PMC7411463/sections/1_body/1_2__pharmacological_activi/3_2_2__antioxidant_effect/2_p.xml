 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and benzopyrene [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] are the main reagents used to induce intrahepatic oxidative stress in most experiments performed to investigate the antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>. Most of these chemicals are metabolized in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum, and their metabolites lead to protein and lipid peroxidation, depletion of antioxidant enzymes, and triggering of hepatic necrosis by covalently binding with nuclear DNA [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. First, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> increased the production of the antioxidant factors, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GR) in the liver of rodents, which were depleted by the above chemicals. In addition, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> regulated the intrahepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, one of the most popular biomarkers of oxidative stress in rats administered TAA. Furthermore, the 95% ethanol extract of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> reversed the levels of hepatic nitrotyrosine (a biological marker for protein oxidation) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), indicating DNA oxidative damage, as effective as silymarin in SD rats [
