<p>Most experimental studies demonstrating the antitumor effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> against hepatobiliary system were based on HCC cell models or animal models induced by carcinogens of HCC. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells by inducing apoptotic changes [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In addition, the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> lowered the HCC incidence rate [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the level of the serum tumor marker, 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-fetoprotein [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], in DEN-stimulated SD rats. In parallel, histological findings were characterized by the reduction in the number and size of GGT-positive hepatocytes, which are important in tumorigenesis in SD rats induced by DEN [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> impeded tumor angiogenesis by decreasing the level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in DEN-induced Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In p-DAN and phenobarbital-induced rat models, the ethanol extract of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> inhibited liver carcinogenesis by suppressing the hepatic expression of p53 and Bcl-2 and prevented cancer metastasis by disturbing hepatic MMP activity [
