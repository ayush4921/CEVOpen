<p id="Par49">Computational simulation techniques and mathematical tools help us to predict the content of hypericin under ecological conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Using the MLP model in the present study, we could predict the contents of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> which will reduce the expensive and time-consuming phytochemical methods and laboratory experimentations. In addition, a designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) will help to run the MLP model on new data to easily discover the content of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> by entering ecological conditions of site, land form, soil characteristics and plant phenological stages. These findings also could be applicable for rangeland managers, pharmacognosists, manufacturers and producers of medicinal plants, local beneficiaries and potentially various other field of studies.
