 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. is among the most important species of the genus 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> which is being studied for several therapeutic purposes including skin wounds and burns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous literature has reported its role as neuroprotective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], antidepressant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], antioxidant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], hepatoprotective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], antimicrobial, and antiviral [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among the known constituents of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>, hypericin and flavonoids attribute to several pharmacological effects of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>. Therefore it remain imperative to develop methods and/or tools accurately identify and predict the concentration of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
