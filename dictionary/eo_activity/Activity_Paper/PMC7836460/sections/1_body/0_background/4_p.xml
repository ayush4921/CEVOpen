<p id="Par7">Artificial neural network (ANN) modeling technique has been designed based on the human brain functioning with a variety of mathematical functions to enhance the ability of the model for accurate prediction. Recently, artificial neural network techniques such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as nonlinear and dynamic modeling techniques are utilized in ecological sciences for development of accurate prediction models [

This unique quantitative modeling and artificial neural network approach are essential to deal with ecological and biological phenomena such as the prediction of hypericin content in
