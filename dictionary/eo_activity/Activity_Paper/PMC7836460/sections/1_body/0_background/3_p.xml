<p id="Par6">Furthermore, sample harvesting, extraction and analytical processing presents a wider range of discrimination in regards to the accurate quantification of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique with different type of detectors such as diode array, fluorescence, and mass detector have been employed for robust identification and determination of hypericin in crude extracts of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although these techniques have high resolution to detect metabolites at very low concentration but they present some limitation including instrument cost, laboratory space and require large volumes of mobile phase and personal skills. In addition, it often require development of complex time consuming workflows comprising of sample collection, extraction purification and analytical method development, data collection and processing and statistical analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore a relatively simple, robust and eco-friendly tool are required for prediction of secondary metabolites including hypericin.
