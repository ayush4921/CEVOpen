<p id="Par5">It is likely that the content of hypericin content in plant tissue is impacted by physiological and environmental factors including climate, topography, vegetative stage, epigenetic similar to other related secondary metabolites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence available in the literature reporting association of hypericin contents with biotic and abiotic factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is interesting to study association of various ecological factors affecting biosynthesis and tissue localization of secondary metabolites in regards to harvesting maximum yield of biologically active constituents from plant extracts. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the altitude and hypericin content in plant extracts, considering the intensity of sunlight and temperature as primary factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For instance, Asghari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] reported significant effect of the ecological conditions mainly altitude of 300, 600 and 1200 m above the sea level on the hypericin content in different highlands of Golestan National Park of Iran. Saffariha et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] studied essential oil yield of
