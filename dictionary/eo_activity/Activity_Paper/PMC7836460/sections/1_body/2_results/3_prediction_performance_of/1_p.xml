 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. SVM regression that has the Gaussian function includes bell-shaped curves in which the width is determined by value of γ. In this study, when the value of γ is lower, it increases over-fitting. As a result, it was be necessary to obtain the highest accuracy and avoid overtraining. In the SVM model, we were looking for simple curves in which the value of the parameter C helps to achieve this result. In other words, C, ε, and γ factors in SVM regression to obtain hypericin were explained. The most suitable SVM factors and prediction accuracies for SVM regression of the train and test data have been listed in Table
