<p>Endophytic actinobacteria affiliated with medicinal plants have been shown to have the potential to inhibit or kill pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Thus, they are considered as a significant source for the development of new antimicrobial products [

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our earlier studies, we demonstrated that endophytic bacteria could be a potent source for secondary metabolites with bioactive potential [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, bioactive compounds with cytotoxic and antioxidant properties produced by endophytic actinobacteria associated with plants have also been reported. Among these are endophytic actinobacteria, which exhibit cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines [

 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tanvir et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], reported antioxidant activity in most of the endophytic actinobacteria (66.6%) that were recovered from different medicinal plants. Presently, researchers are continuing to search for novel actinobacteria with antioxidant properties for therapeutic use. 
 <italic>Mirabilis jalapa</italic> L., a member of the
