<p>To determine the effect of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 on the antioxidant activity in chickpea plants, an in-vivo experiment was conducted which involved treating chickpea seedlings with DBT-34 and letting the plants grow for four weeks. After that time, a methanolic extract (50–500 µg/mL) was prepared from the untreated four-week-old chickpea plants (control) and chickpea plants treated with 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34. The methanolic extract was used to conduct a DPPH radical scavenging assay and ABTS radical cation decolorization assay [
