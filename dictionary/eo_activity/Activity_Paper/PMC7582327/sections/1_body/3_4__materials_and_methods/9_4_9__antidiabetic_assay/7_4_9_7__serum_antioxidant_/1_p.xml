 <xref rid="B82-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. LPO levels were determined based on thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and GSH was determined with the use of Ellman’s reagent (5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB)), which produces a product that can be quantified spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. Catalase and SOD activity were measured using the Beauchamp and Fridovich methods [
