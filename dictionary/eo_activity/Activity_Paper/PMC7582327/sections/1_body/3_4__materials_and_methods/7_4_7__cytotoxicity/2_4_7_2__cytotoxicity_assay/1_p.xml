<p>The MTT test was used to measure the cytotoxicity of the methanolic extract of DBT34 against three cancer cell lines. A total of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per 100 μL of media were placed in 96-well plates. The plates were cultured in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Initial cytotoxicity of a 500 μg/mL concentration of the methanolic extract was tested against all three cell lines and the results indicated that the extract had significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells. Based upon the preliminary results, the extract was diluted to different concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100, and 250 μg/mL), and their cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells was evaluated. Untreated cells served as a control. The methodology of the MTT assay was previously described by Tan et al. [
