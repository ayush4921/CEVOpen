<p>GC-MS analysis is an excellent method to detect and identify VOCs and has been used by several researchers to identify VOCs [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. VOCs, including alcohol, ketones, esters, acetic acid groups, amides, and their derivatives, have been detected in genera of Actinobacteria [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the present study, 11 volatile compounds were detected in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34 using GC-MS analysis. Cathinone constituted 32.45% of the total amount of VOCs in strain DBT34. This compound was also reported by Dudai et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], who stated that cathinone has antioxidant activity. The cathinone compound was reported in our isolate DBT34 and may be responsible for antioxidant activities. The volatile compound, acetamide, 2-Amino, was also detected in strain DBT34. Previous research has indicated that acetamide derivatives and their analogs have bioactive properties, such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The VOC, benzene acetic acid, 4-Methoxy-Alpha-[(Trimethylsilyl)Oxy]-Methyl compound, which is a derivative of 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid, as well as benzene acetic acid, 4-methoxy-p-methoxy-phenylacetic acid, was identified in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. strain DBT34. Several researchers state that acetamide, 2-Amino and benzene acetic acid, 4-Methoxy-Alpha-[(Trimethylsilyl)Oxy]-Methyl compound showed anticancer activity as observed in our isolate DBT34 and could be responsible for cytotoxic potential against HepG2 cancer cell lines. A derivative of 4-Methoxybenzeneacetic acid has been reported to be neuroprotective, as well as possessing anticancer activity [
