<p>Various methods are used to investigate the antioxidant property of different samples. Can be classified so in vitro and in vivo antioxidant models [

 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic>, 
 <italic>E. livingstoniana</italic> and 
 <italic>E. mildbraedii</italic> it proved in different studies [

 <xref rid="B66-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In vitro radical scavenging assay (DPPH) was the most widely used in vivo test to determine the capacity of free radical scavenging (
 <xref rid="ijms-22-00248-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In most studies, a similar and even higher activity was obtained than the positive controls (Trolox, BHA, ascorbic acid and quercetin) [

 <xref rid="B65-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,

 <xref rid="B68-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Reduction of Fe ions was also evaluated, an assay often used as an indicator of electron donation activity (FRAP). Additionally, the in vivo antioxidant activities of the enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH were measured to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of 
 <italic>Erythrina indica</italic>, 
 <italic>senegalensis</italic>, and × 
 <italic>neillii</italic>, in rats. Where the activities of antioxidant enzymes were restored (

 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Inhibition of lipoxygenase and xanthine oxidase, enzymes that participate in the production of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory agents were other tests used [

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Likewise, the decrease in lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and the inhibition of NO were used to evaluate the antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,

 <xref rid="B72-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Among the compounds responsible for these activities, Eryvarin H, Abyssinone V, mildbone, mildbenone, 7,3′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxy-5′-(3 methylbut-2-enyl)flavanone, erylivingstone H, 7,3′,4′-trihydroxyflavanone, trans-3,4,2′,4′-tetrahydroxychalcone, Eryvarin J and erycrisagallin [

 <xref rid="B75-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Flexible molecular docking on heme oxygenase, an important stress protein that is involved in cellular protection, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, showed with 2″-O-galloyl orientin forming four binding interactions with residues, Arg 136 (two interactions), Met34 and Gly139 [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been reported that the compound abyssinone V increases oxidative stress and reduces stress resistance in the Caenorhabditis elegans model [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, many antioxidant compounds are also evaluated for their cytotoxic activity that promotes apoptosis favoring a pro-oxidant environment. This is highly dependent on the used concentrations of the compound. However, studies are required to help clarify this activity.
