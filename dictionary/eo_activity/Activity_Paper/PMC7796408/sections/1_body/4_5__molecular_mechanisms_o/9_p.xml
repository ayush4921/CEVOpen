<p>Mildbone and mildbenone, flavanone and chalcone from

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] participates in the eicosanoid cascade during the inflammatory response, using arachidonic acid as a substrate, for the synthesis of leukotrienes (LT) and other oxidized lipids intermediates [
 <xref rid="B124-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. So, these compounds acted as an anti-inflammatory. At least three inhibitory mechanisms of LOX have been recognized, among these, some compounds act on an essential iron atom at the site, affecting its oxidation state (redox inhibitors) and binding directly to the iron atom (chelators), affecting the cycle catalytic. This non-selective antioxidant mechanism [
 <xref rid="B124-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] may be associated with the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>E. mildbraedii</italic> compounds and be responsible for the observed effect. The authors suggest that the high antioxidant activity of mildbone is mainly related to the second bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of a second hydrogen atom transfer from i-OH phenoxyl radical to the free radical [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The BDEs of the respective phenol bonds correlate with the antioxidant effect of these compounds. It was found that phenols with low BDE values lead to clearly higher stabilizations [
 <xref rid="B125-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Mildbone with lower IC50 and BDE had greater antioxidant effects than mildbenone [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These values are generated by group Electrondonators (EDG). Hydroxy groups (â€“OH) represent EDG and therefore lead to lower BDE values. This makes it clear that high antioxidant activity is mainly related to the number and positions of OH groups located in ring B [
