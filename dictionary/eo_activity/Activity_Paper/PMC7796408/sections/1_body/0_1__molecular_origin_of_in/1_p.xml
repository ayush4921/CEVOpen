<p>Pain is traditionally defined as a complex sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage (International Association for the Study of Pain) [

 <xref rid="B3-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is a complex process that involves neuronal signaling pathways between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS) [

The transduction of noxious stimuli (those that actually or potentially damage tissues) is carried out by a nociceptor, creating an electrophysiological neuronal signal encoded in the form of an action potential that is transmitted to the CNS. The acute injury is associated with a first, well-localized pain sensation transduced and transmitted by nociceptors. Although pain is one of the body’s most important adaptation and protection mechanisms, the degree of tissue damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators that bind to its receptors, triggering an enzymatic cascade [

Thus, inflammatory pain is generated by an increase in sensitivity due to the cellular response associated with tissue damage, promoting the influx of activated cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and mast cells that release inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, Hþ ions, ATP, purines, prostaglandin E2, leukotrienes, cytokines, nerve growth factor (NGF), sympathetic amines, and oxidative stress products present in the membrane of nociceptors [

NGF released by activated macrophages acts directly on peptidergic C fibers that express the TrkA receptor, a key component of peripheral sensitization. Macrophages release cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) which in turn contribute to peripheral sensitization through increased local production of proalgesic agents such as bradykinin, prostaglandins and increased release of NGF [

Prostaglandins are synthesized by consecutive reactions initiated by the phospholipase A2 enzyme that causes the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from cell membranes. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) metabolizes arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) which is ultimately converted to PGE2 by prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PGE2 acts on all four E-prostanoid (EP) receptor subtypes (EP1-4). In peripheral tissue, PGE2 modulates pain sensitivity by sensitizing primary afferents. Sensitizes ion channels involved in pain, namely transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels, and purinergic P2X3 channels, also enhances the release of neurotransmitters. So, it is a crucial lipid mediator of inflammatory responses that causes pain hypersensitivity [
