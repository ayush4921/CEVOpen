This suggests that the biological activity demonstrated, in the various studies, was largely due to polar compounds. Mostly, high polarity solvents (ethanol, water, and methanol) were used to obtain the extracts. This suggests that the biological activity demonstrated in the various studies was largely due to polar compounds. Two flavanones (Sigmoidin A and B), a prenylated flavonoid (abyssinone V-4′-methyl ether), a prenylisoflavone (warangalone), and a pterocarpane (Erycristagallin) (

 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], all compounds demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory efficacy. The anti-inflammatory suggested mechanisms include the inhibition of prostaglandins and cyclooxygenases. The most widely used reference drugs in pain models were morphine and diclofenac. While for the inflammation models it was Indomethacin, diclofenac, and dexamethasone. Although in some cases, acetylsalicylic acid and Pentazocin were used. In general, all preclinical studies agree that each species studied is shown to have an analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory effect [

However, it is also mentioned that alkaloids erysotrine, erysotrine hypophorine, reduced the number of inflammatory cells in lung tissue, mainly eosinophils and lymphocytes. Possibly due to the decrease of IL-4 and IL-5, which stimulate the maturation of eosinophils in the bone marrow and recruit these cells to the tissues. In turn, this can impact the modulation of the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, nitric oxide, and cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF α [
