<p>Three of the tested bacteria exhibited some susceptibility to ethanol stem extracts of the plant except 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>. But the aqueous stem extracts did not indicate any inhibitive activities against all the bacteria. Higher microbial growth inhibitions were observed with ethanol extracts compared with aqueous extracts. This result may be attributed to the fact that 80% v/v ethanol can extract bioactive compounds with broad range of polarity, whereas water can extract compounds with strong polarity [

 <italic>S. incanum</italic> stem may not be as good source of bioactive compounds compared with fruits and leaves. As one study with 
 <italic>Solanum marginatum</italic> L. showed, stem extracts resulted in limited inhibitive activities against bacteria [
