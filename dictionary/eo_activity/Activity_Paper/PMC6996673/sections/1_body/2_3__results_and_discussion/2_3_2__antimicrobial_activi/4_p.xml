<p>We observed that 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most susceptible species among the tested bacteria to 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> extracts. However, Alamri and Moustafa had reported findings contrary to ours where fruit extracts of the plant had profound antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> compared with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [

 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This is because each of the class of phytochemicals reported in this study contains several compounds that can affect a diversity of microorganisms in many ways [
