<p>Majority of Ethiopian communities use traditional medicine. On the one hand, they have limited access and economic capacity to modern health care services. On the other, they have practical experiences and positive beliefs toward traditional medicine. For example, the authors of this article have known the fruits of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> as source of extracts used for medicine, pesticides, soaps, and tanning. But the indigenous community and traditional healers believe that medicinal plants should be kept secret by the healers if they are to be effective. If the healers decided to reveal the knowledge, they often choose one curious and wiser family member and pass it on to her/him verbally. Such beliefs and practices have been the recipe for rapid loss of ethnobotanic, ethnomedicine, and ethnoveterinary knowledge before the scientific community makes adequate documentation and sharing. Moreover, despite the considerable contribution of traditional medicine to many Ethiopian communities and the urgent call by the scientific communities, there are not adequate efforts to transform the traditional indigenous practices and integrate the traditional medicine into modern health care system.
