<p>Our study results show that necrosis of tissues can be induced by a frozen metal bar after it makes contact with the skin. Eschar appears after 2 to 3 days (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Visual inspection can be done, and therapy administered can give visible effects. Likewise, the treatment effects of 
 <italic>Cs.Cr</italic> were palpable during the course of the study. 
 <italic>Cs.Cr</italic> dose- and time-dependently reduced the area and percentage of induced frostbite wound at the dose of 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg. Positive changes in the healing process were evident even in the first seven days at the dose of 200 mg/kg of 
 <italic>Cs.Cr</italic>, possibly preventing the early tissue loss and damage to the deeper organs. The positive changes continued till the 21
 <sup>st</sup> day. This reflects the anti-inflammatory and early wound-healing properties of Cs.Cr in frostbite, which is particularly important in saving the tissue damages that usually occur within the first few hours of injury. ASA was used as a positive control drug for its well-known wound-healing and anti-inflammatory activities.
