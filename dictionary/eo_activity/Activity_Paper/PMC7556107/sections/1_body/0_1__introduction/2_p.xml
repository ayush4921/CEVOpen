<p>Currently, there are fewer specific therapies to frostbite injuries. Aloe vera is the only plant which has manifested reduction in tissue loss and has achieved a certain degree of success in the treatment of frostbite. According to WHO estimates, about three-quarters of the world's population use herbs for different illnesses. 
 <italic>Cuscuta reflexa</italic> Roxb. from the Cuscutaceae family, commonly known as “Akashabela,” “Amarabela,” or “Loot,” is a perennial herb. The genera 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> includes 170 parasitic species [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This parasitic plant species is a rootless, leafless twined sprawling thin vine that grows over a host plant. It has a heterotrophic mode of nutrition due to lack of chlorophyll and hence is completely dependent on the host plant for survival [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The utilization of the entire plant of 
 <italic>Custuca reflexa</italic> is linked with the treatment of different illnesses. For instance, it is devoured as a therapeutic option for cerebral pain, tingling [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], headache, skin rashes, amnesia, epilepsy, cough, and fever [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The aqueous ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Cuscuta reflexa</italic> has been studied for its constituents and found to contain alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The plant has scientifically been investigated for various pharmacological activities like anxiolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], hair growth potential [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The crude extract has also been evaluated for antiepileptic and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, this plant inhibits the erythrocyte damage due to hypotonicity which is anti-inflammatory effect [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, the plant has been quarantined for antitumor and antiproliferative activities using different animal models [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
