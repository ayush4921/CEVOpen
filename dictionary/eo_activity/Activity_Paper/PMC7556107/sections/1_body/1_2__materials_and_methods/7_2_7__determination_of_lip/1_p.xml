<p>Malondialdehyde, as a marker for lipid peroxidation, was determined in serum by the double heating method of Draper and Hadley with some modifications. The principle of the method is based on spectrophotometric measurement of the color produced during the reaction of TBA with malondialdehyde. For this purpose, 2.5 mL of 100 g/L trichloroacetic acid solution was added into 0.5 mL serum in a centrifuge tube and placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. After cooling under tap water, the supernatant was transferred into a test tube containing 1 mL of 6.7 g/L TBA solution and placed again in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The solution was then cooled under tap water, and its absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm. The concentration of malondialdehyde was calculated using the following equation: malondialdehyde (nmol/mL) = [(Absorbance of sample/Absorbance of standard) × 100].</p>
