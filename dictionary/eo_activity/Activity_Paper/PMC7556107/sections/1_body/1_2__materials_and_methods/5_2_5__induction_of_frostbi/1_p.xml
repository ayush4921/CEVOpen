<p>We have followed the Chigunadze et al. model to induce frostbite [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with minor modifications. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (10 : 1), and hair was removed with hair removal cream (Veet cream). It was applied for 3 minutes, and then, cream was removed with dried and wet cotton swabs, respectively. Simulated contact frostbite was produced with the help of metal weighing 3.5 × 3 cm which was precooled up to -73°C in a freezer. It was then made to contact the shaved area of the rat's skin for 3 minutes (
