  <p>The graphs showing the MDA (nmol/mg) content of frostbite on respective study days. Comparison is established between the frostbite control group and the treatment groups. Statistical analysis is performed with two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test. All the groups are compared with the frostbite control group. Results are nonsignificant (∗) if 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, significant (∗∗) if 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and highly significant (∗∗∗) if 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.
