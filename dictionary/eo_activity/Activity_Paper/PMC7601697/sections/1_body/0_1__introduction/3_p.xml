<p>To address this issue, the main goal of this paper is to propose an overarching framework for risk management of NBMs used in MD and ATMP, which complements the preclinical benefit-risk analysis of these technologies with a complete assessment of their risks for the environment as well as for medical professionals (e.g., physicians, technicians, nurses and healthcare assistants) and workers exposed to NBMs during production (e.g., powder/liquid handling), use (e.g., abrasion, leaching) and/or end-of-life treatment (e.g., disposal, incineration) (a list of industries producing NBMs or NMB-based MD and ATMP, as well as healthcare facilities where they can be used is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-04532">Table S1</xref>). This approach has been developed within the EU Horizon 2020 project BIORIMA (BIOmaterials RIsk MAnagement; Grant Agreement No: 760928), which has built upon the results of many EU FP7 and Horizon 2020 projects with the aim to adapt the knowledge, data and tools for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) to the NBMs used in MD and ATMP.
