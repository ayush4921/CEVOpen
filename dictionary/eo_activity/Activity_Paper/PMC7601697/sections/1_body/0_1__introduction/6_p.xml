<p>The present paper describes the BIORIMA RMF from a conceptual standpoint. First, we describe the process and provide an overview of the positioning of its main elements, which are then described in more detail in subsequent sections. The purpose of this paper is to provide an ‘early view’ of an evolving RMF for MD and ATMP.</p>
