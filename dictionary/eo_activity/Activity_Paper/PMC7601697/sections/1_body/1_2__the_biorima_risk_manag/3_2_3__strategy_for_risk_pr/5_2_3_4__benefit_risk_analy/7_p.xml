<p>In the non-clinical discovery phase, also known as Go/No-Go decision, a MD or ATMP containing NBMs needs to pass through several steps, which include determination of drug availability, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination and preliminary studies to investigate safety aspects such as genotoxicity, mutagenicity, safety pharmacology and general toxicology [

Moreover, in this phase, the application of in silico and in vitro tests, complemented by ex vivo and in vivo assays (if necessary) can help to recognise safety/toxicity issues early in the process to correct those prior to the final selection of clinical candidates [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the pre-clinical phase, information of the disease obtained from animal models are compared with data from toxicological studies to determine whether (or not) a candidate type of NBM can be administered for the first time in humans [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this phase, hypothetical benefits are assessed based on current understanding of the mode of action for the NBM identified in animal or in vitro tests, along with a nonclinical and in vitro safety evaluation [
 <xref rid="B129-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. During the clinical development, the registration process and the marketing period, benefit risk analysis involves identifying potential efficacy and safety endpoints and other surrogates as well as a more precise safety profile and the identification of adverse effects.
