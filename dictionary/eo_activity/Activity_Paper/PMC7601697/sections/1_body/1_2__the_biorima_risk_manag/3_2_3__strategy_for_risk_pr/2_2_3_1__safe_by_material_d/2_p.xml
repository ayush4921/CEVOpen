<p>The context and logic of implementing the SbMD idea for nanomaterials have been described in the ‘Safe-by-Design (SbD) Implementation Concept’ of the EU FP7 ProSafe project [
 <xref rid="B108-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. This idea builds on the SbD concept of the EU FP7 NANoREG project and the Safe Innovation Approach (SIA) of the EU H2020 NANoReg2 project. The main outputs expected by the implementation of a SbMD approach are decision criteria for selecting safer options in the early R&amp;D steps. This requires adoption of screening-level approaches from predictive toxicology (in vitro and in silico tools) in order to speed-up the process and decrease the costs of generating material safety profiles, while taking quality and performance requirements into consideration. Indeed, as pointed out in [
 <xref rid="B109-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] on benefit versus risk of nanomaterials: ‘Successful innovation, if it is to encompass both regulatory and consumer approval, must incorporate safety by design’.
