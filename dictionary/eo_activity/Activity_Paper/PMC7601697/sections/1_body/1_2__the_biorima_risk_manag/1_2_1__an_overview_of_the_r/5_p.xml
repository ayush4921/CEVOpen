<p>The two pillars are not disconnected. Instead a flux of information and data is recommended in order to avoid duplication of efforts that can incur additional costs. For example, data on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of NBMs are relevant to any kind of appraisal of adverse effects or health benefits and, as such, once collected or generated they should be shared and exploited within both assessment processes regardless of the regulatory regime. The same holds true for the pre-clinical toxicological studies that are required for the hazard identification and the hazard characterisation of the NBMs.</p>
