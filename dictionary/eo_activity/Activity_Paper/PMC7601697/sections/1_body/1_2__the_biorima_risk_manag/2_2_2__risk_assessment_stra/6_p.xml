<p>Before initiating any testing by means of the IATA, a review of the available data is required to identify areas of immediate concerns regarding the NBMs toxic potency and/or exposure potential. This includes information from clinical studies (preferably), then human relevant in vitro and in silico data, and lastly animal in vivo data. This analysis also allows a gap analysis of the hazard data relevant to that specific NBM. The missing data are then generated by employment of the IATA. For human hazard assessment, tier 1 focuses on in silico, in chemico and simple (one cell type monoculture) in vitro models, tier 2 includes more complex alternative approaches such as multi-cell lineage three dimensional co-cultures (e.g., organoids, organ-on-chip) and tier 3 is largely based on animal models including hazard and biodistribution testing. The in vivo data currently remains vital for the NBMs to progress to clinical trials, and also for their full occupational risk assessment. However, the results of tier 1 and 2 are used to refine the animal studies in terms of the most relevant concentrations, timepoints and endpoints to assess, thereby reducing the number of animals used. The IATAs therefore optimise the cost of obtaining relevant information and data, while reducing the use of experimental animals in accordance with the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) principles [
