<p>In general, hazard assessment of NBMs is carried out by gathering/generating and evaluating relevant physicochemical and toxicological information from in vitro and in vivo tests to assess the intrinsic hazard of a substance and to establish a dose-response relationship [

 <xref rid="B50-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Toxicological approaches to assess hazards of NBMs can either be based on methods adopted from classical toxicology or on alternative methods, including in vitro and in vivo testing and in silico modelling (e.g., Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, grouping and read-across methods).
