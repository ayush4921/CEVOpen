<p>As for the in situ exposure, there are advanced exposure models being developed, but these require refinement and validation especially for NBMs released from MDs and ATMPs. Therefore, the bioaccumulation/trophic transfer potential is not well understood for nanomaterials and hence also not for NBMs used in medicine. Although substantial research efforts have focused on bioaccumulation [
 <xref rid="B84-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] there are currently no good models available, partly because nanomaterials are difficult to detect in complex media, partly because nanomaterials are not assumed to follow equilibrium paradigms, which hampers the estimation of bioaccumulation factors.
