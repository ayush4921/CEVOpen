<p>We have adopted strategies for human health and environmental risk assessment of the NBMs from a life cycle perspective, considering the provisions of EU regulations and using state-of-the-art scientific approaches for safety assessment of nanomaterials. These strategies are intended to support stakeholders (e.g., regulators, industries, consultants) in identifying and applying the most appropriate methods and tools (e.g., standards, testing protocols, predictive models) to assess potential risks associated with unintentional exposure of workers involved in manufacturing, use and disposal of nano-enabled MDs and ATMPs, as well as healthcare professionals exposed to NBMs while using the products. In addition, the strategy is aimed at guiding the identification of releases of NBMs into environmental compartments (i.e., air, soil, water, sediment) and the implementation of the most appropriate experimental and modelling tools to enable the assessment of their behaviour and fate (e.g., bio-persistence, bio-transformation) as well as their short and long-term toxicity effects for aquatic and terrestrial biota. </p>
