<p>The environmental risk assessment (ERA) of NBMs contained in MDs and ATMPs is generally based on the REACH Chemical Safety Assessment, but there are prominent differences compared to chemicals, e.g., a focus on the aquatic environment with limited number of test systems [

 <xref rid="B64-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is well-known that NMs behave differently from ‘regular’ chemicals, in regard to environmental fate, subsequent exposure and mode of toxic action. Further, the ultimate fate of NMs is generally considered to be solid environments, like soils and sediments, rather than aquatic systems [
 <xref rid="B65-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Hence, a comprehensive ERA strategy for NBMs should consider these compartments. Additional to these, there should also be a focus on sludge born materials, as sewage sludge is in many countries applied to soils [

 <xref rid="B67-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The ecotoxicological approaches of choice to assess the hazard of NBMs can be derived from classical ecotoxicology [

 <xref rid="B68-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], including longer term testing [
 <xref rid="B69-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] or mechanistic endpoints [
 <xref rid="B73-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The development of alternative test methods has been highly recommended, also by regulatory agencies. For example, in the context of REACH Regulation, ECHA and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have proposed the use of omics data for risk assessment purposes [
