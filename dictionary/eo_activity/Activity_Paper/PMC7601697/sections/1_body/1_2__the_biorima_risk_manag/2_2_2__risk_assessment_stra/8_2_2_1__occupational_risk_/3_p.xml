<p>Occupational exposure assessment starts with the identification of the possible sources of emissions/release for the activities and tasks performed by the workers or healthcare professionals, and the formulation of respective exposure scenarios that should include information on the substance, activities, route(s) of exposure, operational conditions and risk management measures (RMMs). Exposure scenarios should be defined and assessed for the synthesis phase and downstream use when NBMs are incorporated into a MD or ATMP, during the use stage when the product is applied/administered to patients by medical professionals, as well as during waste recycling, incineration and/or disposal. Occupational exposure during manufacturing processes has been already investigated for a variety of nanomaterials and can be mostly negligible for medical NBMs if appropriate RMMs are implemented. However, for the use phase of NBM-based MD and ATMP realistic occupational exposure scenarios have been formulated in the BIORIMA project. Some relevant examples include dental and surgical procedures involving the milling, drilling, grinding and polishing of materials or implants, where composites may be a source of nanoparticle inhalation exposure for dentists and surgeons [
