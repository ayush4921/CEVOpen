<p>The reference product diclofenac showed a pain inhibition percentage of 43%. Based on the analgesic activity evaluated by the acetic acid test (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05469-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we found that the fraction of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> roots (APPR) at a dose of 300 mg/kg was the most active, with an inhibition percentage of 94.10 ± 4.35%. The fraction of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> leaves (APPF) at a dose of 500 mg/kg was the least active when compared to the other samples, with an inhibition percentage of 12.00 ± 5.27%. Concerning the effect of the seed fraction (APPG), the effect increased in a dose-dependent manner, unlike in the root fraction (APPR), where we noticed a decrease in the effects when increasing concentrations. However, the leaves (APPF) and capitula (APPC) fractions used at 300 and 500 mg/kg, respectively, had the best effects compared to other doses, reducing the number of contortions. The contortions observed for these doses were significantly lower than those observed for the control group (
