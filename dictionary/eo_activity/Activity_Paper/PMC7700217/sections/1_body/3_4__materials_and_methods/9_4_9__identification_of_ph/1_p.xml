<p>The determination of phytochemical compounds was carried out according to the silylation method described by Kabran and al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05469" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In short, 50 g of each sample (treated with petroleum ether and 250 mL of 2 N (HCl) was heated under reflux for two hours. After cooling, the hydrolysate was treated with 3 × 250 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic fractions were grouped, dried on anhydrous MgSO4, and then concentrated under vacuum. Afterward, 200 μL of 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was added to 3 mg of the resulting fraction and then heated at 37 °C for 30 min. Next, 0.1 μL of the sample was injected for analysis using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrophotometer (Brand Agilent Technologies Model 5973 with an Agilent column 19091S-433 HP-5MS, 30 m long, 0.25 mm inside diameter, and 0.25 μm film thickness of the stationary phase, (Helsinki, Finland) in positive mode. Helium was used as a carrier gas, with a typical pressure range (psi) of 0.9 mL/sec. The oven temperature program was set to 60–300 °C for 10 min and then maintained at 300 °C for 20 min. The detector temperature was set to 250 °C and the injector temperature to 260 °C. Identification of the silylated compounds was conducted by comparing the retention times with those of the standards obtained from the database.
