<p>The injection of carrageenan induces the release of several inflammatory mediators, as follows: Serotonin and histamine within the first hour, and between 1.5 and 3 h, and bradykinin beyond the third hour [

Concerning the results of anti-inflammatory activity obtained in this study, the extracts found to reduce edema were significantly induced by carrageenan compared to the untreated groups and, therefore, we may affirm that the samples tested have an antagonistic effect on the liberation of responsible mediators for the inflammatory process. The phytochemicals detected in plant extracts are responsible for their anti-inflammatory effect induced by carrageenan and which may act, individually or in synergy, at different levels of the multifactorial process of inflammation [
