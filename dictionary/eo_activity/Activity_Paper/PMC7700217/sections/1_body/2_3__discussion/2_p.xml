<p>In the present study, the hydro-ethanoic extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L) had inhibitory effects on abdominal cramps resulting from the injection of acetic acid and the pain induced by the injection of formaldehyde solution. Pain caused by the injection of acetic acid and formaldehyde is due to the release of endogenous mediators that activate the nociceptive neurons, bradykinin, serotonin, cyclooxygenases, and their metabolites (e.g., PGE2 and PGF2a) in the peritoneal fluid. In addition, these solutions might activate peritoneal receptors and stimulate nociceptive nerve terminals [

In the present work, the analgesic effects of samples could be explained by the fact that the extracts studied might reduce the liberation of different inflammatory mediators such as serotonin, prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGEÎ±), bradykinin, and histamine [

 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L) extracts is responsible for the analgesic effect, inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes [
