<p id="Par57">Descriptive statistics showed that curing healers, male therapists, adults and the elderly, married, educated (with secondary education), and urban respondents reported a higher average number of species and diseases than other respondent categories. Similar findings were obtained by Dapar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] for men, adults, and elderly, married and secondary-school-educated therapists as well as by Sanga [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] for therapists living in urban areas. Nzuki [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], however, found that in Mbanza-Ngungu, rural therapists may have more knowledge than urban therapists. This difference may be due to the fact that Nzukiâ€™s observations are based on the comparison between urban and rural healers who use more than 10 medicinal plants rather than comparing the average number of plants used by both healer categories.
