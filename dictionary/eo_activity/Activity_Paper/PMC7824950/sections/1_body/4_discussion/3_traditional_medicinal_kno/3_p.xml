<p id="Par58">The high number of common species and diseases that are reported in both Kisantu and Mbanza-Ngungu (including their neighboring villages), may be linked to the fact that the two territories belong to the same Guineo Congolese phytogeographical region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and share more or less the same ecoclimatic and edaphic conditions and common realities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Low similarity indices are often linked to a high diversity of ethnic groups in a certain area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], globalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], the use of the same species for a wide variety of diseases, or to the limited cultural exchanges between the studied ethnolinguistic groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].
