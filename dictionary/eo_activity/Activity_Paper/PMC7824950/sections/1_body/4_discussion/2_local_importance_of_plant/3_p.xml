<p id="Par55">The common medicinal use of 
 <italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> Jacq. is linked with the diverse products that are obtained from it, including oil, wine, and salt (palm inflorescence reduced to ashes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. These extracts are used respectively as (1) an excipient for the preparation of vegetable ointments; (2) a maceration liquid to enhance the action of certain drugs with aphrodisiac and galactogenic properties; (3) an addition in many preparations to facilitate the absorption of the drug; or to reduce and preserve certain preparations in powder form. According to Raymond-Hamet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], the ash salts of 
 <italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> Jacq. would release alkaloids from the plants used in the various preparations, which would explain why they are so frequently used by natives in multiple medications.
