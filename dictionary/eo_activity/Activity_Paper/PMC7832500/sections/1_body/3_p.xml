<p>To explore the phylogenetic position of 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic>, the cp genomes of 15 representatives of Asphodelaceae was downloaded from NCBI GenBank. The sequences of 78 common protein-coding genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. Complete chloroplast genome sequence alignment was performed by MAFFT program (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and then phylogenetic tree was built by IQ-tree software (Nguyen etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) with the maximum-likelihood algorithm. The phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) indicated that 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic> has a close relationship with 
 <italic>P. kingianum</italic>.
