  <italic>Polygonatum cirrhifolium</italic> (Wall.) Royle is a medicinal plant of commercial value. In the present study, we assembled the complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>P</italic>. 
  <italic>cirrhifolium</italic>. The total genome was a circular DNA molecule of 155,583 bp, which was made up of a large single copy region (84,412 bp), a small single copy region (18,427 bp), and a pair of inverted repeat regions (26,372 bp each). A total of 133 genes was annotated in the chloroplast genome, including 85 protein-coding genes, 40 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and eight ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Overall, the chloroplast genome had a GC content of 37.66%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
  <italic>P</italic>. 
  <italic>cirrhifolium</italic> was closely related to 
  <italic>P</italic>. 
  <italic>kingianum</italic>.
