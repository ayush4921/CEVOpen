<p id="p0130">A novel polysaccharide fraction (MSCP2) was extracted and isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>M. Speciosa</italic> Champ. MSCP2 (molecular weight = 2.85 × 104 Da) was purified from the aqueous root extract and confirmed to have significant immunomodulatory activity by improving the pinocytic capacity and increasing the levels of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6. TLR4, SRA and GR were found to be the major PRRs for MSCP2 to trigger signalling transcription and macrophage activation. These results indicated that MSCP2 might be a potent agent in medical science and food industries (
