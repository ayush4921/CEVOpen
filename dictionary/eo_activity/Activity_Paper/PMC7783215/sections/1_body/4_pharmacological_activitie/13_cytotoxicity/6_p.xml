<p id="p0210">It was reported that different compounds were identified from EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts of vine stems of 
 <italic>M. dorwardi</italic> Collett &amp; Hemsl. and evaluated for the cytotoxicity effect against five cancer cell lines viz. HepG2, HCT116, MCF7, Raji and KG-1. These compounds have no evident activity but one of the compound known as millepurpan showed modest growth inhibitor activity against Raji and KG-1 cell line. From the advance study, it was revealed that millepurpan could induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in KG-1 cells (
