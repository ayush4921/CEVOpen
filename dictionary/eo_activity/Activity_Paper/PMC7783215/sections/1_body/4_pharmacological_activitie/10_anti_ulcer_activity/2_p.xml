Generally, secondary metabolites like terpenoids, quinines, flavonoids, etc. exhibits some kind of cytoprotective as well as anti-secretory property. Flavonoids play a vital role in anti-ulcer activity by amplifying the mucosal defence system and also improve the capillary resistance by raising the gastric defensive factors (
