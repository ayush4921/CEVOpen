<p>The synthetic strategies approved for the synthesis of the intermediate and target compounds are outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001 SCH0002">Schemes 1 and 2</xref>. Thus, 3-methylpyrazol-5(4
 <italic>H</italic>)-one 
 <bold>1</bold> was coupled smoothly with diazonium salts 
 <bold>2a</bold> and 
 <bold>2b</bold> in the presence of ethanol and sodium acetate at 0–5 °C, to afford the respective hydrazines 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>3b</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>). The latter products were established on the basis of their analytical and spectral data. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>3a</bold>, as an example, revealed the two signals at δ 9.15 and 12.37 ppm due to two NH groups, in addition to the presence of amino, methyl and aromatic protons. While, its 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum revealed the signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 12.9 and 164.5 ppm assigned to the carbons of the CH
 <sub>3</sub> and CO groups, (See 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref> and Experimental part). Moreover, the obtained arylhydrazino derivatives have been utilised as starting materials for preparing the targeted pyrazolopyridazine ring system. Fusion of hydrazines 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>3b</bold> with malononitrile (
 <bold>4a</bold>) in the presence of ammonium acetate over melting point afforded the 6-aminopyrazolo [4,3-
 <italic>c</italic>]-pyridazine derivatives 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6c</bold>. The structures of 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6c</bold> were established via inspection of their spectral data. For example, the infra-red of 
 <bold>6a</bold> indicated the presence of the two NH
 <sub>2</sub> and C≡N absorption band at ν = 3441, 3357, 3232, 3125 and 2205 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. While, its 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR revealed singlet signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.77 ppm which was assigned for CH
 <sub>3</sub> group, two signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.87 and 8.69 due to two NH
 <sub>2</sub> protons and the absence of any signals may be attributed to NH protons, beside aromatic protons in the molecule. The 
 <sup>13</sup>CNMR of 
 <bold>6a</bold> showed signals at 11.1and 115.0 for the carbons of the CH
 <sub>3</sub>, and C≡N groups, in addition to the sp
 <sub>2</sub> carbon atoms (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref> and Experimental part). The formation of 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6c</bold> from 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>3b</bold> is assumed to proceed through the intermediate of non-isolable adducts 
 <bold>5a</bold> and 
 <bold>5c,</bold> which cyclised into the imino structure 
 <bold>i</bold> via loss of water molecule, which tautomerised into the end amino products 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6c</bold> (
