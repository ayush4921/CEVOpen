<p>Similarly, 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>3b</bold> reacted with ethyl cyanoacetate (
 <bold>4b</bold>) in the same above reaction conditions to afford 6-oxopyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>c</italic>]pyridazine derivatives 
 <bold>6b</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> based on the elemental analysis and spectral data. The IR spectra of 
 <bold>6b</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> indicate the presence of C≡N absorption bands at 2207, 2217 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively and C=O at 1728, 1732 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of 
 <bold>6b</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> showed the presence of only one signal attributed to NH at 9.60 and 9.42 ppm, respectively. Also, its 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra revealed the signals of amidic C=O at 169.7 and 168.7 ppm, respectively.
