<p>A molecular property is a complex balance of various structural features which determine whether a specific molecule is similar to the known drugs and to facilitate the drug-likeness of the candidate drug. Therefore, the calculated molecular descriptors of the new compounds expressed in terms of calculating log P, molecular size, flexibility and the presence of hydrogen-donor and acceptors using Molinspiration tool
