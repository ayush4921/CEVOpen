<p>All melting points were determined on a Gallenkamp apparatus and are uncorrected. The IR spectra were measured on a Pye-UnicamSP300 instrument in potassium bromide discs. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury VX (300 MHz) spectrometer (with operating frequencies 300.07 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H using TMS as an internal standard and 75.45 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C). Chemical shifts (
 <italic>δ</italic>) are reported in parts per million (ppm), and coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) are reported in Hertz (Hz). NMR spectra were recorded at temperature (30–45 °C) and were referenced to the residual signals of DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub>. Elemental analyses were carried out by the Micro analytical Centre of Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. The antimicrobial activities were carried out in the Medical Mycology Laboratory of the Regional Centre for Mycology and Biotechnology of Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.
