<p>Dissolve either (2.81 g, 10 mmol) of 
 <bold>3a</bold> or (2.52 g, 10 mmol) of 
 <bold>3b</bold> in dimethylformamide (30 ml), and then add 0.5 ml of triethylamine. Each of the solutions was treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.69 g, 10 mmol). The reaction mixtures were heated under reflux for 24 h then left to cool, and poured into crushed ice and acidified with 10% HCl. The solid product obtained was collected by filtration and recrystallised from dioxane/ethanol to give 
 <bold>9a</bold> and 
 <bold>9b</bold>, respectively.
