<p>Recently, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been considered to be a universal and attractive enzyme which is present in all organisms. Its essential function is to catalyse the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate within the thymidylate synthesis cycle. As a result, inhibition of DHFR causes “thymineless death”
