<p id="Par61">Innocente, de Brum Vieira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that betulinic and ursolic acids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and the piperazine derivative of betulinic acid inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The derivative showed greater activity than the parent compound. Vieira, Silva [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] found that 
 <italic>Manika rufula</italic> plants from the Caatinga desert region of Brazil contained a number of characterized compounds that inhibited 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. These included the α-amyrin caproate, β-amyrin caproate, lupeol acetate, and ursolic acid. After incubation for 2 h, ursolic acid reduced about 98% of parasite viability and induced drastic ultrastructural alterations in the cells, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Bitencourt, de Brum Vieira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] reported that the triterpene compound ursolic acid and its derivative, 3-oxime-urs-12-en-28-oic-ursolic acid, were active against fresh clinical isolates of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with an MIC of 25 μM. The derivative also inhibited a metronidazole-resistant 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> isolate and was not active in a hemolysis assay or cytotoxic to Vero cells, suggesting its value as potential trichomonocidal agent. Hübner, de Brum Vieira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>] also found that derivatives of betulinic acid inactivated 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>.
