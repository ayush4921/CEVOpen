<p id="Par69">The results from two related studies show major differences in the content and metabolism of sulfur and other amino acids in the two trichomonad species. Nozaki, Ali [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>] reported that the metabolism of sulfur amino acids in 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> probably influences their virulence and defense against stress. Based on an extensive bioanalytical study, Westrop, Wang [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>] showed that there are major differences in cysteine and methionine synthesis and metabolism in 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> and 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>foetus</italic>, that both trichomonads synthesize methylthioadenosine by an unusual mechanism, that 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>foetus</italic> has higher levels of ornithine and citrulline than 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> and released high levels of the polyamine putrescine, and that 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> but not 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic> exported 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid derived from leucine. Because these biochemical events and associated enzymes probably contribute to the viability of the protozoa, inhibition of the active sites of the enzymes might transform pathogenic to nonpathogenic trichomonads.
