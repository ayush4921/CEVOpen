<p id="Par65">Patridge, Darnell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>] found that the bioactive 3-decalinoyltetramic acid (pyrrolocin A) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) they isolated from the Amazonian fungal endophyte E6927E inhibited the growth of the pathogenic bacteria 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> as well as isolates of the pathogenic fungal strains 
 <italic>Candidas albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. King, Carter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], using an image-based, high-throughput, and high-content for testing natural products for anti-trichomonal activity, discovered that pyrrolocin A was also a potent inhibitor of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with an effective inhibitory concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 60 nM. Because the fungal compound also showed limited toxicity towards mammalian cervical cells with a high selectivity index of &gt; 100, the results of the two investigations suggest that pyrrolocin A has the potential to protect food and humans concurrently against contamination and infection by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. Will pyrrolocin A, with the exceptional high in vitro activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, also show similar activity after oral consumption or intravaginal application in women? Will pyrrolocin A-supplemented liquid and solid food protect humans against microbial, fungal, and protozoal infections? Will pyrrolocin A also be active against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] and protozoa in vitro and in vivo? We are challenged to respond to these research needs. (Also see the above section on marine compounds for a description of anti-trichomonal effects of compounds from marine fungi).
