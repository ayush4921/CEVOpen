<p id="Par62">Rocha, de Brum Vieira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that saponins (glycosylated triterpenes) isolated from 
 <italic>Quillaja, Passiflora,</italic> and 
 <italic>Ilex</italic> plant species had high anti-
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> activity with an MIC of 0.025%
 <italic>.</italic> All samples induced erythrocyte lysis and release of LDH. An evaluation by Damke, Tsuzuki [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] of purified saponins of the medicinal plant of 
 <italic>Sapindus saponaria</italic>, used traditionally to cure ulcers, external wounds, and inflammation revealed their inhibitory potency against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with an MIC value of 0.156 mg/mL for nonclinical strains and 0.078 mg/mL for a clinical strain. Jain, Kumar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] reported on a related study on the potential value of 
 <italic>Sapindus saponaria</italic> trichomonocidal saponins for prophylactic contraception.
