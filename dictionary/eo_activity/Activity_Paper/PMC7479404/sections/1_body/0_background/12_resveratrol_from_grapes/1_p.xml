<p id="Par38">Mallo, Lamas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] analyzed the in vitro effects of the natural polyphenolic compound resveratrol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) present in grape skins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The effect was cytostatic at a concentration of 25 μM and cytotoxic at 100 μM, with calculated mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 32 μM on day 1 and 25 μM on day 2, respectively. The corresponding IC
 <sub>50</sub> values using metronidazole are 3.2 μM and 4.25 μM, respectively. Although the kinetics of the in vitro inhibition of the 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> cells by resveratrol and metronidazole are similar, in terms of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, metronidazole was about 6- to 10-fold more effective than resveratrol.
