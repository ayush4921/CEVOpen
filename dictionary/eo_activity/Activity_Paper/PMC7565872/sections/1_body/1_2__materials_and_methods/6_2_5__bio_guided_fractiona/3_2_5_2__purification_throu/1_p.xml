<p>A Hewlett-Packard Agilent 1200 HPLC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a Multi Wave detector set at 280 nm was used, and the following parameters where applied. Ten microliter of 10 mg/mL sample was injected at a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. The solvent used were the same as the one used for the preparative HPLC. The instrument was equipped with a 250 × 4.6 mm–5 µm RP C8 column (Strategy from Uptisphere, Interchim, Montluçon, France). The gradient starts at 0% (A)–100% (B) for 10 min; then from the 10:00 min mark to the 55:00 min mark, it goes down to 20% (A)–80% (B); this is followed by a drop reaching 60% (A)–40% (B) at the 57:00 min mark. It finishes at the 59:00 min mark with a 0% (A)–100% (B) mobile phase. From this fractionation 5 fractions were collected and tested for the two biological activities. Once the purification process was complete, the compound was kept at 7 ± 1 °C in a dark container for a maximum 48 h before undergoing the analytical steps.</p>
