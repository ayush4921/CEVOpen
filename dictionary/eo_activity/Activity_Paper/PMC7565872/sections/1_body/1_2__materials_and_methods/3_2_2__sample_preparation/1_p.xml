<p>Twenty grams of 
 <italic>L. chinensis</italic> roots were precisely weighted and extracted with 400 mL of solvent in a Soxhlet apparatus. Extractions were made using either HPLC grade methanol or HPLC grade dichloromethane, and this led to the collection of a polar and a less-polar extract. The extracts were then evaporated at 40 ± 1 °C using a rotating evaporator (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). The dried extracts were kept at −22 ± 1 °C until use. The polar samples were solubilized in a small amount of pure ethyl alcohol and the non-polar extracts were solubilized in HPLC grade dimethyl sulfoxide. The solvents were added gradually under ultrasonic bath until complete solubilization.
