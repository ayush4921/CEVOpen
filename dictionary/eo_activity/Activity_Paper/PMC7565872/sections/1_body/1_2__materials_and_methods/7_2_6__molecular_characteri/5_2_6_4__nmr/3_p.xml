<p>Regarding heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiments, the datasets were acquired with 4096 and 512 data points for the f2 (
 <sup>1</sup>H) and f1 (
 <sup>13</sup>C) dimensions, with spectral widths of 9091 and 38736 Hz, respectively. Thirty two scans were performed and the relaxation delay was fixed at 1.5 s.
