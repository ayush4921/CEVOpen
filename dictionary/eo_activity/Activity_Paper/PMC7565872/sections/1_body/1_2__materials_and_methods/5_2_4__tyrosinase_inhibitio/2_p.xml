<p>The enzymatic reaction was performed by mixing 100 µL of sample with 50 µL of tyrosinase and 250 µL of oxygenated phosphate buffer. This mixture was left to incubate for 15 min, and then added in a quartz absorption cell along with 400 µL of the substrate solution. The synthesis of dopachromes was observed in real time, and the absorbance was measured every 15 s for 5 min at 475 nm.</p>
