<p>Based on the mass spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01347-f006">Figure 6</xref>), signal at 1153.1 m/z corresponded to [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>, indicating a monoisotopic mass of 1152.1 Da for the purified molecule. When compared to the literature, the observed parent ion is in line with the observations of Lv Q. et al., 2015 and Xu X. 2010 [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and suggests a proanthocyanidin tetramer with two B-type bonds and one A-type bond (Figure 8). The following information obtained from the mass spectrum was consistent with that conclusion. Signal at 1001.1 corresponded to the loss of an hydroxyvinylbenzenediol unit [M + H − 152]
 <sup>+</sup>, as previously described by Enomoto H. et al., 2020 [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-10-01347" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The most abundant ion of the mass spectrum (865.2 m/z) was formed by quinone methide fission which caused the loss of the first epicatechin unit linked with a single B-type 5–4′ bond. The 865.2 m/z ion thus corresponded to an epicatechin trimer [M + H − 288]
 <sup>+</sup>. Sodium adduct of the latter is also reported at 887.2 m/z [M + Na − 288]
 <sup>+</sup>, as well as the formation of an ion resulting from a water molecule loss to the trimer at 847.2 m/z [M + H – 288 − H
 <sub>2</sub>O]
 <sup>+</sup>. The signal at 713.2 was produced following the loss of a hydroxyvinylbenzenediol unit from the epicathechin trimer [M + H – 288 − 152]
 <sup>+</sup>. Specific fragment ions at 575.1 and 865.2 allowed to elucidate the position of the A-type double 5–4’/2-O-3’ (Figure 8) as those fragments are produced when the A-type bond is placed between the second and the third epicatechin units [
