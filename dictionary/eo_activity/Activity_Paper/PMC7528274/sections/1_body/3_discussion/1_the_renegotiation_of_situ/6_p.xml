<p id="Par39">On the demographic side, while most of the Alpine Valley in the country faced rapid socioeconomic transformation after WWII [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which led to the abandonment of the valley [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], the Sangone Valley experienced the opposite. Thanks to its position close to Turin and on the main corridor between Italy and France, like neighbouring Val di Susa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], during the past 40 years, the valley has been repopulated (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). While from the 1940s to 1960s local inhabitants abandoned the valley, the repopulation of the valley is linked first of all to the opening of a large car manufacturing facility in Rivalta in 1967, as well as other factories in other municipalities in the Sangone Valley [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Due to this industrialization, new factory workers, coming from all across Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], have settled in the municipalities of the valley since the 1960s. Moreover, since the 1980s, the valley has been the destination of a new wave of immigrants. In this case, it has been mostly professionals and other people from Turin, who decided to move away from the city looking for better accommodation and environment. Due to the landscape and overall affordability of houses, these newcomers settled in the valley, enriching the cultural diversity of the place. In regard to LEK, these new inhabitants, most of the time, have had little or no knowledge of the valley and its environment but have enriched the culture of the place by bringing with them knowledge concerning different plants from their home communities [
