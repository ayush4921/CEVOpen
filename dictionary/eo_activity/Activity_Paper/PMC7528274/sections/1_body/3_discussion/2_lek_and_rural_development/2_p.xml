<p id="Par48">In the Sangone Valley, as well as in other areas of the Western Alps, LEK was mostly interpreted as a fragment of intangible heritage; pieces of ancient knowledge preserved only in fragments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. With this approach, LEK has been placed at the centre of a process of 
 <italic>heritagisation</italic> and museification, culminating in the development of ethnographic museums as well as specific tourism and commercial communication campaigns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In this sense, LEK has been turned into an ethno-commodity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] aimed at addressing cultural and economic issues related to tourism and food business development. However, as pointed out by Comaroff and Comoraff [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>], such an approach, even if rewarding in the short term, furthers the cultural and economic dependence of the local community on the outside because it triggers a vicious circle of cultural production in which local communities promote and inflate traditional knowledge in order to suit the needs of tourists and the market. Thus, despite the lexicon and premise, this approach to LEK risks not fostering a real opportunity for sustainable development.
