<p>Docking calculations offer essential quantitative results. The binding affinity and the inhibition constant are among these results. As shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the binding affinity or the docking free energy along with the inhibition constants are listed for the eight selected compounds. Interestingly, lithospermic acid (
 <bold>42</bold>) and salvianolic acid A (
 <bold>41</bold>) have shown the best binding affinity against the five enzymes which may indicate a potential bioactive role for these compounds. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00053-f001">Figure 1</xref> gives a better insight into the interactions of these compounds at the active site and offers explanation for the relative high binding affinity. Strong non-bonding interactions were found between these compounds and the active site, such as hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions, and electrostatic forces.
