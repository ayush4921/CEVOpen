<p>A total of 13 known nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites were tentatively identified through negative ionization mode, including mostly cyclic and acyclic peptides derivatives; 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (
 <bold>7</bold>), 1-methylxanthine (
 <bold>8</bold>), and hypoxanthine (
 <bold>9</bold>) of the xanthine family compounds [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 
 <italic>N</italic>-Acryloylglycine (
 <bold>10</bold>) and orysastrobin (
 <bold>11</bold>) are strobilurins derivatives [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which are widely used as a fungicide [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Other identified compounds, including mecarbinzid (
 <bold>12</bold>), the oxidized compound oplophorus luciferin (
 <bold>13</bold>), and biotin-X-NHS (
 <bold>14</bold>), are important secondary metabolites. Carbinoxamine (
 <bold>15</bold>), a natural product derived from carbamic acid, was also found in the extract; however, these compounds are very rare in nature, especially from plant sources. In the past, natural products derived from carbamic acid have been isolated from the Taiwanese plant 
 <italic>Magnolia kachirachirai</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the Pakistani plant 
 <italic>Vincetoxicum stocksii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The nitrogen-based compounds which were identified through the positive mode of UHPLC-MS analysis include tranexamic acid (
 <bold>16</bold>), 5-pentyloxazole (
 <bold>17</bold>), homoarecoline (
 <bold>18</bold>), 
 <italic>N</italic>-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (
 <bold>19</bold>), alizapride (
 <bold>20</bold>), 
 <italic>L</italic>-cladinose (
 <bold>21</bold>), N1, N10-dicoumaroylspermidine (
 <bold>22</bold>), 9-acetoxyfukinanolide (
 <bold>23</bold>), and dodemorph (
 <bold>24</bold>).
