<p>The tentatively identified plant pyrrolizidine alkaloids (in positive ionization mode) were supinine (
 <bold>3</bold>), europine 
 <bold>(4)</bold>, and heliotrine 
 <bold>(5)</bold> [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These pyrrolizidine alkaloids (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="biomolecules-11-00053-sch002">Scheme 2</xref>) are known phytochemicals from various 
 <italic>Heliotropium</italic> species. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid 
 <bold>6</bold> was found to be a new derivative of 
 <bold>4</bold> (C
 <sub>16</sub>H
 <sub>27</sub>NO
 <sub>6</sub>), since the UHPLC-MS data displayed molecular ions for 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 329.1847 (C
 <sub>16</sub>H
 <sub>27</sub>NO
 <sub>6</sub>) and 331.2003 (C
 <sub>16</sub>H
 <sub>29</sub>NO
 <sub>6</sub>), respectively, which indicated that compound 
 <bold>6</bold> is a reduced form of 
 <bold>4</bold>. Thus, on the basis of the molecular formula and the number of DBE, two structures, 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold> are possible; however, structure 
 <bold>6a</bold> is more suitable based on its stability factor and the fact that both saturated and unsaturated pyrrolidine rings are reported in pyrrolizidine alkaloids from various 
 <italic>Heliotropium</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further, a similarity with structure 
 <bold>b</bold> (reduced ester linkage) was not reported in the literature. Therefore, compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> is identified as new pyrrolidine alkaloids form this plant. Further compounds 
 <bold>3, 4, 5,</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> are biosynthetic analogs, as compound 
 <bold>3</bold> is converted into 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> by simple methylation and hydroxylation, and these reactions are very common in the biosynthesis of alkaloids. Similarly, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> on dehydrogenation gives compound 
 <bold>6a</bold>.
