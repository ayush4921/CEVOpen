<p>In vitro enzyme inhibitory assays (AChE, BChE, tyrosinase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase), as reported previously [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], were also performed with the methanolic extract. The positive references used were acarbose for α-amylase and α-glucosidase, galantamine for AChE and BChE, and kojic acid for tyrosinase. The details of these protocols are provided in the
