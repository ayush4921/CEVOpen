    "Cinnamoyl sucrose esters (CSEs) were evaluated as AGIs and their enzyme inhibition activity and potency were compared with gold standard acarbose. The inhibition activity of the CSEs against α-glucosidase and α-amylase depended on their structure including the number of the cinnamoyl moieties, their position, and the presence or absence of the acetyl moieties. The inhibitory values of the CSEs <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> generally increases in the order of mono-cinnamoyl moieties < di-cinnamoyl ≤ tri-cinnamoyl < tetra-cinnamoyl. This trend was supported from both in vitro and in silico results. Both tetra-cinnamoyl CSEs <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> showed the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of 77 ± 5%, 74 ± 9%, respectively, against acarbose at 27 ± 4%, and highest α-amylase inhibitory activities of 98 ± 2%, 99 ± 1%, respectively, against acarbose at 93 ± 2%. CSEs <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> showed desired higher inhibition of α-glucosidase than α-amylase suggesting potential for further development as AGIs with reduced side effects. Molecular docking studies on CSEs <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> attributed the high inhibition of these compounds to multiple π-π interactions and favorable projection of the cinnamoyl moieties (especially O-3 cinnamoyl) in the enzyme pockets. This work proposes CSEs as new AGIs with potentially reduced side effects."
