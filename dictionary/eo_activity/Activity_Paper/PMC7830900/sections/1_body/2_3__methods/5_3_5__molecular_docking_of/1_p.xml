<p>A suitable template for building a homology model for α-glucosidase was found using the ‘BLAST’ algorithm. Yeast isomaltase (PDB ID: 3A4A)

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. AutoDock was used for docking simulations and Maestro was used to visualize the binding modes. Receptor preparation was done by first removing water molecules and then adding Gasteiger charges and hydrogen atoms. Maximum number of rotatable bonds was chosen to increase the flexibility of the docked ligand. The site that houses the glucose molecule in the yeast isomaltase was chosen to be the gridded binding site. Lamarckian Genetic algorithm was chosen for the docking and a total of 100 binding modes were chosen.
