<p>We have earlier reported that feruloyl sucrose esters (FSEs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f001">Figure 1</xref>) function as selective AGIs and has the potential to eliminate the side effects associated with the commercial AGIs [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. FSEs desirably showed higher % inhibition of α-glucosidase and lower inhibition of α-amylase in comparison to acarbose as the AGI gold standard [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Specifically, FSE 
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f002">Figure 2</xref>) significantly reduced blood glucose excursion in STZ-treated mice compared to control (starch only) mice. The diisopropylidene bridges, position, and the number of the feruloyl substituents on the sucrose core were key determinants of the selectivity and % inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further research is advantageous to assess other phenylpropanoid moieties beside the feruloyl moieties to obtain lead AGIs candidate for further development.
