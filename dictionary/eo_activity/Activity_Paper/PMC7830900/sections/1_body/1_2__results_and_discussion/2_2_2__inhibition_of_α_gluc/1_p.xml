<p>CSEs 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold> were screened for α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition at their maximum solubility limit of 25 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Acarbose, the gold standard AGI drug, was used as a reference standard at the same concentration. Except for CSE 
 <bold>2</bold>, all CSEs investigated showed inhibition of both α-glucosidase and α-amylase, and the inhibition was mainly influenced by the number of the cinnamoyl substituents on the sucrose core and to a lesser extent by the acetyl moieties and the diisopropylidene bridges. CSE 
 <bold>2</bold> with one cinnamoyl moiety did not show significant inhibition activity of both enzymes, in agreement with the inhibition results using FSE with one feruloyl moiety. Both CSEs 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> with diisopropylidene bridges and free OH groups showed similar α-glucosidase inhibition of 35 ± 5% and 32 ± 3%, respectively, and similar α-amylase inhibition activities of 9 ± 5% and 8 ± 4%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f003">Figure 3</xref>). In both cases, the % α-glucosidase inhibition was &gt;4 times higher than the % α-amylase inhibition. An additional cinnamoyl at O-3 as in CSE 
 <bold>5</bold>, caused a huge increase in the % α-glucosidase inhibition to 77 ± 5 and even a bigger increase in the α-amylase inhibition to 98 ± 2%. Again, these results agree with the inhibition trend observed in the case of FSEs where moieties at O-3 lead to higher enzyme inhibition.
 <sup>26</sup> Capping of the hydroxyl moieties of CSEs 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> with acetyl protecting groups to give CSEs 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> respectively, resulted in a similar increase in both the α-glucosidase inhibition (46 ± 3% and 46 ± 2%, respectively) and α-amylase inhibitions (14 ± 4% and 13 ± 7%, respectively). In both cases, the % α-glucosidase inhibition remained roughly &gt;4 times higher than the % α-amylase inhibition as seen in the case of free OH in CSEs 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold>. The modest increase in selectivity may be attributed to the steric effects that the acetyl groups cause, which favors better docking of CSEs 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> at the active sites of the enzymes. Though the increase in inhibition was modest, acylation of the OH groups with other larger acetyl groups could be a means to influence the inhibition activities. CSE 
 <bold>8</bold> without the diisopropylidene or acetyl groups exhibited a similar α-glucosidase inhibition value of 34 ± 4% as compared to its counterpart, CSEs 
 <bold>4</bold> with 32 ± 3%. However, it’s α-amylase inhibition value of 16 ± 2% is double that of CSEs 
 <bold>4</bold> at 8 ± 4%. These results once again clearly show that the diisopropylidene bridges on the sucrose core have no significant influence on α-glucosidase inhibition: a similar trend observed in the case of FSEs. CSE 
 <bold>9</bold> with four cinnamoyl moieties and no diisopropylidene bridges showed α-glucosidase inhibition of 74 ± 9%, which is similar to its counterpart CSE 
 <bold>5</bold> with an inhibition value of 77 ± 5%. Interestingly, both CSEs 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> showed similar α-amylase inhibition values at 99 ± 1% and 98 ± 2%, respectively. This result disagrees with the observations from the FSEs where the inhibition activity decreases in the presence of the diisopropylidene bridges [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There was no significant increase in the % inhibition of both enzymes with the increase in the number of cinnamoyl moieties from three to four (compare values for CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> vs. 
 <bold>9</bold>, and 
 <bold>4</bold> vs. 
 <bold>8</bold>). This observation contrasts with the results observed in the case of FSEs [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This is attributed to the lack of hydrogen bonding, which is observed in the case of FSEs from docking studies [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the case of FSEs, hydrogen bonding increased the % inhibition of the enzymes due to stronger interactions with the enzyme moieties [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the inhibition values of CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> with four cinnamoyl moieties, were several folds higher than those of the CSEs 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6,</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> with two of three cinnamoyl moieties, indicating that the number of substituents on the sucrose core plays a key role in enzyme inhibition. CSEs 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, and 
 <bold>8</bold> showed similar α-glucosidase inhibition values as compared to acarbose at 27 ± 4% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00469-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> with four cinnamoyl moieties had almost double the inhibitory values compare to acarbose making them more potent inhibitors. Interestingly, except for CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold>, the rest of the CSEs had much lower % α-amylase inhibition values compared to α-glucosidase inhibition. This selectivity is important for reducing the gastrointestinal side effects.
