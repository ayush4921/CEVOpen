<p>Cinnamoyl sucrose esters inhibited α-glucosidase and α-amylase to different extents and the inhibition activity depended on the structure of these compounds. Selective inhibition of α-glucosidase over α-amylase to eliminate the side effects is achievable by tuning the number of cinnamoyl moieties, their positions, diisopropylidene bridges, and the acetyl groups. Among the eight compounds tested, CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold>, with four cinnamoyl moieties, showed much higher inhibition of α-glucosidase than acarbose and near complete inhibition of α-amylase. Both showed much higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values than acarbose. From the in silico docking studies, the high inhibition of CSEs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> is thought to be due to multiple π-π interactions and favorable projection of the cinnamoyl moieties (especially O-3 cinnamoyl) in the enzyme pockets. This work demonstrates the potential of CSEs as AGIs. Further studies on developing phenylpropanoid sucrose esters as AGIs with minimum side effects are underway in our lab.
