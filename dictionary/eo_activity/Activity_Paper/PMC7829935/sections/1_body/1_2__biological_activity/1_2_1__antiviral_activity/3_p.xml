<p>Some substrates mimic the inhibitors of influenza virus neuraminidase, for example, the thioglycoside, 3-deoxy-3-fluoro derivative and phosphonate of sialic acid (Neu5Ac), whereas the 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en, DANA) was identified as the first effective neuraminidase inhibitor (K
