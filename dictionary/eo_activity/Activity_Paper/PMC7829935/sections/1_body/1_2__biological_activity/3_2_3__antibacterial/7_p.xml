<p>The effectiveness of peptide Compound 
 <bold>21</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) as an antibacterial agent was assessed by employing a standard minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay against four Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacterial strains. This compound showed a complete loss of activity against all bacterial strains in this assay. Moreover, the peptide lost all toxicity toward human erythrocytes. Since these results correlate with the abovementioned antimicrobial activity and the same trend for antimicrobial activity and hemolytic activity was observed, it can be concluded that the therapeutic value of the peptides presented in these studies is limited. The authors presented a highly efficient gramicidin S synthesis strategy for the incorporation of nonproteinogenic sugar amino acids, which can be developed in the future in examining new active compounds.
