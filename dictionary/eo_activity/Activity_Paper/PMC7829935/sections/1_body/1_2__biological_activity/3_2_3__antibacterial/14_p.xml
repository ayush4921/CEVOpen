<p>Tondi et al., obtained a set of boronic β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid derivatives acting as AmpC β-lactamase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The lead Compound 
 <bold>28</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), containing β-amino acid moiety, presents improved drug-like properties, and with its strong binding to AmpC, it is a promising candidate for further development of this series of compounds with the ability to cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the binding orientation adopted by Compound 
 <bold>28</bold> in AmpC suggests the gain of additional interactions with such surrounding polar residues as Asn289 and Asn343 through the introduction of functional groups at the inhibitor distal phenyl ring.
