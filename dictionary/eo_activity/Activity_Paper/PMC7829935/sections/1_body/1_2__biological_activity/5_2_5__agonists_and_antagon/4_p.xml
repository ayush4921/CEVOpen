<p>Jeong and colleagues developed the synthesis of novel 3′-ureidoadenosine derivatives, starting from 1,2:5,6-di-

 <sc>d</sc>-glucose with the presence of the β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid motif (

 <bold>36</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Although they did not discover new and potent A
 <sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor agonists, the authors explained the unfavorable steric and electrostatic interactions likely to occur upon binding of the 3′-ureido derivatives in the agonist binding site of the A
 <sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor using molecular modeling, which could provide valuable information about the identification of the binding site of the A
 <sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor.
