<p>Nicotinic acid (niacin, vitamin B3, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) is one of the most effective therapeutic agents for raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Moreover, it also protects from other cardiovascular risk factors by lowering very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipoprotein(a) plasma concentrations [

Identifying the high-affinity nicotinic acid receptor GPR109A (HM74A in humans and PUMA-G in mice) was made possible due to the identification of a high-affinity nicotinic acid binding site that was localized to adipose, macrophage, and spleen tissues and appeared to function in a G

 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] postulated that tissue selectivity, commonly observed with partial agonists, could help prevent side effects on skin cells (i.e., reducing or eliminating flushing). The authors decided to test the hypothesis that there are GPR109A agonists that are potent anti-lipolytic agents that do not cause flushing. It was shown that biaryl cyclohexene carboxylic acids act as full and potent niacin receptor (GPR109A) agonists. Compound
