<p>Heterocycles are cyclic compounds having atoms of at least two different elements as ring members. Most of the naturally occurring heterocycles, e.g., antibiotics belonging to the penicillin group, alkaloids such as vinblastine, morphine, reserpine, etc., have a heterocyclic moiety [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Till now, a wide range of synthetic heterocycle preparation methods has been developed using both solution and solid-phase synthesis. This class of organic compounds presents a wide range of applications. Predominantly, they are used as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and veterinary products [

Heterocycles are promising agents for drug design as they can be easily synthesized in laboratories by using routine synthetic methods. The location of common heteroatoms, including nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, is different; however, most of the heterocycles can be divided into groups characterized by the specific structural motif [
