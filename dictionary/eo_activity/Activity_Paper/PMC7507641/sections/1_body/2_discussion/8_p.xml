<p id="Par51">The endophytic bacterial composition differed among the samples, and our study also indicates that the endophytic bacterial community in the roots of medicinal licorices is determined by the bioactive compounds in the roots. In addition, this result is consistent with the hypothesis that the physical and chemical factors in the soil and leaf nutrition dictate the composition of the endophytic bacterial population, although further studies are required to characterize the roles of these endophytic bacteria. Our study provides useful information for the development of strategies to improve the production and quality of medicinal licorices.</p>
