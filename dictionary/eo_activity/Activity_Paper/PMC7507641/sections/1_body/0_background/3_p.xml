<p id="Par29">The dried roots and rhizomes of three medicinal licorices (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) are widely used worldwide as a traditional medicinal herb [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antitumor, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective activities, which are attributed to a variety of bioactive constituents extracted from licorice root, mainly including triterpene saponins and flavonoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Glycyrrhizic acid, which is present at the highest levels among the triterpene saponins, is an important pharmacologically bioactive constituent with anti-inflammatory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], antiviral, immune regulation and other biological properties. Recent studies have shown that licorice flavonoids have a variety of pharmacological activities and have gradually become a hot spot in pharmacological research [
