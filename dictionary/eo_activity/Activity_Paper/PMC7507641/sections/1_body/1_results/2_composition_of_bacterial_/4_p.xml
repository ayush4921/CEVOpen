<p id="Par37">We used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) to identify discriminative taxa among different species of medicinal licorices and different growing years. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the results of LEfSe analysis of all years and species based on the rank sum test revealed a total of 16 biomarkers with significant differences that were contained in the E.D (5 taxa), E.W (7 taxa), R.G (2 taxa) and R.W (2 taxa) groups. No discriminative taxa were observed in year 3. These biomarkers included

 <italic>Nocardiopsis</italic>, 
 <italic>Methylophaga</italic>, 
 <italic>Pelagibacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Halomonas</italic> and
