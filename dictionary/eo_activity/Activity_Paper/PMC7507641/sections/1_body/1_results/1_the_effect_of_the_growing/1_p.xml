<p id="Par32">The results of two-way ANOVA showed that the contents of the bioactive compounds (glycyrrhizic acid (GIA), liquiritin (LI) and total flavonoid (GTF)) were not significantly affected by the interaction effect between growing year (1–3) and plant species (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, the contents of the bioactive compounds were significantly affected by the main effect growing year (1–3) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), with a trend of stable increase in the contents observed with each growing year. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the contents of GIA, LI and GTF in the year 3 were significantly higher than those in year 1, the contents of GIA and GTF in year 2 were significantly higher than those in year 1, and the contents of GIA and LI in year 3 were significantly higher than those in year 2.
