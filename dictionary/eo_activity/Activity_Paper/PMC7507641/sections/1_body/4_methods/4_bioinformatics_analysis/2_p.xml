<p id="Par58">UPARSE software (UPARSE v7.0.1001) was used to cluster the effective tags of all samples into the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with ≥97% identity, and taking the sequence with the highest frequency as the representative sequence of each OTU. The taxonomic information for each representative sequence was annotated using the SILVA database (threshold value set to 0.8–1), and multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE (Version 3.8.31) software to study the phylogenetic relationship of the representative sequences of OTUs among the 27 root samples. OTU abundance information was normalized using a standard sequence number corresponding to the sample with the lowest sequences (49,096 reads for sample E.W.1). Subsequent analysis of alpha diversity and beta diversity were performed based on this output normalized data. The raw sequence reads have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of NCBI (SRR12483393 to SRR12483419)(
