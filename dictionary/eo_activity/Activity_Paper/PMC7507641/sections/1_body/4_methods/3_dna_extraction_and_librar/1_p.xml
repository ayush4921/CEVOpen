<p id="Par55">After immersion in liquid nitrogen, genomic DNA was extracted from the samples using the DNA Quick Plant System kit (Tiangen, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity and concentration of DNA were evaluated using a NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). According to the concentration, each DNA sample was diluted a final concentration to 1 ng/μL with sterile distilled water for use as a DNA template. The 16S rDNA genes of the V4 region were amplified using specific primers (515F: 5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′ and 806R: 5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) with barcodes [

PCR analyses were carried out with Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix and GC Buffer (New England Biolabs) to ensure amplification efficiency and accuracy. PCR runs started at at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min.
