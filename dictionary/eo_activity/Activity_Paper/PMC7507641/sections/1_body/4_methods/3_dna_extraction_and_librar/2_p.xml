<p id="Par56">The PCR product was mixed with the same volume of 1× loading buffer (containing SYBR green) and then was detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR product was purified from the target strip using a Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The libraries were constructed using a TruSeq®DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and index codes were added. The library quality was assessed on the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Finally, Amplicon sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platforms at the Beijing Compass Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).</p>
