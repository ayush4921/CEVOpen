  <p>Db-RDA for all groups. Description: Environmental factors are generally represented by arrows. The length of the arrow line represents the degree of correlation between a certain environmental factor and community and species distribution, and the longer the arrow, the greater the correlation. When the angle between the environmental factors is acute, it means that there is a positive correlation between the two environmental factors, while when the angle is obtuse, there is a negative correlation.</p>
