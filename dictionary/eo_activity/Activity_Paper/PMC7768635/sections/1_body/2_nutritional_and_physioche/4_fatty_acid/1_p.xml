<p>PQR is rich in fatty acids. (As shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Li et al. showed that the saturated fatty acid with the highest content in the flower bud of PQR was palmitic acid, and the unsaturated fatty acid with the highest content was linoleic acid (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1999</xref>). Yang et al. showed that the fatty acid with the highest content in the root of PQR was methyl linoleate (59.56%) (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid for human body. Linoleic acid is very important for cholesterol metabolism. Only when cholesterol is combined with linoleic acid, can it run in the body and metabolize normally. If linoleic acid is deficient, cholesterol will combine with saturated fatty acid and deposit in human body. Moreover, linoleic acid can protect skin from radiation damage. In addition, linoleic acid also has a strong effect on reducing the concentration of LDL cholesterol. In Chinese Pharmacopoeia, ethyl linoleic acid pills and drops are still used to prevent and treat hypertension, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. However, most of the articles on anti-radiation, anti-hypertension and anti-cardiovascular diseases of PQR mainly focus on the study of the crude PQR and ginseng saponin, and few studies have conducted in-depth discussion on the composition, pharmacological effect and mechanism of fatty acid compounds in PQR. In the future, scholars can try to extract linoleic acid from PQR, and then apply it to the treatment of some diseases. Future scholars should not only study the saponins, they should pay more attention to other active components and analyze the overall characteristics of PQR.
