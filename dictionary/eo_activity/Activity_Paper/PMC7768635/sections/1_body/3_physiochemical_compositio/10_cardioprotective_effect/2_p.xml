<p>As a potential dietary supplement, PQR has been proved to be effective in preventing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and heart failure. It could reduce the occurrence of myocardial hypertrophy by blocking leptin stimulating RhoA/ROCK and significantly reducing the expression of p115RhoGEF gene and protein (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Moey et al., 2011</xref>). It also activates Nrf2 signaling pathway by inhibiting Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap) 1, and significantly inhibits inflammatory macrophage-mediated cardiac cell death and hypertrophy to play a cardiac protective role (

 <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments, PQR could attenuate the effect of isoproterenol on left ventricular function, increase heart quality, and decrease the up-regulation of fetal gene expression. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies, PQR completely inhibited isoprenaline induced hypertrophy on the surface area of myocytes (

In addition, PF11, the characteristic component of PQR, could reduce the levels of MDA, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), LDH, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), increase the activity of SOD, and significantly improve cardiac function and reduce the area of myocardial infarction. PF11 could be used as a natural anti-myocardial ischemia drug to improve cardiac function (
