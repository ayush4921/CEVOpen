<p>PQR mainly contains ginsenosides, which can be divided into three types according to their parent structure: dammarane, oleanane and oceanillol. Studies have confirmed that ginsenosides are contained in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds of PQR. Now more than 70 ginsenosides have been isolated from different parts of PQR (as shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Meng et al. studies showed that the total saponins content in different parts of PQR was as follows: flower bud &gt; flower stalk &gt; pulp &gt; root &gt; stem and leaf, the highest content of saponins in flower bud was 14.87%, and the lowest was 5.79% in stem and leaf (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2000</xref>). Wang et al. showed that the stem, leaves and taproot of PQR contain saponins, and the content of ginsenosides in the stem was 1/3-1/2 of that in the taproot, while the content of ginsenosides in the leaves was 1.5â€“4 times of that in the taproot (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Dong, 1995</xref>). In other words, because the leaves of PQR are not exploited and utilized, a lot of the medicinal ingredients are lost, which results in a great waste of resources. Future scholars can focus on the stems and leaves of PQR in order to make full use of its resources. As mentioned above, PQR is expensive and the resources are in short supply. If the root of PQR is used as medicine, abandoning the buds of stems and leaves will cause a great waste of resources. The above studies also showed that the content of saponins in the flower bud was the highest, followed by the fruit. In Pharmacopoeia, the plants with dried flower buds and fruits as medicinal parts were not rare. Future scholars can study the pharmacological effects or edible value of the flower buds and fruits of PQR. On the one hand, it can make full use of PQR resources and alleviate the pressure of supply exceeding demand of the market of PQR. On the other hand, it can develop new medicinal parts of PQR and enrich its clinical application and food health application.
