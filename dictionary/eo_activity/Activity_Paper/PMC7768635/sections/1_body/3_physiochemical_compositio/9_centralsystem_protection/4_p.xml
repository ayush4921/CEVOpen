<p>The above studies have shown that PQR has a good neuroprotective effect on neurological disorders such as Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, acute central nervous system injury, neurodegenerative and other diseases. However, there are common problems in the above experiments, such as the lack of a comparative study between positive control drugs and PQR, and the study only on related biochemical factors, and the lack of in-depth study on the target pathways, target proteins and relevant neuroprotective mechanisms. Previous literature indicated that rapamycin, sodium valproate, donepezil hydrochloride and other drugs could be used as positive drugs to explore neuroprotective effects. ALOX5, ADORA2A, CDK2, GSK3B and TLR4/JNK/caspase-3, AMPK/Mtor/ULK1 are the key targets and pathways of neuroprotective effect. Whether future scholars can use this as a starting point to explore the in-depth mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of PQR. In addition, attention to insulin/IGF signaling, mitochondrial function and glucose utilization in neurodegenerative models may contribute to a better understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
