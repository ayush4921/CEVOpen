<p>With the increasing demand for PQR, PQR is in short supply and expensive. In order to seek excessive profits, the adulterants of PQR increase accordingly, and the phenomenon of shoddy products frequently occurs in the market. Moreover, plant resources are easily affected by different factors, such as provenance, growth environment, harvesting time, processing methods and storage conditions, which makes the quality of PQR from different regions uneven. In addition, PQR has complex chemical components and many chemical substances have pharmacological effects. The quality control of medicinal materials is the most problematic link in the production of medicinal materials. At present, the key problem in the quality evaluation of PQR is that the evaluation index is too one-sided and unitary.In Chinese pharmacopoeia (2020 edition), only Rg1, Re and Rb1 were used as the quality control indexes of PQR. However, medicine materials contains many kinds of ingredients, different ingredients work together, it is not scientific and objective to evaluate the quality of medicine materials only by using one or several effective components as indicators. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of PQR, it is necessary to establish a rapid, accurate and sensitive detection method to simultaneously measure a variety of chemical components, evaluate the quality of medicinal materials, and improve the quality control methods.</p>
