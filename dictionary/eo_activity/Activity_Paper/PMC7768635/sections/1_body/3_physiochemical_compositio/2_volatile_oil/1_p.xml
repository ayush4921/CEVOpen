<p>Shen et al. identified 37 compounds from the volatile oil of PQR cultivated in Jilin province, among which 26 sesquiterpenes accounted for 75% of the total volatile oil, the content of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-farnesene was as high as 36%, and the content of bisabolene was as high as 10%, which were the main components of the volatile in PQR (

The basic components contained ketones, alcohols, phenols and aldehydes. The strong acidic components were dominated by organic acids, and also contained aldehydes and ketones. The weak acidic components were mainly contain alkene, and also contained ketones and esters.The neutral components were dominated by esters and also contain alkenes and phenols (
