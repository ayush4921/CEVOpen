<p>“Chinese Materia Medica” (中华本草) records: PQR likes humid environment, should avoid strong light irradiation. Therefore, the cultivation of PQR needs to build a shading shed, the light transmittance of the shed is 20–25%. The light transmittance should be higher in spring (about 22%) and lower in summer, which can reduce the disease. And the soil for PQR cultivation should be sandy loam with good water permeability and fertility, mixed with large coarse sand, rather than clay or low-lying areas with poor drainage and easy to accumulate water.</p>
