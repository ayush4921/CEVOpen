   <p>1) There were two males and one female, aged 24, 28 and 45 y, respectively, with no history of disease, who chewed fresh PQR rhizomes planted at home with a chewing amount of about 0.5–1 g. After chewing about 5–10 min, they were sudden chest tightness, palpitation, abdominal distension, nausea and mild dizziness. Two cases were accompanied by obvious vomiting and cold sweat due to a large dosage. The results showed that the blood pressure was low and the heart rate was fast, and the electrocardiogram examination showed no abnormality. And there was no skin flush, rash, pruritus and other allergic reactions in all three patients. In this case, a little or even a small amount of fresh PQR root by oral administration cause poisoning, which is very rare (

   <p>2) Male, 3 g of PQR was taken 4 h after birth, and on the second day he developed symptoms of food refusal and convulsion. Physical examination: the face and the whole skin were obviously flushed, the muscle tension of limbs was slightly increased, and the skin was irritated with twitching, which was relieved automatically after 3–4 s. CT diagnosis: extensive cerebral edema and subarachnoid hemorrhage, consistent with the changes of brain CT caused by PQR poisoning. There are many causes of intracranial hemorrhage in newborns, and intracranial hemorrhage caused by PQR poisoning is rare (
