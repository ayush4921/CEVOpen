<p>Whole plant samples of 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> were sourced from Masaba south sub-County in Kisii County, Kenya, under accepted bioconservation methods with the help of a local herbalist. A fresh sample was botanically authenticated by an acknowledged taxonomist, Mr. Lucas Karimi, from the Pharmacy Department, Kenyatta University, and assigned a voucher specimen number BM/26345/001/2016. A sample voucher was deposited at the Department of Pharmacy research herbarium of Kenyatta University. The plant samples were transported to Kenyatta University, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Biotechnology laboratories, washed with clean water to remove soil, and dried under shade for 14 days. The samples were then milled into a fine powder with an electric mill. The powder was weighed and stored at room temperature in airtight containers, awaiting extraction.
