<p>The existence of viable bacteria colonies after 24â€‰h of incubation with the antibacterial agent present could be due to the occurrence of mutant forms which resist and grow in the presence of extract concentrations and change to vegetative forms when antibacterial agents are withdrawn. Mutant bacterial cells devoid of cell wall can be produced by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [
