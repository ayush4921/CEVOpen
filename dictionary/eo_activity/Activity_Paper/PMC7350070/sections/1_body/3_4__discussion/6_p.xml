<p>Time-kill kinetics studies of the dichloromethane: methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> at varying concentrations on the test bacteria showed a slow dose- and time-dependent kinetics of killing for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Dose-dependent kinetics occur when the antibacterial agent is at a high concentration at the target site for it to kill the bacteria, while time-dependent kinetics is observed when the concentration of the antibacterial agent is more than the MIC for the test bacteria [
