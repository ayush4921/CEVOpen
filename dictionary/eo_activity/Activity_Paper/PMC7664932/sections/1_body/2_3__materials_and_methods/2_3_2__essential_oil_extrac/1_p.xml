<p>The EOs of 200 g from the prepared plant samples were extracted by hydrodistillation from the shoots of Saudi and Egyptian 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> (two samples for each) via a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours. The apparatus has a 5000 mL round flask, filled with 2000 mL distilled water. The oil layer was collected, water was removed using 0.5 g of anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and stored in a dark glass vial at 4 °C till further analysis. The yields of the extracted EOs were calculated via the equation: 100 × (V/W); where V: volume of extracted EO, W: weight of the plant material used in extraction. The chemical composition of the EO samples was analyzed separately by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the National Research Center, Giza, Egypt, as described in our previously documented work [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The device consists of TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific™ Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA) and Thermo Scientific ISQ™ EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC-MS system is equipped with a TR-5 MS column with dimensions of 30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter (i.d.), 0.25 µm film thickness. At a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, helium was used as carrier gas with a split ratio of 1:10. The temperature program was 60 °C for 1 min, rising by 4.0 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 240 °C and held for 1 min. A diluted sample in hexane (1 µL) at a ratio of 1:10 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was injected, and the injector and detector were held at 210 °C. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 40–450. The identification of the EO chemical components was performed via Automated Mass spectral Deconvolution and Identification (AMDIS) software, Wiley spectral library collection, NIST library database (Gaithersburg, MD, USA; Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA), retention indices relative to 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>22</sub>), or appraisal of the mass spectrum with authentic standards.
