<p>Low concentrations of aromatic compounds were identified, with a concentration of 7.00% and 3.82% from the Saudi and Egyptian samples, respectively. Seven aromatic compounds were characterized in EO of the Saudi sample, including myristicin (6.13%) as the main constituent and bolandiol (0.17%) as minor. The profile of the Egyptian plant revealed that myristicin (2.09%) and ethyl iso-allocholate (1.58%) were major components, while bolandiol (0.15%) was minor. From the previously described chemical profiles and the reported data, myristicin was found as a characteristic compound in 
 <italic>Calotropis</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Myristicin was found with a concentration of 26.4%, 28.1%, 27.9%, and 25.9% of the leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> collected from Egypt, respectively. Moreover, the leaves of Nigerian 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> were deduced to have myristicin as the main compound with 19.9% of the total mass [
