<p>Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5) of the docking compounds calculated on the SWISSADME predictor is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Most of the compounds used in this study do not violate the Ro5. However, hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin do not meet the Ro5.
