<p>Detailed interaction was evaluated to show the complexes were stabilized by many types of interaction (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The docking process on spike protein did not use a native ligand due to lack of data in the protein data bank. Therefore, we explained the potential based on the docking score only. A conventional hydrogen bond has the main role to stabilize the interaction in the complexes. The result indicated that amino acids involved in the interaction are commonly similar. They bind on the region between 140â€“180 to indicate the same binding site.
