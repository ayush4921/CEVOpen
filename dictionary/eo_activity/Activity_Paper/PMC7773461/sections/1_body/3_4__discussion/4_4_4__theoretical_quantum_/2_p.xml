<p>The global reactivity descriptors such as hardness (
 <italic>η</italic>), softness (
 <italic>S</italic>), chemical potential (
 <italic>µ</italic>), electronegativity (
 <italic>χ</italic>), and electrophilicity index (
 <italic>ω</italic>), which are calculated from HOMO and LUMO energies, were obtained by the level of theory DFT/B3LYP/6-31G and incorporated in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Using Koopmans' theorem [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], IA and EA values can be correlated with the frontier orbitals by the relation IA = −E
 <sub>HOMO</sub> and EA = −E
 <sub>LUMO</sub>. Reactivity descriptors such as global hardness and global softness (
 <italic>S</italic>) are defined as 
 <italic>η</italic> = (IA–EA)/2 and 
 <italic>S</italic> = 1/
 <italic>η</italic>, chemical potential is described as 
 <italic>µ</italic> = −
 <italic>χ</italic>, the absolute electronegativity (
 <italic>χ</italic>) is given by the relation 
 <italic>χ</italic> = (IA + EA)/2, the electrophilicity (
 <italic>ω</italic>) can be calculated using the electronic chemical potential, and the chemical hardness is described as 
 <italic>ω</italic> = 
 <italic>µ</italic>
