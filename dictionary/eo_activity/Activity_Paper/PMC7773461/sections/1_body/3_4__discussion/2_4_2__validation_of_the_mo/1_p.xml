<p>To validate the results, M
 <sup>pro</sup> was redocked. This redocking's binding site area was 
 <italic>x</italic>: 7.808, 
 <italic>y</italic>: 18.739, and 
 <italic>z</italic>: 65.479 with a center grid box 24 × 24 × 24. The parameter of the validation method is RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation). RMSD showed the degree of deviation from experimental ligand docking results to the crystallographic ligand at the same binding site. The higher the RMSD value, the greater the deviation, which indicates the higher prediction error of ligand-protein interactions [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Conversely, the smaller RMSD value obtained shows better conformation because the redocking ligand position is closer to the ligand position resulting from the crystallography [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The result indicated that the RMSD value obtained from the native ligand with the M
 <sup>pro</sup> receptor was 1.281 Å, so it can be said that the method used for docking in this study is valid and can be used against tested ligands with the same binding site area. In addition to generating data in the form of RMSD values, in the validation stage, data were also obtained in the form of binding affinity values between ligands and receptors of −7.5 kcal/mol. There were also types of bonds that were formed between the native ligand and amino acid residues in proteins, such as hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond, and van der Waals interactions.
