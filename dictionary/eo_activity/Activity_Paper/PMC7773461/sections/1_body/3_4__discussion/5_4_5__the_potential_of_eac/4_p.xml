<p>The docking results using rhoifolin as a ligand were −9.5 and −8.2 for S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup>, respectively. Rhoifolin is a flavone that was first discovered in the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Rhus succedanea</italic> in 1952 [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Besides, this compound was also found in 
 <italic>Citrus grandis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. The result of rhoifolin docking on S protein was −9.5 and M
 <sup>pro</sup> was −8.2. The rhoifolin binding score for SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> shows a value of −9.565 [
