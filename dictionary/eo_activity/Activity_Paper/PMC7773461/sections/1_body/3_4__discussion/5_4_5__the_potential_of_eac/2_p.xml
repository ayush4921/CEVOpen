<p>The major flavanone glycoside in the citrus peel is hesperidin [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Docking scores of this compound with S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup> were −10.4 and −8.3, respectively. Utomo et al. [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] have docked hesperidin against S protein (−9.6) and M
 <sup>pro</sup> (−13.51). Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] revealed that the best hesperidin position against SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) was −10.1. Adem et al. [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] found that the ability of hesperidin was better than that of nelfinavir. Based on this finding, it can be seen that hesperidin has great potential to be a candidate for drugs, but its low oral bioavailability is a problem.
