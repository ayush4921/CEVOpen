<p>Spike protein is considered a potential receptor target for discovering new types of drugs [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Spike proteins, both in the form of closed state (6VXX) and open state (6VYB), have amino acid residual bonds in the form of van der Waal's interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. Hydrogen bonds occur in each ligand that binds to the S protein receptor. The hydrogen bonds are in the amino acid residues Asn-B: 1023, Ser-A: 1030, Thr-A: 1027, Gln-A: 762, Lys-A: 176, Ser-B: 1030, Arg-C: 1039, Asn-C: 1023, Gln-A: 762, and Lys-A: 776. Hydrophobic interactions avoid a liquid environment and tend to cluster in proteins' inner globular structure [

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This study shows that each ligand has hydrophobic interactions that can support receptor inhibition. As for the van der Waals bond, it contributes to the ligand to inhibit the target receptor because of the large number even though the strength of this interaction is not as strong as that of the hydrogen bond. Van der Waals bonds are relatively weak electric attractions due to induced or permanent polarity of molecules [
