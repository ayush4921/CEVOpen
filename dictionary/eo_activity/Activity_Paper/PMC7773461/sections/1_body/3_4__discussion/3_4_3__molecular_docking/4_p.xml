<p>The glycoprotein spike (S protein) receptor does not have a target structure equipped with an inhibitor in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) because this receptor is a receptor that binds to the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2). The inhibition does not target the S protein receptor. Still, it occurs on the surface between the two receptors (S protein and hACE2), so that the binding site area is no longer on the spike glycoprotein receptors but between the two receptors [
