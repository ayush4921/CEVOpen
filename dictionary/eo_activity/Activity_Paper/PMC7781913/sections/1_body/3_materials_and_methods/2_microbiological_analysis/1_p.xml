<p>Total aerobic counts and yeasts and molds of raw danshen and HHP-treated danshen were investigated. Each sample (20 g) was placed in a sterile filter bag with 60 ml 0.1 % buffered peptone water and stomached for 2 min using a stomacher (MIX 2, AES Laboratories, Combourg, France). Samples were serially diluted using saline solution; 1-ml samples of the diluted solution were then plated onto triplicate plates of nutrient agar for total aerobic counts and onto potato dextrose agar (acidified to pH 3.5 with 10% tartaric acid) for yeasts and molds. Total aerobic counts of colonies were counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h. Colonies of yeast and molds were counted after incubation at 25°C for 3 d.</p>
