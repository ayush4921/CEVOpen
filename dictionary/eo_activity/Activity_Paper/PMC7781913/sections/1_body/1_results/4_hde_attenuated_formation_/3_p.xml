<p>To investigate the anti-atherogenic effects of HDE in the aorta, we isolated whole aortas of the 
 <italic>ApoE</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice and detected aortic atherosclerotic lesions stained with Oil Red O. Supplementation with HDE (15.3%) reduced atherosclerotic plaque burden by about 10% in the total aortas compared with HCD-fed control group (26.9%) (
