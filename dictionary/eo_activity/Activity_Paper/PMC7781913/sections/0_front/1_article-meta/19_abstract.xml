 <p>Danshen (
  <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>) is a traditional medicinal plant widely used in Asian countries for its pharmacological activities (e.g., amelioration of cardiovascular diseases). In this study, we investigated the anti-atherosclerotic activity of raw danshen root extract prepared using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at 550 MPa for 5 min and hot water extraction. This method was useful for elimination of bacteria from cultured danshen plants and for better extraction yield of active principles. The HHP-treated danshen extract (HDE) inhibited proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and induced autophagy that was assessed by LC3 conversion and p62 degradation. HDE suppressed foam cell formation in oxLDL-induced RAW264.7 macrophages; lysosomal activity simultaneously increased, measured by acridine orange staining. HDE also reduced atherosclerotic plaque development
