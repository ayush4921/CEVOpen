<p>In humans and mammals, alcohol dehydrogenase oxidation system, which includes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and micro ethanol oxidation system (MEOS) are two main pathways for liver metabolism of ethanol. About 8%-10% of ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by microsomal ethanol oxidase (EO) and about 90% by ADH [

 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O through the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Accordingly, ALDH and ADH are the two most important enzymes in the whole process of ethanol metabolism in the liver. Relevant study shows that acute or chronic ethanol consumption can significantly inhibit the activities of ALDH and ADH [

The microsomal ethanol oxidation system (MEOS) in hepatocytes requires the participation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphoric acid (NADPH) to metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde. Alcoholism increases the amount of acetaldehyde and consumes more liver P450 enzymes, resulting in insufficient supply of P450 enzymes in the body, and the liver's ability to metabolize alcohol is reduced, resulting in the damage of liver cells by alcohol [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the metabolism of MEOS can be reflected indirectly by observing the activity of P450. This study showed that ADH, ALDH, and P450 activities were significantly inhibited in acute alcoholism model mice. The CTR can increase the activities of ADH and ALDH, accelerate the oxidative metabolism of ethanol and acetaldehyde in vivo, and reduce the toxicity of acetaldehyde; moreover, it can significantly increase the P450 activity, activate the MEOS, and accelerate the metabolism of ethanol. In addition, CTR has a better effect on alcohol metabolism than RU-21. The ethanol concentration curve after alcohol intake also confirmed the above viewpoints.
