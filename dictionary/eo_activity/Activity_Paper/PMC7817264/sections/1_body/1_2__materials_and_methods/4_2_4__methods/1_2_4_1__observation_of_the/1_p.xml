<p>The 120 SPF Kunming mice were fed for one week in the mouse feeding room of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Then, the mice were randomized into control group, model group, RU-21 group, and CTR group (compound turmeric recipe group), with 30 mice in each group. Before the experiment, the mice were fasted for 12 hours, but they were allowed to drink freely. The RU-21 group and CTR group were administered with RU-21 (12.33 g/kg) and water extracts of compound turmeric recipe (55.48 g/kg), respectively. The control group and model group were given the same volume of normal saline. Half an hour later, except for the control group, all groups were administered with 14 ml/kg ethanol in order to establish the mice models of acute alcoholism, and the control group was replaced by the isometric normal saline. Then, we observed the following items: alcohol tolerance time, time for soberness, 24 h survival rate of mice, and drunkenness.</p>
