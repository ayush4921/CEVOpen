<p id="Par32">First, it is unclear what standards inspectors use to declare that the inspected sites were generally GCP compliant in spite of major/critical ERFs. 
 <italic>Major/critical</italic> issues are defined as “conditions, practices or processes that 
 <italic>might adversely/adversely</italic> affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects and/or the quality and integrity of data” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. If major/critical ERFs at the very least have the possibility of affecting the rights, safety, or well-being of the subjects, how were these weighed and factored in the conclusion that the sites were generally GCP compliant? At the time of writing, we know of no EMA document that speaks about this process. Thus, there is a need for a transparent structure on grading standards as well as guidelines on the place of minor/major/critical findings in application decision-making.
