<p id="Par14">In a previous publication, we identified the types of ethical issues that pharmaceutical regulators encounter post-marketing through inspection reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this publication, we discovered that based on 2008–2012 inspection reports comprising of 112 medicinal products and 288 clinical trial sites, inspectors frequently and regularly encounter ethically relevant findings (ERFs). Specifically, "At least major ERFs were present in almost all medicinal products with ERFs. The categories with the highest number of ERFs were protocol issues, patient safety, and professionalism issues." Also, "on average, there were 7.54 major and 2.95 critical ERFs per medicinal product application, although ERFs can increase to 30 major and 12 critical" [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For more information on what inspectors consider as major and critical ERFs, the reader is directed to consult our article entitled, “Ethics in clinical trial regulation: ethically relevant issues from EMA inspection reports” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Though it is fair to assume that at least some of the ERFs that “directly influence the benefit-risk balance” of an investigational medicinal product submitted for marketing authorization application would be carried over to the succeeding regulatory deliberation processes, we cannot make the same assumption about GCP inspection findings that do “not directly influence the benefit-risk balance.” The latter remains unknown and, as such, we know very little about the manner that “clinical assessors, rapporteurs and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)” fulfill this obligation of “assessing the ethics of a clinical development programme.” To respond to this need, it is the goal of this article to look into the manner and extent that ethical issues that do not affect benefit-risk balanced and were discovered during inspection have reached the deliberation processes, i.e., how “major ethical flaws” have impacted “the final conclusions about (the) approvability of an application.”
