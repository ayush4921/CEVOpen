<p>On the other hand, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, none of the three remedies, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO, or sesame oil (SO) alone, showed a significant effect on the biomass formation of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms. However, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, when treated with SO, KPE-SO and CDE-SO there was a significant reduction in the metabolic activity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms as compared to biofilms grown without treatment (UT), an effect not observed with OTE-SO. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the KPE-SO and CDE-SO remedies compared to SO alone, indicating that the plant components of the remedies had no further effect on reducing metabolic activity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms, as compared with sesame oil alone.
