<p>As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, for both pathogens, sesame oil and the three plant-based formulations were observed to inhibit planktonic growth compared to the untreated culture (grown in LB). 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> untreated planktonic cultures showed a doubling time of 29.3 ± 4.0 min (mean ± standard deviation). 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> planktonic cultures treated with CDE-SO and OTE-SO showed inhibited growth as compared with untreated cultures (doubling times 65.4 ± 16.5 min and 113.5 ± 28.0 min respectively); SO and KPE-SO treated cultures showed almost no growth. A similar trend was seen for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Untreated planktonic 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultures showed a doubling time of 40.8 ± 1.7 min. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> planktonic growth was inhibited in the presence of the plant-based formulations, with KPE-SO and sesame oil treated cultures showing no growth at all. As stated previously, observations that planktonic cultures treated with SO show a greater inhibitory effect, as compared to CDE-SO and OTE-SO, could be attributed to select nutrients provided by the plant-based ingredients or antagonistic interactions between components; effects that could be explored further. Interestingly, comparison of biofilm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and planktonic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) growth states reveals that the plant-based reemdies had differential effects on these two modes of growth. For example, treatment with CDE-SO and OTE-SO showed greater inhibition of total biomass formation in comparison with SO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), however under planktonic conditions, SO was more inhibitory (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). CDE-SO also resulted in reduced metabolic activity during biofilm formation as compared with SO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). For 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while SO and the plant-based formulations inhibited planktonic growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), they had no significant effects (as compared with UT) on total biomass during biofilm formation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>); an inhibitory effect on metabolic activity was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).
