<p>Infections in chronic, non-healing wounds are most commonly caused by bacterial pathogens 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Serra et al., 2015</xref>). We, therefore, evaluated the anti-biofilm effects of the traditional remedies on these two pathogens. The anti-biofilm potential of reconstituted traditional remedies was tested under 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions with microtiter-plate based biofilm assays (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kragh et al., 2019</xref>). A mainstay of biofilm studies, these assays are widely-used, rapid, accessible, affordable, relatively easy to perform, and use commonly available materials. Further, a set of minimum information guidelines have been recently published for these assays (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Allkja et al., 2020</xref>). We evaluated the effects of the remedies on both biofilm formation, and eradication of pre-formed biofilms. We measured total biomass using the crystal violet assay (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kaushik et al., 2016</xref>), and metabolic activity of the biofilms using a colorimetric assay with the tetrazolium dye “XTT” (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kaushik et al., 2016</xref>). Based on previously published guidelines (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Allkja et al., 2020</xref>), we have stated our experimental designs and protocols providing details of strains, reagent volumes, and types of microplates. All assays were done with at least two biological replicates (each with three technical replicates) for each strain and for the medicinal formulations. The data was plotted as box and whisker plots. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. Data was checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. A one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison was performed to test for significance. A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. The effects of the remedies were expressed as a percentage reduction compared to the untreated and reported as a range.
