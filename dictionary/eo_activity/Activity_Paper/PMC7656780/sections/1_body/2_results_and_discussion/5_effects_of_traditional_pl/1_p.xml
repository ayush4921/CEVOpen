<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, treatment with SO, KPE-SO and CDE-SO were seen to reduce the viable cell mass of pre-formed 24-h 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms quantified as 35–56%, 52–68% and 45–64% reduction respectively (as compared with UT). Of the three remedies, only KPE-SO showed an increased reduction in viable cells as compared with SO alone. Infact, OTE-SO treatment was observed to show a marginal increase in cell viability (as compared with SO), an effect that could possibly be attributed to select nutrients provided by the plant-based ingredients or antagonistic interactions between components. When pre-formed 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms were treated with SO, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO for 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), a significant reduction in the viability of biofilms (as compared with UT) was seen with SO (66–87%) and KPE-SO (19–68%), and a lesser effect was observed with CDE-SO and OTE-SO (13–35% and 17–27% reduction respectively). However, when compared with SO alone, treatment with all three plant-based remedies (in sesame oil) for 24 h showed higher cell viability in biofilms, possibly indicating interactions between plant-based components and sesame oil.
