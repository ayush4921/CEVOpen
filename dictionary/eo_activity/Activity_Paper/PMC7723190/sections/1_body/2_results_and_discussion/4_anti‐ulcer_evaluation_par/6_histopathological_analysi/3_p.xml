<p>The results of the present investigation are in line with the earlier findings of Ortaç et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) who studied the anti‐ulcer genic effect of okra on ethanol‐induced acute gastric mucosal lesions in Wistar rats. Groups used in study were; okra 100, 250, 500 mg/kg, famotidine 20 mg/kg, quercetin 75 mg/kg and ethanol group. Okra 250, 500, and Fam 20 group showed decreased apoptosis, inflammatory changes, erosions, ulceration, and increased cell proliferation than the ethanol group. The nearly normal mucosal view was seen in okra 250 and 500 groups and effects were even comparable with the famotidine reference drug. Tissues from okra 100 exhibited little epithelial ulceration, hemorrhage, and edema (Ortaç et al.,

Quercetin‐3‐O‐β‐D‐glucuronopyranoside attenuated indomethacin gastric mucosal damage due to increased gastric mucus secretion, decreased free radicals production due to activated neutrophils via ICAM‐1 and pro‐inflammatory cytokine down regulation (Gopalakrishnan et al.,
