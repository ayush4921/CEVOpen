<p>Okra extract at the dosage of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) decreased the ulcer scoring than the aspirin‐treated group as presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The highest ulcer score (2.29 ± 0.02) was observed in aspirin administrated rats G2 group, while the lowest ulcer score was observed in the control group G1 (0.03 ± 0.01). Okra extract at the dose of 500 mg/Kg of b.w showed better reduction (0.50 ± 0.06) in ulcer scores than 250 mg/Kg of b.w (1.62 ± 0.04). An increase in ulcer area (8.9 ± 1.2 mm
 <sup>2</sup>) was observed in the aspirin administrated group G2 than the control group G1 (0.01 ± 0.005 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). Omeprazole‐treated group G3 (1.2 ± 1.72 mm
 <sup>2</sup>) had the lowest ulcer area than others. Higher concentration of okra extract, 500 mg/Kg of b.w resulted in more reduction in ulcer area (2.95 ± 1.55 mm
 <sup>2</sup>) as compared to a lower dose of okra extract as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Anti‐ulcer drug omeprazole significantly (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05) decreased the ulcer index (5.61 ±
 <bold> </bold>0.58) followed by group G5 (7.15 ± 0.36) received okra extract dose 500 mg/Kg of b.w (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). An earlier study reported that the anti‐ulcer activity of methanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Neolamarckia cadamba</italic> bark and leaves in aspirin and pylorus ligation ulcer models. In both models, the common parameter determined was the ulcer index. Both extracts demonstrated the anti‐ulcerogenic activities by a reduction in ulcer index, which might be due to its antisecretory activity (Babu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In another study, Ortaç et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) reported that the okra extract 500 mg/kg of b.w resulted in a maximum reduction in ulcer index (5.26 ± 2.4) and it was even less than the reference drug famotidine (6.57 ± 2.7). Polyphenols and flavonoids like quercetin are important contributors to the gastroprotective action of okra (Gemede et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The earlier investigation demonstrated that quercetin can protect DNA damage due to gastric mucosa cells infected by 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> (Klupinska et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Ethanol‐induced gastric lesions are significantly inhibited by quercetin treatment (Abourehab et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Gastric mucus content is increased by pretreatment with okra paste (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Quercetin can regulate immune cells’ invasion and can control the local immune response at the injury site and promoted wound healing by the modulation of TGF‐β1 and VEGF in the rat wounding model (Gopalakrishnan et al.,
