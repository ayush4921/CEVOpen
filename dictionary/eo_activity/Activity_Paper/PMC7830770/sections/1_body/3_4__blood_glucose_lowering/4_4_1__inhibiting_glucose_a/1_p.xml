<p>Polysaccharides could attenuate diabetes by the mechanisms of gastrointestinal viscosity, inhibiting glucose absorption efficacy and postprandial glycaemia. The water-soluble dietary fibers and polysaccharides increase the viscosity of gastrointestinal content, thereby decreasing the gastric emptying rate and delaying food digestion and absorption of carbohydrates [
