<p>Triterpenoid ganoderol B identified in the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> showed greater inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase than acarbose [
 <xref rid="B81-jof-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] due to the presence of hydroxyl groups at C-3 and at C-25 and a double bond in the side chain which are responsible for the high activity of this compound [

 <italic>G. lingzhi</italic> fruiting bodies at various stages of development showed stronger inhibitory effects against α-glycosidase than the standard inhibitor used [
