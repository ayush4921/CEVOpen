<p id="Par41">Applied ultrafiltration leads to successful pyrogens removal from extracts what was confirmed both by LAL test and in primary neutrophils in vitro culture. The origin of LPS from bacteria growth in aqueous extracts during the time following the extraction process was excluded by immediate freezing and freeze-drying. What is more, similar experiments were conducted for 70% ethanolic extracts, which results were similar to those obtained for aqueous ones.</p>
