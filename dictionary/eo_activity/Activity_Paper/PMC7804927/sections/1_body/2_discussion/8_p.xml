<p id="Par44">None of the tested extracts, both before and after filtration, showed cytotoxic activity on neutrophils. Before the ultrafiltration, for all extracts, the percentage of viable cells was very high and comparable with LPS control what additionally confirms the presence of pyrogens which are known to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis

 </sup>. Besides, the prevention of apoptosis increased together with the concentration of extracts. After the elimination of endotoxins in the ultrafiltration process, the number of viable cells decreased and reached the level of non-stimulated control.
