 </sup>, thus to exclude their contribution to observed neutrophil stimulation, subsequent filtration steps were introduced, to determine what is the size of particles/molecules which induce cells' inflammatory response. The applied filters in the range 450–100 nm did not remove the stimulating agent, only ultrafiltration using 30 kDa membrane resulted in its complete removal, also when LPS was added to the extract as the internal control. The pyrogenic agent elimination by ultrafiltration was also confirmed using the LAL test, which excluded the potential interference of nanoparticles in the applied method for pyrogens monitoring
