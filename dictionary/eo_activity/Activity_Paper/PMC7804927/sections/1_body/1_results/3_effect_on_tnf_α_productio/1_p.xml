<p id="Par25">Extracts 
 <bold>1n</bold> and 
 <bold>4n</bold>–
 <bold>8n</bold> at 6.25–12.5 µg/mL showed stronger TNF-α production than the non-stimulated control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Additionally, at 25–50 µg/mL, the cytokine production increased to the level close to stimulated control ((76.9 ± 5.4 and 91.2 ± 6.0% for 
 <bold>1n</bold>) or below (28.3 ± 5.7 and 45.2 ± 6.8%; 58.4 ± 6.5 and 80.4 ± 7.6%; 67.2 ± 4.4 and 76.9 ± 9.3%; 51.9 ± 4.8 and 60.3 ± 8.2%; 26 ± 1.7 and 53.6 ± 7.8%; 27.1 ± 6.1 and 50.0 ± 7.0% for 
 <bold>2n</bold>, 
 <bold>4n–8n</bold> respectively). The lowest TNF-α production was observed for 
 <bold>2n</bold> (at 6.25 μg/mL), 
 <bold>3n</bold> (at 6.25–25 μg/mL), 
 <bold>9n</bold> (at 6.25–50 μg/mL) and was comparable to non-stimulated control. In most cases except 
 <bold>9n</bold>, the induction of TNF-α production depended on the concentration of the extracts. For roscovitine and urolithin A results did not differ significantly from the non-stimulated control.
