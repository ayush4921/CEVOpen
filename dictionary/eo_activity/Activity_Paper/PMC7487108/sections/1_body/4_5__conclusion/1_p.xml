<p>Our results indicate that nipa palm vinegar may delay the digestion of a high-fat diet and absorption through small intestine through mechanisms such as the inhibition of pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase activities as well as through the inhibition of solubility of cholesterol micelles. These results indicate that NPV could be used as a natural source of bioactive compounds with antilipidemic activity. Nevertheless, NPV should be extensively evaluated by animal and clinical human studies.</p>
