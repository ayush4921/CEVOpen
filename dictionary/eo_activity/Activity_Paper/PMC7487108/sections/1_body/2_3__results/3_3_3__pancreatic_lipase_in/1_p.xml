<p>The inhibitory activity of nipa palm vinegar against pancreatic lipase is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The nipa palm vinegar inhibited pancreatic lipase activity by 9.55, 12.51, 19.65, 28.14, 50.53, and 60.22% at concentrations of 3.13, 6.25, 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, and 100.00 
 <italic>µ</italic>L/mL, respectively. The nipa palm vinegar had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 69.95 
 <italic>µ</italic>L/mL. Orlistat served as a pancreatic lipase inhibitor control, and a concentration of 2 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL reduced activity by 53.67%. These results show that the NPV showed a lipase inhibiting activity.
