<p>The nipa palm vinegar inhibited cholesterol esterase by 8.78, 16.33, 19.48, 23.02, 26.22, and 36.66% at concentrations of 3.13, 6.25, 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, and 100.00 
 <italic>µ</italic>L/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Simvastatin at a concentration of 300 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL was used as a positive control which inhibited cholesterol esterase by 41.66%. These findings show that the NPV has the ability to inhibit cholesterol esterase in a dose-dependent manner.
