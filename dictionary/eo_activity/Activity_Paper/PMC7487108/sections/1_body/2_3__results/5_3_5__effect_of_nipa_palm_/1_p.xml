<p>The inhibition of cholesterol micellization by NPV at various concentrations is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The NPV suppressed cholesterol micellization by 13.46, 19.23, 25.00, 38.46, and 46.15% at concentrations of 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, 100.00, and 200.00 
 <italic>µ</italic>L/mL, respectively. Gallic acid at a concentration of 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL was used as a positive control which inhibited cholesterol micellization by 84.62%. These results show that the NPV can inhibit the formation of cholesterol micellization in a dose-dependent manner.
