<p>There are several reports demonstrating anti-dyslipidemia activity of natural compounds. Gallic acid has been reported to decrease levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein in high-fat induced dyslipidemia in rats [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and it also reduced serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in a rabbit model of high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, isoquercetin, a glucoside derivative of quercetin, improved hepatic lipid accumulation through activating the AMPK pathway and inhibiting TGF-

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A previous study showed that green tea catechin suppressed cholesterol absorption in the small intestine and reduced serum cholesterol concentrations [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Other studies have also demonstrated the antiobesity effects of rutin by decreasing serum lipid profiles and leptin [
