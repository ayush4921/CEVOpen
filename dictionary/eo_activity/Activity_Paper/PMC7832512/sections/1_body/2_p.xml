<p>The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>L. mollis</italic> is 152,311 bp in length, containing a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 20,068 bp, a large single copy region of 93,258 bp, and a small single copy region of 18,917 bp. The chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>L. mollis</italic> contains 130 unique genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes (4 rRNA species). Among these genes, 94 of them exist as single copy, but 4 protein-coding genes (i.e. ndhB, rps7, ycf12, and ycf68), 6 tRNA genes (i.e. trnA-UGC, trnI-GAU, trnL-CAA, trnN-GUU, trnR-ACG, trnV-GAC), and 4 rRNA genes (i.e. 4.5S, 5S, 16S and 23S rRNA) present in double copies. In general, the overall GC content of the whole chloroplast genome is 39.2%, whereas the corresponding values of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions are 37.95%, 33.95%, and 44.40%, respectively.
