<p>The first-line antimalarial treatment for uncomplicated 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria worldwide comprises the artemisinins, which are a fast-acting class of antimalarials [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] combined with a partner antimalarial drug such as lumefantrine and referred to as artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therapeutic doses of antimalarial drugs are formulated to ensure complete clearance of all infecting malaria parasites; however, drug-resistant parasites or drug-tolerant parasites have evolved that thrive under drug pressure [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites resistant to the artemisinin class of antimalarial drugs were initially reported in Cambodia [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and have also been identified in Africa [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These artemisinin-resistant parasites are known to produce more gametocytes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and consequently enhance malaria transmission.
