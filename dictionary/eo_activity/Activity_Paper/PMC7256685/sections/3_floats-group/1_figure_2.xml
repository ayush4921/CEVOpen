  <p>Relative prevalence of early-stage (ES) gametocytes on 7 days. A graphical representation of the total number of early-stage (ES) gametocytes (stage II) identified in each culture after 7 days of continuous exposure to herbal extracts. A total number of 5000 RBCs were counted in each thin smear, and the number of gametocytes counted was expressed as a percent of the number of gametocytes identified in the control untreated culture. The data represents the mean (SEM) number of gametocytes observed. No gametocytes were observed in the artesunate-treated cultures on Day 7.</p>
