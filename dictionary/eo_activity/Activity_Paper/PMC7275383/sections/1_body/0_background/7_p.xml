<p id="Par11">It has been proposed that the richness of birds is directly related to the amount of rainfall in a region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but it is now also recognized that birds can be a diverse group in arid areas in correlation with the degree of environmental heterogeneity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For instance, in the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve (TCBR), bird fauna diversity is as high as that of areas dominated by tropical deciduous forests, and greater than that of other important arid areas of North America, even though the region has a smaller area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such state of diversity is related with the high diversity of other biological groups and because of the ecosystem heterogeneity existing in that region [
