<p>Based on the pharmaceutical instructions in which the properties of ethnic medicine were claimed, the clinical indications of DPMs and YPMs were surveyed and recorded, and 28 DPMs and 73 YPMs that could be approved for clinical use in China following the drug regulatory laws were identified. Fourteen DPMs such as Biao Re Qing Granule, Guan Tong Shu Oral liquid, and Hui Xue Sheng Capsule that have already been approved as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs accounted for 50% of the DPMs. The YPMs included 24 prescriptions such as Bai Bei Yi Fei Capsule, Chang Shu Zhi Xie Capsule, and Dan E Fu Kang Ointment, which have been approved as OTC drugs and account for 32.8% of the total YPMs. The information about these patent medicines is recorded in Tables
