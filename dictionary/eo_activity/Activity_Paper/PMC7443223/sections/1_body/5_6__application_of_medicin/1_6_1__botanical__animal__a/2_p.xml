<p>Animals are therapeutic arsenals with a significant role in healing. Zootherapy are derived from products of metabolism (e.g., corporal secretions and excrements) or from nonanimal materials such as nests or cocoons [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The reasonableness of zootherapy cannot be denied, and evidence supporting their use should be strengthened by modern scientific research. The animal sources of medicines in DPMs and YPMs are listed in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The use of some animal products in DPMs and YPMs is controversial, e.g., 
 <italic>Cordyceps sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Moschus</italic> deer musk, and bear bile, because these medicinal materials originate from protected wild animals or by harvesting activities that harm the ecological environment. Nevertheless, the production and use of such animal sources of medicines are restricted in China. China has joined and complied with many conventions on biological protection such as CITES (
 <italic>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</italic>) and the 
 <italic>Convention on Biological Diversity</italic> and has implemented domestic animal protection regulations. However, the medicinal value of these and other animal sources of medicines cannot be ignored. Fortunately, substitutes are available because of the cultivation of 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> and industrial production of artificial musk [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Bile can be obtained from living, farmed bears but is ethically controversial [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Artificial bear bile has been reported to be effective on anticonvulsion, sedative, and choleretic [
