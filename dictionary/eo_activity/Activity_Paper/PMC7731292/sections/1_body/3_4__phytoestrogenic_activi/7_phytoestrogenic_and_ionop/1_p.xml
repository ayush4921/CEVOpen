<p>The ionoforic effects of ferutinin on platelets are in contrast to the other calcium ionophores; indeed, the standard ionophores produce a collapse of membrane ionic gradient in different cellular compartments, due to the calcium ions release from mitochondria, whereas ferutinin acts similar to an electrogenic uniporter and induces increased concentrations of cytosolic calcium, through the calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum, and a subsequent accumulation in mitochondria [
