<p>Gao et al. (2013) showed that ferutinin, in a dose-dependent way and, particularly, at high concentrations (40 Î¼M or above), was able to induce apoptosis in human red blood cells (RBCs), without the involvement of mitochondria since these cells lose those organells during the maturation process. The erythroptosis is mediated by simultaneous increase of the cytosolic free calcium ions level and the activity of caspase-3. In addition, the external calcium depletion had not blocked the apoptosis mediated by ferutinin, suggesting that the existence of unknown mediators of apoptosis are ferutinin-induced, which could be added to the ionophoric activity [
