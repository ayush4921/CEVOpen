<p>The oxidative-stress reduction leads to a decreased risk of onset of several pathologies, such as cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; the stress oxidative reduction is due to their aromatic rings that contains hydroxyl groups and the antioxidant capacity depends on the number of these groups [
