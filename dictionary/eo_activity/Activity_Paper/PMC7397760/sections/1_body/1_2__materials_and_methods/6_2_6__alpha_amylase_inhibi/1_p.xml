<p>The EtOAc fraction of crude extracts was evaluated for their alpha-amylase inhibitory activities. The assay was performed according to the published protocol by Wickramarthne et al. with in-house modifications [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. pH 7.0, 100 mM phosphate buffer solution was used as the reaction medium. The amylase stock solution with a concentration of 2,500 units/mL was prepared by dissolving 25 mg (1,000 unit/mg) of porcine pancreas alpha-amylase in 10 ml of phosphate buffer using the vortex mixer followed by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm. The plant extracts were dissolved in DMSO with the concentration of 5 mg/mL. Then, supernatant was separated and stored in reduced temperature. Initially, 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the enzyme and 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L plant extracts were mixed, and final volume of the reaction mixture was made up to 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L using phosphate buffer. Then, the mixture was preincubated for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 1% of starch was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the reaction was terminated by addition of 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DNS to the mixture. Then, it was kept in a boiling water bath for 8 minutes and allowed to cool in a water bath. Absorbance was taken at 540 nm (SpectraMax Plus384, Molecular Devices, USA) after proper dilution with distilled water. Control experiments were conducted in an identical way, replacing the extract with 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DMSO as the negative control and 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L acarbose (10 mg/mL) as the positive control. For sample blank incubations (to allow for absorbance produced by the extract), the enzyme solutions were replaced with buffer, and the same procedure was carried out.
