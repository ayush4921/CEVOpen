<p>According to the disc-diffusion and bioautographic data of this study, most of the active compounds are in the nonpolar region. This is because bryophytes are lower plants, and they do not have special mechanism to preserve water. Hence, they produce different types of oil- and fat-based compounds in order to avoid loss of water, and most of the secondary metabolites of lower plants are lipophilic. The bioautographic analysis revealed the distribution of antimicrobial compounds. Normally, the bioautogram of higher plants is very complex and consists of several active compounds. However, the number of active compounds of the bryophytes used this study is limited to maximum 3. Therefore, isolation of antimicrobial compounds from these plants is quite easy compared to the higher plants. Furthermore, bioautography is a very valuable and time-saving method for bioassay-guided isolation of antimicrobial active compounds.</p>
