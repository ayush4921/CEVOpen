<p>The bioautographic analysis of the antimicrobial active extracts against 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The clear zone indicates the respective TLC band which has antimicrobial potential. All extracts showed a simple bioautographic pattern with less than 3 active bands. Most of active compounds are between nonpolar to medium polar. Therefore, the respective active compounds can be easily separated via normal phase silica column chromatography since the polar normal phase has more selectivity towards nonpolar and medium polar compounds.
