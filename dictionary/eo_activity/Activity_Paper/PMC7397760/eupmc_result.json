    "Medicinal plants have been the main focus of natural product research. However, recent research has revealed that lower plants including bryophytes are also a major resource of biologically active compounds with novel structures. Sri Lanka is considered as a biodiversity hotspot with a higher degree of endemism flora including bryophytes. In this study, different species of bryophytes were investigated for their antimicrobial and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities. The air-dried plant materials of 6 different bryophyte species, <i>Marchantia</i> sp., <i>Fissidens</i> sp., <i>Plagiochila</i> sp., <i>Sematophyllum demissum</i>, <i>Hypnum cupressiforme</i>, and <i>Calymperes motley</i>, were subjected to sequential cold extraction with 3 different organic solvents. All three types of organic crude extracts were subjected to screening of antimicrobial bioassays using the disc-diffusion method against 3 bacterial strains and 1 fungal strain. According to the results obtained, 6 extracts out of 18 showed antibacterial activity for tested Gram-positive bacteria and 1 active against Gram-negative bacteria. Two extracts showed activity against the pathogenic fungus strain. Extracts from some plants were active against tested bacterial as well as fungal species. TLC-based bioautographic study was carried out to identify the corresponding active bands which is useful for active compound isolation. Furthermore, the ethyl acetate extracts were subjected to evaluate alpha-amylase inhibitory activity where three extracts out of six extracts showed moderate inhibitory activity for alpha-amylase with IC50 ranging 8-30%."
