 <p id="Par1">The transplantation of tissues can save lives and re-establish vital functions, where no alternatives of comparable effectiveness exist. This has led to establishment of tissue transplantation as a successful practice worldwide; however, a great variability between countries remains in terms of donation levels, safety, quality of grafts and their efficacy. Tissue transplantation requires coordination of different agencies involved in the implementation of procurement, processing, storage and distribution of tissues and cells from different hospital units that perform surgical procedures with graft-type input requirements. This biomaterial-like requirement has led to the constant development of the area and today these graft products of human origin can be the starting point for new and more advanced biotechnological products. For long-term sustainability and successful transplantation units, a process management comparable to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of quality management systems must be established to produce safe and high-quality human-derived products. This review aims to update the current concepts of tissue transplant services for its application for developing countries using the current Chilean scenario as a case study. We summarize our findings proposing a set of guidelines/actions that should be followed to ensure smooth tissue transplant services implementations with high efficiency and safe use.</p>
