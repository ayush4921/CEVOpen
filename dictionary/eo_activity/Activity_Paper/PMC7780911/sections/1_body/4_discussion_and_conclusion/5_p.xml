<p id="Par43">After reviewing the last years of a developing country case study example, such as Chile with its tissue transplants services implementation and taking into account the standards of tissue services from several developed countries from the EU, we propose a summary of concepts that developing nations should address in order to implement sustainable tissue services:

   <p id="Par44">Update and/or establish detailed regulatory framework, both global and local norms and laws for comparisons and buildout strategies, the WHO guidelines could be considered the backbone of them. The relationship and effective communication between clinicians and health authorities is vital. In case of aiming to develop more advanced processing techniques, it is also required to examine developed countries advanced therapies medicinal products regulatory agenda for more technically complex novel tissue or cell grafts preparations, such as decellularization process leading to extracellular matrix scaffolds, cardiovascular tissues storage by liquid nitrogen, and stem cell transplantation and cellular therapy, among others.</p>

   <p id="Par45">Be involved with international associations that intend to promote tissue transplantation worldwide, either directly through regional associations (e.g. American Association of Tissue Banks, Asia–Pacific Association of Surgical Tissue Banking and Latin American Association of Tissue Bank, among others), or indirectly, such as the EATCB, the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare and the ICH. This should ensure knowledge crucial for professional’s certification for implementing high standards safety and quality processes and for acquiring novel skills for cell and tissue human-derived product development.</p>

   <p id="Par46">Creation of inter-sectorial alliances for mutual goal endeavours in the healthcare services. The communication flow is encouraged between main parties (i.e. clinicians, tissue establishments and health authorities) under a life-cycle management comprising alliance to face the implementation of state-of-the-art knowledge exchange. Additionally, new biotechnologies that can facilitate novel tissue-associated product and services are needed, and the health sector must be involved with academic and research institutions that can employ tissues for research, development and innovation. This will ensure smooth knowledge transfer and generate new value for patients.</p>

   <p id="Par47">Regularly assess tissue transplant-activity related data to ensure appropriate actions are taken. With more complete set of data better benefit-risk ratio can be obtained. By analysing epidemiology, demand and clinical outcome data of grafts and transplantation (e.g. which grafts are demanded?, which grafts represent higher hospital costs?), better evidenced-based decisions can be designed. These reports will aid authorities with better funds allocation, leading to more resources &amp; knowledge-based decisions.</p>
