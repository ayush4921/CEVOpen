<p id="Par39">Accordingly to the United Nations, sustainable development goal N.17 “strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development”, association of health services with academia generates multidisciplinary clusters for the generation of innovation that deliver value and can deliver new, more advanced biotechnological products, spin-offs and start-ups, leading to more translational research and development projects (Casanellas et al.

This led to the appearance of the advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) industry, a core industry developing human-derived tissue products disruptive innovations, originating from academic environments (Advanced Therapies Investment Report

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2019</xref>). In the EU, in 2012, there were 18 ATMPs authorised for manufacture and supply under hospital exceptions, the majority developed through academic institutions.
