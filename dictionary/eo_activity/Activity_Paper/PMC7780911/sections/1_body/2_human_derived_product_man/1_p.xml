<p id="Par29">There are several steps that a developing country must adopt to offer high quality standard grafts, in a sustainable, quality industrialized tissue services. Firstly, four relevant bioethics principles must always be considered (Beauchamp and Childress 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2001</xref>; Council of Europe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>; Erk 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>; see Footnote 2) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Then, there are critical steps needed for high quality graft manufacturing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) including: the recruiting, consenting, evaluating and examining the donor in order to continue with the processing, storage and distribution of the tissue (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). There are two types of donors: (I.) the cadaveric donor (CD) with consent for the use of their body for the treatment of others. This type allows tissues such as bones, heart valves, skin, corneas, ligaments, cartilages and nerves to be used for therapeutic purposes (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>; Saegeman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2009</xref>). (II.) The living donors (LD) can donate several tissues too. In this case different consideration of decreasing donor morbidity must be taken into account, such as perinatal tissue (Witkowska-Zimny and Wrobel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2011</xref>; Koizumi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2000</xref>) (e.g. amniotic membrane, placenta and umbilical cord-derived hematopoietic stem cells), hematopoietic stem cells (Weissman and Shizuru 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2008</xref>) and bones from femoral heads that are removed during a hip replacement (Lomas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>), among others (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To enhance donation, it is recommended that any potential organ donor be referred to the local procurement unit and that all deaths (usually hospital deaths) should be processed with a procurement coordinator, regardless of the patient’s age, the cause of death, or known diseases (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). After the identification, the informed consent of the donor must be obtained in a documented way through their family declaration in the case of the CD, and with the deceased donor with brain death (DBD), a process known in Chile as “Last will testimony request”, which is carried out by trained personnel of the procurement unit (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>).
