<p id="Par36">Risk management refers to the systematic processes designed to coordinate, facilitate and improve decision making, based on scientific evidence regarding the risk for graft quality during its life cycle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) (Quality Risk Management 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2005</xref>). The level of effort and documentation of the quality risk management process must be proportional to the risk for the recipient. A “process flow” diagram that lists all the steps, processes, consumables, tests and equipment related to the specific graft can form the basis for the evaluation exercise. This allows identifying risks, their probability of occurrence and their severity. All of which is key information for the decision making of preventive activities for risk reduction or acceptance. An acceptance of risk could vary on case by case by analysis of the balance between risks and benefits. For example, there is an established high public demand for bone graft in Chile, which could favour the use of fresh-frozen graft from femoral heads after hip replacement surgeries to increase hospital supply, an accepted risk that has proven to be safe over time in several scientific publications (Slooff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1984</xref>; Schreurs et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2009</xref>; Dennis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>). Effective risk management must guarantee the quality of the graft, as it provides a proactive means to identify and control possible problems during manufacturing chain and the chance for continuing improvement.
