   <tr>
    <td align="left">Gratuity</td>
    <td align="left">The “Oviedo Convention” refers to the fact that the human body and its parts should not generate any financial gains. For example in Chile, the impossibility of receiving compensation for the donation of human tissues is established under law, as the donation is always voluntary and free of charge. “Altruistic” donations aim to promote donation and eliminate disincentives that affect donation, with compensation, that could be described as covering expenses in the procurement and processing of a donated human tissue as matter of health justice</td>

    </td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">Informed consent</td>
    <td align="left">This step has direct implications in the bioethics principle of autonomy and it implies that the donor has understood all the information about the use that will be given to the tissue bank and that it grants its approval expressly, freely, consciously and disinterestedly, understanding that the donation corresponds to a free and voluntary act to contribute to the common good. In deceased donors in Chile, this step is taken and is authorized by the potential donor’s relatives under the “request for last will testimony”</td>

    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Confidentiality</td>
    <td align="left">Refers to the fact that in no case the information can be disseminated to identify the donor and recipient of human tissue and vice versa. In Chile, to process donor and recipients information in confidentiality, the data is transferred to codes administered by the “Integrated Donation and Transplant System” (SIDOT) software from MINSAL</td>

    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Quality, safety and effectiveness</td>
    <td align="left">Refers to how the tissues can be implanted in multi-receptors and implies that the generation of any batch of tissue should not generate a risk of multiple infections and the tissues (bioethics principle of no-maleficence), in this case grafts, are safe, effective and with a “guarantee of quality” or planned, systematic and documented actions, necessary to provide safety to the receiving patient</td>
