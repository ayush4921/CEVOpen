<p>A member of the cysteine protease family, the active SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro comprises two identical monomers, each with three structural domains; the first two domains (domain I: 8–101 and II: 102–184) form a chymotrypsin fold, and the third (domain III: 201–303) forms a globular α-helical structure, with an identity of 96% to SARS-CoV 3CLpro
