 </xref>, identifying two FDA-approved drugs (disulfiram and carmofur), and five preclinical or investigational compounds as promising antiviral agents against 3CLpro. In this study, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potential SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. To evaluate the extent of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, a fluorogenic peptide with intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) was used as the substrate for the protease. Subject to the inhibitory effect, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of the repurposing existing drugs of interest were characterised, along with analysis of docking poses in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
