<p>To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of the identified SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, molecular docking was performed to simulate the binding model in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>, the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro can be divided into four subsites

 </xref>, where the S1 subsite comprises L27, N142, G143, S144, C145 and H164, the S1' subsite consists of H163, F140, L141, E166 and M165, the S2 subsite includes H41, M49, D187, R188 and Q189, and the S4 subsite is made up of L167 and P168. A way to disrupt the catalytic function of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is to occlude the access of the substrate to the Cys-His catalytic dyad (C145 and H41)

 </xref>. The molecular docking results revealed that the identified inhibitors interacted with the Cys-His catalytic dyad, along with other residues, in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B,C)</xref>). Specifically, ethacrynic acid and naproxen form a stable electrostatic force with H163 through the carboxyl group, and hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force with the catalytic dyad and other residues in the S1, S1' and S2 subsites. Butenafine interacted with the catalytic residue H41 and other residues in the S1, S1â€™ and S2 subsites through van der Waals force alone. Raloxifene and saquinavir filled all four subsites of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, binding to the catalytic residues C145 and H41, and the enclosed hydrophobic residues N142, G143, L141, M165, M49, L167, P168, R188 and Q189, resembling to the binding mode of Michael acceptor inhibitors

 </xref>. As for compounds of a low heavy atom count, allopurinol and tranylcypromine occupied deeply in the S1 and the S2 subsite, respectively. Taken together, the identified inhibitors docked into up to four subsites of the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, interacting with the catalytic dyad and other residues involving in substrate binding.
