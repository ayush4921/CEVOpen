<p>Coronaviruses, known for the crown-like appearance of the virions in electron microscopy, are enveloped + ssRNA viruses with the largest known genome size among RNA viruses. The genome encodes structural proteins (e.g. spike glycoproteins), non-structural proteins (e.g. papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), and accessory proteins
