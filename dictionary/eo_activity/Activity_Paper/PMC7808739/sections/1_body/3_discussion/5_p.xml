<p>Taken together, we found several potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in a library of 774 FDA-approved drugs, including ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate. These drugs exert SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition by obscuring the accessibility of the C145-H41 catalytic dyad via hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force. Including the forces mentioned, the carboxyl group of ethacrynic acid and naproxen form an additional electrostatic force to H163 in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Although ethacrynic acid had the best inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, repurposing naproxen and sirolimus for COVID-19 treatment shows promise in that they have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, respectively, which may help address the immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our identification of potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors among FDA-approved drugs highlights their potential for treating COVID-19 and other diseases caused by Î² CoVs.</p>
