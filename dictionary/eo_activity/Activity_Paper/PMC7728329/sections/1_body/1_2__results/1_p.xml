<p>The synthetic route shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-25-05536-sch001">Scheme 1</xref> was successfully applied for the preparation of the 
 <italic>para</italic>-SF
 <sub>5</sub> substituted aniline derivatives, 
 <bold>1b</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold>. The synthesis was initiated by the bromination of a commercially available aniline, 
 <bold>1a</bold> using 
 <italic>N</italic>-bromosuccinimide (NBS), which led to the formation of mono- and di-bromo anilines 
 <bold>1a′</bold> and 
 <bold>1a″</bold>, respectively. The molecules, 
 <bold>1a′</bold> and 
 <bold>1a″</bold> were subsequently methylated by the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling to give the corresponding anilines, 
 <bold>1b</bold> and 
 <bold>1d</bold> in 64% and 75% yields, respectively. Finally, 2-methyl-aniline 
 <bold>1b</bold> was further reacted with NBS in DMF to produce 2-methyl-6-bromo-aniline 
 <bold>1c</bold> with excellent yield [
