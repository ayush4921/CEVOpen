<p>Based on the above results from DPPH, ABTs, superoxide radical scavenging, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, methanol extract possessed the highest antioxidant activity among all solvent extracts. Among the methods used for quantifying antioxidant capacity, there were significant correlations among three assays (DPPH, ABTS, and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays), while exhibited weaker correlations with superoxide scavenging assay. Similar experimental results could also be observed in the past study [
