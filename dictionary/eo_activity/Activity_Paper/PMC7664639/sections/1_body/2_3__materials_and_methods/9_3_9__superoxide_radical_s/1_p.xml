<p>Superoxide anion radical (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•−</sup>) scavenging activity was measured using minor revision of method [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In brief, the stock solutions, which contained 300 μM NBT, 468 μM NADH, and 120 μM PMS, were added in 16 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Each 50 μL of NBT, PMS, and different concentrations of extracts was mixed. The reaction was initiated by adding NADH solution to produce superoxide. The absorbance was measured at 560 nm after incubating at room temperature for 5 min. The scavenging activity was measured by the following equation.
