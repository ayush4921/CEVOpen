<p>DPPH scavenging activity (%) = (A
 <sub>c</sub> − A
 <sub>t</sub>)/A
 <sub>c</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub>t</sub> is the absorbance of the test sample and A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the control. Commercially-available BHT was used as positive control. All half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of tested activities were determined by the liner regression of the percentage of remaining DPPH radical against the sample concentration.
