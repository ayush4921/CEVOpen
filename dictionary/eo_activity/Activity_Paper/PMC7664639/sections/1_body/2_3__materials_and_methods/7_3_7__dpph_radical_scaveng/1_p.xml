<p>The DPPH radical scavenging assay was measured as described with minor revisions [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The assay mixture in each well of the 96-well plates included 200 µM DPPH solution (dissolved in ethanol, 100 µL) and different concentrations of test compounds (100 µL). After 30 min at room temperature and in darkness, the absorbance of mixture was measured at 520 nm. DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated with following formula,
