<p>The scavenging activity of hydroxyl radical was evaluated based on the method described by Mathew and Abraham with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, the reaction mixture, contained different concentrations of the extract, 0.1 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.8 mM deoxyribose, 0.1 mM ascorbic acid, and 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>–KOH buffer (20 mM pH 7.4), was incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for the nonsite-specific hydroxyl radical system. After incubation of 1 h, 2.8% TCA (200 μL) and 1% TBA (200 μL) were added. After boiling at 100 °C for 30 min, the antioxidative activity of the boiled mixture was measured by calculating the decrease in absorbance measured at 532 nm by the following equation.
