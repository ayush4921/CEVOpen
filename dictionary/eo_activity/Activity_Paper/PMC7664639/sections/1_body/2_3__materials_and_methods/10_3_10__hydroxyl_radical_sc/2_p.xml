<p>Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (%) = (A
 <sub>c</sub> − A
 <sub>t</sub>)/A
 <sub>c</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub>t</sub> and A
 <sub>c</sub> are the absorbance of the test sample and the control, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of all tested activities were determined by the linear regression of the percentage of remaining hydroxyl radical against the sample concentration.
