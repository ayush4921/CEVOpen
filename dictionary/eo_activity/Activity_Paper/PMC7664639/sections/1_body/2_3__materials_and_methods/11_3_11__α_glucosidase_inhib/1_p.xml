<p>The inhibition assay of α-glucosidase was performed using the conditions previously reported with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In brief, the solution of α-glucosidase (1 U/mL in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8; 20 μL) was mixed with different concentration of tested compounds (20 μL) in a 96-well microplate. Then, the substrate 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (
 <italic>p</italic>-NPG) (0.375 mM; 40 μL) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min under shaking in the microplate. After adding 0.1 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution (80 μL), the reaction was terminated, and the absorbance of 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPG was measured at 405 nm using a 96-well microplate reader. Each experiment was executed in triplicate. Percentage inhibition of each sample was determined using the following equation,
