<p>ABTS radical inhibiting activity (%) = (A
 <sub>c</sub> − A
 <sub>t</sub>)/A
 <sub>c</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub>c</sub> and A
 <sub>t</sub> are the absorbance of the control and test sample, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of all tested activities were determined by the liner regression of the percentage of remaining ABTS radical against the sample concentration.
