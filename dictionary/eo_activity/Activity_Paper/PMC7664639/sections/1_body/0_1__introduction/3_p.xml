<p>It is crucial to manage hyperglycemia because it can induce severe complications. α-Glucosidase, which is situated on the brush-border surface membrane of intestinal cells, activates the final step of the digestive process. The absorbable monosaccharides generated by α-glucosidase activity is readily available for intestinal absorption [

Therefore, inhibitors of α-glucosidase restrain the release of glucose from starch, thereby reducing intestinal absorption of glucose and decreasing in postprandial hyperglycemia. Currently, there are several antidiabetic drugs, such as acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose, which act by inhibiting α-glucosidase activity to reduce high blood glucose levels. However, the continuous use of these synthetic agents often causes undesirable negative side effects, namely abdominal cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, and liver toxicity [
