 <p>Schiff-base–bearing new bis(thiosemicarbazone) derivatives were prepared from terephthalaldehyde and various thiosemicarbazides. FT–IR, 
  <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
  <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and UV–Vis spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis were used to elucidate the identification of the synthesized molecules. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds was analysed with the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free-radical–trapping process. The synthesized compounds exhibited lower antioxidant activity than the standard ascorbic acid. IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of the synthesized molecules measured from 3.81 ± 0.01 to 29.05 ± 0.11 μM. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 
  <bold>3</bold> had the best antioxidant activity. Moreover, this study explained the structure–activity relationship of the synthesized molecules with different substituents in radical trapping reactions.
