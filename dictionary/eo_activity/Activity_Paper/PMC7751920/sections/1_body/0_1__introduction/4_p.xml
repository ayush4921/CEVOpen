<p>In view of this evidence, Schiff bases are important not only in possessing biological activities, but also in pharmacological chemistry. In this paper, a series of novel bis(thiosemicarbazones) based on Schiff bases were prepared by condensation reaction with terephthalaldehyde and various thiosemicarbazides under reflux in ethanol. The structures of the new compounds were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT–IR), proton–carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR–13 C NMR), and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopic techniques, as well as elemental analysis. Antioxidants are very important reagents because they can trap free radicals and reduce their damaging effects on our bodies. Therefore, the in vitro antioxidant activity of all of the obtained molecules were evaluated by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) freeradical trapping process. This paper investigated the effects of diverse structural features on the antioxidative activity of all the compounds. Moreover, I studied the electronic effect of electron-donating and electronwithdrawing groups as the substituents on antioxidant activity, as well as their positions. The aim of this study was to explain the structure–activity relationship of the products with various substituents in radical scavenging reactions.</p>
