<p>The electronic absorption spectra of the new bis(thiosemicarbazones) based on Schiff base derivatives (
 <sup>1-10</sup>) show that in all obtained products absorption bands appeared in the range of 256–406 nm in dimethylsulfoxide (see Figures S28–S36). The electronic spectra of these compounds show remarkable absorption bands of the aromatic ring (C=C) and thiosemicarbazone (C=S)–imine (CH=N) region, owing to transitions of a π → π* and an n → π*. The π → π*-type transitions of C=C on the aromatic ring are seen at 256 nm, except in compound 1 (258 nm). This transition is a characteristic benzenoid (B) band of the aromatic structure [32]. While the n → π* transitions of the imine C=N double bond were seen at 282–296 nm for all compounds, the bands at 352–406 nm are assigned to the electronic transition n → π* of the thiosemicarbazone moiety (C=S).
