<p>On the other hand, synthesis of the enaminone, 
 <bold>6</bold> was essential to construct biologically active heterocyclic products. Reaction of the thiazolidinone 
 <bold>4a</bold> with dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA), under solvent-free conditions, produced the enaminone derivative 
 <bold>6</bold> within 1â€‰h., in 87% yield. The enamine 
 <bold>6</bold> was condensed with ethyl acetoacetate or acetyl acetone in the presence of ammonium acetate and glacial acetic acid, to afford the thiazolopyridine carboxalate and thiazolo-pyridine ethanone derivatives 
 <bold>7</bold>and 
 <bold>8</bold>, respectively, in 83 and 80% yields. While, reaction of compound 
 <bold>6</bold> with cyanothioacetamide or malononitrile in ethanolic sodium ethoxide gave thioxo-pyridine or oxo-pyridine carbonitrile derivatives 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>10</bold>, respectively, in 83 and 81% yields (
