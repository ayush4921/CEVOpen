<p>The filtered EE sample was separated using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled with a WPS-3000(T) Autosampler, HPG-3400 pump and DAD-300 detector. The separation was performed using a Purospher RP-18 endcapped column (250 mm × 4.6 mm I.D.; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with a guard column (4 mm × 4 mm I.D.). Solvent gradients were formed by varying the proportion of solvent A [water with 0.1% acetic acid (
 <italic>v/v</italic>)] to solvent B (methanol) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Solvent B was maintained initially at 10% for 5 min and then increased to 100% in 25 min. This 100% of Solvent B was maintained for 10 min, then decreased to 10% in 10 min and equilibrated for 5 min (total run time 55 min). The compound peaks were detected at three different wavelengths: 220, 240 and 280 nm. The same program was used to obtain fractions in bulk using a preparative HPLC (11250 Infinity, Agilent Technologies) using reversed-phase C18 column (Kinetex 5u EVO C18-100A—250 × 21.2 mm). After collection, the fractions were lyophilized to powder. These lyophilized fractions were resuspended in 7% ethanol and checked for their effect on IL-8 levels, as described below. Further analyses were carried out to correlate the activity and peak profile for detecting the active compound peak(s).
