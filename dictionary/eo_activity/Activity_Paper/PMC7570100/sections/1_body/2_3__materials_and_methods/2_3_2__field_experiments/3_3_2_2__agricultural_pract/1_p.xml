<p>Seeds were sown at late November 2017 in an open field on sandy soil beds. Water was supplied using two drip lines per bed (40 cm apart), with five 1.6 L h
 <sup>−1</sup> emitters per 1 m of drip line. Two seeds were sown on either side of each emitter, resulting in a density of 16 plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>. Fresh water (0.7 dS m
 <sup>−1</sup>) was supplied at 6 mm day
 <sup>−1</sup> until germination, which occurred about 2 weeks after sowing. After germination, irrigation was reduced to 4 mm day
 <sup>−1</sup> to accomplish 700 mm until late May. An unfertilized control was tested against a fertigated treatment, which was applied using a liquid fertilizer (Shefer 4:2:6, 35% ammonium and 65% nitrate, Israel Chemicals, Ltd.) at 1.5 L m
 <sup>−3</sup>. The experimental design was of random blocks with four replicates (plot size was 2.4 m
 <sup>2</sup>). Bloom began in April and continued until June. Tubers began forming at a very early stage of plant growth and continued to form and develop throughout the season. Tuber harvest took place in June, toward seeds ripening. At harvest, tuber yield was determined; tubers were cleaned and stored at −20 °C until further examinations.
