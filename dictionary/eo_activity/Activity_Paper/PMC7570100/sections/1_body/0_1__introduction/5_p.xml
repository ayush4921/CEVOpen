<p>The objective of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the nutritive and medicinal potential of 
 <italic>E. crassifolium</italic> for becoming a useful new crop species. In addition to a moderate nutritive potential, we demonstrate here significant in vitro anti-inflammatory capacities in the tubers, assigned to well-known bioactive compounds. Furthermore, HSB displayed impressive tuber productivity when exposed to agricultural conditions, indicating a promising potential for domestication.
