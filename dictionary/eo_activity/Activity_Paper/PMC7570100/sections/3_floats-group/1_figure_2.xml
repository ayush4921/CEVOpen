  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) HPLC profile of 70% ethanol extract (EE) of HSB tubers at 220 nm. Each fraction (F1–F11) was collected during 5 min out of the total 55 min of HPLC run; (
   <bold>B</bold>) levels of IL-8, an indicator of cell inflammatory status, in response to treatment with crude EE, EE fractions (F1–F11) and pooled fractions (PF) in in vitro trials using human cells. NT—non-treated control; TNF-α—an inflammation excitatory factor; DXM—dexamethasone (100 μM), positive control. Means of replicates were subjected to statistical analysis using Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test. Different letters indicate significant differences between treatments; ***, ** and *, indicate 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. Bars indicate standard error.
