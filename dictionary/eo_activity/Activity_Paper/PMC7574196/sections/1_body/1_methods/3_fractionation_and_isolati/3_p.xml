<p id="Par12">Part of EtOAc fraction (23 g) was also subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluted with a gradient of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-EtOAc (70:30 → 00:100) and chloroform-MeOH (92:5 → 75:25) to afford 60 sub-fractions of 20 mL which were combined to four sub-fractions: F (1–4), G (5–15) H (16–24), I (25–60) on the basis of their TLC profile. Sub-fraction G (3.5 g) was purified on silica gel column chromatography using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-EtOAc (50:50 → 00:100) to yield compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (21 mg) while purification of sub-fraction H (2.6 g) on sephadex LH-20 column eluted with chloroform-methanol (50:50) afforded compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (60 mg). The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by combining various techniques comprising 1D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR):
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, DEPT 90, DEPT 135 and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC), NOESY and ROESY as well as Mass Spectrometry analysis (TOF-ESI-MS). The data of the established structures were compared with those existing in literature.
