 <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a major source of food-borne illness in humans and a major cause of morbidity, mortality and economic loss both in the poultry and human health sectors. The disease caused by bacteria belonging to 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> genus is often called salmonellosis. This pathology remains one of the limiting factors in the development of poultry farming especially in developing countries of Asia and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] because it causes huge direct and indirect losses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> is very diverse and today it is composed of more than 2500 serotypes, many of which cause enteric diseases in humans and animals. Many serotypes of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> can infect chickens and some serotypes are well adapted although, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Gallinarum and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Pullorum cannot be transmitted to human. However, some serotypes can infect both poultry and human and among these serotypes 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium are more prevalent in chickens and notable in human disease outbreaks. These serotypes are most commonly implicated in the human 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The poultry is considered one of the main sources of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> human infection usually through poorly cooked foods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and foodstuffs of avian origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection represents a considerable burden in both developing and developed countries. Ubiquitous non-typhoidal 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> (NTS) which includes 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium annually cause more than 93.8 million illnesses and 155,000 deaths each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, both NTS are the most frequently occurring serotypes from poultry causing infection in human [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similarly, each year worldwide, typhoidal serotypes among which 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Paratyphi, cause approximately 22 million cases of typhoid and 216,500 deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
