<p>Extraction starts with methanol with an ultrasound-assisted extraction method (frequency set at 35 kHz). In total, 10 g of plant powder mixed with 100 mL of 70% methanol for 40 min and after that filtered using Whatman paper and concentrated utilizing a rotavap. The concentrated extract was rediluted in D.W. and extracted with n-butanol (repeated 2 times) to finally get the polyphenol (organic phase). </p>
