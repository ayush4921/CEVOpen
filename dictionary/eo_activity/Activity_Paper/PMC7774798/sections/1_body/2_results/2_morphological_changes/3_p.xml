<p>Wound contraction length per week was measured as another physical characteristic, and it was inferior in the marigold leaf paste-treated group than in the other two groups (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After the operation, from D
 <sub>0</sub> up to D
 <sub>21</sub>, the width of the suture area of the wounds was recorded to realize the contraction of the healing process (
 <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The width of the suture area of the wounds of all the groups was amplified up to D
 <sub>3</sub>. After D
 <sub>3</sub>, it diminished steadily in all the groups (
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results of observations on D
 <sub>7</sub> and D
 <sub>14</sub> demonstrated that wounds treated with marigold leaf paste resulted significantly (
