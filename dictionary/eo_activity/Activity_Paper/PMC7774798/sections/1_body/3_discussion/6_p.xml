<p>On the contrary, Paul et al. [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] stated that the clinical efficacy of marigold flower paste was not as satisfactory as the turmeric in the wound healing of goat, which is slightly contradictory to our findings. But in their experiment, they did not explain the reasons suggesting their conclusions. The difference in animal species and the use of flowers instead of leaves of marigold might be the reason for this variation.
