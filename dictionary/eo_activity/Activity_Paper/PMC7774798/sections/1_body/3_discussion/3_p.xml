<p>The microbiological study suggested different bacterial colonies were absent in the samples of marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated groups following D
 <sub>1</sub>. However, the bacterial colonies existed in the culture of samples of the normal saline-treated group until D
 <sub>3</sub>. Moreover, through Gram stain, cultured samples proved the existence of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus </italic>spp. and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The bacteria gradually reduced their susceptibility to elimination by the host immune response and antibiotics. Different types of bacteria, such as
 <italic> Staphylococcus </italic>spp., hemolytic 
 <italic>Streptococci</italic>, and
 <italic> Pseudomonas </italic>spp
 <italic>. </italic>are mostly found in surgical wounds [

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Dasgupta et al. [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They showed the comparative antibacterial action of marigold leaves extracts against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>.
