  <title>Histological assessment of the biopsies from a group of wounds treated with the turmeric paste and stained with H&amp;E dye (4x). On day 1 (a, black circle), clot, debris, and hemorrhages were perceived on the incised wound. Histological study on day 3 (b, black circle) represents that there were accesses of reactive cells with moderate congestion and hemorrhage. On day 7 (c, black circle), the wound seemed to heal through the intrusion of less reactive cells and the development of a thin layer of keratin on the woundâ€™s surface.</title>
