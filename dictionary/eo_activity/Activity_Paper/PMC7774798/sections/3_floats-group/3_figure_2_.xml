  <title>Histological analysis of wound healing processes with marigold leaf paste-treated group stained with H&amp;E (4x). The biopsy samples were collected on days 1 (a), 3 (b), and 7 (c) post-operatively. The existence of ample hemorrhages and tissue debris in the surgical wounds was observed on day 1 (a, black circle). On day 3 post-operation, there was a massive intrusion of inflammatory cells and few hemorrhages in the wound (b, black circle). On day 7, histological analysis showed that there were a satisfactory number of inflammatory cells. Besides, much of the hemorrhages and debris disappeared simultaneously. A thick layer of keratin emerged on the experimental woundsâ€™ epidermis (c, black circle).</title>
