  <title>Histological evaluation of the samples from the normal saline-treated wounds and stained with H&amp;E dye (4x). On day 1 (a, black circle), profuse hemorrhages and tissue debris were seen in the wounds. There were fewer infiltrations of reactive cells with undesired hemorrhages and congestion (b, black circle) on day 3 of the study. On day 7 (c, black circle), the experimental samples contained a small line of keratin and a minimal amount of inflammatory cells. There was less affinity for healing due to a gap between the incised woundâ€™s edges (c, black circle).</title>
