 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) (Novagen, USA) was used as production host. For AsK production, two co-transformed plasmids were used for co-expression of the alpha and beta monomers. The recombinant strains were cultivated in 250 ml LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic(s) at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm and, at OD
 <sub>600</sub> ~ 0.6, induced with 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated overnight at 28 °C. Production of SK was carried as described by Kenyon et al. [
