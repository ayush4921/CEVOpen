<p id="Par35">HSK was insoluble and was purified using an ÄKTA Avant (GE Healthcare, USA). The biomass pellet was resuspended in 40 ml Denaturation Solublisation Buffer (DSB; 50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea; pH 7.9) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking at 50 rpm. This was then lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 4080 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and loaded onto a 25 ml bed volume Ni-NTA (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) column on the ÄKTA Avant, pre-equilibrated with DSB. After loading, the column was washed with DSB, and HSK was refolded on the column using a linear gradient from 100% DSB to 100% of the urea-free Lysis Equilibration Buffer (50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl; pH 7.9) before being eluted off the resin using Elution Buffer (50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM Imidazole; pH 8.0). The eluate was dialysed overnight in HSK’s selected dialysis buffer (Table
