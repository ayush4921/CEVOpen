<p id="Par41">Liquid chromatography was performed on a Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000 RSLC equipped with a 5 mm × 300 mm C
 <sub>18</sub> trap column (Thermo Scientific) and a CSH 25 cm × 75 μm 1.7 μm particle size C
 <sub>18</sub> column (Waters) analytical column. The solvent system employed was loading: 2% acetonitrile:water; 0.1% formic acid; Solvent A: 2% acetonitrile:water; 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B: 100% acetonitrile:water, 0.1% formic acid. The samples were loaded onto the trap column using loading solvent at a flow rate of 10 μL/min from a temperature controlled autosampler set at 7 °C. Loading was performed for 5 min before the sample was eluted onto the analytical column. Flow rate was set to 325 nL/minute and the gradient generated as follows: 2.0 -10% B for 4 min; followed by 10–35% B from 4 to 60 min and finally 35–50% B from 60 to 70 min. Chromatography was performed at 40 °C and the outflow delivered to the mass spectrometer through a stainless steel nano-bore emitter.
