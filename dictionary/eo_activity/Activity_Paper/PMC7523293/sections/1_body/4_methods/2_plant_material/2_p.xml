<p id="Par30">The primary pre-processing post agricultural harvesting involved washing of the biomass (stalks and leaves cut into smaller pieces) prior to drying at 40-50 °C, over 3–5 days. The material was then milled using a hammer mill before carrying out the batch extraction process. The extraction was carried out in a glass jacketed percolation column. The biomass material was held in place within the column using mutton cloth. The percolation process was then carried out over 7 h. The extraction solvent used was ethanol (43% v/v EtOH, 1.25 L) and effective dried raw material loading (0.25 kg). The solvent was re-circulated through the column reactor over the period of 7 h. The solvent is pumped in at the top of the percolation column and allowed to diffuse through the column under gravitational force. The flow rate was estimated to be 36 ml/min. The percolator column dimensions (out diameter 11 cm, column length ~ 32 cm). The recovered filtrate (ex. percolation) was then collected and ethanol removed using a Buchi evaporator (40-60 °C, − 85 kPa over 1–2 h). The extract yield was 16.917 g (yield 6.76% m/m). The crude extract was stored at 4 °C.</p>
