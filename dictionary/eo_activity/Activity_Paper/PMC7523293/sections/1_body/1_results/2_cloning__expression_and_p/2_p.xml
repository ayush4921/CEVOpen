<p id="Par20">All enzymes were expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) subsequent to IPTG induction. Following nickel-affinity purification using either native or denaturing means, the proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE as outlined in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the detailed break-down of the fractions obtained. Acetate kinase (AK) and glycerol kinase (GK) were both well expressed however the final eluate yielded lower levels of protein. They were both however still used in the screening as sufficiently high levels of enzyme activity were obtained. It was decided to keep these enzymes in the screen panel as one of the primary aims of setting up the screen panel was to assess if the panel may be used to identify compound target selectivity from mixtures such as plant extracts. It is envisaged that a higher fidelity secondary screen will be set up, using purer enzyme, once the target has been identified. The secondary screen will be used for compound identification.
