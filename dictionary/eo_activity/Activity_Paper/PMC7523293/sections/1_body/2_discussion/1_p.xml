<p id="Par24">A range of kinases was selected for screening, based on representing some of the 12 fold-groups that have distinct phosphoryl transfer mechanisms, with a total of 6 distinct phosphoryl transfer mechanisms represented in the 8 enzymes used in this study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The purification of the proteins was challenging, but a variety of different techniques were investigated in order to acquire sufficient amounts of relatively pure protein (as estimated by PAGE) to run all assays simultaneously as part of a preliminary medicinal plant extract screen. The presence of each kinase was demonstrated by enzyme activity, SDS-PAGE and/or MS analysis. The competitive inhibition of the kinase reaction may manifest either as inhibiting the binding of ATP or by the inhibition of the binding of the enzyme substrate that is to be phosphorylated. As these enzymes were selected based on the fact that they all have distinct phosphoryl transfer reactions as well as distinct substrates, it was envisaged that the plant extract may demonstrate a significant variation on the IC
 <sub>50</sub>s obtained. This was found to be the case, with SK and GK having IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.17 mg/ml and 1.4 mg/ml, respectively, with all the other enzymes having IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of at least one order of magnitude higher. Clearly, the kinases selected could be used in a primary selection to identify targets for a plant extract. The selected enzymes could then be used in a more stringent secondary screen to identify the active compounds. What is significant is one of the major active ingredients of 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> is gallic acid, which is a shikimic acid mimic (the substrate of SK) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Gallic acid and a range of 
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylated compounds have been demonstrated to be present in the extracts of 
 <italic>P. sidoides</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SK has been identified as being a potential target to develop antimicrobial agents for Mtb [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An associated species of 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> used in South Africa for medicinal purposes is 
 <italic>Pelargonium reniforme</italic>. 
 <italic>P. reniforme</italic> produces 
 <italic>O</italic>-galloylated glycerol (glycerol-1-gallate) which could be a potential bi-functional inhibitor of both SK and GK. If only low levels of glycerol-1-gallate are synthesized in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>sidoides</italic>, however if the binding constants of glycerol-1-gallate for SK and GK is high enough inhibition will still occur and probably synergistically. As the enzymes selected are all kinase enzymes it is realistic to believe that one of the binding mechanisms is in the kinase ATP binding site. These results clearly demonstrate that this platform of Mtb kinase enzymes can be used as a primary selection strategy for the identification of active ingredients in plant extracts that allows for the stratification of the inhibition of Mtb kinase enzymes and the validation of the extracts potential medicinal properties.
