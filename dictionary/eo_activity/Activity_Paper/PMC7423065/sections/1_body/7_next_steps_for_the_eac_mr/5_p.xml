<p>As the EAC MRH initiative takes its place alongside other regulatory harmonization initiatives, we welcome it and encourage it to stay the course. History has shown that it takes decades of patience and perseverance to set up a mature system. Though the EMA was established in 1995, the legal framework for pharmaceutical regulation in the EU had been established in 1965 (Council Directive 65/65). Similarly, after the concept of the CTD was first proposed at ICH, it took 2 years and a costly survey before the topic was accepted for development and an additional 3 years before the CTD guideline was issued. To ensure that the EAC MRH initiative has the staying power needed to improve access to medicines for the people of East Africa, we believe an essential next step is establishing a binding legal framework that lays out clear decision-making processes and obligates partner states to abide by program decisions. The initiative has strong support from national and regional leaders now, but this support may wax and wane over time in the absence of a binding legal framework. It is unlikely that the EUâ€™s system could have survived and succeeded for decades, even as controversies arose among member states, without robust legal backing.</p>
