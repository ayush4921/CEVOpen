<p>In terms of funding, we believe that if the initiative can demonstrate that it meets its target timelines and its decisions are respected throughout the EAC, the pharmaceutical industry will be willing to pay substantial, legally authorized user fees, which can provide a stable source of income to sustain the programâ€™s ongoing operations. This approach has been extraordinarily successful in the US for nearly 30 years (via the Prescription Drug User Fee Act); the EMA and PMDA also receive financial support from industry user fees. In addition to supporting the desired EAC Medicines Agency, user fees could be employed to compensate the national regulatory authorities that participate most in joint activities. For example, the EMA pays a portion of the industry user fees for each application to the national regulatory authorities that provide their expertise during assessment.</p>
