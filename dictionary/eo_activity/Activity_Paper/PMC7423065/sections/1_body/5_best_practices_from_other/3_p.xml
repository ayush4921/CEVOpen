<p>In recent years, the EAC MRH initiative has spent much of its time developing an EAC-specific CTD format for marketing applications in lieu of using ICHâ€™s CTD format. It has also focused on creating EAC-specific regulatory guidelines and standard operating procedures. Although the EAC may need to modify existing global regulatory standards somewhat to ensure that its unique needs are met, introducing changes also increases the risk that harmonization with regulatory practices elsewhere in the world will be compromised. This could potentially delay access to needed medicines for EAC patients. In addition, time spent on such modifications cannot be spent on other activities that may have a greater public health return (for example, ensuring the quality of medicines, especially generic drugs, manufactured in or imported into the EAC).</p>
