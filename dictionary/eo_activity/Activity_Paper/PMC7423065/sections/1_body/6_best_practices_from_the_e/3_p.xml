<p>Some unique aspects of the context in which the EAC MRH initiative operates may make it difficult for other programs to replicate its results. A common problem across regional harmonization initiatives is that partner states have extremely different capacity levels. For example, APEC’s members include economies as diverse as those of Mexico, China, the US, Brunei, and Papua New Guinea. In addition, like the EAC MRH initiative, many regional harmonization programs lack a binding legal framework (such as exists in the EU) that requires partner states to abide by joint decisions. Therefore, joint assessment and inspection programs hinge on the level of trust between member states, and more mature regulatory authorities may be reluctant to recognize decisions that rely on the work of less mature authorities. The EAC MRH initiative has encountered this problem to some extent and has put a great deal of effort into building the capacity of each of its partner states. However, the EAC’s partner states have also been willing to grant one another an extraordinary amount of trust, perhaps due to their tight linguistic, historic, and cultural ties.</p>
