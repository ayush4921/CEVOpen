<p>Based on the reported PK inhibitory activity of isatin and benzofuran nuclei, specially, on the homologous CDK2 and GSK-3β kinases, a hybridisation strategy of these two privileged scaffolds was adapted to design dual CDK2/GSK-3β hybrid inhibitors which could target breast cancer. For the hybridisation strategy, the bioisosteric amido and uriedo moieties were used as linkers between the two nuclei, moreover, different substitution pattern and nature on the oxindole ring offering various electronic and lipophilic environments were introduced to study their impact on the activity (
