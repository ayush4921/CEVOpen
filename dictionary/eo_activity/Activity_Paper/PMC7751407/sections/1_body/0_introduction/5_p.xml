<p>CDKs, a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, are involved in several cellular functions such as division, proliferation, apoptosis, and gene transcription. CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 subtypes are responsible for the regulation of cell-cycle progression in its different phases, moreover, they play a pivotal role in cancer cell continuous proliferation

 </xref>. CDK2 subtype, specifically, received a great attention as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment due to its key role in several cellular processes upon complexation with its activating cognate, cyclin A or E, in addition, dysregulation of CDK2 or its cyclin partners was detected in various cancers such as ovarian, lung, pancreatic carcinomas, melanoma as well as breast cancer
