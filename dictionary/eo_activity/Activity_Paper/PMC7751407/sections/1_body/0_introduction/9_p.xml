 <italic>H</italic>-indole-2,3-dione (isatin) is a privileged scaffold that emerged as a promising nucleus in medicinal chemistry demonstrating a broad range of pharmacological activities including antibacterial, anticonvulsant, antifungal, antiviral, as well as anticancer activity

  <sup>76–78</sup>
 </xref>. Isatin derivatives exert their anticancer activity through several mechanisms such as inhibition and/or modulation of proteases, translation initiation, angiogenesis or tubulin polymerisation, moreover, PK inhibition is one of the key anticancer mechanisms of isatin derivatives
