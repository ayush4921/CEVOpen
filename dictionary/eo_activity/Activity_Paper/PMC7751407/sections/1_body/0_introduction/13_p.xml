<p>The newly synthesised compounds were experimentally evaluated for their anti-proliferative activities against breast cancer cell lines T-47D and MCF-7. Compounds showed promising anti-proliferative activity were tested for their potential dual CDK2/GSK-3β inhibitory activity, moreover, compounds showed prominent anti-proliferative activity and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> PK inhibitory activity were investigated further by studying their effect on cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, molecular docking studies were also performed to study the interaction of the newly synthesised hybrid compounds with CDK2 and GSK-3β kinase domain hot spots (key amino acids) to rationalise their biological activity and to reveal their probable binding mode.
