<p>As results indicated, pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> were able to provoke a significant rise in the cellular population of the G2/M phase in T-47D cells by 2.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively, with concurrent significant increase in the sub-G1 phase by 13.8- and 9.5-fold, respectively, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>. In addition, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells by pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> elicited a significant increase in the cell population within both G2/M phase (by 4.1 and 3.8-fold, respectively) and sub-G1 phase (by 18.9- and 15.2-fold, respectively) with respect to untreated control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref>). Conclusively, both alteration of the Sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> phase as well as arrest of G
 <sub>2</sub>-M phase are featured as significant remarks for pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> to trigger apoptosis in T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells.
