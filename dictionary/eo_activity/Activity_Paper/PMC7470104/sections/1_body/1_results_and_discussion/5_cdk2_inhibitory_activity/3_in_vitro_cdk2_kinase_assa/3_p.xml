<p>The results revealed that the examined pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold>, and 
 <bold>11m</bold> possessed good inhibitory action towards CDK2 kinase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values equal 151 ± 6.16, 43.8 ± 1.79, 55.6 ± 2.27 and 20.1 ± 0.82 nM, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Remarkably pyridazine derivative 
 <bold>11m</bold>, bearing two morpholine moieties, elicited the best CDK2 inhibitory activity in this study (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.1 ± 0.82 nM), alongside to its superior anti-proliferative activity that has been reported above (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It’s worth stressing that this is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, that reports on 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines as anticancer CDK inhibitors.
