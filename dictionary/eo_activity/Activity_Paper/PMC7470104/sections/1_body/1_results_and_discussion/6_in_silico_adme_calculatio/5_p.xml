<p>All the predicted physicochemical properties for pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> were located in the desired pink area for all the six parameters, with an exception for compound 
 <bold>11e</bold> which barely violated the LIPO (Lipophilicity) and INSOLU (Solubility) parameters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0012">Figure 12</xref>), which clarifies its location outside the region of HIA in the BOILED-Egg graph. The other three compounds (
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold>) have the optimal combination of physicochemical properties that guaranteed a high GIT absorption with no single violation to any component of the bioavailability radar chart.
