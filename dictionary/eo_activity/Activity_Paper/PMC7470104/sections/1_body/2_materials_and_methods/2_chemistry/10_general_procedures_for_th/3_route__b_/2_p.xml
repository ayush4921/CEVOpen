<p>Ethyl 6-morpholino-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine-3-carboxylate 
 <bold>(13)</bold> (2.54 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in ethyl alcohol (8 ml), then primary amines (
 <bold>8a</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold>) (15 mmol) and piperidine (2–3 drops) were added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h and then the solvent was evaporated under reduce pressure. The crude product was purified by using flash column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate 70:30) to afford the corresponding target pyridazines
