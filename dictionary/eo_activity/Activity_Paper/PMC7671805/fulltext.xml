Groote Eylandt inhabitants used a variety of plant species to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal illnesses. This study was undertaken to test, identify, and evaluate traditional medicines to treat these conditions against gastrointestinal bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens, as well as against cancer cell proliferation. Six plant species (<italic>Buchanania obovata</italic> Engl., <italic>Casuarina equisetifolia</italic> L., <italic>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</italic> F. Muell., <italic>Planchonia careya</italic> (F. Muell.) R. Knuth, <italic>Terminalia carpentariae</italic> C. T. White, and <italic>Vigna vexillata</italic> (L.) A. Rich.) were selected from a survey of a panel of elders from the Warnindhilyagwa tribe and compared with the published literature. Decoctions prepared according to traditional methods were screened for growth inhibitory activity of a panel of diarrhoea-causing bacterial pathogens by disc diffusion and liquid dilution MIC assays. Inhibitory activity against the gastrointestinal protozoal parasite <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> and antiproliferative activity against human colorectal (Caco2) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines were evaluated using MTS-based colorimetric cell proliferation assays. Preliminary antiviral screening was accomplished using an MS2 bacteriophage plaque reduction assay. Toxicity was evaluated using <italic>Artemia franciscana</italic> nauplii mortality and HDF cell viability bioassays. All traditional medicines tested inhibited bacterial growth, often with MIC values substantially &#x0003c;1000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> was particularly noteworthy, with MIC values of 230&#x02013;350&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL against <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>, <italic>Salmonella newport</italic>, <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. This species also had MICs 450&#x02013;950&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL against all other bacterial pathogens. <italic>B. obovata</italic> Engl. and <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> were also good inhibitors of bacterial growth, albeit with substantially higher MIC values than determined for <italic>T. carpentariae.</italic> The <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was also the best inhibitor of MS2 phage replication (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;427&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) and Caco2 and HeLa proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 885 and 85&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, respectively). None of the extracts were particularly strong inhibitors of <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> growth. All decoctions were nontoxic in the <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii and HDF cell viability bioassays, indicating their suitability for therapeutic use.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Griffith University</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that nearly nine million children under the age of five die every year as a result of diarrhoea [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite that report being more than a decade old, very little has changed in the interim, and diarrhoea remains the leading killer of children globally, accounting for approximately 9% of all deaths among children under the age of five [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This translates into more than 1400 young children dying each day, or about 530,000 children a year. To exacerbate this problem, many bacteria have developed resistance to conventional antibiotics, rendering them of little use against some diarrhoea-causing pathogens [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is an urgent need to develop new treatment options to combat these diseases through the development of novel drugs.</p><p>Plants have long been used in traditional healing systems to treat diarrhoea. These traditional medicines may be given as single-component therapies or they may be prescribed in combination to target the multiple negative effects of diarrhoea (loose stools, cramps, loss of electrolytes, and possible fever). The activity of several of the herbal preparations used traditionally to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal diseases has already been validated by rigorous scientific evaluation. This is particularly true for plant medicines used in traditional Indian healing systems (including Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, the potential of many Australian medicinal plants in alleviating the symptoms of diarrhoea and inhibiting the pathogenic causes has been relatively neglected.</p><p>Despite being one of the oldest continuous civilisations globally, far less information is available describing the ethnobotany of the First Australians than for many other ethnic groups globally. The First Australians had a good understanding of the medicinal properties of Australian plants and had used them successfully for at least 50,000 years to treat a variety of illnesses. However, little of this information has been recorded as the First Australians did not have a written language. Instead, traditional knowledge was passed between generations orally, and most ethnobotanical texts have collated data from the perspective of European settlers. As a result, substantial ethnobotanical information has been irretrievably lost. Furthermore, many of the seminal texts that summarise Aboriginal plant usage are old and difficult to access, taxonomic classifications are outdated and often dubious, and the information is incomplete. Compounding the problem, the First Australians consist of diverse groups, with individual communities having their own language, culture, customs, and belief systems, as well as their own traditional knowledge. Members of one language group were generally unable to communicate effectively with other groups. Within the language groupings, the First Australians are further divided into local groupings, which often had regional dialects, further complicating communication. Furthermore, many of the First Australian groups lived in isolation from other groups. As such, exchange of knowledge between groups was often not viable. Additionally, Torres Strait Islanders have distinct heritage from the Aborigines, with substantially different customs and traditional knowledge. Thus, plants used traditionally by one group of First Australians may not have been used for the same purposes by other groups. Despite this relative dearth of rigorous ethnobotanical studies on Australian flora, several studies have identified plant species with noteworthy antimicrobial activity. In particular, the ethnobotany of the inhabitants of Groote Eylandt has been relatively well recorded, allowing for selection of relevant species to treat microbial pathogens [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial pathogens are major causes of diarrhoea, and several studies have already screened Australian medicinal plants for antidiarrheal properties. Palombo and Semple investigated the growth inhibitory properties of extracts prepared from 39 Australian plant species against a panel of bacterial pathogens, including several diarrhoea-causing species [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. That study reported that several species had noteworthy inhibitory activity and highlighted <italic>Eremophila duttonii</italic> F. Muell. as having the greatest activity of the species tested. However, that study screened the plant extracts at a single dose (concentration not specified), and MIC values were not reported, making a comparison with other studies impossible. Furthermore, the Palombo and Semple study tested ethanolic extracts instead of the decoctions that were used by the First Australians. Therefore, whilst that study was interesting and highlighted several plants worthy of further evaluation, it did not validate the traditional use of those species to treat diarrhoea. Another study screened extracts prepared from 109 Australian plants for the ability to inhibit the growth of <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, which is one of the most common causes of acute enteritis in humans, and reported potent activity for many species [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. That study reported MIC values below 1000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL for all species against two <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains and similar potency against several other diarrhoea-causing bacteria. Several <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp. were amongst the most potent species tested in that study. Several recent studies have also reported good inhibitory activity for several high-antioxidant Australian plant species against multiple bacterial species, including diarrhoea-causing pathogens [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent study also tested <italic>Terminalia ferdinandiana</italic> Excell. extracts against multiresistant ESBL <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and reported MIC values as low as 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several studies have also reported good inhibitory activity for Australian plants against the gastrointestinal protozoal parasite <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study from our group reported notable antimicrobial activity for one of the species examined herein (<italic>B. obovata</italic>) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, all those studies examined extracts prepared under laboratory conditions using organic solvents and did not consider the traditional preparation methods.</p><p>Six plant species were selected for screening in our study, based on their ethnobotanical used. <italic>Buchanania obovata</italic> Engl. (family Anacardiaceae; commonly known as green plum and wild mango) is a small- to medium-sized tree native to the northern regions of the Northern Territory, Australia [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It produces small (1&#x02013;1.5&#x02009;cm diameter) fleshy green fruit that are high in antioxidants. As well as being considered as nutritious food, the First Australians used <italic>B. obovata</italic> as a bacteriocide to treat skin diseases and as a wound antiseptic, as well as for treating eye infections and diarrhoea [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>Casuarina equisetifolia</italic> L. (family Casuarinaceae; commonly known as whistling tree and Australian pine tree) is native to northern regions of Australia, as well as Papua New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves and inner cambium are used as traditional antiseptics on Groote Eylandt [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</italic> F. Muell. (family Myrtaceae; commonly known as Darwin stringybark and messmate) was also selected due to its traditional use as an antiseptic and to treat diarrhoea [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is a medium-sized tree with rough fibrous bark. Several parts of the tree, including the inner bark, leaves, and kinos have been used traditionally as antibacterial medicines [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>Planchonia careya</italic> (F. Muell.) R. Knuth. (family Lecythidaceae; commonly known as cocky apple and cockatoo apple) produces edible fruit that were prized by the First Australians. The cambium layer inside the bark and the leaves were used as medicines to treat skin diseases and diarrhoea [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The outer bark and the roots were also used as fish poison, indicating that they may also be useful in blocking cancer cell proliferation. <italic>Terminalia carpentariae</italic> C. T. White (family Combretaceae; commonly known as wild peach) is a small tree native to coastal regions of northern Australia. The edible fruit of this species have high antioxidant contents. The fruit, inner bark, and leaves were traditionally used to treat skin diseases and diarrhoea [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly<italic>, Vigna vexillata</italic> (L.) A. Rich. (family Fabaceae; commonly known as wild cowpea) is a climbing plant with a wide distribution. It is native to tropical regions globally, including northern regions of Australia. The root is used as food, whilst the cambium layer and the leaves are used to treat skin disorders and diarrhoea by Groote Eylandt Aborigines [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ethnobotanical uses of these plants indicate that they are good candidates for screening studies. Despite these, there are few reports confirming the bioactivities of these plants, and those studies that have been published invariably report on the activity of solvent extracts or essential oils. Studies testing these plants the way that they were originally used do not yet exist.</p><p>Diarrhoea may also be caused by nonbacterial pathogens. Gastrointestinal parasites, particularly protozoa (e.g., <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp., <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic>, <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, <italic>Blastocystis</italic> spp., and <italic>Cyclospora cayetanensis</italic>), also frequently cause diarrhoea. <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> and <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> infections are relatively frequent, especially in socioeconomically depressed regions and in rural areas [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. More than 280 million people per year are diagnosed with giardiasis internationally (WHO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/giardiasis/en/">http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/giardiasis/en/</ext-link>), accounting for a significant health burden. Despite this, the effects of traditional medicines on protozoal pathogens have been relatively neglected in diarrhoeal studies, with only a few studies screening Australian medicinal plants against <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, the effects of gastrointestinal viruses are poorly studied with very few studies reporting the potential of Australian plants to inhibit the replication of enteric viruses. The current study was undertaken to highlight plant species used by First Australian communities on Groote Eylandt against a panel of bacterial, protozoal, and viral gastrointestinal pathogens that cause diarrhoea. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of the extracts was also evaluated against a colorectal human cancer cell line as well as HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Site</title><p>Groote Eylandt is the largest island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and lies approximately 50&#x02009;km off the coast of mainland Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is within the Arnhem Land region of Australia and experiences tropical weather conditions for the entire year. Despite its proximity to the mainland and the close relationship of the Warnindhilyagwa people with the Nunggubuyu people on the mainland, the Warnindhilyagwa tribe have retained their own unique identity and much of their traditional knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Plant Species Selection</title><p>Few published resources on the traditional therapeutic use of plants by the First Australians exist, and we were only able to find a single ethnobotanical book devoted to the ethnobotany of Groote Eylandt [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. That book was used as a resource to narrow the focus and create a list of twenty plants used traditionally by the Warnindhilyagwa people to treat gastrointestinal illnesses, with an emphasis on diarrhoeal diseases. Where the usage of a plant was ambiguous, the species was excluded. This list was used to compare information obtained from informal ethnobotanical surveys conducted with a panel of Warnindhilyagwa elders. Six female tribal elders reputed to be knowledgeable about traditional medicines were surveyed to further shortlist the plants for study. The ethnobotany surveys adhered to all ethical principles in the Code of Ethics of the International Society of Ethnobotany [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The survey participants were asked to name plants that they knew to be useful to treat diarrhoea. Only those plant species that were named by at least four of the six survey participants were selected for further study. This listing was compared to the shortlist obtained with reference to Levitt [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and only species on both lists were included in our study. By this process, we narrowed the focus of the study to six species.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Plant Material and Extraction</title><p>Gayangwa Lalara and Gwen Lalara, elders of the Warnindhilyagwa tribe on Groote Eylandt, were consulted to identify local plant species that were traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal diseases by the Warnindhilyagwa people. <italic>Buchanania obovata</italic> Engl., <italic>Casuarina equisetifolia</italic> L., <italic>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</italic> F. Muell., <italic>Planchonia careya</italic> (F. Muell.) R. Knuth, <italic>Terminalia carpentariae</italic> C. T. White, and <italic>Vigna vexillata</italic> (L.) A. Rich. were highlighted as useful species to screen in this study. The tribal elders identified the trees, harvested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) and processed the plant material in November 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>), and prepared the decoctions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>) used in these studies. The plant species highlighted and collected on Groote Eylandt were initially identified by the tribe elders involved in the collection. High-definition photographs were taken of the entire plant as well as various morphological features (leaves, flowers, etc.) for confirmation identity. Additionally, further samples were collected for identification purposes. The identity of each species was later confirmed by botanists at the Darwin Botanical Gardens from the collected material and the photographs. Voucher specimens of all collected species are stored in the School of Environment and Science, Griffith University. All decoctions were prepared by traditional methods immediately after harvesting. The traditional preparation method was the same for all the collected materials or each plant material. Trunks of immature plant specimens were cut, and the outer bark was scraped away with a knife. The inner cambium layers were carefully collected and processed separately. The cambium of each species was pounded with the inner wood from which it was removed to soften it for extraction, and the cambium was teased apart into strands by hand to increase the surface area for extraction. Each of the plant materials was placed into individual bowls, and enough deionised water was added to just cover the plant material. The plant material was allowed to extract for an hour, and the decoction was decanted from the cambium into clean plastic bottles. The bottles were stored on ice for transport to the laboratory where they were filtered through Whatman No. 54 filter paper under vacuum. Aliquots (1&#x02009;mL) of each decoction were dried in preweighed 1.5&#x02009;mL microfuge tubes to determine the mass of extracted plant material/mL of decoction. The remaining aliquots of each extract were stored at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C until use.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were added dropwise to fresh nutrient broth, and the turbidity was visually adjusted to produce a McFarland number 1 standard culture. This was subsequently diluted 1 in 50 with nutrient broth, resulting in the MIC assay inoculum culture. A volume of 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L sterile broth was added to all wells of a 96-well plate.

Therefore, it is possible that this is a particularly resistant strain, and other <italic>E. coli</italic> strains may be inhibited by these decoctions.

Interestingly, both <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. and <italic>C. perfringens</italic> were resistant to these decoctions. As both <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> genera can form endospores, it is possible that these decoctions may still be effective against the planktonic form of the bacterium yet be ineffective against the endospores. Thus, even if they kill the vegetative cells, the bacterium may regrow from spores, thus masking any inhibition. Future studies are required to specifically test these decoctions against both vegetative cells and endospores.</p><p>The relative antimicrobial potency was further evaluated by determining the MIC values (<xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) for each extract against the bacterial species which were susceptible in the decoctions.

All decoctions were also screened for toxicity in an HDF cell viability assay. Exposure of the HDF to all decoctions resulted in &#x0003e;50% cell viability at 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, thus confirming that all decoctions were nontoxic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Recent increases in the rates of microbial resistance to clinically used antibiotics have rendered many frontline treatments to be ineffective against pathogenic diseases. This is particularly true for diarrhoea-causing pathogens. The gastrointestinal system is an ideal environment not only for microbial growth but also for the exchange of genetic information between different microbial strains, and even between different species. When a pathogen in this environment possesses antibiotic resistance genes, it can readily exchange those genes with other microbes, and individual pathogens can accumulate resistance to multiple conventional antibiotics. There is an urgent need to develop new antibiotic therapies to treat diseases caused by these pathogens. For reasons reviewed elsewhere [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the previous methods of antibiotic discovery are unlikely to yield many new antibiotics in the future, and medical science must explore new methods to treat pathogenic diseases. A reexamination of traditional medicine is an attractive option as many traditional medicines have been used effectively for hundreds or even thousands of years. Furthermore, this use has often been well documented, allowing for selection of traditional therapies for screening. Indeed, there has been a significant increase in published studies into traditional herbal therapies to treat pathogenic diseases in most regions of the world. In contrast, the traditional remedies used by the first Australians have been relatively neglected. This may be due to a less extensive reporting of Australian Aboriginal traditional remedies, which hampers studies based on directed species selection. However, the use of plant-based medicines by some groups of first Australians, including the tribes inhabiting Groote Eylandt, has been more extensively reported, allowing for more directed studies.</p><p>This study chose plant species that were recorded as being used traditionally by the Warnindhilyagwa tribe on Groote Eylandt to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal complaints. The list of identified plants was further focused following surveys and consultations with Warnindhilyagwa tribal elders. As this study aimed to validate the antipathogenic activity of the traditional Warnindhilyagwa therapies, we used decoctions prepared by the tribal elders by traditional methods and tested them undiluted, as they were used traditionally. The decoctions were initially screened against a panel of bacterial pathogens selected as they are all associated with diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disease. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a common trigger of diarrhoea, particularly in children [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (including <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>) are common causes of antibiotic-associated nosocomial diarrhoea [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. (including <italic>B. cereus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. (including <italic>C. perfringens</italic>) release diarrheagenic toxins in food poisoning cases [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> can cause shigellosis [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A recent outbreak of fatal diarrhoea was attributed to <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], whilst other food-borne strains including <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., <italic>A. faecalis</italic>, and <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] inhabit the lower gut and cause acute diarrhoea.</p><p>Most of the decoctions were effective at inhibiting microbial growth at low concentrations, with liquid dilution MIC values against the bacterial species that they inhibited generally substantially &#x0003c;1000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, indicating the noteworthy antimicrobial activity of these preparations. Interestingly, the tested decoctions were generally effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with similar efficacies. The ability of plant extracts to inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram negative-bacteria has been previously reported for other plants that have a history of medicinal usage for the treatment of microbial diseases. The antiseptic properties of the <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], <italic>Leptospermum</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and <italic>Syzygium</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] have been studied extensively and shown to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of bacteria. However, the equal or greater susceptibility of the Gram-negative bacterial species towards the plant extracts is noteworthy. This is in contrast to other previous studies which have reported a greater susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria towards solvent extracts for South American [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], African [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and Australian plant extracts [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], although other examples of Australian plant extracts which have a greater effects on Gram-negative bacteria have also been reported [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> and <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoctions were particularly good antibacterial agents, with MIC values generally &#x0003c;1000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL against most of the tested bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Whilst the MIC values reported in our study are noteworthy and validate the use of these plants for the treatment of bacterial diarrhoea, substantially higher MIC values are reported compared to several other Australian native plants. In particular, <italic>Terminalia ferdinandiana</italic> Excell. fruit and leaf extracts have been reported to have substantially lower MIC values against some gastrointestinal and diarrhoea-causing bacterial pathogens, with MIC values as low as 30&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL against some species [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> extracts were not only inhibitory against susceptible reference strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> but also had similar potency against extended spectrum beta-lactamase and methicillin-resistant strains, indicating that the extracts may function by distinct pathways, allowing them to bypass the bacterial resistance mechanisms [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. That study identified a diversity and relative abundance of tannins, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the extracts and deduced that they contribute to their antibacterial activity. The phytochemical constituents of the decoctions tested in our study are yet to be evaluated, and future studies are planned to assess this. Furthermore, further work is required to determine whether the decoctions tested in our study are also inhibitory towards resistant bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Most previous studies screening Australian plant extracts for potential in treating gastrointestinal and diarrhoeal diseases have myopically focused on only a few common bacterial pathogens and neglected pathogens such as <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>. However, these bacteria also cause a substantial incidence of gastrointestinal disease and should not be neglected. Notably, several of the decoctions studied herein had noteworthy activity against these bacteria. Similarly, most previous studies have also neglected testing against nonbacterial pathogens. The gastrointestinal protozoal pathogen <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> is particularly common and causes substantial illness globally. Indeed, approximately 280 million people per year were reported with giardiasis internationally in a 2013 study [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. All the decoctions tested in our study (except <italic>B. obovata</italic> and <italic>P. careya</italic>) significantly inhibited <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> proliferation when tested undiluted. However, none of the decoctions were particularly strong inhibitors of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> proliferation, and we were unable to determine IC<sub>50</sub> values for any extract as none inhibited proliferation by &#x0003e;50% at any concentration tested. This is in contrast to several other Australian plants for which good anti-Giardial activity has been reported. Notably, extracts produced from the fruit of <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> are strong inhibitors of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> growth, with IC<sub>50</sub> values as low as 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is therefore surprising that only low activity was noted for the <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> extract tested in this study. Notably, the previous study determined that the anti-Giardial activity of <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> corresponded to extracts rich in tannins, which are common to many <italic>Terminalia</italic> spp., including <italic>T. carpentariae</italic>. Subsequent studies have reported that the anti-Giardial activity of individual <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> components was potentiated by other extract components [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that even if the inhibitory components were present in the extract screened in this study, they may have only displayed weak activity if the potentiating components were absent. Of further note, fruit extracts were screened in the previous <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> studies, whereas cambium extracts were tested in this study. It is likely that the different plant parts may have substantial different phytochemical profiles, and this may account for the activity differences.</p><p>Several of the decoctions tested in this study displayed noteworthy inhibition of MS2 phage replication, with the <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction being the most potent (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;427&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL). This may indicate that this decoction would be particularly useful in treating gastrointestinal diseases caused by viral pathogens such as <italic>Norovirus</italic>. These results compare favourably to other studies, which have reported antiviral activity using MS2 assays. An earlier study from our group reported comparable inhibitory activity for <italic>Scaevola spinescens</italic> R.Br. against the same virus and classified it as strong antiviral activity [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Notably, that study used <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.) Kuntze as the positive control and reported a substantially lower anti-MS2 phage activity (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;600&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL). Our study chose to screen the decoctions against the MS2 bacteriophage as a model for viral pathogens. Whilst this virus has previously been reported to be a good model to indicate activity against RNA viruses [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we did not screen the decoctions against specific human viral pathogens, and further work is required to confirm the potential of these decoctions in treating viral gastrointestinal pathogens.</p><p>Antiproliferative activity against Caco2 (colorectal) and HeLa (cervical) carcinoma cell line cells was also noted for several of the decoctions, although the <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was the most potent inhibitor of proliferation against both cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values generally approximately 885 and 85&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL against Caco2 and HeLa cells, respectively. The antiproliferative activity of the <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was particularly noteworthy as colorectal cancers cause substantial mortality globally. Notably, anticancer activity has also been reported for related <italic>Terminalia</italic> spp. A recent study reported potent antiproliferative activity for <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> extracts, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of approximately 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL against Caco2 cells, which is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> screened in these studies [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Fruit and leaf extracts were tested in the <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> study, whereas cambium decoctions were tested in this study, which may account for these broad differences. Interestingly, the <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> study determined that the extracts induced their anticancer activity by elevating caspase-3 activity and inducing apoptosis. It is yet to be determined whether the same mechanisms are involved in the antiproliferative activity reported for the <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction tested herein, and future studies are required to address this. Similarly, the <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> study also identified a diversity of tannins and flavonoids as contributing to the anticancer activity of those extracts [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further study is required to determine if similar compounds contribute to the activity of the <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> extracts. The <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic> (450&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL)<italic>, E. tetrodonta</italic> (588&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL), and <italic>V. vexillata</italic> (126&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) decoctions were also good inhibitors of HeLa proliferation but were substantially less effective against Caco2 cells.</p><p>Identification of the specific components responsible for the antimicrobial activity reported in the plant decoctions tested herein was beyond the scope of our study, although all decoctions were abundant in phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins. Many studies have reported potent growth inhibitory activities for a wide variety of flavonoids against extensive bacterial panels [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similarly, several tannin compounds have bacterial growth inhibitory activity. Gallotannins have been reported to inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of bacterial species [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] through a variety of mechanisms including binding cell surface molecules including lipoteichoic acid and proline-rich cell surface proteins [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and by inhibiting glucosyltransferase enzymes [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Ellagitannins are also highly potent inhibitors of bacterial growth, with MIC values as low as 63&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Ellagitannins have also been reported to function via several antibiotic mechanisms including interaction with cytoplasmic oxidoreductases and by disrupting bacterial cell walls [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that multiple compounds within the tested decoctions contribute to the antimicrobial properties of these extracts.</p><p>The findings reported here also show that none of the decoctions displayed significant toxicity towards <italic>A. franciscana</italic> or HDFs. Whilst this indicates that these decoctions are safe to use therapeutically, further toxicity studies using other human cell lines are needed to further evaluate the suitability of the decoctions for medicinal purposes. The results of this study indicate that all the decoctions screened in this report are worthy of further study due to their antipathogenic activities and their abilities to block cancer cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study partially validate the traditional usage of several native Groote Eylandt plant decoctions to treat pathogenic diarrhoeal diseases and cancer, indicating that they warrant further study. The potential of <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> in the treatment of bacterial diarrhoea was particularly evident, with MIC values 230&#x02013;350&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL recorded for <italic>C. freundii</italic>, <italic>S. newport</italic>, <italic>S. sonnei</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Notably, <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> also displayed noteworthy inhibitory activity (MICs 450&#x02013;950&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) against all other bacterial pathogens. <italic>B. obovata</italic> Engl. and <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> were also good inhibitors of bacterial growth, albeit with substantially higher MIC values than determined for <italic>T. carpentariae.</italic> The <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was also the best inhibitor of MS2 phage replication (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;427&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) and Caco2 and HeLa proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 885 and 85&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, respectively). None of the extracts were particularly strong inhibitors of <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> growth, indicating that none of these plants would be useful against giardiasis. From these results, <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> stands out as the most promising species for further study. Bioactivity-driven purifications of the active components and an examination of the mechanisms of action of these agents are required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Gayangwa Lalara and Gwen Lalara and other members of the Warnindhilyagwa tribe of Groote Eylandt for identifying and providing the plant material used in this study.
