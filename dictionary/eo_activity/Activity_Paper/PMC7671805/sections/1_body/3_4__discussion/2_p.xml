<p>This study chose plant species that were recorded as being used traditionally by the Warnindhilyagwa tribe on Groote Eylandt to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal complaints. The list of identified plants was further focused following surveys and consultations with Warnindhilyagwa tribal elders. As this study aimed to validate the antipathogenic activity of the traditional Warnindhilyagwa therapies, we used decoctions prepared by the tribal elders by traditional methods and tested them undiluted, as they were used traditionally. The decoctions were initially screened against a panel of bacterial pathogens selected as they are all associated with diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disease. 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a common trigger of diarrhoea, particularly in children [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>) are common causes of antibiotic-associated nosocomial diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. (including 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. (including 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic>) release diarrheagenic toxins in food poisoning cases [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> can cause shigellosis [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A recent outbreak of fatal diarrhoea was attributed to 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], whilst other food-borne strains including 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., 
 <italic>A. faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] inhabit the lower gut and cause acute diarrhoea.
