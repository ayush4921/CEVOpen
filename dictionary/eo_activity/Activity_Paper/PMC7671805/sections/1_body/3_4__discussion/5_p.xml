<p>Most previous studies screening Australian plant extracts for potential in treating gastrointestinal and diarrhoeal diseases have myopically focused on only a few common bacterial pathogens and neglected pathogens such as 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>. However, these bacteria also cause a substantial incidence of gastrointestinal disease and should not be neglected. Notably, several of the decoctions studied herein had noteworthy activity against these bacteria. Similarly, most previous studies have also neglected testing against nonbacterial pathogens. The gastrointestinal protozoal pathogen 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> is particularly common and causes substantial illness globally. Indeed, approximately 280 million people per year were reported with giardiasis internationally in a 2013 study [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. All the decoctions tested in our study (except 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> and 
 <italic>P. careya</italic>) significantly inhibited 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> proliferation when tested undiluted. However, none of the decoctions were particularly strong inhibitors of 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> proliferation, and we were unable to determine IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for any extract as none inhibited proliferation by &gt;50% at any concentration tested. This is in contrast to several other Australian plants for which good anti-Giardial activity has been reported. Notably, extracts produced from the fruit of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> are strong inhibitors of 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> growth, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values as low as 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is therefore surprising that only low activity was noted for the 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> extract tested in this study. Notably, the previous study determined that the anti-Giardial activity of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> corresponded to extracts rich in tannins, which are common to many 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> spp., including 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic>. Subsequent studies have reported that the anti-Giardial activity of individual 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> components was potentiated by other extract components [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that even if the inhibitory components were present in the extract screened in this study, they may have only displayed weak activity if the potentiating components were absent. Of further note, fruit extracts were screened in the previous 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> studies, whereas cambium extracts were tested in this study. It is likely that the different plant parts may have substantial different phytochemical profiles, and this may account for the activity differences.
