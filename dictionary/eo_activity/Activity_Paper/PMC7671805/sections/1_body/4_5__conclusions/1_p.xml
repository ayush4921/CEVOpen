<p>The results of this study partially validate the traditional usage of several native Groote Eylandt plant decoctions to treat pathogenic diarrhoeal diseases and cancer, indicating that they warrant further study. The potential of 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> in the treatment of bacterial diarrhoea was particularly evident, with MIC values 230–350 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL recorded for 
 <italic>C. freundii</italic>, 
 <italic>S. newport</italic>, 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Notably, 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> also displayed noteworthy inhibitory activity (MICs 450–950 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) against all other bacterial pathogens. 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> Engl. and 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> were also good inhibitors of bacterial growth, albeit with substantially higher MIC values than determined for 
 <italic>T. carpentariae.</italic> The 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was also the best inhibitor of MS2 phage replication (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 427 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and Caco2 and HeLa proliferation (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 885 and 85 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively). None of the extracts were particularly strong inhibitors of 
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> growth, indicating that none of these plants would be useful against giardiasis. From these results, 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> stands out as the most promising species for further study. Bioactivity-driven purifications of the active components and an examination of the mechanisms of action of these agents are required.
