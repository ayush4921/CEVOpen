<p>Diarrhoea may also be caused by nonbacterial pathogens. Gastrointestinal parasites, particularly protozoa (e.g.,

 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, 
 <italic>Blastocystis</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Cyclospora cayetanensis</italic>), also frequently cause diarrhoea. 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> and 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> infections are relatively frequent, especially in socioeconomically depressed regions and in rural areas [

Despite this, the effects of traditional medicines on protozoal pathogens have been relatively neglected in diarrhoeal studies, with only a few studies screening Australian medicinal plants against

Similarly, the effects of gastrointestinal viruses are poorly studied with very few studies reporting the potential of Australian plants to inhibit the replication of enteric viruses. The current study was undertaken to highlight plant species used by First Australian communities on Groote Eylandt against a panel of bacterial, protozoal, and viral gastrointestinal pathogens that cause diarrhoea. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of the extracts was also evaluated against a colorectal human cancer cell line as well as HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line for comparison.
