<p>The MS2 bacteriophage and F + Amp + 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> used in this study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The clinical 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strain used in this study was obtained from Michelle Mendell, Griffith University. A volume of 30 mL of nutrient broth (Oxoid, Australia) containing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) was inoculated with 1 mL of F + Amp + 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> culture and incubated for 2 h at 37°C to reach the log phase. A volume of 1 mL MS2 virus stock solution (containing approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units) was subsequently added to the bacterial culture and incubated overnight at 37°C. The following day, the bacterial cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant (containing free MS2 phage) was collected, passed through a 22 
 <italic>μ</italic>m Sarstedt filter, and stored at 4°C until use.
