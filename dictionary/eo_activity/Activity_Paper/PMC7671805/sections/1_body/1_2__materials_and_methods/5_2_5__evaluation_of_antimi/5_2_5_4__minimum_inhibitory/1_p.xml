<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration for each extract was determined using two methods. Colorimetric liquid dilution MIC assays were used as they are sensitive measures of bacterial growth inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is a commonly used method of quantifying bacterial growth inhibition efficacy, allowing for comparisons with other studies. A solid-phase agar disc diffusion assay was also used in this study as a comparison and as a closer representation of solid-phase infections.
