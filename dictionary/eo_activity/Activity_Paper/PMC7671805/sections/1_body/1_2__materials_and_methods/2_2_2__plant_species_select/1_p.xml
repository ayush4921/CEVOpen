<p>Few published resources on the traditional therapeutic use of plants by the First Australians exist, and we were only able to find a single ethnobotanical book devoted to the ethnobotany of Groote Eylandt [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. That book was used as a resource to narrow the focus and create a list of twenty plants used traditionally by the Warnindhilyagwa people to treat gastrointestinal illnesses, with an emphasis on diarrhoeal diseases. Where the usage of a plant was ambiguous, the species was excluded. This list was used to compare information obtained from informal ethnobotanical surveys conducted with a panel of Warnindhilyagwa elders. Six female tribal elders reputed to be knowledgeable about traditional medicines were surveyed to further shortlist the plants for study. The ethnobotany surveys adhered to all ethical principles in the Code of Ethics of the International Society of Ethnobotany [

Only those plant species that were named by at least four of the six survey participants were selected for further study. This listing was compared to the shortlist obtained with reference to Levitt [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and only species on both lists were included in our study. By this process, we narrowed the focus of the study to six species.
