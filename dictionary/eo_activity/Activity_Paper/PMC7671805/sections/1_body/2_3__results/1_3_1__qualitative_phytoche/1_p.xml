<p>The decoctions prepared traditionally from the individual cambiums yielded preparations with varying concentrations (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The concentrations of the decoctions were relatively consistent (generally 1–4 mg/mL) for most of the plant species. However, substantially higher concentrations were noted for the 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> and 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoctions (7.8 and 10.2 mg/mL, respectively). Phytochemical studies (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) showed that all the decoctions contained similar classes of phytochemicals. All contained high relative abundances of phenolics and (with the exception of 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic>) moderate to high levels of tannins. Flavonoids were present in low to moderate abundance across all extracts, and saponins were noted in most decoctions (except 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic>). All other phytochemical classes were either missing or in low abundance in all decoctions.
