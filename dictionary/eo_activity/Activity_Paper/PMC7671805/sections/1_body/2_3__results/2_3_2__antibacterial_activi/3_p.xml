<p>The relative antimicrobial potency was further evaluated by determining the MIC values (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) for each extract against the bacterial species which were susceptible in the decoctions. With some notable exceptions, most of these decoctions were effective at inhibiting microbial growth at low concentrations, with liquid dilution MIC values against the bacterial species that they inhibited generally substantially &lt;1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, indicating the noteworthy antimicrobial activity of these preparations. The 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was a particularly good inhibitor of bacterial growth, with MIC values &lt;1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against all bacteria tested. 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> was also a good antibacterial agent against most bacteria. Only 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> had an MIC &gt;1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against this decoction, and its MIC of 1712 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL still indicates moderate activity. In contrast to the other decoctions, the 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic> preparation had only low to moderate antibacterial activity, with MIC values 1750–2850 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Whilst these values indicate that the 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic> decoction may still be useful in treating gastrointestinal bacterial infections, they would be less effective than the other extracts.
