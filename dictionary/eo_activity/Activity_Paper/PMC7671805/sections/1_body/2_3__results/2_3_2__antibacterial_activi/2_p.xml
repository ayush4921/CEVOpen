<p>The 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta, T. carpentariae</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoctions were also broad-spectrum inhibitors of Gram-positive bacteria, each inhibiting all of the bacteria tested. In contrast, 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>P. careya</italic> decoctions inhibited the growth of 50% of the Gram-positive bacterial species tested. Interestingly, both 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic> were resistant to these decoctions. As both 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> genera can form endospores, it is possible that these decoctions may still be effective against the planktonic form of the bacterium yet be ineffective against the endospores. Thus, even if they kill the vegetative cells, the bacterium may regrow from spores, thus masking any inhibition. Future studies are required to specifically test these decoctions against both vegetative cells and endospores.
