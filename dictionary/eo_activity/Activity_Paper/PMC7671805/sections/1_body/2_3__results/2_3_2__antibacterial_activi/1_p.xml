<p>Aliquots (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) of each extract were tested in the disc diffusion assay against panels of Gram-negative (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and Gram-positive bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). All the decoctions possessed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity. Indeed, the 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta, P. careya,</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoctions each inhibited all the Gram-negative bacteria species tested. The 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was resistant to the 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoctions, although all other Gram-negative bacterial species tested were inhibited by these decoctions. It is noteworthy that the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain tested in this study was also relatively resistant to the other decoctions as only relatively small ZOIs were measured against those decoctions. Therefore, it is possible that this is a particularly resistant strain, and other 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains may be inhibited by these decoctions. Further work is required to test these decoctions against other 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains.
