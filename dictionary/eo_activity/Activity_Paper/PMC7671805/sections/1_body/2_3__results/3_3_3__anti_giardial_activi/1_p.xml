<p>The extracts were screened for their ability to inhibit 
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Whilst the 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta, T. carpentariae</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoctions displayed significant inhibitory activity, the level of inhibition was relatively low (20â€“40% inhibition of control proliferation), indicating only weak growth inhibitory activity. As the inhibition of 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> growth did not exceed 50% at any concentration tested for these preparations, it was not possible to determine IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for these extracts (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> decoction also displayed apparent inhibition (approximately 7% inhibition) of 
 <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> growth. However, this inhibition was not statistically significant.
