<p id="Par13">HPTLC analysis was carried out by the CAMAG HPTLC system (Switzerland). Samples were applied using CAMAG ATS 4 auto sampler on aluminum backed pre-coated silica gel 60F
 <sub>254</sub> HPTLC plate (Merck India). Mobile phase was optimized as toluene, ethyl acetate, and methanol in the ratio of 7:3:1. The chromatogram was developed in a saturated Twin Trough chromatographic chamber (Camag, Switzerland) and was visualized under UV-chamber (254 and 366 nm) and in visible light after derivatizing with anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating at 105 °C for 5 min.
