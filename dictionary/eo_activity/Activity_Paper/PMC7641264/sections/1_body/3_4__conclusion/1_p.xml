<p>The traditional healers of Kikwit (DRC) use 23 plant species in the management of sickle cell disease. Eighteen plant species showed a high antisickling activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with a normalized rate of at least 70%. The present results validate and support the local uses of plants in the treatment of diseases, especially sickle cell disease. Most of these plants have already been cited for their antisickling activity in other parts of the DRC and in the literature. Two species including 
 <italic>Alternanthera bettzickiana</italic> and 
 <italic>Dissotis brazzae</italic> deserve in-depth investigations to meet scientific demands for clinical studies. Furthermore, it is crucial to isolate their bioactive compounds in order to understand their pharmacological mechanisms.
