<p>SCD is a painful disease due to a genetic mutation conducting to the substitution of a polar amino acid (glutamic acid) by a nonpolar one (valine) on the sixth position of the beta-globin chain [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This change decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Furthermore, this structural modification influences the solubility of hemoglobin conducting abnormal hemoglobin, hemoglobin S (HbS), to polymerize inside the erythrocytes into a gel or further into fibers, causing the change of the red blood cell (RBC) shape from the normal biconcave form into the sickle form in hypoxic conditions. The HbS polymerization and the sickling of the RBC are responsible for sickle cell disease to basic pathological processes, the painful vaso-occlusive crises, and chronic hemolytic anemia. The occlusion of microvessels' circulation leads to chronic tissue ischemia and infarction affecting the bone, lungs, brain, kidneys, or spleen that conduct to complications in sickle cell disease [
