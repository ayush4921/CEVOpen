<p>These curves show that the percentage of the drepanocytes, which return to the normal shape, increases with the extract concentration indicating that the normalization rate is dose-dependent. The minimal concentration of normalization (MCN) obtained is 0.9 and 11.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL with a maximal normalization rate (NRmax) of 90 and 86% for 
 <italic>D. brazzae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bettzickiana</italic>, respectively. This indicates that the aqueous extract of the two plants has very high NRmax with low MCN, but 
 <italic>D. brazzae</italic> is a little more active than 
 <italic>A. bettzickiana</italic>. The same behavior was found in other Congolese medicinal plants used in the management of sickle cell disease, but the obtained value of MCN and NRmax depends on the plant species [
