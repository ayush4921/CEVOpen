<p>Values (means ± S.D) in 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> show a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the negative control compared to values from the two extracts. This confirms the antisickling activity of these plant aqueous extracts. Furthermore, the values obtained from the two plant extracts are in the same range to those obtained in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Used software cannot calculate the radius of untreated sickle red blood cells because the shape of cells was elongated, not circular. However, in the presence of plant extracts, cell shape becomes circular, and the radius could be calculated.
