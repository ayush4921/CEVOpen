<p>Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] were able to establish the optimal culture conditions for mycelial growth of 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> at 25 Â°C and pH 6.0. This species was successfully grown on sawdust, with biological efficiency of 100% [
 <xref rid="B70-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The addition of 10% rice bran to oak sawdust stimulated mycelial growth since it may contain ingredients favourable for mycelial growth for 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> [
