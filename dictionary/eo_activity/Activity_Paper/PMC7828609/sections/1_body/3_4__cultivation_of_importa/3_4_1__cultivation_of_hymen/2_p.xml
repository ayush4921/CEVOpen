 <italic>Hymenopellis raphanipes</italic> is commercially cultivated in China by the local name “Heipijizong” or “Black Termite Mushroom”. It was previous misidentified as 
 <italic>H. furfuracea, H. radicata, Termitomyces fuliginosus</italic> or 
 <italic>T. badius</italic>. Hao et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] correctly identified this mushroom by using morphologic and phylogenetic (ITS and nrLSU) analyses. The results clarified the phylogenetic position and taxonomy of “Heipijizong” as 
 <italic>H. raphanipes.</italic> To increase production for large scale cultivation, the use of liquid culture fermentation and optimization of culture conditions of fermentation technology was studied by Ning et al. [
