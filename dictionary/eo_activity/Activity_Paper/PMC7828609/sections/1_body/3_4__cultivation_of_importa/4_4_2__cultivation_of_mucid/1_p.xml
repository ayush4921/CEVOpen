 <xref rid="B75-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. It can also successfully grow in nutrient media for mycelial growth. Musilek et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] grew this species on glucose-corn-steep media containing 30 or 50 g glucose, 15 g corn-steep (~50 dry weight), 1.5 g MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>.7H
 <sub>2</sub>O per liter of water with the pH 5.5. This species was successfully cultivated in oak sawdust mixed with rice bran (20–30%) in the bottle at 25 °C, incubated in the dark [
 <xref rid="B71-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The mycelia then colonized the media from the top to bottom. The bottles were exposed under 12 h of light (350 lux) and dark having a relative humidity of 95% at 17 °C. The primordia were observed after 7 days of incubation. They then developed into mature fruiting bodies after 7 days [
