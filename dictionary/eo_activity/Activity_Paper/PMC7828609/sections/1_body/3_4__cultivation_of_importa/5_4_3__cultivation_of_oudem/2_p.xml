<p>Among the species of 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic>, 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic> is the most commonly cultivated. It can be grown in different biomass, since this species is able to colonize several kinds of plant. Silveira Ruegger et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] cultivated 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic> strain CCB179 in polypropylene bags in two different substrates (200 g), sugar-cane bagasse and eucalyptus sawdust incorporated with wheat bran (50 g). The composts were sterilized at 121 °C for an hour and were later inoculated with 3 g of spawn. The bags were incubated at 25 °C until the basidiomata primordia formed. Mushroom growing in sugar-cane bagasse resulted in higher biological efficiency (55.66%) as compared with eucalyptus sawdust supplemented with wheat bran (19.51%). Lignocellulosic wastes such as cottonseed hull and corn-comb can also be used as substrates in cultivating 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic>. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] used these lignocellulosic wastes as base substrates for the cultivation of 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic>. The addition of wheat bran and lime in the substrates provide nitrogen and adjusted the pH of the substrates. 1000 g of substrate were prepared in each bag with water content adjusted to 65% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>). The substrates were then inoculated with spawn at 2% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>). The bags were then incubated at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity (RH) in the dark room. Among the substrates cotton-hull (80%) resulted in highest biological efficiency (113.64) and essential amino acid contents. The combination of cottonseed hull (80%) supplemented with 8% wheat bran and 2% lime can give a high yield of basidiomata and should be extended in future use [
