<p>In general, these properties have made the strobilurins one of the most commercially successful natural product based class of agrochemicals and products from all the major agro-companies, which have distributed them for decades. However, the pathogenic fungi and oomycetes have increasingly developed resistance against the beta-methoxy-acrylates, and therefore it is advisable to use them in combination with other antifungal agents [

It is urgent to develop new antifungal pesticides in the near future based on different compound classes and with different modes of action, and fungi appear to be a very promising source for these. Therefore, the quest for antifungal metabolites from hitherto untapped sources should be intensified.
