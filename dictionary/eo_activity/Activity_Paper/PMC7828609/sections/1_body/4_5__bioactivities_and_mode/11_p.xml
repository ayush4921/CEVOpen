<p>Edible mushrooms have the ability to stimulate the immune system by exerting effects on cellular activities, producing secondary metabolites that boost the immune system, modulate humoral and cellular immunity, and potentiate antimutagenic and antitumorigenic activity, as well as rejuvenating the immune system destroyed by radiation and chemotherapy in cancer treatment, usually linked to β-glucans [

 <xref rid="B126-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Specifically, β-glucan, a water-soluble polysaccharide, activates immune cells and proteins and macrophages, T cells, natural killer cells, and cytokines that attack tumor cells [
