<p>Many studies have been conducted on the anti-oxidant and anti-cancer properties of other oudemansielloid species, which cannot be explained by the presence of strobilurins. As early as 1987, 
 <italic>Mucidula mucida</italic> extracts demonstrated inhibitory effect on sarcoma 180 and Erhrlich carcinoma of mice [

 <italic>Oudemansiella canarii</italic> has moderate anticancer and anti-oxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B96-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, total antioxidant activity and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethyl benzothiaoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays were used to determine anti-oxidation properties of the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B117-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. HPLC analysis was also used to record and analyse phenolic fingerprints. Acharya et al. [
 <xref rid="B117-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] were able to quantify the DPPH radical scavenging activity using EC
 <sub>50</sub> at 0.912 µg/mL. The total antioxidant activity was 15.33 µg ascorbic acid equivalent/mg of extract. ABTS revealed 12.91 µm TE/mg of extract antioxidant activity. 
 <italic>Oudemansiella canarii</italic> can therefore be a novel source of antioxidants with functional food and supplement applications. An ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>O. canarii</italic> was active against enzyme TryR from 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7- breast, TK-10- renal and UACC-62-melanoma) and phytopathogenic fungus 
 <italic>Cladosporium sphaerospermum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B96-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, in its activity against three cancer cell lines, it was noted that it exhibited a degree of selectivity against UACC-62, 2–3 times more active as compared with MCF-7 and TK-10. As an important note, the extract was inactive in lymphocyte proliferation assays, thus indicating that this compound has a low level of toxicity to normal human cells. It is therefore likely to be safe when used and developed in pharmaceutical applications [
