<p>The enzymatic- and acid- hydrolysed mycelia polysaccharides (En-MPS and Ac-MPS) from 
 <italic>Hymenopellis radicata</italic> on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mice was tested for their antioxidative and pulmonary protective effects [
 <xref rid="B118-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. En-MPS has more antioxidative effect than Ac-MPS. Selenium polysaccharides were also produced by 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic>. The hydrolysates (enzymatic-SPS) and acidic-SPS) were acquired by enzymolysis and acidolysis. The in vivo mice experiments showed that the enzymatic-SPS displayed higher antioxidant and protective effects against the lipo-poly-ssachardide-toxicities than selenium polysaccharides and acidic-SPS by increasing the antioxidant activities and reducing lipid peroxidation. Enzymatic-SPS also helps improve the inflammatory response which could aid in improving kidney and lung functions. This shows that the polysaccharides by 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> might be apt for functional foods. They can also be developed as natural drugs in preventing the endo-toxemia and its complications [
