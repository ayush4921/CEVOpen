<p>Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] proposed a taxonomic classification for the genus 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> s.s., which was divided into four sections, i.e
 <italic>., Oudemansiella</italic>, 
 <italic>Mucidula</italic>, 
 <italic>Dactylosporina</italic> and 
 <italic>Radicatae</italic>. Section 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> comprised tropical to south temperate species, e.g., 
 <italic>O. platensis, O. australis, O. canarii</italic> and 
 <italic>O. crassifolia</italic>. The distinguishing characteristics of this group was the ixotrichoderm pileipellis composed of filamentous hyphae often intermixed with chains of inflated cells. The section 
 <italic>Mucidula</italic> on the other hand was characterised by an ixohymeniderm-trichoderm pileipellis composed of more or less clavate terminal cells and encompassed north temperate and subtropical taxa (e.g., 
 <italic>O. mucida</italic>, 
 <italic>O. venosolamellata</italic> and 
 <italic>O. submucida</italic>). Sections 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> and 
 <italic>Mucidula</italic> shared similar habitats, growing on exposed rotten wood. Their basidiomata were with or without a (rudimentary) annulus on the stipe. Section 
 <italic>Dactylosporina</italic> accommodated species from South and Central America with basidiospores that had finger-like ornamentation. Section 
 <italic>Radicatae</italic>, represented by 
 <italic>O. radicata</italic> and its allies, was the largest section and included the remaining species of the genus in its restricted sense.
