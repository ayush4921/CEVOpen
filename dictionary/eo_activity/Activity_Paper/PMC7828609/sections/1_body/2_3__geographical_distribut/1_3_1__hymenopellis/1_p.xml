 <italic>Hymenopellis</italic> species are widely distributed in eastern and north America [
 <xref rid="B49-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the distribution is well documented in these areas, they can also be found in other continents. Many species of 
 <italic>Hymenopellis</italic> were first documented in Asia. For instance, 
 <italic>H. amygdaliformis</italic> and 
 <italic>H. velata</italic> were first found in China [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], 
 <italic>H. aureocystidiata, H. japonica, H. orientalis</italic> and 
 <italic>H. vinocontusa</italic> in Japan, and 
 <italic>H. endochorda</italic> in Sri Lanka [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>Hymenopellis chiangmaiae</italic> was first recorded in Thailand but was later synonymized under 
 <italic>H. raphanipes</italic> by Petersen and Hughes [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several species of the genus have also been discovered in Australia. These are 
 <italic>H. eradicata, H. gigaspora, H. mundroola, H. superbiens, H. trichofera</italic> and 
 <italic>H. variabilis</italic>. Other species are distributed almost worldwide, such as 
 <italic>H. radicata.</italic> This fungus occurs in Europe and North America and can also be found in northern Africa, in extreme western Asia and Asia minor [

 <xref rid="B50-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. 
 <italic>Hymenopellis raphanipes</italic> was first described from India [
 <xref rid="B51-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and has also been reported from Australia, China, India, Japan and Thailand [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Basidiomata of 
 <italic>Hymenopellis</italic> can grow solitary or gregarious on dead or buried hardwoods, and occasionally on exposed, well-decayed wood. They can appear as growing from the ground because of their long deep tap-root like pseudorhiza attached to the decayed wood underground [
