<p>The bio-synthethic gene cluster for strobilurin was first identified from 
 <italic>Strobilurus</italic> sp.; however, its detailed molecular biosynthesis remains cryptic. Nofiani et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] reported the biosynthesis of strobilurin using 
 <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> by identifying the biosynthesis gene cluster, which encodes the highly reducing polyketide synthase. The synthesis is via a novel route initiated with benzoyl CoA molecules rather than the usual acetyl unit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f009">Figure 9</xref>). The compound is formed by the degradation of phenylalanine via cinnamate [
 <xref rid="B99-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. As the core polyketide chain is formed, it undergoes a complex rearrangement to make the β-meth-oxy-acrylate toxophore. The antifungal activity of strobilurins is brought about by the β-methoxy-acrylate toxophore preventing the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by targeting the Qo site of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain [
