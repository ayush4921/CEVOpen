<p>The synthesis of dihydroxerulin was first described by Siegel and Br√ºckner [
 <xref rid="B132-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. It began with stereoselective preparations of phosphorus ylide 1 and lactone aldehyde 2 and ended with a Wittig reaction between these entities. The process resulted in the formation of up to 30% of the trans Z isomer 3, along with up to 25% of a mixture of at least two stereoisomers. The same researchers synthesized xerulin via a convergent route and were able to get the pure form of the compound [

 <xref rid="B133-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] was accomplished from commercially available (E)-1-bromopropene, acetylene, and propynoic acid with 30% overall yield and &gt;96% stereoselectivity.
