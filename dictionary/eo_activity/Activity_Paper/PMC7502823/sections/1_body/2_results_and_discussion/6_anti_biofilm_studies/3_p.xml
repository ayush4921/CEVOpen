<p id="par0165">Quorum sensing (QS) is a signaling mechanism to establish communication between bacterial complexes, through the cell to cell signaling. Several strategies are adopted to interfere with the quorum sensing of the bacterial complex, namely, signal molecule inactivation, including quorum sensing disruption through inhibition of signal molecule biosynthesis and blockade of signal transduction [
