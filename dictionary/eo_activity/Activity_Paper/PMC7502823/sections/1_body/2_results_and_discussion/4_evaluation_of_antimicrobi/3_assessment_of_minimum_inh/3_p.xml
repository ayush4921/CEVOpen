<p id="par0145">The MBC test results showed that these extracts have bactericidal activity on the MRSA ranging from 500 μg/mL to &gt;2 mg/mL. The MIC and MBC results are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The MBC results revealed that pet.ether extract of

 <italic>P. guajava</italic> showed the lowest MBC readings with the value of 500 μg/mL. The MBC results of these extracts inveterate their bactericidal activity, which is generally two to four times greater than their corresponding MIC values.
