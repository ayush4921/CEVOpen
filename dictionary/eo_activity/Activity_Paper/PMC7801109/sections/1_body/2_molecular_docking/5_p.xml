<p>Inspection of the docking poses for the two examined compounds revealed their ability to fit perfectly in the active site of the DprE1 enzyme establishing different types of interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">5</xref>). The oxindole ring in both compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> was engaged in two H-bond interactions 
 <italic>via</italic> its carbonyl oxygen (C = O) functionality with His-132 and Tyr-415 amino acids. Furthermore, the NH of the hydrazide linker and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring were involved in H-bond interactions with His-132 and Asn-385, respectively. Moreover, the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring in compound 
 <bold>5h</bold> achieved an extra hydrogen bond interaction with Cys-387 which may explain its higher energy score than 
 <bold>5g</bold>. Worthy of note, the 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl group of compound 
 <bold>5h</bold> established several hydrophobic interactions with non-polar residues lining a hydrophobic pocket, such as Pro-116, Val-121, Ile-131, and Ala-417.
