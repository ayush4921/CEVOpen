<p>Along with the emerged drug resistance, the development of secondary bacterial infection is considered to be a critical problem

 </xref>. Unfortunately, many virulent bacterial strains have developed bacterial resistance against most of the currently used antibiotics. The death rate due to bronchitis has been increased up to an alarming level recording about 0.7 million cases of death every year. Thus, there is a crucial need to design and synthesise new candidates that may help in the battle of the developed bacterial resistance towards the currently available anti-tubercular and antibacterial drugs.
