<p>I.R. spectra have been recorded on Schimadzu FT-IR 8400S spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker-Avance 400 spectrometer. 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectra were run at 100 MHz in deuterated dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub>). Chemical shifts (

 <italic>)</italic>. NMR analyses were carried out at the NMR Unit, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt, whereas IR analyses were carried out at the Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt. Elemental analyses were carried out at the Regional Centre for Microbiology and Biotechnology, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt. Compounds
