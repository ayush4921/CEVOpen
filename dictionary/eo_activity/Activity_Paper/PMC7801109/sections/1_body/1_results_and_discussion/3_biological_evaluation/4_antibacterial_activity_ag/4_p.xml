<p>Moreover, compound 
 <bold>5k</bold> showed MIC values (0.98-3.9 µg/mL) less than that expressed by Azithromycin (MIC = 1.95–7.81 µg/mL) against four bacterial strains: 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 15531), 
 <italic>H. influenza</italic>, 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> (ATCC 25238) and 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> (ATCC 9340). Also, compound 
 <bold>5j</bold> was as potent as the reference drug against 
 <italic>H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 43816), 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> (ATCC 25238), and 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> (ATCC 9340). Furthermore, compounds 
 <bold>5f</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> were two-fold more potent (with MIC = 1.95 µg/mL) than Azithromycin (MIC = 3.9 µg/mL) against 
 <italic>H. influenza</italic> (ATCC 10211) and 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> (ATCC 9340) and equipotent to Azithromycin against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 43816) with MIC = 0.49 µg/mL. Finally, derivatives 
 <bold>5a</bold>, 
 <bold>5b</bold>, and 
 <bold>5d</bold> produced the same MIC values = 0.49 µg/mL as that expressed by the standard drug against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 43816).
