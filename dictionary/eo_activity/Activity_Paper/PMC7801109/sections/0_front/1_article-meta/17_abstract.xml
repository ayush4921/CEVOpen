 <p>Joining the global fight against Tuberculosis, the world's most deadly infectious disease, herein we present the design and synthesis of novel isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids (
  <bold>5a–m</bold> and 
  <bold>9a–c</bold>) as promising anti-tubercular and antibacterial agents. The anti-tubercular activity of the target hybrids was evaluated against drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis strain (ATCC 27294) where hybrids 
  <bold>5d</bold>, 
  <bold>5g</bold> and 
  <bold>5h</bold> were found to be as potent as INH with MIC = 0.24 µg/mL, also the activity was evaluated against Isoniazid/Streptomycin resistant M. tuberculosis (ATCC 35823) where compounds 
  <bold>5g</bold> and 
  <bold>5h</bold> showed excellent activity (MIC = 3.9 µg/mL). Moreover, the target hybrids were examined against six bronchitis causing-bacteria. Most derivatives exhibited excellent antibacterial activity. K. pneumonia emerged as the most sensitive strain with MIC range: 0.49–7.81 µg/mL. Furthermore, a molecular docking study has proposed DprE1 as a probable enzymatic target for herein reported isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids, and explored the binding interactions within the vicinity of DprE1 active site.
