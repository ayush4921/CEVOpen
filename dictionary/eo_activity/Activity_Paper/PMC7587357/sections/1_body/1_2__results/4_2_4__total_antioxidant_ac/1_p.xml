<p>In our samples, total antioxidant activity (TAA) was measured in the hydrophilic (H-TAA) and lipophilic (L-TAA) fractions, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04672-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04672-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The results showed that the H-TAA fractions of 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> obtained the highest levels of H-TAA in the leaves and roots. These levels were significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the roots of 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> (979.54 ± 42.43 and 823.62 ± 22.06 mg eq trolox/100 g DM, respectively) than in other parts of the plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04672-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> showed the highest level of H-TAA between all the species studied in this research. On the other hand, for L-TAA, 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> both had a higher balance of lipophilic antioxidants in the stems and roots, in comparison with 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04672-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In this sense, the lowest levels of L-TAA were found in 
 <italic>Solanum</italic>, regardless the part of the plant evaluated.
