<p>MeOH NaF recorded the highest polyphenol content, this being significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparison with the other solvents for the three species. The potential for extraction of TPC via maceration by the rest of the solvents could be classified in a different order, regarding the species studied, i.e., 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> (ethanolic extracts &gt; acetonic extracts &gt; methanolic extracts) or 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> (acetonic extracts &gt; ethanolic extracts &gt; methanolic extracts). During decoction, methanolic and acetonic extracts showed less differences regarding the potential for extraction between them in the three species evaluated, but especially for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> the best solvent used in a decoction process was ethanol, in comparison with acetone or methanol.
