<p>The yield of the two extraction methods for the three plants was calculated using the formula described by Falleh et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]: Y (%) = 100 M
 <sub>ext</sub>/M
 <sub>ech</sub>, where Y is the yield of extraction in %, M
 <sub>ext</sub> is the mass of the extract after the evaporation (using the rotary evaporator) of the extraction solvent in mg, and M
 <sub>ech</sub> is the mass of the plant sample in mg.
