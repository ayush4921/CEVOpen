<p>The different plant parts of 
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic>, 
 <italic>Physalis peruviana</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> Aiton are considered healthy because of their high levels of bioactive compounds, such as the phenolic compounds (total polyphenols, flavonoids), which contribute to the total antioxidant activity (TAA) [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The flowers and stems showed similar levels of H-TAA for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic>, reaching higher levels in its flowers as compared to all the values obtained in the rest of the flowers of this study. It is likely that the high levels of anthocyanins that 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> flowers contain could explain the significant differences between the flowers studied in this research [
