<p>Small extraction yields could limit the use of some extracts of 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> (and plants in general) as sources of bioactive compounds. In addition, these compounds can sometimes be present in a very low concentration. On the other hand, and in consonance with Orlando et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we observed that the polyphenol extraction yields were considerably varied between different plant parts. In a recent study, and in agreement with our results, Salih et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] did not obtain a good polyphenol extraction from macerated or decocted samples when using water as an extractant, in comparison with methanol and ethanol. These results were attributed to the lower polyphenol extraction yield obtained when water was used. However, the use of other extracting agents in these conventional techniques entails an optimal extraction of bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this sense, methanol’s polarity is higher than ethanol’s; for this reason, very polar phenolic acids, such as cinnamic or benzoic acids, could be extracted more easily, increasing the total polyphenol content in the extracts obtained [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This effect was in consonance with our results, since when higher methanol concentration were used, the TPC extraction became higher in comparison with methanol (70%) and the rest of the extractant agents for maceration or decoction in all plant species studied.
