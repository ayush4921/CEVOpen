<p>The TPC extracted by the decoction method was higher than that extracted by the maceration method for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Physalis</italic>, and there were significant differences between the two methods of extraction. These results confirm that a moderate temperature would act in favor of the extraction; this fact has been confirmed by some authors who specify that the techniques using higher or lower temperatures and/or pressures would considerably increase the efficiency of the polyphenol extraction [
