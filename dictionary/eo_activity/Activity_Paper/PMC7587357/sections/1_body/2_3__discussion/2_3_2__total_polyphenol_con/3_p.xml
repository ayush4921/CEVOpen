On the other hand, the high extraction potential of ethanol evaluated during decoction has also been observed by Katalinić et al. [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In these studies, ethanol in combination with water allowed for the better extraction of total polyphenols, because the addition of water to organic solvents increases the solubility of polyphenols and allows for maximum extraction [
