  <title>The transmission-blocking activity of the extracts candidates by screening the fungal library with the 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> FREP1-parasite interaction-based ELISA assays.
  </title>
  <p>(A–D) The morphology of fungal isolates 37C6, 100D3, 22E8T, and 45F10 on the MEA agar plate. (E) The final concentrations of the fungal extracts were 100 µg/mL and the results show that the fungal extracts (37C6 and 22E8) significantly reduced the oocyst number compared with the DMSO control while the oocyst number of the other two (100D3 and 45F10) was not significantly different with the DMSO control, respectively. (F) Further, the fungal extract of 22E8 continued to show a significant reduction of the oocyst number in midgut while the 37C6 fungal extract did not have significant effects on 
   <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in mosquitoes when the concentration of the fungal extracts was decreased to 20 µg/mL. 
   <bold>N</bold>: the number of mosquitoes for each treatment; 
   <bold>mean</bold>: the average number of oocysts per midgut; 
   <bold>PR</bold>: infection prevalence in mosquitoes.

   </bold>: the p-value was calculated by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. The experiments were repeated three times.
