<p>Following the previous protocol (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), the 15- to 17-day old cultured 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> containing 2–3% stage V gametocytes were collected and diluted with new O+ type human blood to get 0.2% stage V gametocytes in the blood. Then, the 150 µL blood was mixed with the same volume of heat-inactivated AB+ human serum. Then, 3 µL candidate fungal extract in DMSO (10 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL) was mixed with 297 µL infected blood, the final fungal extract concentration in blood was 100 or 20 µg/mL, respectively. SMFA was performed to feed about 100 3–5 days old 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> G3 female mosquitoes for 15 min, and the engorged mosquitoes were maintained with 8% sugar in a BSL-2 insectary (28 °C, 12-h light/dark cycle, 80% humidity). The midguts were dissected seven days post-infection and stained with 0.1% mercury dibromofluorescein disodium salt in PBS for 16 min. The oocysts in midguts were counted under a light microscope. The standard membrane feeding assays were conducted at least twice to confirm the results.
