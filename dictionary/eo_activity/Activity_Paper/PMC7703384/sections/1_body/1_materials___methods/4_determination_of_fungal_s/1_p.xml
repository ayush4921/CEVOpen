<p>Forty fungal isolates were randomly picked to evaluate the fungal library’s diversity. The fungi were cultured with liquid malt extract medium at RT for one week, and mycelium was collected for DNA extraction using DNAzol (Thermo Fisher). Genomic DNA applied as PCR templates were isolated using DNAzol Reagent following the manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To identify the fungal species, nuclear ribosomal ITS regions were amplified by PCR with specific primers (
