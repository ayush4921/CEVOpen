<p>Fungi can be isolated from soil, water, air, plants, or other organisms. In particular, the endophytic fungi from the plants can generate similar secondary metabolites as their hosts (

 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2015</xref>). At present, there are several specific fungal libraries for drug discovery (

 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), many of which focus on specific environments (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Menendez et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). We focus on generating a global diverse fungal library to facilitate new drug discovery. The soil and plant samples were collected globally, currently including from Asia, Africa, and North America.
