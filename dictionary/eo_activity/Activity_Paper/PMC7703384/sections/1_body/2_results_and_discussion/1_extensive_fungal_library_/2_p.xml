<p>From these samples, 9,053 fungal isolates in total were cultured. Among them, 2,356 were from the plant samples, and 6,688 were from soil samples. About one fungal strain per plant-part sample and 2.8 fungal isolates per soil sample were obtained by average. Nearly 69.4% of fungal isolates were from the subtropical climate in China (Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing) and the USA (e.g., Dallas, New Orleans, and Oklahoma City). About 8% of fungal isolates were from tropical climates such as Miami in the USA, Yangon in Myanmar, Kisumu in Kenya. Approximate 4% were from tropical/subtropical highland climate areas such as Nairobi in Kenya, the Lijiang National Park, and the Potatso National Park in China. A small portion (2.1%) was from the cold areas, such as Jiuzhaigou National Park in China, and Alaska in the USA (

Notably, some fungi were isolated from samples collected from the mountains with an altitude over 3,000 m, such as the Cang Mountains and Meili Snow Mountains in the Yunnan Province, China. The vast difference of sample collection in location, weather, climate, and altitude (
