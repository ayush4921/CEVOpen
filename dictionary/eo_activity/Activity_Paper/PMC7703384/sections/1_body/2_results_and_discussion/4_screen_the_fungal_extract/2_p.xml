<p>To examine the usability of the newly constructed fungal library, we screened 460 fungal extracts obtained in later 2016 and early 2017 for their inhibition activity against FREP1-
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> interaction and found 4 extracts that prevented FREP1 from binding to 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lysates by over 90%. The fungal colonies of these four fungal candidates on MEA plates showed different colors and shapes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3A</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3D</xref>). Then, we determined the activities of the four candidates against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to 
 <italic>An. gambiae in vivo</italic> using the standard membrane feeding assays (SMFA). Results show that the fungal extracts of 37C6 and 22E8 could block malaria transmission at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, and 100D3 and 45F10 did not (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplemental-information">File S2</xref>). The oocyst numbers of 37C6 or 22E8 extract-treated mosquitoes were nearly zero, while the oocyst numbers in the 100D3 or 45F10 extract-treated mosquitoes were not significantly different from that of the DMSO control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3E</xref>). After further dilution of the two positive candidate fungal extracts (37C6 and 22E8) to 20 µg/mL, we found that the extract of 22E8 still significantly inhibited the activity in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission to mosquitoes (

 <italic>Penicillium thomii</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium pancosmium</italic>, respectively (

 <italic>P. thomii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pancosmium</italic> that produce secondary metabolites with antimalarial activities. An independent project in our lab identified 
 <italic>Asperaculane B</italic> as an active compound from this GFEL that inhibited malaria transmission to mosquitoes (
