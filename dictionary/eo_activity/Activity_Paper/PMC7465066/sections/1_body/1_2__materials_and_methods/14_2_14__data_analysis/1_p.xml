<p>All values are expressed as mean Â± standard error of the mean of N observations. For in vivo experiments, N represents the number of animals. For experiments involving histology, the photos shown are demonstrative at least three experiments performed on different experimental days on tissue sections collected from all animals in each group. The results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA when the effect of the treatment was investigated in time-dependent mode or by one-way ANOVA when the means of two or more samples were analyzed. All analysis were followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. In all statistical studies GraphPad Software Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA) was used. A
