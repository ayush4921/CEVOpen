<p>Edema was assessed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In short, the volume of the paw was measured with a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) immediately before carrageenan was injected and for 6 h at hourly intervals subsequently. For each animal, edema was expressed as increase in paw volume (mL) after CAR injection relative to pre-injection value.
