<p>Nuts would be a promising alternative in reducing oxidative damage, owing to their secondary metabolites richness such as polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, and anthraquinones [

The most accredited hypothesis may be that polyphenolic components of dietary plants may increase the endogenous antioxidant defense potential and thus modulate cellular redox state, additionally, and sequentially is apt to consider how polyphenols may modulate the redox system and its components in a cell during normal and pathophysiological conditions [
