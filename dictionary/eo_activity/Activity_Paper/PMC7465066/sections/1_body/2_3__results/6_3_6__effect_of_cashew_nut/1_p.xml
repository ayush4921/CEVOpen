<p>One of the most important role, during inflammatory events, is done by the mediators of the arachidonic acid cascade from COX and LOX pathways, that, as well-known, are modulated by flavonoids [

As speculated, after CAR injection we found a significant increase in both expression, compared to sham animals. After oral treatment with cashew nuts at the dose of 100 mg/kg, we found a significant decrease in both (
