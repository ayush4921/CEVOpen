<p>Inflammation studies have been one of the main hubs of global science study. The inflammation is known to be correlated with oxidative processes, mainly because they share some common pathways. Since oxidative stress is common in several degenerative disease, it has been supposed that dietary antioxidants may explain a very important protective effect. Nuts are a main source of antioxidants in the diets worldwide. Nuts are high in antioxidant, in fiber, and in beneficial unsaturated fats and low in saturated fats. Nuts are usually eaten as a snack or added to food to provide both nutrients and bioactive antioxidants. In conclusion, in our work, we demonstrated for the first time that cashew nuts consumption not only brings benefits in experimental mouse models of chronic inflammation, but also in acute inflammation events. In particular was in grade to significantly counteract edema formation and consequently carrageenan-related pain. In addition, oral treatment with 100 mg/kg of cashew nuts significantly decreased MPO and MDA activity as well as nitrate/nitrite formation. Moreover, in agreement with our previous study, we demonstrated for the first time, that cashew nuts administration was able to significantly improve endogenous antioxidant activity, limiting pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Its beneficial effect is probably due to the high content of phenols that mediate activation of 5-LOX COX pathways. Considering all the benefits brought by cashew nuts, its usual consumption in the diet could be considered in order to reduce the events of cellular oxidative stress. Taken together, our result fits with previous study in which it was demonstrated that cashew nuts possess interesting anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and analgesic activities that will be of interest for further investigation.</p>
