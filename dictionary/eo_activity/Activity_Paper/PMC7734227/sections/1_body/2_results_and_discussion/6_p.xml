<p id="p0105">Zones of inhibition by EPS on pathogenic microorganisms were shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The zones of inhibition displayed by EPS-A, EPS-B, EPS-C and EPS-D against 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O 157:H7 were not significantly different at p &lt; 0.05. EPS inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> yeast and other Gram-negative bacteria. 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> showed MIC of EPS against tested microorganisms. The MIC ranged from 0.25-1.00 mg/ml against tested microorganisms. 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saskiawan (2009)</xref> reported antimicrobial activity of EPS produced by 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp
 <italic>.</italic> against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Findings of 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Osińska-Jaroszuk et al. (2015)</xref> revealed that EPS from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota displayed pronounced antibacterial properties against 
 <italic>Staphyloccoccus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Micrococcus tetragenus</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Skalicka-Woźniak et al. (2012)</xref> associated the wide antimicrobial potentials of polysaccharides in four 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> to their ability to chelate essential nutrients, which therefore, limit the growth of microorganisms. Polysaccharides (intra and extra-) produced by numerous microorganisms, most especially mushrooms are tagged with various biological and pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, dietary supplements, immunostimulating and immunodulatory, anti-tumor, hypoglycemic and antioxidant (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ruthes et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Therapeutic potentials of EPS are the main reasons for their medicinal and industrial uses. Hence, EPS produced by fungi in submerged culture with agro-wastes was enhanced and can be continually exploited for different bioactivities.
