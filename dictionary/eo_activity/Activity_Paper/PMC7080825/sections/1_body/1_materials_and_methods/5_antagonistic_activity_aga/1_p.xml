<p>A slightly modified method from 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Nie et al. (2012)</xref> for detecting antibacterial activity was used against the three common bacteria—
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>—provided by Key Laboratory of Biogeography and Bioresource in Arid Land, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The bacteria were cultured for 1 night in Luria-Bertani LB medium at 37°C. The tested bacteria and endophytes isolates were each pre-cultured overnight, and 5 m L
 <sup>–1</sup> of each culture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in sterile DDH
 <sub>2</sub>O and density adjusted to 10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units CFU/mL by using Densicheck plus (Biomerieux, United States). A total of 100 μL of the typical bacteria cell were inoculated and evenly spread by sterile cotton swaps onto the surface of the LB medium, and then four 5 mm diameter pieces of sterile filter paper were placed on each corner of the agar plate. After this, 10 μL of each actinobacteria strain was added dropwise to the filter paper. All plates were wrapped with parafilm, incubated at 37 ± 2°C for 24 h, and observed for the inhibition of the common bacteria (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Mohamad et al., 2018</xref>). Antibacterial activity was assessed by measuring the diameter of the clear zone of growth inhibition. An equivalent volume of sterile DDH
 <sub>2</sub>O instead of the endophytic actinobacteria was used as a negative control.
