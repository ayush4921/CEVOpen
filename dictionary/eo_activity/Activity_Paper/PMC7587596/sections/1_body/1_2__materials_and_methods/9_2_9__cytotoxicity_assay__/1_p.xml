<p>HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats, along with positive control of Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag, were assayed to determine their toxicity. The nanofibrous mats were disinfected with ultraviolet (UV) light for 20 min and immersed in DMEM (containing FBS). Afterward, the obtained extract suspensions of nanofibrous mats and Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag were incubated at 37 °C and the extracted suspensions were filtered through sterile filters (0.22 µm, Sigma, USA). The DMEM medium was used to prepare different dilution ratios (0, 25, 50, and 100%) of the extract. Vero cells (fibroblasts) from the kidneys of an African green (or old world) monkey (
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>) (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 96-well plate. The Vero cells were then incubated with the extracted material at different dilution ratios for 48 h. Next, 20 µL of MTT solution was added to each well, and the resultant mixture was incubated for 4 h. Subsequently, DMSO (100 µL) was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The optical density (OD) was evaluated at a wavelength of 590 nm to calculate the effect of each sample on cell viability.
