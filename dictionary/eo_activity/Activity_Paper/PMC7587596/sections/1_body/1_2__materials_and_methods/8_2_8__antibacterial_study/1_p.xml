<p>The antibacterial activities of the developed HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats were estimated and compared with those of difloxacin and chloramphenicol antibiotics, which served as the positive control. Blend suspensions were evaluated to determine their antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, Staphylococcus pyogenes,</italic> and 
 <italic>Vibrio vulnificus.</italic> Each tested bacterial specie was cultured on a separate Petri dish (MatTek, Ashland, MA, USA) containing Muller–Hinton agar (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Three wells were made in each dish, into which 0.5 mL of each blend suspension was injected. Afterward, the Petri dishes were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the inhibition zone was measured and compared with that of the antibiotic materials.
