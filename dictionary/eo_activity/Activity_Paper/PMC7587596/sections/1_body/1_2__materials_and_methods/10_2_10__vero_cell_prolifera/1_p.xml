<p>The cellular proliferative efficacy of the prepared HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats, and Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag (as the positive control) was determined. Vero cells were seeded (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) on the examined samples and incubated differently for 24 and 72 h. At each time point, the estimated samples were transferred from the primary plate to a new plate with fresh media and MTT solution (100 µL/well) and incubated for 4 h. DMSO was used to dissolve the obtained formazan crystals, and the OD was calculated at 590 nm.
