<p>The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cervical tissues/cells might damage and/or induces the rapid proliferation of cells and leads to cervical neoplasia, lesions, and carcinoma. There may be several reasons for the onset of cervical cancer such as human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, unhealthy lifestyle, etc., but the oxidative stress with the increased redox potentials is one the major reason for the carcinoma. The cervical tissues under severe alteration in the redox oxidative stress leads to change in the gene expression that might induces the cellular proliferation in a rapid state. The cervical cancer can be easily reduced or treated with the several medicines including traditional and food diet. One such potent therapeutic/medicine is polyphenols from natural sources containing the anti-cancer properties and there are several researches explicated the therapeutic nature of the polyphenols against cervical cancer. In this study the inhibition of cervical carcinomaâ€™s malignant stage was effectively treated by the phenolic product-DoE.</p>
