<p>The current investigation has produced and purified a potential polyphenolic DoE from a prospective endophytic fungus 
 <italic>C. australiensis</italic> FC2AP and the DoE belongs to the class of chemical family, flavonoids. The flavonoids have therapeutic metabolites or products exhibiting the antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral, antiparasitic, and anti-cancer properties. Angiogenesis in tumor or tumor cells is a malignant stage and this could be minimized or prevented by the implementation of polyphenols and flavonoids. The preliminary assessment of inhibiting the angiogenesis process was successfully carried out through HET-CAM analysis in chick’s embryonated eggs and the DoE inhibited and slowed down the formation of blood vessels in the embryo. The tumor progression at various sites are initiated by the onset of the angiogenesis process—one of the characteristic in cancer cells, and thus the cancer cells are carried over the blood stream further invading any organs/sites in the body; this stage is called metastasis. Angiogenesis in tumors/carcinoma is an essential or vital component in cancer growth and propagation, and an important target for investigations related to its therapeutic use. It is significant to consider that tumor vascularization not only supply nutrients to tumors/tumor invasive areas, but also controls the physiopathology, and consequently its growth, metastasis in tumor [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] reported the inhibition of angiogenic effects using few anticancer products such as imatinib, diltiazem and bevacizumab. Pyripyropene A and hypocrimins (A and B) isolated from 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Hypocrea vinosa,</italic> respectively, have good anti-angiogenic properties [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; Similarly a synthetic analogue pinabulin was derived from 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. and fumagillin from 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> have been exhibiting the anti-angiogenic effects.
