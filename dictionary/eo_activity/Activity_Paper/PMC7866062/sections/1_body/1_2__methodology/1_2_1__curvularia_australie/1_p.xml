<p>This investigation has focused to characterize the anti-cancer potentiality of the DoE produced by an endophyte 
 <italic>C. australiensis</italic> FC2AP. This strain was isolated from a medicinal tree 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> grown around the foothills of Vellingiri hills, Western Ghats regions (Nilgiris cluster), Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. The strain FC2AP (NCBI accession number: KR363626) was isolated from the leaf sample of the 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> tree; the strain was found to dwell and produce maximum metabolites in Sabouraud’s Dextrose Broth medium [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The preliminary research of this study such as isolation, identification, and characteristics of the isolated endophytic fungus 
 <italic>C. australeinsis</italic> FC2AP was stated in the earlier investigation of Mani et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The DoE was purified through HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) technique from crude pigmented metabolites extract-CPME (biomass-intracellular extract) produced by 
 <italic>C. australiensis</italic> in Sabouraud’s Dextrose Broth medium; this medium was optimized using experimental design- RSM executed through Stat-Ease software. There were six peaks (MM1 to MM6) when CPME was eluted at 554 nm and those eluted fractions were subjected to antimicrobial and antioxidant analyses where the highest peak (MM4) exhibited the maximum activity at minimum concentration. The MM4 was put through for chemical characterization of the structure with the aid of UV-Vis spectrum, FT-IR, 1H, and 13C NMR, and HRLC-MS/MS analyses. With these data, the compound MM4 was found to be DoE with the molecular mass of 573.1991 (C
 <sub>30</sub>H
 <sub>22</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>). The elucidated DoE was investigated for anti-cervical cancer properties on cancer cell lines HeLa and the DoE explicated its anti-cancer potentiality where the cell viability in HeLa cells was found to be 48.38% at 100 µg/mL concentration (unpublished data).
