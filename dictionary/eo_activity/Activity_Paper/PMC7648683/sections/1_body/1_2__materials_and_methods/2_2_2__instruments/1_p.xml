<p>High-resolution mass spectra acquisition was performed with an AB SCIEX Triple TOF 5600
 <sup>+</sup> mass spectrometer (Concord, ON, Canada) in the positive ion mode using the following parameters: source temperature was set at 450°C with a curtain gas flow of 25 L/min (GS1 and GS2 both 50), the ion spray voltage was set at 4500 V, declustering potential was 50 V, the collision energy was 10 V, and the mass range was set at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 50–1500. High‐purity nitrogen gas was used for the nebulizer/Duospray™ and curtain gases. MS data acquired were processed using Analyst® TF software. Prior to MS, the sample was dissolved in methanol (1 mg/ml) and used for all sample injections. 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer (Faellanden, Switzerland) at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. The 2D experiments carried out included heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC). Chemical shifts are reported in units of 
 <italic>δ</italic> (ppm), and coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) are expressed in Hz. Multiplicity of 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR signals is reported as 
 <italic>s</italic> = singlet, 
 <italic>d</italic> = doublet, 
 <italic>t</italic> = triplet, 
 <italic>q</italic> = quartet, 
 <italic>dd</italic> = doublet of doublets, and 
 <italic>m</italic> = multiplet.
