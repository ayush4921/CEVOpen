<p>Compound 2 was obtained as a yellow colored amorphous solid. A molecular formula of C
 <sub>16</sub>H
 <sub>17</sub>NO
 <sub>4</sub> for compound 2 was deduced from the positive-mode HR-TOF-ESI-MS (

 <sup>+</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">Figure S5</xref>). Based on its 1D (
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C) (Figures S6–S8) and 2D (HMBC and HMQC) spectral data, compound 2 was unambiguously characterized as lycorine (
