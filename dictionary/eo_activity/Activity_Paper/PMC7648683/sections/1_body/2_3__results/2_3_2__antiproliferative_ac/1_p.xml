<p>To evaluate the antiproliferative activity of the bulbs of 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic>, its 80% methanol extract was tested against A2780 and MV4-11 cell lines using MTT and resazurine assays, respectively. The results indicated that the bulb extract exerted antiproliferative effect against MV4-11 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and A2780 (GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) cell lines. Thus, the bulb extract of 
 <italic>C. abyscinicum</italic> possesses a promising anticancer potential. In the United States National Cancer Institute plant screening program, a crude extract is generally considered to have 
 <italic>in vitr</italic>o cytotoxic activity if the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value following incubation between 48 and 72 h is less than 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
