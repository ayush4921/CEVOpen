The plant specimen was authenticated by Mr Shambel Alemu, the national herbarium at the Department of Biology of Addis Ababa University where a sample specimen (AD-001) was deposited. The collected plant material was then inspected to remove any debris or plant parts other than the leaves. Finally, the leaves were dried at room temperature in an open and shade area.
