<p>The phytochemical work carried out on the experimental plant is inadequate. However, one previous study described the presence of stigmasterol (a phytosterol molecule) and the triterpenoid molecules lupeol and lup-20(29)-ene-3β,23-diol in 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Various sterols and triterpenoids were also reported from similar species such as 
 <italic>H. spinosa</italic> and 
 <italic>H. auriculate</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> These triterpenoids and sterols were reported to possess anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities.
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Specifically, stigmasterol and lupeol were reported to demonstrate significant anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Similarly, lup-20(29)-ene-3β,23-diol was reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity.
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Yet, the anti-nociceptive activity of lupeol still needs further confirmation since other authors such as Geetha and Varalakshmi (2001) reported that it lacks anti-nociceptive activity.
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Therefore, stigmasterol, lupeol, and lup-20(29)-ene-3β,23-diol may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> whereas, its anti-nociceptive property may be due to the presence of stigmasterol and/or other uncharacterized compounds.
