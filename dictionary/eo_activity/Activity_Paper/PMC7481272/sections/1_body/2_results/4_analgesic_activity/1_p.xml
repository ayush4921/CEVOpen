<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>, the leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> possessed significant inhibition of acetic acid-induced writhes in mice in a dose-dependent manner. The oral dose of the ethanolic extract at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg reduced the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhes by 48.76 ± 12.39% and 57.89 ±10.92%, respectively, that were statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) when compared to the negative control (DW-treated group). Acetylsalicylic acid (the standard drug) showed 88.76 ± 2.82% inhibition of writhes which was statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) as compared to the negative control, as well as the lower and medium dose of the extract. The extract at 100 mg/kg had declined the number of writhes in mice by 29.07 ± 9.36%, though it was statistically insignificant. Similarly, the leaf extract was observed to prolong the reaction time of the treated mice for thermal stimuli in the tail immersion test. As detailed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the extract at three different doses has possessed statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) anti-nociceptive activity in mice against the thermal stimuli at different observation time points starting from 60-min through 180-min post-treatment relative to DW-treated group. The oral dose of mice with the reference drug, pethidine at 5 mg/kg, was found to significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) increase response latency at all observation time points compared to the untreated group (distilled water-treated group). The lowest and middle doses of the extract were observed to prolong the reaction time at 30- and 60-min observation time relative to the distilled water-treated group, though it was statistically insignificant (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05).
