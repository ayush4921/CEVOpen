<p>The analysis of 28 populations of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> collected from Serbian sites showed that the most dominant compounds were 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, sabinene, 1,8-cineole, borneol, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene, lavandulyl acetate and chamazulene [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Furthermore, investigations in Serbia showed that the high percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes and absence of azulene in the obtained EO proved that this population was octaploid, whereas the chamazulene chemotype was in the tetraploid population [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In addition, collections from saline habitats in Serbia identified three chemotypes: chamazulene + 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene + 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (15.84 + 8.98 + 8.89%, respectively), lavandulyl acetate + chamazulene + 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene (14.88 + 13.89 + 7.57%, respectively) and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate + 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene + germacrene D (21.33 + 9.53 + 7.07%, respectively) [
