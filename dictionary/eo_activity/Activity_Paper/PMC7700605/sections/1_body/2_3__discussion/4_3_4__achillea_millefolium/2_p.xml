<p>According to the major compound of the EO, this 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> from Rtanj can be classified as a camphor chemotype. Essential oil of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> from France was also identified as a camphor chemotype (12.8% camphor in EO) [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. However, in Lithuania, six different chemotypes of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> were found: 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 1,8-cineole, borneol, camphor, nerolidol and chamazulene chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In Poland, three chemotypes were found based on the determination of the variability between 20 yarrow populations according to content of the most dominant compounds identified in the EO: 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene + chamazulene and 1,8-cineole chemotype [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Variations in the essential oil content and composition in commercial samples of yarrow from different European countries were analyzed, and five chemotypes were determined: chamazulene, chamazulene + bornyl acetate, chamazulene + 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene + 
 <italic>trans</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, sabinene + 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene + 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinyl acetate [
