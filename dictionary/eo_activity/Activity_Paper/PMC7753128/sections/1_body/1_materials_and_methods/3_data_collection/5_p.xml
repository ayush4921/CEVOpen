<p id="p0135">Data were entered into a database and grouped according to their similarities (e.g., knowledge about malaria or not) and analyzed using SPSS (version 24). The frequency of citation (FC) of each plant was presented as the sum of informants that cited the use of the species to treat malaria. The informant consensus factor (ICF) was calculated in order to estimate the agreement about the use of plants to treat given ailments [

 <disp-formula id="ufd1">ICF = (
  <italic>N</italic>
  <sub>
   <italic>ur</italic>
  </sub> − 
  <italic>N</italic>
  <sub>
   <italic>t</italic>
  </sub>)/(
  <italic>N</italic>
  <sub>
   <italic>ur</italic>
  </sub> − 1)
 </disp-formula>where, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ur</italic>
 </sub> = number of use-reports in each disease category, 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> = number of species used for that use category. ICF values range between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest level of informant consensus on the species to be used in the treatment within a category of illness [
