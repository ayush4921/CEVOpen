<p id="p0255">It should also be noted that of all 19 tested plants, only 5 had their active compounds analyzed, namely: 
 <italic>Erythrina abyssinica</italic> DC., 
 <italic>Flacourtia indica</italic> (Burm.f.) Merr., 
 <italic>Grewia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Ormocarpum kirkii</italic> S.Moore and 
 <italic>Stereospermum kunthianum</italic> Cham. Of these, the quinones isolated from 
 <italic>S. kunthianum</italic> presented a high antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 μg/ml), followed by the phenolic compounds isolated from 
 <italic>F. indica</italic>. The compounds from the other 3 plants had their antiplasmodial activity expressed in μM.
