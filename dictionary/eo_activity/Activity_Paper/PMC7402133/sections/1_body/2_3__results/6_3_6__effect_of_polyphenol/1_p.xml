<p>Redox status homeostasis is regulated by ROS-detoxifying enzymes, including Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD, catalase, GPx, and HO-1, as well as ROS-producing enzymes, such as Nox4. It was relevant to assess the impact of polyphenol-rich plant extracts on the production of such redox enzymes. Results show on the one hand that the expression of genes coding for the antioxidant enzymes Cu/ZnSOD (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f004">Figure 4</xref>C), and HO-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f004">Figure 4</xref>D) was down-regulated, and, on the other hand, that GPx gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f004">Figure 4</xref>E) was up-regulated in response to high glucose concentration. 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> and 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plant extracts exerted a protective action against the modulation of Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD, HO-1, and GPx gene expression mediated by hyperglycemic condition. 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plant extract also improved catalase gene expression. 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant extract protected against the alteration of MnSOD, HO-1, and GPx gene expression in high glucose-exposed cells. Regarding 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic> plant extract, it counteracted MnSOD gene expression reduction mediated by hyperglycemic condition. Standard polyphenols were also able to counteract the impact of hyperglycemic condition on the expression of genes encoding redox enzymes, depending on the considered enzyme. Of note, all of the pure polyphenols abrogated the decrease in HO-1 gene expression caused by high glucose; and quercetin exerted a marked protective action by inducing a four-fold increase in HO-1 gene expression. Concerning the ROS-producing enzyme Nox4, its gene expression was up-regulated in hyperglycemic condition-exposed cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant extract, caffeic, and gallic acids protected against Nox4 gene expression deregulation. It is well known that the transcription factor Nrf2 is involved in the enhancement of the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, high glucose concentration reduced by a two-fold factor Nrf2 gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f004">Figure 4</xref>G). This result is consistent with data described above showing the down-regulation of Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD, catalase, and HO-1 gene expression in hyperglycemic condition. 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>, 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic>, and 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plant extracts as well as caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids abrogated Nfr2 gene expression decrease during hyperglycemic condition. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the hyperglycemic condition altered the cerebral endothelial cell redox status by promoting oxidative stress. Polyphenol-rich plant extracts exhibited protective antioxidant properties. Given that quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids exerted similar activities, these polyphenols could partly contribute to the biological effects of the medicinal plant extracts.
