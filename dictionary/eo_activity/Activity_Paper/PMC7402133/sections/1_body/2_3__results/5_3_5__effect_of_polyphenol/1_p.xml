<p>SOD activity was determined to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the ability of polyphenols to reduce oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycemic condition. The results show that the total SOD and Cu/ZnSOD activities were significantly elevated in cells exposed to hyperglycemic condition (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00573-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Interestingly, all of the polyphenol-rich plant extracts reversed the up-regulated activities of total and Cu/ZnSOD mediated by high glucose, except 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plant extract, which only modulated the activity of Cu/ZnSOD. Standard caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and quercetin also abrogated the hyperglycemic condition effect on total and Cu/ZnSOD activities. This suggests the possible involvement of these polyphenols in the bioactivity of medicinal plant extracts. Concerning MnSOD activity, it was unchanged in cells that were exposed to the hyperglycemic condition. Noteworthy, 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant extract, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and quercetin significantly increased MnSOD activity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Cu/ZnSOD was more particularly enhanced during high glucose-mediated oxidative stress. Such an enzymatic activation could result from the elevation of intracellular ROS levels induced by hyperglycemic condition that we reported above. Polyphenol-rich plant extracts may preserve the endogenous antioxidant defense system.
