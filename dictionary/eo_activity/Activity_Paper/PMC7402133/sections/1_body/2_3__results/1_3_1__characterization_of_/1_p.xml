<p>UPLC-ESI-MS-MS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) shows that polyphenols detected in 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant extract were mainly phenolic acids, including chlorogenic and dicaffeoylquinic acids, which are derivatives of caffeic acid, and quercetin and kaempferol glycosides from the flavonoid family (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00573-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Polyphenols that were depicted in 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant extract were the phenolic acids protocatechuic, isoferulic, and caffeic acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Of note, UPLC-ESI-MS-MS analysis also led to identifying both ayapin and ayapanin, known as specific coumarin derivatives in 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant. Regarding 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic> plant extract, different polyphenols that were derived from gallic and ellagic acids were detected, such as the ellagitannins punicalin and punicalagin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plant extract was characterized by the presence of different flavonoids, including the methylated form of quercetin called isorhamnetin, a trimethoxyflavone and procyanidins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Total polyphenol contents ranged from 0.5 to 8.1 g GAE/100 g plant, depending on the medicinal plant extract considered, as reported in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00573-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic> plant was identified as the richest source of polyphenols, followed by both 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> and 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plants exhibiting similar ranges of total polyphenol quantities that were 2.5-fold lower than that of 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic> plant. In comparison, the total polyphenol content of 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plant was six- to 14-fold lower than those of other medicinal plants. To evaluate whether the polyphenols present in plant extracts exhibit free-radical scavenging and reducing capacities, DPPH assay was performed using vitamin C as a positive control. Given that UPLC-ESI-MS-MS analysis led to identify caffeic acid in both 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> plants, chlorogenic acid in 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> plant, gallic acid in 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic> plant, and quercetin in 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>, 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic>, and 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plants, the corresponding standard polyphenols were also assessed for DPPH assay. The data show that all polyphenol-rich plant extracts were able to scavenge and reduce DPPH radical (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00573-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Polyphenol-rich extracts from 
 <italic>T. bentzoe</italic>, 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> exerted the most pronounced antioxidant activity as compared to that of vitamin C. Interestingly, the standard polyphenols quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids exhibited radical-scavenging and reducing capacities, which suggested their possible contribution to the antioxidant properties of the medicinal plants.
