<p>The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was performed to assess the ability of polyphenol-rich plant extracts to exert free radical-scavenging and reducing capacities, according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, 40 μL of each plant extract or a pure polyphenol (100 µM), namely quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, or gallic acids (Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA), or vitamin C used as a positive control (100 μM) were placed in a 96-well plate. Subsequently, 200 μL of 0.25 mM DPPH diluted in methanol (Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) were added to each well. After an incubation at 25 °C for 25 min., the absorbance was measured at 517 nm (FLUOstar Optima, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK). Reduced DPPH percentage was used in order to calculate the antioxidant capacity, by the following formula:
 <disp-formula>Antioxidant capacity (%) = [(Absorbance control − Absorbance sample)/Absorbance control] × 100</disp-formula>
