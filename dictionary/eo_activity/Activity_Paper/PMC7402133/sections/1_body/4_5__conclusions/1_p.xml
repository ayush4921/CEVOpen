<p>This study demonstrates that medicinal plant polyphenols attenuated oxidative stress and improved inflammatory and vasoactive markers on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00573-f008">Figure 8</xref> summarizes the molecular targets that are involved in polyphenol action. Whereas the hyperglycemic condition induced oxidative stress by deregulating several redox factors, including ROS, Nox4, SOD, catalase, GPx, HO-1, and Nrf2, medicinal plant polyphenols limited oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycemic condition. Cell pretreatment with inhibitors of signaling pathways led to show the causal role of NFκB, while a protective action of AMPK on redox changes. Hyperglycemic condition induced a pro-inflammatory response by increasing NFκB gene expression and IL-6 secretion. Moreover, it altered ET-1, eNOS, and NO vasoactive marker production. Importantly, medicinal plant polyphenols protected against the deleterious effects of hyperglycemic condition. Quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids identified as predominant plant polyphenols, and related circulating metabolites exerted similar beneficial activities. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in polyphenol uptake by cerebral endothelial cells is needed. Preclinical studies on diabetic animal models will also help to assess the ability of polyphenols to target cells in in vivo condition and protect against cerebrovascular complications during type 2 diabetes.
