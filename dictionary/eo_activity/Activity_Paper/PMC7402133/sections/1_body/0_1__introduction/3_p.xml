<p>There is still a lack of pharmacological strategies that aim to counteract oxidative stress and inflammation on cerebral endothelial cells during hyperglycemia. Interestingly, polyphenols constitute the most abundant antioxidants provided by the human diet through various fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants [

 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. More than 8000 molecules have been identified and classified in main chemical families, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Polyphenols are characterized by the presence of one or several phenolic rings that contribute to their free radical-scavenging and reducing capacities [

 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and their ability to improve oxidative stress-caused endothelial dysfunction during metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes [

Noteworthy, the biological effects of polyphenols depend on their bioavailability as polyphenols are known to be poorly absorbed and extensively catabolized by the gut microflora. Polyphenol circulating metabolites may consist on microbial metabolites, like derivatives of phenylpropionic, phenylacetic, and benzoic acids, and compounds that are produced by both the microbial and tissular metabolism, such as ferulic acid originating from the catabolism of the phenolic acids chlorogenic and caffeic acids [

 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Terminalia bentzoe</italic>, as well as exotic species, like 
 <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic>. Even if some authors reported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities for plants of the same species and genus [

 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], few data exist regarding their possible benefits to reduce diabetes-related metabolic and vascular complications. Our previous studies demonstrated that polyphenolic extracts from medicinal plants, like 
 <italic>Antirhea borbonica</italic> or 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> turmeric from Réunion Island, exert protective effects on adipose cells exposed to metabolic or bacterial stimuli inducing redox and inflammatory damages that are associated with insulin resistance markers [
