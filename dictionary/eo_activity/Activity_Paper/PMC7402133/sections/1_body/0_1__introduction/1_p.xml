<p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of microvascular endothelial cells that correspond to a monolayer of flat cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels. These endothelial cells exert important physiological functions in order to maintain the cerebral microenvironment and participate in brain protection [
