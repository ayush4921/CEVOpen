<p>During type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia may alter the endothelial functions, participating to BBB disruption and brain homeostasis loss [

 <xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Of note, oxidative stress plays a causal role in the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia on cerebral endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="B11-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the rate of their degradation by the endogenous antioxidant defense system, which is composed of various enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. ROS overproduction has been associated with several molecular mechanisms, including an alteration of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, the formation of advanced glycation end products, and the activation of specific ROS-producing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), known as the most abundant endothelial Nox isoform [

 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress, high levels of ROS lead to endothelial dysfunctions by damaging DNA, proteins, lipids, and by deregulating NO production and the redox sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates the expression of genes encoding redox enzymes [

 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, high glucose-induced oxidative stress activates the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB) transcriptional factor that induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, hyperglycemia-caused redox changes may inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which exerts anti-inflammatory effects and acts as a key regulator of the endothelial function through induction of eNOS activity and NO vasodilator production [
