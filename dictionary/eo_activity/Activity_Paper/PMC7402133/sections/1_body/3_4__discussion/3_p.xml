<p>An in vitro study was conducted on cerebral endothelial cells exposed to hyperglycemic condition in the presence or not of polyphenols to assess whether the presence of polyphenols in the medicinal plant extracts was associated with antioxidant activities. Our findings provide evidence for the antioxidant effects of medicinal plant polyphenols against high glucose-induced oxidative stress. Indeed, the results from DCFH-DA assay show that the hyperglycemic condition led to increased intracellular ROS levels. According to Kassab et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], in hyperglycemic condition, glucose is phosphorylated and converted into fructose-6-phosphate, next into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and transformed into glycerol phosphate, a precursor of diacylglycerol which is a signaling molecule that is able to modulate protein kinase C activity involved in redox deregulation. Moreover, the overproduction of superoxide caused by hyperglycemia inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway able to provide reducing equivalents to the endogenous antioxidant defense system [

Interestingly, medicinal plant polyphenols protected cerebral endothelial cells by decreasing ROS production elevated by hyperglycemic condition. Quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids also improved the ROS levels in hyperglycemic condition. This raises the possibility that such polyphenols could partly contribute to the antioxidant effects of plant extracts on cerebral endothelial cells. Accordingly,

Here, cerebral endothelial cell pretreatment with specific inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways highlights a causal role of NFκB, while a protective action of AMPK on redox changes. This is consistent with our published data demonstrating the causal involvement of NFκB, JNK, ERK, and PI3K pathways and the protective role of AMPK in ROS production of bEnd3 cells in hyperglycemic condition [
 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, we found that hyperglycemic condition induced a pro-inflammatory response of cerebral endothelial cells, by elevating NFκB gene expression and IL-6 release. Accordingly, several literature data provided evidence for the crosstalk between oxidative stress and inflammation, and showed that NFκB suppression limited redox damages in in vitro cell models as well as in diabetic rats [

 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Importantly, our present data show that polyphenol-rich plant extracts, as well as quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids exerted anti-inflammatory effects, by lowering NFκB and IL-6 production caused by high glucose on cerebral endothelial cells. In parallel, we found that all polyphenols tested abrogated the increase in ROS levels mediated by AMPK blockade in cells that were exposed to hyperglycemic condition. When considering that AMPK is a conserved key enzyme involved in cell energy homeostasis and able to counteract oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], polyphenols may help to reduce redox alterations related to AMPK suppression and, thus, to protect cerebral endothelial cells during hyperglycemia. Of note, Shen et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] reported that polyphenols like quercetin up-regulate AMPK gene expression. This activation of AMPK prevents oxidative stress-induced vascular dysfunction via the increased phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-00573" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] found that chlorogenic acid improved ROS and NO production by activating AMPK signaling pathway and eNOS activity on human aortic endothelial cells that were exposed to hypochlorous acid.
