  <p>Effect of polyphenols on the viability and mitochondrial metabolic activity of cerebral endothelial cells. Cells were exposed to normoglycemic condition in presence or not of each polyphenol-rich plant extract (10 µM GAE) or standard polyphenol (10 μM) for 24 h. In order to evaluate the cellular viability, the cells were counted by using the Trypan blue exclusion method (
   <bold>A</bold>). The mitochondrial metabolic activity was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (
   <bold>B</bold>). Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments.
