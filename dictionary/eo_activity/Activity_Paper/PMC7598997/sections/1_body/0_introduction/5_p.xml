<p>Based on our above-mentioned structure–activity results obtained in antiproliferative, tubulin polymerisation and OATP2B1 transport assays, our aim in the present study was to combine the key structural elements (highlighted in blue, green, and red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figures 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) to get potent antiproliferative compounds. Here we disclose the synthesis of 3-
 <italic>N</italic>-benzyltriazolylmethyl-13α-oestrone derivatives brominated or phosphonated at C-2 or C-4.
