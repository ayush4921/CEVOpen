<p>Concerning binding preference order, SP docking score only helps to separate binding and non-binding molecules in a molecular pocket. However, it is not suitable to determine an accurate binding preference order; therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were performed. This allowed us to calculate binding energy at a more advanced level (MMGBSA method). Furthermore, calculations also provide information about the stability of the binding pose concerning the different ligand–protein complexes. It was established that the binding positions were stable in all four cases, even though the two compounds occupy the CBS in reversed manner (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Comparing binding energies at the same region, compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> had always stronger interaction than compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. Comparing binding energies at the different binding sites, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> provided almost the same interaction energies in the two binding pockets, while compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> had stronger interaction at the TBS. The strong interactions of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> indicate that the hormonally inactive 13α-estrane core with certain ring A modifications might be a suitable scaffold in the design of potent MT targeting agents. Concerning its possible dual binding (at CBS and at TBS), it might be a promising candidate in the development of antitubulin drugs targeting MDR cells, too.
