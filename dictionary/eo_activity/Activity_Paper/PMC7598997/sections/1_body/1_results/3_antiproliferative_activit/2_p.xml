<p>The new compounds (
 <bold>11</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>) were evaluated for their cell growth-inhibitory action against an ovarian (A2780) and two breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) human adherent cancer cell lines. As a general tendency, ovarian cell line proved to be more sensitive for the tested agents than the utilised breast cancers. Certain newly synthesised derivatives exhibited substantial sub- or low-micromolar antiproliferative potentials (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Bromo derivatives (
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold>) did not influence the growth of the tumour cells, except compound 
 <bold>12a</bold>, which inhibited the proliferation of A2780 cells with a submicromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. This test compound displayed substantially higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against the two other cell lines. Derivatives 
 <bold>13b</bold> and 
 <bold>14a</bold> proved to be the most potent in the phosphonate compound group with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the low micromolar range against all tested cell lines, which are comparable to those of reference agent cisplatin. Phosphonates exhibited a similar level of potency against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. The only exception is compound 
 <bold>15 b</bold>, which did not exert considerable growth inhibitory action against MDA-MB-231 cells. The cancer selectivity of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> was tested by means of the MTT assay using the non-cancerous mouse embryo fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3. The treatment with compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> resulted in a modest inhibition of cell growth (28.73 ± 1.26% and 37.94 ± 0.75% in 10 and 30 µM, respectively) indicating the cancer selective property of the determined antiproliferative action.
