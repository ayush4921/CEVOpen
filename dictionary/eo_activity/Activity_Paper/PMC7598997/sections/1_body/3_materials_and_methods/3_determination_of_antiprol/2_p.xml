<p>The antiproliferative properties of the newly synthesised triazoles (
 <bold>11a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>–
 <bold>15a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) were determined on a panel of human adherent cancer cell lines of gynaecological origin. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were isolated from breast cancers differing in biochemical background, while A2780 cells were isolated from ovarian cancer. The cancer selectivity of compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> was tested on the non-cancerous mouse embryo fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3. All cell lines were purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECCAC, Salisbury, UK). Cells were cultivated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids and an antibiotic–antimycotic mixture. All media and supplements were obtained from Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. Near-confluent cancer cells were seeded onto a 96-well microplate (5000 cells/well) and, after overnight standing, 200 µL new medium, containing the tested compounds at 10 and 30 µM, was added. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the living cells were assayed by the addition of 20 µL of 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution. MTT was converted by intact mitochondrial reductase and precipitated as purple crystals during a 4-h contact period. The medium was next removed and the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 µL of DMSO during a 60-min period of shaking at 37 
 <sup>о</sup>C.
