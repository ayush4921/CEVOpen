<p>Ebselen – an organic compound capable of reducing lipid peroxides and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> – is another type of Trx inhibitor that results in the production of selenolic acid (EbSeOH). In mammalian cells, this compound is a substrate for TrxR, which reduces EbSeOH to an active selenolic form (EbSeH). Ebselen is a selective inhibitor that exclusively inhibits the activity of the bacterial form of TrxR, leading to an increase in ROS production, ultimately resulting in the death of bacterial cells. This is important for the potential use of ebselen for the treatment of bacterial infections, but the compound also has a protective effect on mammalian cells
