<p>The biological activity of the Trx-TrxR system depends primarily on endogenous blocking inhibitors that bind at least one of the system’s components. An example of such a Trx-binding molecule is the Thioredoxin Interacting Protein (TXNIP, also called thioredoxin binding protein-2, TBP-2 or vitamin D3 stimulated protein 1, VDUP-1), which binds to Trx

 </xref>. The formation of a disulphide bond between Cys247 in TXNIP and Cys32 in Trx leads to the formation of a stable complex and blockade of the Trx catalytic centre, resulting in inhibition of the antioxidant action of the redox protein
