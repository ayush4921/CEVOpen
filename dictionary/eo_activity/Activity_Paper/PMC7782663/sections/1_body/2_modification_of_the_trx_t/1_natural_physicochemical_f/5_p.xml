<p>Among naturally occurring chemical compounds, some support the Trx-dependent system, leading to increased expression of its components. Among these is cannabidiol (CBD) – a compound found in the extracts of the Cannabis sativa L. plant – which has no psychoactive effect but has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activity

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that at a concentration of 4 µM, CBD leads to an increase in both Trx and TrxR expression, while reducing the expression of GSH-dependent antioxidant system components including GSH itself, as well as GSH reductase and peroxidase, suggesting that CBD action may promote the activity of the Trx-TrxR system
