<p>In addition to naturally occurring Trx-dependent system inhibitors, many synthetic compounds can also modify the functioning of the Trx-TrxR system by inhibiting the biological activity of Trx or its reductase. This includes compounds from the group of disulphide imidazole derivatives, naphthoquinone derivatives and Michael acceptors as well as several organic and inorganic complex compounds containing transition metal ions as the central atom (
