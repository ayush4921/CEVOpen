<p>The enzyme responsible for reducing the oxidised form of Trx is thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). The reducing enzyme contains a FAD prosthetic group, NADPH binding domain, interface domain, and an active centre located in the C-terminus

 </xref>. The TrxR active centre contains one cysteine and one selenocysteine (-Gly-Cys497-Sec498-Gly-) and the FAD domain contains the sequence -Cys59-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys64-, which enables electron transfer during a redox reaction. An important element for TrxR activity is the Sec498 located at the enzymeâ€™s C-terminus. It has been shown that recombinant mutant TrxR containing cysteine instead of selenocysteine in the active centre showed a 100 times lower catalytic constant value in comparison to the wild type Sec-containing enzyme. It was also observed that the substitution of redox inactive serine in place of selenocysteine completely inactivates the enzyme
