<p>Given the metabolic significance of Trx, the most important element of the molecule is its active centre (-Cys32-Gly-Pro-Cys35-) as it is responsible for the antioxidant function of the protein. The cysteines located in the active centre are arranged in such a way that Cys32 is more exposed to the outside while Cys35 is hidden in the core

 </xref>. This spatial distribution is important for the reducing action of Cys32, which leads to a disulphide bond between Trx and the protein to be reduced. Cys35 is responsible for the separation of the reduced protein molecule and the creation of a disulphide bond within the active Trx centre (

 </xref>. The conservation of this sequence in the active centre is essential for the proper functioning of Trx and any amino acid change in the sequence (e.g. substitution of proline with serine or threonine) leads to a change in protein conformation, resulting in decreased stability of the molecule, which in turn, significantly affects the reduction potential of Trx

 </xref>. Apart from the cysteine residues located in the active centre of Trx, there are three additional cysteines in the structure of the protein at positions 62, 69, and 73. Therefore, in a situation of Trx deficiency and/or under oxidative conditions, it is possible to use other thiol groups for Trx reduction activities through the formation of a second disulphide bond between Cys62 and Cys69. Further oxidation on the other hand, would lead to the formation of a homodimer with a disulphide bond between the cysteines at position 73 of two Trx molecules
