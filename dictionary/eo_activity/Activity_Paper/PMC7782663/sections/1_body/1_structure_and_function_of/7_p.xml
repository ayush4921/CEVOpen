<p>In humans, TrxR occurs in three isoforms
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>16</sup>
 </xref>: the TrxR1 isoform which is present in the cytosol (55 kDa; 499 amino acids), the TrxR2 mitochondrial isoform (56.2 kDa; 521 amino acids), and TrxR3 (65 kDa; 560 amino acids) which localises to the nucleus. TrxR2 contains a domain composed of 33 amino acids situated at the N-terminal portion of the enzyme, which is responsible for mitochondrial translocation of enzyme molecules. TrxR3 can reduce both Trx and glutathione (GSH) and is therefore referred to as thioredoxin glutathione – reductase (TGR)
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>17–20</sup>
 </xref>. It contains a TGR structure at the N-terminal motif which contains an additional glutaredoxin domain so that the enzyme can act as a thioredoxin reductase, glutathione reductase, and glutaredoxin, the purpose of which is to reduce mixed disulphides in proteins produced by glutathionylation, among other processes
