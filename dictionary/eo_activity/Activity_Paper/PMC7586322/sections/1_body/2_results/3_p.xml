<p>Probit analysis was used to compare egg hatchability and larval development inhibition of the condensed tannin extracts by comparing their relative potency with that of the standard counterparts (positive controls); thus, 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> was 3.7 and 5.9 times more potent in inhibiting egg hatchability than 
 <italic>S. guineensa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gumifera</italic>, respectively. Similarly, 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> was 2.5 and 7.3 times more potent in inhibiting larval development than 
 <italic>S. guineensa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gumifera</italic>, respectively (
