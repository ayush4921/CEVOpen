<p>The IC

 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Accordingly, the highest IC

 <italic>guineensa</italic> whereas the lowest value was recorded with 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic>. Hence, the condensed tannin inhibiting egg hatching and larval development most potently was 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> followed in descending order of activity by 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guineensa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gumifera</italic>. This result suggests that all three condensed tannin-enriched extracts exhibited variation in potency to inhibit the egg hatchability and larval development.
