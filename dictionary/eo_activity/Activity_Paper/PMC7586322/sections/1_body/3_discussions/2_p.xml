<p>Demonstration of various degrees of dose-dependent inhibition on both egg hatchability and larval development by all condensed tannin extracts is in agreement with previous studies by different authors.

 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> There are two hypotheses proposed to elucidate the anthelminthic effects of condensed tannins. Primarily, the direct hypothesis: the ability of these compounds to interact with proteins of the cuticle, oral cavity, esophagus, cloaca and vulva of nematodes, changing their chemical and physical properties. Secondly, the indirect hypothesis: the capacity of condensed tannins to bind dietary proteins and protect them from rumen degradation increasing protein flow to and amino acid absorption by the small intestine, improving host immune response against worms.
