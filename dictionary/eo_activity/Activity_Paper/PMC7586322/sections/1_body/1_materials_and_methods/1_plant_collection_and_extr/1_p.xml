 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and based on traditional knowledge obtained from the study area, fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Rhus glutinosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Syzygium guineensa</italic> and 
 <italic>Albizia gumifera</italic> were harvested from their natural habitat in and around Bahirdar area including Blue Nile river basin (LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE), Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. Thereafter, the plant materials were dried in a well-aerated dark room to avoid direct sun light. Then, 500 g of dried leaves were pulverized and placed in a mixer containing 3 L of 70% acetone in water containing ascorbic acid (1 g/L) to avoid oxidation. After that, the mixture was sonicated in a water bath for 20 min. The extract was obtained from the filtered material using a filter paper. Meanwhile, the acetone was evaporated from the extract at 45°C (in vacuo) using a roto-vapor (BUCHI, England). The aqueous solution was washed four times with 500 mL methylene chloride to remove chlorophyll and lipids. A separation funnel was used for discarding the methylene chloride fraction. The remaining fractions were lyophilized (Ningbo, China) and kept refrigerated at 4°C in airtight containers until their use for biochemical and biological assays.
