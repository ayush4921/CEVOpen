<p>The results of the in vitro tests were expressed as mean efficacy percentage of egg hatching or larval development inhibition Â± standard deviation. The concentrations of the extracts required to inhibit 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and 90% (IC
 <sub>90</sub>) of egg hatching as well as larval development; and the relative median potency estimates of the condense tannin extracts on egg hatchability larval development inhibition as compared to the positive control were calculated by probit analysis. Comparison of the mean egg hatchability and larval development inhibition was carried out by a one-way ANOVA. 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence level for all analysis.
