 <p>Atherosclerosis is a hallmark of most cardiovascular diseases. The implication of macrophages in this pathology is widely documented, notably for their contribution to lipid accumulation within the arterial wall, associated with oxidative stress and inflammation processes. In order to prevent or limit the atherosclerosis damage, nutritional approaches and medicinal plant-based therapies need to be considered. In Reunion Island, medicinal plant-based beverages are traditionally used for their antioxidant, lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of our study was to assess the protective effects of eight medicinal plant decoctions in an in vitro model of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages exposed to pro-atherogenic conditions (oxidized low-density lipoproteins—ox-LDL—
  <italic>E. coli</italic> Lipopolysaccharides—LPS). The impact of polyphenol-rich medicinal plant decoctions on cell viability was evaluated by Neutral Red assay. Fluorescent ox-LDL uptake was assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Activation of NF-κB was evaluated by quantification of secreted alkaline phosphatase in RAW-Blue™ macrophages. Our results show that medicinal plant decoctions limited the cytotoxicity induced by ox-LDL on macrophages. Flow cytometry analysis in macrophages demonstrated that medicinal plant decoctions from 
  <italic>S. cumini</italic> and 
  <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> decreased ox-LDL uptake and accumulation by more than 70%. In addition, medicinal plant decoctions also inhibited NF-κB pathway activation in the presence of pro-inflammatory concentrations of 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. Our data suggest that medicinal plant decoctions exert protective effects on ox-LDL-induced cytotoxicity and limited macrophage lipid uptake. Moreover, herbal preparations displayed anti-inflammatory properties on macrophages that can be of interest for limiting the atherosclerotic process.
