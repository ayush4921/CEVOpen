<p>In this study, eight medicinal plant decoctions used in Reunion Island were evaluated for their possible contribution to atherosclerosis prevention and treatment: 
 <italic>Aphloia theiformis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic>, 
 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Hubertia ambavilla</italic>, 
 <italic>Hypericum lanceolatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Pelargonium x graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> and 
 <italic>Syzygium cumini</italic>. Based on our previous study [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reporting the composition and antioxidant effects of infusions and decoction of these eight plants, we hypothesized that the variety of polyphenols contained in these extracts could confer them interesting properties to limit the processes underlying atherogenesis. Medicinal plants with a higher polyphenol content, especially those containing quercetin, isorhamnetin, chlorogenic acid or kaempferol, could have an interesting bioactivity in this context [

 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The impact of the medicinal plant decoctions on macrophage cytotoxicity induced by ox-LDL and inflammation-induced NF-ÎºB signaling pathway as well as on ox-LDL uptake was also investigated.
