<p>RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded at 200 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL on coverslips in a 24-well plate and FBS-starved for 16 h before stimulation. Cells were washed with 500 µL of PBS and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> with cell culture medium supplemented with Dil-ox-LDL. After the incubation, cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol, 1 ng/mL, Life Technologies) for 10 min and rinsed twice with PBS. The coverslips were then recovered and sealed before analysis using a Nanozoomer scanner (Hamamatsu, Iwata City, Japan) and a Nikon C2Si confocal microscope (Nikon, Melville, IL, USA).
