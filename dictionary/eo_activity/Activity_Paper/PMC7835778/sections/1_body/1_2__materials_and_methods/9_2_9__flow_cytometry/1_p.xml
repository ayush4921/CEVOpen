<p>RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 250 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL in a 96-well plate. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated with cell culture medium supplemented with Dil-ox-LDL for 4 h, lifted with Accutase™ (400 units/mL, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dardilly, France) for 15 min at 37 °C and transferred into a 96-well plate with U-bottom. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at RT and centrifuged at 700× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded and PBS was added. Cells were centrifuged at 700× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min and re-suspended in 100 µL PBS. Cellular uptake of Dil-ox-LDL was evaluated by measuring the mean phycoerythrin (PE-A) fluorescence on flow cytometer CYTOFLEX (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France). Fluorescence was expressed as percent of control.
