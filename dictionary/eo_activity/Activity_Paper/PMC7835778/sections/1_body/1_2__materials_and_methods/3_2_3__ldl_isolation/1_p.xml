<p>LDLs were extracted from a pool of plasma from 5 healthy subjects obtained from the “French Blood Agency”, according to an agreement signed between Inserm and “Etablissement Français du Sang”, which governs the supply of blood-derived products, in compliance with the French Ethical laws. Plasma was adjusted to a density of 1.063 g/mL by addition of solid KBr (Bio basic Inc., Markham, ON, Canada), with gentle stirring. Beckman Ultra-ClearTM sealing ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France) were filled with an aqueous solution of KBr (d = 1.063) and the plasma (15 mL) was added underneath to obtain a discontinuous density gradient. Finally, 3 mL of distilled water were added before sealing. Samples underwent an ultracentrifugation at 252,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 h, at 10 °C. Yellow LDL fractions were collected with a 10 mL syringe and followed a desalting step using centrifugal devices (50 mL centricon, 10 kDa cutoff, Millipore, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) with 5 washed with PBS after successive centrifugations (4000× 
 <italic>g</italic>/20 min). The purity of LDL was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining in order to detect potential protein contaminants. LDL protein concentration was quantified by using DC Protein Assay kit (Life Science, Bio-rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). LDL were stored at 4 °C in the dark and sterilized by filtration on a 0.2 µm membrane before use in cell culture.
