 <italic>Fisetin</italic> (
 <italic>3,3′,4′,7-Tetrahydroxyflavone</italic>), is natural product that could be found in vegetables and fruits [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. 
 <italic>Fisetin</italic> has been well established and possesses antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and anti-neurodegenerative progression [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Most recently, Jacob et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] have reported 
 <italic>Fisetin</italic> showed a significant protective effect on developmental Methyl mercury neurotoxicity in the F
 <sub>1</sub> generation of MeHg exposed rats. In that, Methyl mercury is a teratogenic and neurodevelopmental toxicant in the environment. Whereas MeHg could affect several biological pathways critical for brain development. Most recently, authors present study validated the effect of 
 <italic>Fisetin</italic> on developmental MeHg exposure induced alterations in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and Rho GTPase mRNA expressions in hippocampus of F
 <sub>1</sub> generation rats. Their extensive study showed that Fisetin against gestational MeHg exposure induced changes in expression of ERK/Caspase 3 genes of apoptosis signaling pathway and Rho A/Rac1/Cdc42 genes of Rho GTPase signaling pathway in hippocampus of F
 <sub>1</sub> generation weaning Wistar rats.
