<p>Osteoclastogenesis has been defined as a multistep processes of osteoclast differentiation [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], including several osteoclastic cellular biological functions; such as: migration, cellular contact, cellular fusion and cellular response extracellular factors [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Documented studies demonstrated that osteoclastogenesis initially mediated by two critical cytokines, the macrophage colony stimulating factor-1 (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. M-CSF binds to its receptor (cFms) present in osteoclast precursors, which stimulates their proliferation and inhibits their apoptosis; while, RANKL interacts with its receptor RANK in osteoclast precursor cells, and osteoclastognesis is induced [
