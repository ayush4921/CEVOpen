 <italic>Panacis Japonici Rhizoma</italic> (PJR), derived from dry rhizome of 
 <italic>Panax japonicus C. A. Meyer</italic> (Araliaceae), distributes in the southwest of China [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66â€“68</xref>]. As a widely used focal medicine, the PJR manifested similar clinical merits in anti-tussive and anti-inflammatory diseases [

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Recently, Chen et al. [
