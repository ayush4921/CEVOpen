<p>The compound (
 <italic>4,5,4′-trihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxybibenzyl</italic> (TDB)) extract from 
 <italic>Dendrobium ellipsophyllum Tang and Wang</italic>, has been demonstrated to have antimetastatic activity through the sensitization of detachment-induced cell death [

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Study from Chaotham et al. [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] showing that TDB reduced such cell migration and invasion by decreasing migration-regulating proteins, including integrins αv, α4, β1, β3 and β5, as well as downstream signaling proteins, such as activated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), activated Rac1 and Cdc42. As the presence of cellular protrusion, called filopodia, has been indicated as a hallmark of migrating cells, we showed that the reduction in the mentioned proteins correlated well with the disappearance of filopodia. In summary, the present study demonstrates the promising activity of TDB and its mechanism in the inhibition of lung cancer cell migration, which might be useful for encouraging the development of this compound for anti-metastatic approaches.
