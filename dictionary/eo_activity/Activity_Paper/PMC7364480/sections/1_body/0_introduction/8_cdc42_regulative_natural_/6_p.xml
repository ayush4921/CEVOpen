 <italic>Gigantol</italic> is a bibenzyl compound derived from the 
 <italic>Thai orchid, Dendrobium draconis</italic>. It exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines. Study conducted by Charoenrungruang et al. [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] demonstrates that gigantol suppresses the migratory cellular behavior via decreasing Cdc42, thereby suppressing filopodia formation. The inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>Gigantol</italic> on lung cancer cellular migration suggests that this compound may be suitable for further development for the treatment of osteoclastogenesis by regulating the osteoclastic cytoskeletal structuring.
