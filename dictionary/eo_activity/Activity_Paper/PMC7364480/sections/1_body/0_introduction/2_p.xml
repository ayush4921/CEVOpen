<p>However, at the late stage of osteoclastogenesis, osteoclastic polarization characterized the final maturation of bone resorptive osteoclasts. Notably, during the bone resorption process, osteoclastic polarization involves rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, in which a filamentous (F)-actin ring that comprises dense continuous zones of highly dynamic podosomes are formed and consequently an area of membrane that develops into the ruffled border is isolated [
