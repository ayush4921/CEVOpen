<p>Cdc42 stands as a central player in the regulation of podosome dynamics as it orchestrates podosome actin polymerization, which from the monomeric globular (G)-actin into filamentous (F)-actin, through its canonical effector, Wiscott–Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40–42</xref>]. WASp depletion in macrophages leads to a virtual absence of podosomes and a defective chemotactic response under a gradient of M-CSF. Cdc42 binds directly to WASp, a multidomain adapter protein regulating transmission of signals to the actin cytoskeleton. This binding, together with phosphorylation of WASp on tyrosine, induces a dramatic conformational change [
