<p>Characterized by the unique property, osteoclasts have been extensively studied for their differentiation and cellular functions during the bone homeostasis and pathological process, which makes them as a critical target for therapy in the bone loss diseases, such as: osteoporosis and osteolysis. Given that the low production costs and the increasing evidence of the ability to target the cellular activities and signaling cascades relevant to various diseases, naturally occurring compounds have received extensive attention as potential therapeutic osteoclastogenesis. Our current review has outlined some naturally occurring compounds, which have shown merit in terms of regulating macrophage polarization. However, given that current natural compounds have the Rac and Cdc42 regulatory effects on cancer cell line, the specific mechanisms and therapeutic effects on osteoclastognesis remain incompletely understood. Clearly, more in-depth characterization of osteoclast cytoskeleton rearrangement and relevant therapeutic compounds should be conducted to identify the best possible strategies.</p>
