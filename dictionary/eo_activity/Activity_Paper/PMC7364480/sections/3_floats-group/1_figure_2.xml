  <title>The schematic of molecular mechanisms of Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42, and relevant therapeutic natural compounds</title>
  <p>During the osteoclastogenesis, after RANKL and RANK binding, the intracellular Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42 are via GTP associate with podosomes regulation. However, these regulation effects might inhibited by various compounds (Left panel: inhibitory compounds for Rac1 and Rac2; Right panel: inhibitory compounds for Cdc42).</p>
