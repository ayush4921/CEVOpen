<p>The relationship among ethnobotanical indices i.e. CSI, RFC and UV were found significant at the 0.01 level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241705.g007">Fig 7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241705.s002">S2 Table</xref>). A positive correlation was present between CSI and RFC (r = 0.59**), followed by CSI and UV (r = 0.51**) and RFC and UV (r = 0.25**). The positive correlation provides evidence of cultural importance of each species and relative importance of the use of plants. The fact that these indices are strongly correlated means that their patterns across species match.
