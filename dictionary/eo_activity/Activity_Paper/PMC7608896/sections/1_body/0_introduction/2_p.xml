 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], nevertheless Poaceae remained among the least explored plant family. In the past, grasses rich in nutrition were preferred over those that have therapeutically important compounds [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Grasses are of particular importance in traditional health care system due to the presence of biologically active compound like alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The presence of alkaloids makes them highly resistant against foreign microbes while flavonoids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiviral activity, and also help animals to repair oxidative cell damage [

 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>, 
 <italic>Sacchrum spontaneum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Imperata cylindrica</italic> have been found to be effective in inflammation and fungal diseases in animals [

 <italic>Chloris barbata</italic> is used as disinfectant [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while
