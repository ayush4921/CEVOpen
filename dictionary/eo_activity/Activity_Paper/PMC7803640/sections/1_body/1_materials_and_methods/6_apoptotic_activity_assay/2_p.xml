 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Widowati et al. (2019b)</xref>. Treated and control HepG2 cells were washed using PBS 1x and harvested using trypsin-EDTA for apoptotic assay. The pellet was washed using Annexin Binding Buffer 1X (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-820) 500 μL and stained with Annexin V-FITC (BioLegend, 79998) and Propidium Iodide (BioLegend, 79997). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Cells were later suspended in Annexin Binding Buffer 1x. The HepG2 cells apoptotic percentage were analyzed using MACSquant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec).
