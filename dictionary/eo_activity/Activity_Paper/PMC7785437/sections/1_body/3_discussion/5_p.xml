<p id="p0160">There are implicit drawback with the use of animals in testing pharmacological research, such as ethical concerns and the lack of justification for their use when other appropriate assay are available or could be reviewed. Hence, the current study is being proposed for anti-inflammatory property through protein denaturation bioassay of EEMLR and EEQGL. Besides, the present result exposed a dose-dependent inhibition of protein (albumin) denaturation by EEMLR and EEQGL, where positive result was noted at high dosages which may due to the presence flavonoids group (
