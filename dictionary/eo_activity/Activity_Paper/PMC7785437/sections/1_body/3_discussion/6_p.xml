<p id="p0165">There are numerous agents including tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), streptokinase (SK), urokinase (UK) etc. globally to treat atherothrombotic diseases (

Analgesics can behave on the central or peripheral nervous system which act by blocking the pathway of impulses at the receiver active site such as COX1 (cyclooxygenase-1) and COX2 (cyclooxygenase-2), while central analgesics not only elevate the threshold for pain but also adjust the physiological response to pain and inhibit depression (

 <sub>2</sub>) from hypothalamus, blocking the neuron-to-neuron inflammation transaction, and boosting anti-inflammatory impulses at the site of action (

The result showed that EEMLR and EEQGL had significant antipyretic impacts in yeast-provoked elevated body temperature following Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia method and implications for EEQGL in 3 hrs of 97.13 ± 0.37 while EEMLR exercised 96.23 ± 0.33 comparable to paracetamol. The presence of steroids, alkaloids and flavonoids in EEMLR and EEQGL may be a possible reason for this analgesic and antipyretic activity (
