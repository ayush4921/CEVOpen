<p id="p0145">The phytochemical investigations carried out over the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. longipes</italic> root and 
 <italic>Q. gomeziana</italic> leaves demonstrated the existence of certain bioactive compounds. In this experiment, seven bioactive compounds were screened with these two extracts, out of which just five in both extracts notably alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, saponins and gums and two in extract of EEMLR entitled glycosides and tannins were also present (
