<p id="p0170">The present study validates that ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. longipes </italic>and
 <italic> Q. gomeziana</italic> have great value as a pharmacological source. Potent cytotoxic activity against Brine shrimp was detected, and a maximum percentage of DPPH inhibition was measured. The EEMLR represents the significant antipyretic effect by Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia method, thrombolytic by clot lysis method, and membrane-stabilizing behaviors against lysis-induced erythrocyte. On the contrary, EEQGL represents the exemplified comparable analgesic responses in Eddy's hot plate test and anti-inflammatory protein denaturation bioassay effect. Bioactive effects may be due to phytochemical groups such as alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, gums, saponins, steroids, and glycosides. Further evaluations are meant to validate these study hypotheses and to clarify the real purpose of these findings.
