<p id="p0135">The EEMLR (500 mg/kg b.w, p.o) and EEQGL (500 mg/kg b.w, p.o) were used to have a pronounced core analgesic effect as reflected by a dramatic improvement comparison with control (1% v/v Tween-80, 1 ml/100 g) in the Eddy's hot plate test represented in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. EEQGL (500 mg/kg b.w, p.o) was reported to be 34.33 ± 0.967 s mean latency, statistically significant (
