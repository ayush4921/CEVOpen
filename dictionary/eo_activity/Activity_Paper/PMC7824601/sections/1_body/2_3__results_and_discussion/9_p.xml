<p>Lastly, it seems imperative to mention the hopanoids triterpenes, which are the major class found in 
 <italic>A. quercifolia</italic> rhizomes, mainly due to the presence of hop-16-ene (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This type of triterpenes frequently occurs in ferns and was described for the first time by John Hope, a British botanist [

 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Several hopanoids, including hop-16-ene and diploptene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f003">Figure 3</xref>), were found in 
 <italic>Davallia mariesii</italic> rhizomes, and our results are identical to those previously reported [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The mass fragments confirm, in particular, the position of the double bond at C16 = C17 in hop-16-ene and C22 = C29 in diploptene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, the NMR data showed a proton sign at δ 5.28 ppm correlated with a carbon sign at δ 115.6 ppm characteristics of the hop-16-ene vinylic proton and carbon. Whereas in the case of diploptene, it is possible to detect the vinylic proton and carbon, respectively, at δ 4.78 and δ 109.9 ppm, data that are similar to the ones previously reported [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is also important to highlight that the hop-16-ene DEPT 90 and DEPT 135 spectra confirm the presence of 6 methine, 10 methylene, and 8 methyl carbons, data that also ensure the proposed structure (
