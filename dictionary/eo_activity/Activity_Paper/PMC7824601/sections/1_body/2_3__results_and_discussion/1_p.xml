 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a few studies involving GC-MS analysis were reported [

 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this species still is, from the chemical profile point of view, underexplored. So, both rhizome and leaves were extracted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane at room temperature, aiming to obtain the lipophilic profile. Although this type of extraction was not reported for this species, our experience indicates that low extraction yields, such as the ones herein reported (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), are typical in plants growing in warm environments [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, it was possible the identification and quantification, using GC-MS, of the major compounds present in both rhizome and leaves extracts, whose chromatograms demonstrate the richness in lipophilic compounds, although some only in traces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This analysis allowed identifying a total of 59 compounds, 31 in rhizome extract, and 34 in leaves extract. These were distributed through several chemical families, explicitly amid fatty acids, short-chain carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, terpenoids, alkanes, and alcohols. The retention time, identification, and content of each compound in mg/g of dried rhizome or leaves Â± standard deviation of each species are presented in
