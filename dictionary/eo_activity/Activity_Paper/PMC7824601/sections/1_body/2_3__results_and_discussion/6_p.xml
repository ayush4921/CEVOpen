<p>A detailed analysis of 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows that 
 <italic>A. quercifolia</italic> leaves are incredibly rich in fatty acids, both saturated fatty acids (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), from which, respectively, palmitic acid (237.27 ± 0.59 mg/g dry leaves) and linolenic acid (253.71 ± 0.93 mg/g dry leaves) can be highlighted (

In the case of leaves, it is evident that some nutritional indexes, such as ω−6/ω−3 (total of omega-6 acids/total of omega-3 acids ratio), atherogenicity index (AI), and thrombogenicity index (TI), present values (ω−6/ω−3 = 0.68; AI = 0.59; TI = 0.30) that suggest nutritional and health-promoting values [
