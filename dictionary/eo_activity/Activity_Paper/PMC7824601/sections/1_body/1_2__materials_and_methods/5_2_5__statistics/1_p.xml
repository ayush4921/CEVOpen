<p>Independent replicates of each sample were analyzed and each aliquot was injected twice. The presented results are the average of four concordant values obtained for each sample (less than 5% variation between injections of the same aliquot and between aliquots of the same sample) and expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (MV ± SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan’s multiple-range test were performed using the GraphPad Prism version 7 for Windows (Graphpad Software, Inc.) to compare the results of each independent replicates. A
