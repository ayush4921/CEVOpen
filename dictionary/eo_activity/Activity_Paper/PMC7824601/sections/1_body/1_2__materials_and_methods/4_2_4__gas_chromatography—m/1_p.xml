<p>The GC-MS analysis of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts was done using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra system equipped with autosampler AOC-20i, ion source: electronic impact high-performance Quadrupole mass filter. Separation of the compounds was carried out in a DB-5J&amp;W capillary column (30.0 m in length × 0.25 mm in diameter × 0.25 µm thickness of the film). The spectroscopic detection from the mass spectrometer utilized 0.1 kV electron ionization. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a column flow of 1.18 mL/min. GC-injection temperature was set to ϑ = 320 °C and split ratio of 50 was applied to an injection volume of 1 µL. The mass spectrometer ion source temperature was set to ϑ = 250 °C and the interface temperature to ϑ = 300 °C.
