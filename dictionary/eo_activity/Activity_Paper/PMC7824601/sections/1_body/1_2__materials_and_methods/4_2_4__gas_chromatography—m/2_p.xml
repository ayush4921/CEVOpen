<p>The extracts were weight with approximately m = 20 mg on an analytical scale into a tube. DCM was used as a solvent and 
 <italic>n</italic>-tetracosane as an internal standard, added to the tube with 1 mL in total. The extracts were then dissolved in an ultra-sonic bath. For the silylation, 250 µL pyridine, 250 µL BSTFA, and 50 µL TMSCl were added. The mixture was maintained in a water bath at ϑ = 70 °C for 45 min being the hydroxy and the carboxy groups present in each secondary metabolite converted to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers and esters, respectively. Afterwards were injected twice in the GC-MS apparatus. The silylation reagents quantity, the water bath temperature and the reaction time were previously optimized to ensure a total conversion of all compounds with hydroxy groups into the correspondent TMS derivatives.
