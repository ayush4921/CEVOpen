<p>Studied compounds were examined for their therapeutic activity against 25 common diseases using Meta-Core/MetaDrug platform of Clarivate Analytics (Philadelphia, PA, USA). Training set of compounds were collected from FDA approved compounds, candidate drugs in clinical phases and hit compounds from in vivo activities. Results showed that synthesized compounds can be used as antibacterial agents. Following training and test set compound numbers were used in bacterial QSAR model constructions: Training set N = 530, test set N = 97, sensitivity = 0.87, specificity = 0.90, accuracy = 0.89, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.77.</p>
