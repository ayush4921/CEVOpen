<p>Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a protozoon called Leishmania which is transmitted by the bite of infected female sand flies. Poor nutrition lack of sanitation weakened immune system and poverty facilitate spread of the disease in underdeveloped and developing countries. The disease occurs in 3 different forms: cutaneous (most common), visceral (also known as kala-azar and the most serious form of the disease), and mucocutaneous. An estimated 700,000 to 1 million new cases are reported annually, and 26,000 to 65,000 disease-related deaths are reported by the World Health Organization.While cutaneous form is endemic in Southeastern Anatolia, visceral form is mostly seen in Mediterranean, Central Anatolian and Aegean Regions andimportant constitutes an important health problem for Turkey [21,22].</p>
