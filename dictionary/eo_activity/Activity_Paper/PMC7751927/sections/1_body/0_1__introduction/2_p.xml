<p>Antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections for many years in the early 20th century. Penicillin was the first antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics, which are effective by killing or stopping the growth of bacteria, cause the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens and the development of resistance if used unconsciously and excessively. In addition, the long-term use of antibiotics damages our microbiota and losing the beneficial microorganisms has negative consequence. Approximately 16 million people die annually due to bacterial infections, while developing new approaches to combating drug-resistant pathogens and infectious diseases. New substances have been synthesized due to technological developments and have been used in various bacterial infections for therapeutic purposes [19,20].</p>
