<p>Binary quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) common disease models from Clarivate Analytics MetaCore/MetaDrug platform were used for the therapeutic activity predictions of synthesized compounds. For this aim, 25 different common diseases binary QSAR models were used. All the nine compounds were screened on MetaCore/MetaDrug platform and therapeutic activity values were predicted. Therapeutic activity values in MetaCore/MetaDrug are normalized between 0 and 1 (while 0 represents inactive compound, 1 represents active compounds). Although predicted therapeutic activity value higher than 0.5 indicates compound that may show activity, in the current study we used a higher cutoff value (0.75) for being in the safe zone. Table S1 at the supplementary information show corresponding predicted therapeutic activity values of each studied compound that has activity value equal or more than 0.75. When we check diseases in Table S1 it can be seen that synthesized compounds can be considered mainly for bacterial, angina, allergy, depression and obesity models. Since the investigated compounds are analogs of each other they showed similar TAV values in certain disease models such as antibacterial profile. Thus, from these diseases we considered to perform antibacterial in vitro assays using these compounds. Furthermore, since known antifungal and antileishmanial effect of benz [
