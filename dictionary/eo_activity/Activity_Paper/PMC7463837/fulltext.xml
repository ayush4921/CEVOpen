Introduction</title><p>Medicinal plants, also referred to as herbal plants, have been used for centuries as a source for alternative medicines in the prevention and treatments of various diseases. Globally, plant-based products have been well-accepted due to scientific evidence that proved their low to no side effects and low price compared to modern medicine [<xref rid="B1-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Presently, approximately 70&#x02013;80% of the world&#x02019;s population depend on plant-based products as their primary healthcare needs [<xref rid="B2-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Malaysia, the herbal industry has become one of the most important sectors with RM 80 million (USD 18 million) production values in 2018. With an ever increasing demand, the value has been projected to increase manifolds [<xref rid="B3-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>Clinacanthus nutans</italic>, commonly known as Sabah snake grass, is a medicinal plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae and is among the more important medicinal plants in Malaysia. It is an annual shrub which grows up to three meters tall with lanceolate-ovate shaped leaves [<xref rid="B4-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The species is being widely used in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia as a remedy for the treatment of herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, fever, diabetes and as anti-venom for snake and scorpion bites [<xref rid="B5-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Dried leaves of <italic>C. nutans</italic> are also known to treat hepatitis infection, fever, eczema, shingles and inflammation [<xref rid="B6-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The medicinal properties of <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaf extracts have been recognized for many generations and have been commonly used in traditional medicines. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Malaysia, <italic>C. nutans</italic> has been selected under the National Key Economic Area (NKEA) research grant schemes alongside 17 other herbal plants. They were selected based on their potentials for commercialization [<xref rid="B10-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Meanwhile, in Thailand, the National Drug Committee recognized <italic>C. nutans</italic> as one of Thailand&#x02019;s National List of Essential Medicines in 2011 [<xref rid="B11-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Presently, the extraction of bioactive compounds or plant secondary metabolites from plant-based sources has gained attention in pharmaceutical industries. Advances in plant biochemistry and herbal medicines have identified several bioactive compounds in <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaf extracts, namely stigmasterol, kaempferol, quercetin, gallic acid, apigenin and vitexin. Additionally, several unique bioactive compounds have also been identified such as clinacoside (A, B, C), cycloclinacoside (A1, A2), clinamide (A, B, C, D, E), 2-cis-entadamide A and entadamide (A, C) [<xref rid="B8-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Generally, natural products are the most preferred source of antioxidants in disease prevention than synthetic antioxidants due to them having few side effects. The demand for the raw material of <italic>C. nutans</italic> has led to the over-harvesting of the wild species which has significantly reduced their availability in nature [<xref rid="B4-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, a biotechnological approach in the propagation of the plant through an in vitro technique is perceived as an alternative method for the large-scale production of the raw materials in a shorter time. Plant growth regulators, the basal medium strength and sucrose concentration largely influence the success of an in vitro technique for plant propagation. Through this technique, the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities are also known to be affected. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of plant growth regulators, basal medium strength and sucrose concentrations of in vitro culture of <italic>C. nutans</italic> with the aim of optimizing the basal medium for the mass propagation of plants. The study also was conducted to analyze the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities between the leaves of tissue-cultured and conventionally propagated <italic>C. nutans</italic> as affected by different aqueous extraction temperatures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-09-01030"><title>2.

Shoot Induction of <italic>C. nutans</italic> as Affected by Cytokinins</title><p>In plant tissue culture techniques, plant growth regulators such as cytokinins and auxins are vital elements directly affecting plant growth and the development of the plantlets. Cytokinin is commonly used in shoot induction and the multiplication stages of explants. In the present study, the shoot induction of nodal segments was conducted by supplementing Murashige and Skoog (MS) [<xref rid="B14-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] basal medium with various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), a synthetic cytokinin, and N6-furfuryladenine (kinetin) (<xref rid="plants-09-01030-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results indicated that the MS basal medium without cytokinin (MS0), 4 &#x000b5;M BAP and 4 &#x000b5;M kinetin exhibited 88.89% shoot regeneration. Other treatments were successful in exhibiting 100% shoot regeneration. Shoot induction was observed from day four after explant inoculation. During shoot regeneration, the enlargement of the dormant axillary buds of nodal segments was observed, followed by bud breaks. Subsequently, shoot formation and proliferation occurred.</p><p>The number and length of shoots of <italic>C. nutans</italic> were significantly affected by the inclusion of various concentrations of cytokinins in the culture medium. The highest number of shoots was produced in treatment with 8 &#x000b5;M kinetin, with a total of 1.57 shoots. The longest shoot was recorded from a medium supplemented with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP, with a length of 2.29 cm. Compared with all other treatments, only the treatment with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP was able to produce a shoot length of more than 2.00 cm. In the measured parameters, MS0 produced the lowest number of shoots (1.00 shoot) and the shortest shoot length (1.41 cm). In terms of yield production, the highest number and fresh weight of leaves were recorded from a treatment with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP yielding 4.78 leaves and 16.00 mg, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01030-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The fresh weight of leaves for the MS basal medium supplemented with various other concentrations of BAP increased gradually until the 12 &#x000b5;M BAP treatment. The fresh weight of leaves decreased two-fold in the 16 &#x000b5;M BAP concentration. A similar trend was also observed for the MS basal medium supplemented with various concentrations of kinetin. The fresh weight of leaves gradually increased until it reached a peak at 12 &#x000b5;M kinetin before dropping off.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-plants-09-01030"><title>2.1.2. Synergistic Effect of Cytokinin and Auxins</title><p>In the present study, a treatment with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP was established as the best cytokinin concentration for the shoot induction of <italic>C. nutans</italic> nodal explants. The concentration was used with various concentrations of auxins. It is known that cytokinin is a plant hormone applied exogenously in basal media for the promotion of cell division and cell differentiation, while auxin is used to promote the cell elongation of explants.</p><p><xref rid="plants-09-01030-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the effect of the supplementation of auxins in the basal medium. The highest shoot regeneration percentage (100%) for the parameter was obtained from the MS basal medium supplemented with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP without the addition of auxin. The lowest shoot regeneration percentage (44.44%) was recorded from treatment supplemented with auxin at 8 &#x000b5;M indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The results implied that the addition of auxin significantly reduced the number of shoots and leaves being formed. The maximum numbers and length of shoots were recorded from control treatment with 1.67 shoots and 3.23 cm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01030-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). In the basal medium supplemented with auxin, 4 &#x000b5;M IBA recorded the maximum number and length of shoots with 1.44 shoots and 1.76 cm, respectively.</p><p>Synergistic effects between cytokinins and auxins also affected the number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. The control treatment recorded the highest number of leaves (7.34 leaves) and fresh weight of leaves (21.57 mg), while the lowest was recorded from the treatment medium supplemented with 8 &#x000b5;M IBA with 0.89 leaves and 1.33 mg fresh weight of leaves. The addition of auxins in the basal medium of culture is known to be widely used for the induction of either the roots or callus. In the present study, the formation of callus was observed in all treatments including the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01030-f001">Figure 1</xref>d). The treatment with 8 &#x000b5;M IBA accumulated the highest amount of callus with 69.00 mg. The lowest amount of callus was observed in the control treatment with 10.00 mg, implying that endogenous auxin had stimulated callus formation. Hence, the addition of exogenous auxin in the basal medium facilitated the formation of callus. The formation of callus at the base of the explants could have absorbed nutrients from the medium causing an interruption of nutrient absorption and stunting the growth of explants. In addition, root induction was also inhibited due to an excessive amount of callus formation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot3-plants-09-01030"><title>2.1.3. Optimization of Basal Medium Strength</title><p>In optimizing the strength of the basal medium in the in vitro propagation of <italic>C. nutans</italic> nodal explants, half-, full- and double-strength basal media were observed to vary in terms of the shoot regeneration responses. <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the shoot regeneration capabilities of explants where the half-strength basal medium fared poorly (44.44%) compared with the full- and double-strength media which both achieved 100% shoot regeneration. Results on the number of shoots showed no significant difference between the full- and double-strength basal media. The full-strength basal medium recorded 1.67 shoots, while the double-strength basal medium recorded 1.44 shoots. The lowest number of shoots was recorded in half-strength basal medium, with a total of 0.67 shoots. On the other hand, the present study recorded a significant difference between the strength of the basal medium on the length of shoots. The longest shoot was obtained from the full-strength basal medium with 3.23 cm, followed by double-strength with 2.83 cm and 1.35 cm from the half-strength basal medium. The strength of the basal medium was also found to have a significant effect on the number and fresh weight of leaves produced by the explants. The highest number and fresh weight of leaves were produced from the full-strength basal medium with 7.33 leaves and 21.57 mg, respectively. Meanwhile, the half-strength basal medium produced the lowest number of leaves (3.00 leaves) and fresh weight of leaves (1.78 mg). The observations suggest that the number of leaves produced from each treatment had a significant effect on the fresh weight of leaves. There was no significant difference between the full- and double-strength of the basal medium on the number of leaves. However, the full-strength basal medium significantly produced a higher fresh weight of leaves. One possible reason for this phenomenon could be that double-strength basal medium produced a smaller leaf size compared to full-strength medium despite having a higher number of leaves. The half-strength basal medium also produced smaller leaves compared to the full-strength basal medium. The difference in terms of the fresh weight of leaves was also observed between basal medium strengths.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot4-plants-09-01030"><title>2.1.4. Effects of Sucrose Concentrations on the Growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nutans</italic></title><p>One of the most important elements in plant tissue culture is carbon, as carbon plays a vital role as a source of energy and it controls the osmotic pressure of basal media. Sucrose is one of the most commonly used carbon sources in plant tissue culture due to its availability and cheaper price than other sugars. In the present experiment, the full-strength basal medium was supplemented with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP and various concentrations of sucrose (<xref rid="plants-09-01030-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the results in <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the explants were able to achieve 100% shoot regeneration for sucrose concentrations of 20 to 35 g/L. A sucrose concentration higher than 35 g/L resulted in a decrease in the percentage of shoot regeneration. The lowest shoot regeneration was obtained from the highest sucrose concentration (50 g/L) with 33.33% regeneration. The highest number of shoots was recorded from sucrose concentrations of 30 and 35 g/L (1.67 shoots). However, the concentration of 30 g/L significantly produced the longest shoot (3.23 cm). The maximum number of leaves (8.0 leaves) was obtained from a treatment with 25 g/L sucrose. However, the number of leaves produced from the treatment was not significantly different from the treatment at 30 g/L (7.33 leaves). The highest number of leaves did not reflect the fresh weight of leaves obtained. The highest fresh weight of leaves was recorded from the treatment of 30 g/L sucrose, with a weight of 21.67 mg. Meanwhile, sucrose at a concentration of 25 g/L recorded a fresh weight of 14.67 mg. Although the sucrose concentration of 25 g/L recorded the highest number of leaves, the leaves produced were smaller than that of the sucrose concentration at 30 g/L. Among all the sucrose concentrations tested, the concentration of 50 g/L was least preferred in terms of the percentage of shoot regeneration (33.33%), number of shoots (0.33 shoots), length of shoots (1.18 cm), number of leaves (0.90 leaves) and fresh weight of leaves (0.68 mg).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-09-01030"><title>2.2.

Antioxidant Activities</title><p>The antioxidant activities of <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaf extracts, propagated via conventional and tissue culture techniques, were measured using five in vitro antioxidant assays including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), superoxide anion radical scavenging activity and iron (II) chelating activity. All antioxidant assays were measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at a specific absorbance. A standard graph was generated using trolox as a standard for the DPPH free radical scavenging activity (y = 0.0007x + 0.0865, R2 = 0.989), ABTS scavenging activity (y = 0.0106x + 0.09, R2 = 0.997) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (y = 0.0044x + 0.066, R2 = 0.999).

The lowest DPPH free radical scavenging activity was recorded for the aqueously extracted conventionally propagated leaves at 100 &#x000b0;C with 2.44 mg TE/g DW.</p><p>The measurement of the ABTS scavenging activity is based on the ability of an extract to scavenge the ABTS cation radical. The reaction between the ABTS cation radical and extract reduces the dark blue color of ABTS.

Discussion</title><p>In this present study, the optimum basal medium formulation by the alteration of plant growth regulators, basal medium strength and sucrose concentration for the in vitro propagation of <italic>C. nutans</italic> were established. In plant tissue culture, plant growth regulators are one of the most important factors affecting the growth of explants. In a single node culture of <italic>C. nutans</italic>, the shoot induction was affected by the application of cytokinin in the culture medium. The synthesis of cytokinin in plants becomes limited due to injury when plant parts are excised into smaller sizes [<xref rid="B15-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, cytokinin was supplemented in the basal medium to support shoot induction, cell division and cell differentiation. In the present study, 12 &#x000b5;M BAP was more favorable than other cytokinins in the initial stage of the shoot induction of <italic>C. nutans</italic>. A study on <italic>Justicia gendarussa</italic> (Acanthaceae) showed that the supplementation of BAP in an MS basal medium exhibited the highest percentage of shoot induction, number of shoots and shoot length, compared to a basal medium supplemented with kinetin and thidiazuron (TDZ) [<xref rid="B17-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, similar studies on <italic>Andrographis paniculate</italic>, which belong to the same family as <italic>C. nutans</italic> and <italic>J. gendarussa</italic>, also recorded that the application of BAP was able to produce a higher percentage of shoot regeneration and number of shoots [<xref rid="B19-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The integration of cytokinin and auxin is the most commonly used technique in plant tissue cultures to increase the multiplication and proliferation rates of plantlets. However, the present study observed that the application of auxin significantly reduced the percentage of shoot regeneration, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. A supplementation with auxin resulted in the production of a massive amount of callus. Auxin is supplemented in plant tissue culture basal medium to facilitate cell elongation and induce rooting. In several cases, due to the presence of endogenous auxin in plants, callus is formed [<xref rid="B20-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The current findings on the effects of auxin were also supported by a previous study on <italic>Tylophora indica</italic> in which a combination of BAP and IBA in as low as 1.23 &#x000b5;M of a basal medium significantly reduced the growth of the plant compared to same cultured in BAP alone [<xref rid="B21-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, another study on <italic>Spilanthes acmella</italic> Murr. reported that the supplementation of cytokinin alone in the basal medium produced better growth [<xref rid="B22-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In both of these studies, the callus formation was observed in the basal regions of the explants [<xref rid="B21-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The effect of the basal medium strength on the in vitro growth of <italic>C. nutans</italic> was also investigated. The full-strength MS basal medium yielded superior results for all the parameters studied. Similar results were also reported in a previous study by Chen et al. [<xref rid="B23-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], where a full-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 4.44 &#x000b5;M BAP and 0.11 &#x000b5;M NAA produced the highest multiplication rate and the longest shoots for <italic>C. nutans</italic>. The study reported that as the basal medium strength was reduced to half, the number of leaves and length of shoots significantly decreased. Besides, the growth rate slowed and the explants stunted. Based on the growth vigor and morphological changes, the full-strength basal medium produced more vigorous shoots and greener leaves compared to half-strength basal medium which produced yellowish leaves. The full-strength basal medium was also found to be most effective for the micropropagation of <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> [<xref rid="B24-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], <italic>Bacopa monnieri</italic> [<xref rid="B25-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and <italic>Thymus hyemalis</italic> [<xref rid="B26-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All of these findings were in agreement with current findings, indicating the effectiveness of the full-strength MS basal medium for the medicinal plant studied. On the contrary, the double-strength MS basal medium appeared to be a toxic basal medium, while quarter- and half-strength MS basal media were found to cause nutrient deficiencies in explants [<xref rid="B24-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The MS basal medium is known to be a balanced culture medium in terms of macronutrients, micronutrients and vitamins suitable for a wide range of plant species.</p><p>A continuous supply of carbon is important in plant tissue cultures in order to support plant growth. Several studies have been conducted on different species of plants. In a study by Naz et al. [<xref rid="B27-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], carbon sources including sucrose, glucose and fructose at concentrations from 10 to 50 g/L were supplemented in the basal medium of <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic>. The results indicated that 30 g/L of sucrose exhibited the best result for all the parameters measured. Similarly, Reddy et al. [<xref rid="B28-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported similar results for <italic>Ceropegia ensifolia</italic>. The addition of 30 g/L sucrose was found to be the optimum for the growth of <italic>Thymus hyemalis</italic> compared to other types of carbon sources including glucose, fructose, mannitol and sorbitol [<xref rid="B17-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The studies implied that a sucrose concentration higher than 30 g/L results in a decrease in the multiplication and growth rate of plants [<xref rid="B24-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These findings were in agreement with the present study in which 30 g/L of sucrose was established as the optimum for the growth of <italic>C. nutans</italic>. The literature has previously found that sucrose is found to be the most suitable carbon source for in vitro propagation compared to glucose, fructose and other types of sugar, and is the most common carbohydrate present in the phloem saps of plants. Hence, the translocation process in the plant will be eased [<xref rid="B29-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The addition of sucrose at more than the optimum level would increase the osmotic pressure of the basal medium, causing the water and mineral uptake by explants to be inhibited. Gas exchange in culture vessels would be limited resulting in an increased toxicity of the basal medium [<xref rid="B31-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the propagation technique (tissue culture and conventional propagation) and the effects of aqueous temperatures (25 and 100 &#x000b0;C) on the extraction of phenolics contents and antioxidant activities were studied. Based on the total polyphenols, total phenolic acids and total flavonoids contents measured, tissue-cultured leaves significantly produced higher values on all the parameters under study compared to the conventionally propagated leaves. The extractions at 100 &#x000b0;C recorded a higher amount of total polyphenols, total phenolic acids and total flavonoids from both sources of leaves compared to extractions at 25 &#x000b0;C. Pandey et al. [<xref rid="B32-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] conducted a study on <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, comparing the leaves of the tissue-cultured plant and conventionally propagated mother plants. They found that the leaves of tissue-cultured plants significantly produced higher total phenolics, flavonoids and tannins contents than the leaves of the mother plant. In another study comparing the field-grown and tissue-cultured plants of <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> var., Ellagance Blue, Blue River and Munstead found that tissue-cultured plants of all three varieties exhibited a higher total polyphenols content compared to field-grown plants [<xref rid="B33-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A study by Bose et al. [<xref rid="B34-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported a similar finding on mother and tissue-cultured plants of <italic>Nardostachys jatamansi</italic> extracted with different extraction solvents including methanol, acetone, chloroform, acetonitrile and water. Their results showed that the leaves of tissue-cultured plants significantly produced higher total phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins contents in all the extraction solvents tested. The variations in phenolics content could be due to different extraction processes such as different extraction temperatures and different sources of plants. The concentration of secondary metabolites in plants could be affected by hormonal contents as well as endogenous physiological changes in the plants. According to Umebese and Falana [<xref rid="B35-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the accumulation of the phenolics content is generally low when plants are grown under nonstress conditions. The accumulation of phenolics increases when plants are exposed to stress conditions.</p><p>In an antioxidant activities study, it was observed that leaves from tissue-cultured plants exhibited higher DPPH, ABTS and FRAP values compared to leaves from conventionally propagated plants. Studies by Amoo et al. [<xref rid="B36-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Bhattacharyya et al. [<xref rid="B37-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] on <italic>Aloe arborescene</italic> and <italic>Dendrobium thyrsiflorum</italic>, reported similar findings. The strong antioxidant activities in plant extracts could be due to the presence of high concentrations of secondary metabolites such as phenolics, tannins and alkaloids contents. High concentrations of secondary metabolites in plant samples enhance their redox properties and the ability to scavenge free radicals [<xref rid="B38-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>A study on superoxide anion radical scavenging activities showed that leaves from tissue-cultured plants produced a higher inhibition percentage in comparison with leaves from conventionally propagated plants. Similar findings were reported on shoot and root extracts of tissue-cultured <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, producing a higher inhibition percentage of superoxide anion radical scavenging activity compared to extracts from seed-derived plants [<xref rid="B40-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Superoxide radicals are known to be extremely harmful as they can act as a precursor for the production of reactive oxygen species. An excessive amount of superoxide anions produced in cells increases dismutation and leads to hydrogen peroxide production and thereby increases the oxidative stress levels in the human body [<xref rid="B41-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, the ability of plant samples to scavenge superoxide anion is important to reduce the concentration of superoxide radicals and lower oxidative stress levels.</p><p>The results in the present study on the phenolics content and antioxidant activities recorded that aqueous temperature of 100 &#x000b0;C was more prominent in producing a higher phenolic content and antioxidant activities compared to the aqueous temperature of 25 &#x000b0;C. The results showed that the coefficient of diffusion and phenolic contents solubility increased as the aqueous temperature was increased. An increased solubility of phenolic contents by a higher temperature favors the release of bound phenolics in samples with cellular constituents of the plant cell breakdown which leads to an increase in the cell membrane permeability [<xref rid="B41-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, an elevated extraction temperature causes the rate of thermally stable antioxidants to be higher than the rate of decomposition of less soluble antioxidants [<xref rid="B42-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This was proven by 100 &#x000b0;C aqueous extraction of <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaves to gain higher antioxidant activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-09-01030"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, different plant growth factors, including plant growth regulators, basal medium strength and sucrose concentration, were used to determine the most suitable formulation for a plant tissue culture of <italic>C. nutans</italic>. The study reported that the full-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 12 &#x000b5;M BAP and 30 g/L sucrose exhibited the best result in terms of a high percentage of shoot regeneration, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. In the next experiment, the phenolics content and antioxidant activities were quantified using 25 and 100 &#x000b0;C temperatures. The study found that tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 100 &#x000b0;C was more prominent by exhibiting higher total polyphenols (2.77 mg GAE/g DW), total phenolic acids (4.29 mg GAE/g DW), total flavonoids (21.76 mg RE/g DW), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (3.20 mg TE/g DW), ABTS scavenging activity (1.50 mg TE/g DW), FRAP assay (9.76 mg TE/g DW) and superoxide anion radical scavenging activity (53.74% inhibition). Meanwhile, the highest iron (II) chelating activity was recorded from conventionally propagated leaves extracted at 25 &#x000b0;C with 69.24% inhibition. Based on the results obtained, 100 &#x000b0;C was found to be the most suitable extraction temperature for the dried tissue-cultured leaves of <italic>C. nutans</italic>. This study successfully established a protocol for the propagation of <italic>C. nutans</italic> via a plant tissue culture study. Besides that, this present study also proved that tissue-cultured plants were able to produce high phenolic contents and antioxidant activities. Hence, these findings may contribute to the production of raw materials of <italic>C. nutans</italic> to fulfill the demand in the pharmaceutical industry.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Salleh Kadzimin for proofreading and editing this manuscript.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Z.H. performed the experiments, analyzed data, wrote and edited the manuscript.
