<p>The effect of the basal medium strength on the in vitro growth of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> was also investigated. The full-strength MS basal medium yielded superior results for all the parameters studied. Similar results were also reported in a previous study by Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], where a full-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 4.44 µM BAP and 0.11 µM NAA produced the highest multiplication rate and the longest shoots for 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic>. The study reported that as the basal medium strength was reduced to half, the number of leaves and length of shoots significantly decreased. Besides, the growth rate slowed and the explants stunted. Based on the growth vigor and morphological changes, the full-strength basal medium produced more vigorous shoots and greener leaves compared to half-strength basal medium which produced yellowish leaves. The full-strength basal medium was also found to be most effective for the micropropagation of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 
 <italic>Bacopa monnieri</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and 
 <italic>Thymus hyemalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All of these findings were in agreement with current findings, indicating the effectiveness of the full-strength MS basal medium for the medicinal plant studied. On the contrary, the double-strength MS basal medium appeared to be a toxic basal medium, while quarter- and half-strength MS basal media were found to cause nutrient deficiencies in explants [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The MS basal medium is known to be a balanced culture medium in terms of macronutrients, micronutrients and vitamins suitable for a wide range of plant species.
