<p>In an antioxidant activities study, it was observed that leaves from tissue-cultured plants exhibited higher DPPH, ABTS and FRAP values compared to leaves from conventionally propagated plants. Studies by Amoo et al. [

 <italic>Aloe arborescene</italic> and 
 <italic>Dendrobium thyrsiflorum</italic>, reported similar findings. The strong antioxidant activities in plant extracts could be due to the presence of high concentrations of secondary metabolites such as phenolics, tannins and alkaloids contents. High concentrations of secondary metabolites in plant samples enhance their redox properties and the ability to scavenge free radicals [
