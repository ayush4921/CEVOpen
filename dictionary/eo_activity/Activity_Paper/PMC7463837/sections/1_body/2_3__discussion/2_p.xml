<p>The integration of cytokinin and auxin is the most commonly used technique in plant tissue cultures to increase the multiplication and proliferation rates of plantlets. However, the present study observed that the application of auxin significantly reduced the percentage of shoot regeneration, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. A supplementation with auxin resulted in the production of a massive amount of callus. Auxin is supplemented in plant tissue culture basal medium to facilitate cell elongation and induce rooting. In several cases, due to the presence of endogenous auxin in plants, callus is formed [

 <italic>Tylophora indica</italic> in which a combination of BAP and IBA in as low as 1.23 ÂµM of a basal medium significantly reduced the growth of the plant compared to same cultured in BAP alone [

 <italic>Spilanthes acmella</italic> Murr. reported that the supplementation of cytokinin alone in the basal medium produced better growth [
