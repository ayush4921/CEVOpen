<p>A continuous supply of carbon is important in plant tissue cultures in order to support plant growth. Several studies have been conducted on different species of plants. In a study by Naz et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], carbon sources including sucrose, glucose and fructose at concentrations from 10 to 50 g/L were supplemented in the basal medium of 
 <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic>. The results indicated that 30 g/L of sucrose exhibited the best result for all the parameters measured. Similarly, Reddy et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported similar results for 
 <italic>Ceropegia ensifolia</italic>. The addition of 30 g/L sucrose was found to be the optimum for the growth of 
 <italic>Thymus hyemalis</italic> compared to other types of carbon sources including glucose, fructose, mannitol and sorbitol [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The studies implied that a sucrose concentration higher than 30 g/L results in a decrease in the multiplication and growth rate of plants [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These findings were in agreement with the present study in which 30 g/L of sucrose was established as the optimum for the growth of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic>. The literature has previously found that sucrose is found to be the most suitable carbon source for in vitro propagation compared to glucose, fructose and other types of sugar, and is the most common carbohydrate present in the phloem saps of plants. Hence, the translocation process in the plant will be eased [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The addition of sucrose at more than the optimum level would increase the osmotic pressure of the basal medium, causing the water and mineral uptake by explants to be inhibited. Gas exchange in culture vessels would be limited resulting in an increased toxicity of the basal medium [
