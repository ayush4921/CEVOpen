<p>All the experiments were laid out in a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the significant differences between treatments using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS ver. 9.4). The comparison of means was conducted using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05. The correlation between variables was conducted using a Pearson’s correlation analysis with indicator 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.30 indicating a negligible correlation, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.50 indicating a low correlation, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.70 indicating a moderate correlation, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.90 indicating a high correlation and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.0 indicating a very high correlation.
