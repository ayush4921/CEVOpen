<p>In optimizing the strength of the basal medium in the in vitro propagation of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> nodal explants, half-, full- and double-strength basal media were observed to vary in terms of the shoot regeneration responses. 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the shoot regeneration capabilities of explants where the half-strength basal medium fared poorly (44.44%) compared with the full- and double-strength media which both achieved 100% shoot regeneration. Results on the number of shoots showed no significant difference between the full- and double-strength basal media. The full-strength basal medium recorded 1.67 shoots, while the double-strength basal medium recorded 1.44 shoots. The lowest number of shoots was recorded in half-strength basal medium, with a total of 0.67 shoots. On the other hand, the present study recorded a significant difference between the strength of the basal medium on the length of shoots. The longest shoot was obtained from the full-strength basal medium with 3.23 cm, followed by double-strength with 2.83 cm and 1.35 cm from the half-strength basal medium. The strength of the basal medium was also found to have a significant effect on the number and fresh weight of leaves produced by the explants. The highest number and fresh weight of leaves were produced from the full-strength basal medium with 7.33 leaves and 21.57 mg, respectively. Meanwhile, the half-strength basal medium produced the lowest number of leaves (3.00 leaves) and fresh weight of leaves (1.78 mg). The observations suggest that the number of leaves produced from each treatment had a significant effect on the fresh weight of leaves. There was no significant difference between the full- and double-strength of the basal medium on the number of leaves. However, the full-strength basal medium significantly produced a higher fresh weight of leaves. One possible reason for this phenomenon could be that double-strength basal medium produced a smaller leaf size compared to full-strength medium despite having a higher number of leaves. The half-strength basal medium also produced smaller leaves compared to the full-strength basal medium. The difference in terms of the fresh weight of leaves was also observed between basal medium strengths.
