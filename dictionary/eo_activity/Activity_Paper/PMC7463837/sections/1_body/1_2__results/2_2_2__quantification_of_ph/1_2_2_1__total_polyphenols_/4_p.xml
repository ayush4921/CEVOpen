<p>The total flavonoids content recorded in the tissue-cultured leaves was significantly higher than conventionally propagated leaves. The highest total flavonoids content exhibited by the extraction of tissue-cultured leaves at 100 °C was 21.76 mg RE/g DW followed by the tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 25 °C with 9.10 mg RE/g DW. The lowest total flavonoids content was recorded by conventionally propagated leaves extracted at 25 °C with 5.26 mg RE/g DW, which was four times lower than the highest total flavonoids content recorded.</p>
