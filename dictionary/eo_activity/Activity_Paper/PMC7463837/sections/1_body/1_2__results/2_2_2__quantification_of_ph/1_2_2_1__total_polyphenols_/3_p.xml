<p>The total phenolic acids content recorded ranged between 2.12 and 4.29 mg GAE/g DW. The highest total phenolic acids content was produced by an extraction of tissue-cultured leaves at 100 °C with 4.29 mg GAE/g DW. Meanwhile, the lowest total phenolic acids content was recorded from the treatment at 25 °C conventionally propagated leaves extract with 2.12 mg GAE/g DW.</p>
