<p>The antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaf extracts, propagated via conventional and tissue culture techniques, were measured using five in vitro antioxidant assays including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), superoxide anion radical scavenging activity and iron (II) chelating activity. All antioxidant assays were measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at a specific absorbance. A standard graph was generated using trolox as a standard for the DPPH free radical scavenging activity (y = 0.0007x + 0.0865, R2 = 0.989), ABTS scavenging activity (y = 0.0106x + 0.09, R2 = 0.997) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (y = 0.0044x + 0.066, R2 = 0.999). Based on the results presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the DPPH free radical scavenging activity recorded for the aqueously extracted tissue-cultured and conventionally propagated leaves of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> ranged between 2.44 and 3.20 mg TE/g DW. The highest DPPH free radical scavenging activity was recorded from the aqueously extracted tissue-cultured leaves at 100 °C with 3.20 mg TE/g DW, followed by the aqueously extracted tissue-cultured leaves at 25 °C with 2.98 mg TE/g DW. The lowest DPPH free radical scavenging activity was recorded for the aqueously extracted conventionally propagated leaves at 100 °C with 2.44 mg TE/g DW.
