<p>The highest total polyphenols content was recorded in tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 100 °C, with 2.77 mg GAE/g DW followed by the tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 25 °C with 2.15 mg GAE/g DW. For conventionally propagated leaves, there was no significant difference between the aqueous temperatures on the total polyphenols content of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaves. An aqueous temperature of 25 and 100 °C exhibited 1.54 and 1.55 mg GAE/g DW of total polyphenols content, respectively.
