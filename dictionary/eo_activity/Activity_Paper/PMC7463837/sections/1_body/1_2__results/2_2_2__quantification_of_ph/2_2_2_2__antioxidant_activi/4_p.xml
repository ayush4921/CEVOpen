<p>The superoxide anion radical scavenging was conducted to study the ability of plant samples to scavenge superoxide anion radicals. The data revealed that the sources of leaves and aqueous temperatures significantly affected the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity. The highest superoxide anion inhibition percentage was recorded from the tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 100 °C with 53.74% inhibition, followed by the tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 25 °C with 52.22% inhibition (
