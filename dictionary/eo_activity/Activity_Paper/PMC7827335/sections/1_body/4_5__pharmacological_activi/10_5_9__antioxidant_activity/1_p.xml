<p>Polyphenolic compounds present in plant foods have been reported to be responsible for their antioxidant activity due to their ability to serve as a hydrogen donor and reducing agent (Amorati and Valgimigli 2012). Both fermented and unfermented seeds of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> have been reported to contain an appreciable amount of phenolic contents [

 <xref rid="B211-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. timoriana</italic> pods are also rich in total phenolic and flavonoid contents [

 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> has been reported to be relatively lower than that of the empty pods and seed mixture, suggesting that the pods possess higher antioxidant contents than other parts of the plant [

 <xref rid="B176-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. The difference in geographical location may affect the composition of the antioxidant compounds in plants. It was reported that 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seeds collected from central Peninsular Malaysia had higher antioxidant capacity than the southern and southwestern regions [
 <xref rid="B213-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. The compounds present in the plants attenuate oxidative stress possibly by activating Nrf2/Keap1 and MAPK signaling pathways, leading to enhanced expressions of Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 [

 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> extracts of seed coats and pods could also reduce the risk of hemolysis by inhibiting Heinz body production in the erythrocytes incubated with a hemolytic agent [
 <xref rid="B215-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>], indicating the ability of the extracts to inhibit oxidative destruction of erythrocyte. The finding suggests a potential of the plant extract to reduce hemolytic jaundice, which warrants further research.
