<p>An in vitro study on human cancer cell lines has shown that the methanol extracts of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. filicoidea</italic> exhibit different degrees of antiproliferative activities on T-549 and BT-20 (prostate cancer), PC-3 (acute T cell leukemia Jurka), and SW-480 (colon cancer) at concentrations of 20 and 200 Âµg/mL. 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> also exhibits higher cytotoxic activity against all types of cancer cell lines used compared with 
 <italic>P. filicoidea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B174-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. The antitumor property could be attributable to the antiangiogenic activity of some species of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> such as 
 <italic>P. biglandulosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> extracts [

 <xref rid="B175-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Angiogenesis or neovascularization is involved in metastasis of solid tumors. Methanol extract of the 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> fresh pods was reported to exhibit antiangiogenic activity by more than 50% inhibition of microvessel outgrowth in rat aortae and human umbilical vein endothelial cells forming capillary-like structures in Matrigel matrix. The effect may be attributable to the ability of the compounds in the extract to form vacuoles in the cells [
 <xref rid="B170-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>], which is essential in maintaining the viability of the cells, therefore beneficial in the treatment of cancer owing to its capacity to prevent tumor neovascularization [
