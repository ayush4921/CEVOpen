<p>An in vivo study conducted on both seeds and pods of 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, indicated that only chloroform extract of both pods and seeds exhibited strong glucose-lowering activity. The hypoglycemic activity of the seeds was higher than that of the pods (57% and 36%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B157-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. A mixture of 66% β-sitosterol 
 <bold>60</bold> and 34% stigmasterol 
 <bold>61</bold> is believed to be responsible for the hypoglycemic effect of the seeds—demonstrated 83% decrease in blood glucose level (100 mg/kg body weight) compared to glibenclamide (111% at 5 mg/kg bw) [

 <bold>63</bold> was identified as the compound responsible for the 84% reduction in blood glucose level at 100 mg/kg bw of the pod extract of 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B123-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Both compounds (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol) are believed to reduce blood glucose level by regenerating remnant β-cells and stimulating insulin release [
 <xref rid="B160-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] via augmentation of GLUT4 glucose transporter expression [
 <xref rid="B161-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Stigmasterol is also reported to inhibit the ß-cells apoptosis [
