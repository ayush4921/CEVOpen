<p>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) having molecular weight of 6000 is a natural polymer that is water-soluble and nonionic [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PEG 6000 is found to mimic drought stress and results in lowering of plantâ€™s water potential due to osmotic stress [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the current study, physiological and metabolic changes in response to PEG 6000 were investigated as our understanding of the morphological and biochemical response of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> to drought stress is limited. According to the best of our knowledge, there is not a single study in which production of Reb A in response to PEG 6000-associated drought stress imposed under in vitro condition has been elaborated. Previously, Hajihashemi and Geuns [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] evaluated the impact of drought stress on SGs but under greenhouse cultivation system. Moreover, Badran et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] determined the relationship between drought stress and ST content only. However, we conducted this study to explore water-deficit stress induced by PEG 6000 to in vitro grown 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> shoots and evaluated the resultant effects on the physiology (plant biomass) and biochemistry {(Reb A and ST content) and (antioxidation potential)} of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> by combating drought stress. Besides, it is a dire need to obtain sustainable secondary metabolites in bioreactors by modulating tissue culture-grown medicinal plants which can be achieved in the future by following up on this pilot research.
