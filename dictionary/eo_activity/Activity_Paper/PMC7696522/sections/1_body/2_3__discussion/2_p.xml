<p>It is speculated that when drought stress is caused by water deficiency at critical levels, it manipulates the physiology as well as biochemistry of plants. In case of in vitro culture, 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> plant cells imposed by PEG 6000 stress stimuli elicit significant alterations in the cellular environment. It involves activation of cellular receptors initiating signal transduction cascade that affects physiological processes. Changes in physiology influence primary metabolism that in turn causes signalling of secondary metabolism by providing biosynthetic precursors or intermediates. Hence, enhancement of biomass and bioactive componentsâ€™ biosynthesis takes place simultaneously as shown by the current study. The possible mechanism involves cellular dehydration caused by PEG 6000 stress and resultant increased formation of ROS. Multiple cellular components like DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids get damaged after excessive oxidation. Although ROS are produced even in the absence of stress and get scavenged by naturally occurring antioxidant, the stress conditions cause imbalance of ROS and antioxidants produced in cross-protection. ROS are signalling moieties that play a significant role in the controlled response against stress and programmed cell death. The defensive response is created under appropriate concentration of stress elicitor whereas concentration above threshold causes death of cells [
