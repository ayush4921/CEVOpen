<p>This is the first report that brings to the spotlight how the major steviol glycosides (rebaudioside A and stevioside) respond when they get exposed to the abiotic stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Different growth parameters including percentage of explants shooting, mean shoots length, mean number of nodes, mean number of leaves, and fresh weight of shoots and antioxidant activities involving total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, total antioxidant capacity, total reducing power, and DPPH-free radical scavenging activity are also explored. Out of all concentrations, 4% of PEG concentration has been proved very efficacious in increasing the shoot organogenesis as well as the content of secondary metabolites in shoots of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> grown via tissue culture technique. Hence, this drought stress elicitor should be involved in further studies for significant enhancement and sustainable production of rebaudioside A and stevioside on commercial scale. Furthermore, signalling mechanisms of metabolic action of phenolic, flavonoid, and bioactive compounds produced by 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> produced under drought stress should be finely investigated to unveil the ultimate reason for the described phenomenon.
