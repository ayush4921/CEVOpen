<p>Total flavonoid content (TFC) was determined by following the method of Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. An aliquot of 20 µL (4 mg/mL) DMSO stock solution of each sample was added to the respective well of 96 well plate. Then, 10 µL of 1.0 M potassium acetate, 10 µL of 10% aluminium chloride, and 160 µL of distilled water were added to it and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of samples run in triplicate was measured at 630 nm using microplate reader. The standard used was quercetin and the results were expressed as µg quercetin equivalent per mg (µg QE/mg).
