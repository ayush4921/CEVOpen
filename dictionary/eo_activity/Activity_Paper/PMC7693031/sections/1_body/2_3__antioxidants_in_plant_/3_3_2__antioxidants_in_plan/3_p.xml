<p>Fortunato et al., (2010) showed that the high cold tolerance of the Icatu genotype of coffee seedlings (
 <italic>Coffea</italic> genus) could be attributed to its efficient antioxidant response to cold conditions, involving increases in SOD and APX activities and concentrations of AsA and Î±-tocopherol [

 <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> to drought stress involved upregulation of genes related to the metabolism of secondary antioxidant metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. The expression of genes involved in GSH metabolism was altered in the late response (i.e., after three drought cycles) to drought stress [
