<p>In tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>), salt stress was associated with increased superoxide and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations and an enhanced level of lipid peroxidation. This response coincided with increases in the activities of SOD, CAT and enzymes of the AsA-GSH cycle (APX, MDHAR, DHAR and GR). Furthermore, salinity significantly increased AsA and GSH concentrations, whereas carotenoid levels were reduced. The latter observation suggests ROS-induced damage to the photosynthetic machinery. Interestingly, the extent of ROS-induced damage upon salt stress was lower in the wild tomato relative 
 <italic>Solanum chilense</italic> in comparison to cultivated tomato (
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>), which can likely be attributed to the stronger salt-induced activation of the antioxidant machinery in the former species [

 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> cultivars, whereas the opposite was observed in their tolerant counterparts. This emphasizes the importance of polyphenols in conferring drought tolerance in tomato [
