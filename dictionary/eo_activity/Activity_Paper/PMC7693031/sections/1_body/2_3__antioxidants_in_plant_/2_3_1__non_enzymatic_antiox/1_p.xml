<p>Ascorbic acid is the most important substrate for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> detoxification in plant cells. It functions as the electron donor for ascorbate peroxidase (APX), which reduces H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to water. As a consequence, AsA is oxidized to monodehydroascorbic acid (MDHA), which can disproportionate into AsA and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). Whereas MDHA is again reduced to AsA via MDHAR using electrons derived from NAPDH, DHA is converted to AsA via the action of DHAR. This enzyme uses GSH as an electron donor, causing its oxidation to glutathione disulfide (GSSG). This is reduced back to GSH by GR, using reducing equivalents derived from NAPDH. This metabolic pathway for the detoxification of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is referred to as the AsA-GSH cycle or Foyer-Halliwell-Asada pathway and functions in all subcellular compartments except vacuoles [

Glutathione—a tripeptide consisting of γ-glutamate, cysteine and glycine—constitutes the second major non-enzymatic antioxidant involved in ROS detoxification via the AsA-GSH cycle. In addition, GSH can directly scavenge hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen [

Besides its role in antioxidant defense, GSH plays additional roles in plant protection (1) by forming conjugates with xenobiotics via glutathione-S-transferases and (2) as a precursor for the synthesis of phytochelatins, which are involved in the chelation and sequestration of metals such as cadmium (Cd) and metalloids like arsenic (As) [

Among these, tocopherols (a type of vitamin E) play a crucial role in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation, which occurs when hydroxyl radicals attack polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes. The antioxidant potential of tocopherols relies on their ability to scavenge the resulting lipid peroxyl radicals as well as singlet oxygen. Whereas four different forms of tocopherol exist (α, β, γ and δ), α-tocopherol harbors the highest biological activity and accounts for over 90% of the foliar vitamin E content [
