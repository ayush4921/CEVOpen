<p>Cuba is a unique case as it faces specific environmental challenges, such as extreme temperatures, drought stress, soil conditionsâ€¦, but it also contains an enormously rich (endemic) plant biodiversity [

Understanding the correlation between antioxidant compounds in non-model plants and their evolutionary advantage to withstand specific stress conditions should be included in strategies to protect plant biodiversity. Moreover, the antioxidant spectrum present in Cuban plant species should be maintained via sustainable agroecological practices.
