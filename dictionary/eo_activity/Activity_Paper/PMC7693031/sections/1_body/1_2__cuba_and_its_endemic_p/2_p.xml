<p>Due to its geographical location, Cuba is subject to a humid tropical climate, which might alter into a dry tropical climate due to climate change [
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The dynamics of ecosystems can worsen this aridity due to the combined effect of increased drought, temperature and evaporation. The rise in mean sea level and other changes associated with the water regime, will not only cause the movement, fragmentation, alteration and destruction of certain habitats or even the disappearance of entire ecosystems, especially wetlands, but also favor salinity in aquifers and greater transfer of it to the soil [

In this context, physiological and biochemical modifications are expected in the flora due to stress processes, changes in phenology, phase shift between the biological cycles of plants in relation to their pollinators and biological controllers possibly leading to the extinction of several species.
