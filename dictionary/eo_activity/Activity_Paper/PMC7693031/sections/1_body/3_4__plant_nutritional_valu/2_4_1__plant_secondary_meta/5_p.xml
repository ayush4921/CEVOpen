<p>Despite all these in vitro characteristics that contribute to a high antioxidant potential, intake of antioxidants and/or nutraceuticals via the diet is limited to the ability of these compounds to be absorbed and distributed to the site of action. While a large number of hydroxyl groups point towards in vitro antioxidant activity, such compounds will easily violate the well-known rule of five for bioavailability and in consequence are not suited as drug candidates. This rule described for the first time in 1997 by Lipinski defines four points allowing absorption of these compounds: when molecules have (1) a maximum of five H-bond donors (hydrogens linked to a nitrogen or oxygen atom), (2) less than 10 H-bond acceptors (all nitrogen and oxygen atoms), (3) a molecular weight under 500 Da and (4) an octanol-water partition coefficient under the value of five [
