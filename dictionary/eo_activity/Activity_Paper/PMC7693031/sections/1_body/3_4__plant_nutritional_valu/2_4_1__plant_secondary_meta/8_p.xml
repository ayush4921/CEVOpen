<p>The assessments of antioxidant action performed by polyphenolic compounds include both cell-free and cell-based in vitro assays and animal models as well. The in vitro models based on the free radical scavenging potential (e.g., ABTS, DPPH assays) offer prior information on how polyphenols lead to radical degradation, thus hypothesizing their antioxidant functions to combat oxidative stress in a biological system [

 <xref rid="B113-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Other in vitro tests include enzyme inhibition, prevention of oxidative DNA impairment, reduction of intracellular ROS/RNS levels, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities. In the case of in vivo evaluation, the endogenous antioxidant enzyme estimations, the pro-inflammatory mediators release and the lipid peroxidation assay are some of the main tests performed [

 <xref rid="B115-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Nevertheless, today a well-established methodology where different in vitro and in vivo assays can be combined is highly encouraged in order to evaluate the antioxidant potential of plant bioactive compounds.
