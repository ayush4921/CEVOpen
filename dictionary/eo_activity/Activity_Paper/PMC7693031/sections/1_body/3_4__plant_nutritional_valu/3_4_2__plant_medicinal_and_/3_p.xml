<p>At present, there is a particular interest in polyphenols because of their presence in many natural resources, their chemical variety and their participation in crucial cell functions [

They display significant effects on the reduction of pathological inflammation, liver and neurologic damage protection, and they have also been associated with lower risk of metastasis in cancer patients [

Nevertheless, the in vivo bioactive effects of polyphenols depend on their respective intake, absorption, metabolism, and bioavailability. As their absorption and blood distribution are rather low and at the same time elimination from plasma very fast [

This necessity of regular natural polyphenol consumption as well as the fact that they can change the food organoleptic properties and as a consequence the food quality, offers a link between medicinal plants and dietary supplements.
