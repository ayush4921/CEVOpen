<p>The tree 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> is especially distributed in the eastern region of Cuba, housing some particularly sweet mango varieties. The ethnomedicinal practices refer to the use of mango stem bark decoctions for the treatment of menorrhagia, scabies, diarrhea, syphilis, diabetes, cutaneous infections, and anemia [

 <italic>M. indica</italic> stem bark is the most studied natural antioxidant derived from plants present in Cuba. It consists of a blend of antioxidant chemical components such as polyphenols, terpenoids, steroids, fatty acids, microelements and the xanthone mangiferin, as the main component [

 <xref rid="B166-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. This extract prevents the TNF-α-induced IκB degradation and hence binding of NF-κB to DNA, reducing the gene expression of some mediators and enzymes implicated in inflammation, pain and oxidative stress processes [

 <sup>®</sup>. This product is approved and registered by the Cuban health regulatory agencies and the Cuban Industrial Property Office, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (OCPI, CITMA) as a nutritional supplement, phytomedicine and cosmeceutical [

 <sup>®</sup> is dispensed as different pharmaceutical formulations like raw dried material, tablets, creams and extracts, being the best and most selling natural antioxidant in the Cuban medicinal market. Although 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> is a worldwide tree, the results obtained in studies and the experience accumulated by ethnobotanic, experimental and clinical studies for years in Cuba will allow the development and valorization of new phytomedicines and natural supplements elaborated from endemic plants but widely distributed all over the Cuban island.
