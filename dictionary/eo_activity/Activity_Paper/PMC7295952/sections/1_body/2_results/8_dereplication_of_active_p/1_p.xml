<p>HPLC-based activity profiling, in combination with on-line spectroscopic data (MS and UV) and comparison with natural products databases was used to dereplicate known active compounds. The antiplasmodial activity of 
 <italic>Guiera senegalensis</italic> J.F.Gmel was in accordance with previous reports. In the window of activity a HPLC peak was detected which exhibited a [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 316 in the MS, and λ
 <sub>max</sub> 241 and 276 nm in the UV spectrum. This peak was assigned to guieranone A (MW 316.35 g/mol), a compound previously reported from this species (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Silva and Gomes, 2003</xref>). The chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>Tephrosia apollinea</italic> (Delile) DC. leaves was active against three parasites (

 <sup>+</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 393 in the ESIMS, and λ
 <sub>max</sub> 256 and 310 nm in the UV spectrum corresponded to pseudosemiglabrin, a major secondary metabolite in this plant (
