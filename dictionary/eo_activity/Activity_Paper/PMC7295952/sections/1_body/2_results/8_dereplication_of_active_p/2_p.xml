<p>The ethyl acetate fraction of the leaves, roots, and seeds of 
 <italic>Terminalia leiocarpa</italic> (DC.) Baill. (syn. 
 <italic>Anogeissus leiocarpa</italic> (DC.) Guill. &amp; Perr.) (Combretaceae) exhibited promising inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5</bold>
 </xref>). In the active time window HPLC peaks with MS and UV data indicative for ellagic acid and quercetin were seen, and their identity was confirmed by co-injection of authentic samples. The two compounds have been previously reported from 
 <italic>T. leiocarpa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Ndjonka et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Oboh et al., 2017</xref>). Ellagic acid has been previously shown to possess antiplasmodial activity (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Banzouzi et al., 2002</xref>) which has been attributed to the inhibition of beta-haematin formation in the parasite (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dell’Agli et al., 2003</xref>). The antiplasmodial activity of quercetin (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ganesh et al., 2012</xref>) has been associated with the inhibition of a parasite protein kinase (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Wiser et al., 1983</xref>). The leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vachellia nilotica</italic> (L.) P.J.H.Hurter &amp; Mabb. (syn. 
 <italic>Acacia nilotica</italic> (L.) Delile) (Fabaceae) inhibited 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> at 2 µg/ml, and moderate cytotoxicity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 21.5 µg/ml against L6; 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 3</bold>
 </xref>). In the HPLC activity profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6</bold>
 </xref>) peaks with [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 291.0 and 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 442.9 in the ESIMS, and with λ
 <sub>max</sub> 277 and 280 nm in the UV spectra were detected in the active time window. These peaks corresponded to catechin (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Wulf et al., 2008</xref>) and epicatechin gallate (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Salem et al., 2011</xref>), respectively. The occurrence of these compounds in 
 <italic>V. nilotica</italic> has been reported (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Khalid et al., 1989b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dikti Vildina et al., 2017</xref>). Catechins were found to possess antiplasmodial activity by inhibiting both the ATPase and chaperone functions of the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> heat shock proteins (PfHsps) through direct binding to PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Zininga et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, a peak corresponding to ethyl gallate was detected in the active time window. Gallate esters are known inhibitors of trypanosome alternative oxidase, and they can increase intracellular glycerol to toxic levels resulting in trypanocidal activity (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Jeacock et al., 2017</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that ethyl gallate was formed from gallic acid during ethanol extraction.
