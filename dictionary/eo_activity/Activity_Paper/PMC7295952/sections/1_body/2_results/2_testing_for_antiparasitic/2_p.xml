<p>Extracts that exhibited &gt;80% growth inhibition at 10 μg/ml, or &gt;50% growth inhibition at 2 μg/ml against at least one of the tested parasites was considered active. Of the 235 extracts in our library, 125 (53%) fulfilled these activity criteria. A total of 34 (27%) of the active extracts exhibited activity against 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic>, 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> collectively. Regarding parasite species-selective inhibition, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> appeared to be the most susceptible parasite, followed by 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Among the tested parasites 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was the least susceptible towards the plant extracts (
