<p>The original extracts and all fractions obtained by partitioning were tested at two concentrations, 2 and 10 Î¼g/ml, against the following panel of protozoan parasites: 
 <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> bloodstream form, 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> intracellular amastigote form grown in rat L6 cells, 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> axenic amastigote form grown at low pH, and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocytic stage grown in human erythrocytes. Percent inhibition was calculated in comparison to untreated controls. All tests were carried out in independent duplicates. The results are compiled in
