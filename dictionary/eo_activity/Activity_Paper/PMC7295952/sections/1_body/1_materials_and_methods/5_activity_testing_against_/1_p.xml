<p>All tests were performed with the 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Tulahuen strain C2C4, which expresses the β-galactosidase (
 <italic>LacZ</italic>) gene (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Buckner et al., 1996</xref>). L6 rat skeletal myoblasts served as host cells. Cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1.7 µM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Host cells were seeded in 96-well microtitre plates, 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> per well in 100-µl medium. After 24 h, 50 µl of a suspension of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/ml trypomastigote 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> were added. The medium was replaced at day 4, test samples were added, and the plates incubated for further 4 d. Finally, 50 µl of 2.5× CPRG/Nonidet solution was added to all wells. A color reaction was visible within 2-6 h, which was quantified in an absorbance reader at 540 nm (Spectramax). Benznidazole was used as reference drug. Final in-test DMSO concentration did not exceed 1%. All assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.
