<p>Microfractionation of the active samples was carried out by analytical RP-HPLC on an LC-MS 8030 system (Shimadzu) connected with an FC204 fraction collector (Gilson). For each fraction, a solution of 10 mg/ml was prepared in DMSO. A total of three injections were performed: 2 × 35 μl with only UV detection (254 nm) for collection (0.7 mg of fraction in total) and 1 × 35 μl with UV-ELSD-ESIMS detection without collection.</p>
