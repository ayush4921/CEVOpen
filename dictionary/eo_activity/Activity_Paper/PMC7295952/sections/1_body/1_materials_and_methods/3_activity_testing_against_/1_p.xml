 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Baltz et al., 1985</xref>). The culture medium was MEM supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 1 g/L additional glucose, 1% MEM nonessential amino acids, 0.2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM Na-pyruvate, and 15% heat inactivated horse serum. In the two-concentration assay, 50 µl medium containing the corresponding samples concentration (10 µg/ml or 2  µg/ml) was added to the wells of a 96 well plate. For the IC
 <sub>50</sub> determination, a 50-µl medium was added to each well, and a serial sample dilution of 11 threefold dilution steps covering a range from 100 to 0.002 μg/ml were prepared. Then 10

Plate reading was performed in a Spectramax Gemini XS microplate fluorometer (Molecular Devices Corporation) using an excitation wavelength of 536 nm and emission wavelength of 588 nm. Melarsoprol was used as reference drug. Final in-test DMSO concentration did not exceed 1%. All assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.
