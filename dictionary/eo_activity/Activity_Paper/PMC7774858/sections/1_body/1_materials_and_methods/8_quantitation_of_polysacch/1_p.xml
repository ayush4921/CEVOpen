<p>The supernatants obtained from the UACE processes were subjected to separation for polysaccharides and triterpenoids before being used for the assay. Appropriate amounts of 95% ethanol were added to the extract supernatants to a final ethanol concentration of 75% and kept for 12 h at 4C for polysaccharide precipitation. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was used to determine the concentration of triterpenoids, and the precipitate was washed twice with 95% ethanol, dissolved in distilled water, and used for assay of the polysaccharides. The vanillin-glacial acetic acid method was used for analysis of the triterpenoid with ursolic acid as the standard [
