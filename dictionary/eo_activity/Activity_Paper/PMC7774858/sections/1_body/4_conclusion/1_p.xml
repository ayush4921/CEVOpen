<p>In the present study, the simultaneous and efficient extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from the medicinal fungus 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> was achieved with ultrasonic extraction technology. The optimized extraction conditions by RSM with a desirability function were determined as: ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 80C, liquid/solid ratio of 50 mL/g, and extraction time of 100 min. On the basis of the scavenging capacity of DPPH and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant activity of the extracted polysaccharides by ultrasonic action in optimal UACE process was significantly enhanced, while the triterpenoid-rich extracts demonstrated unchanged activity. The present study is the first report on the application of ultrasound for the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> in a convenient extraction process.
