<p>Through the numerical optimization technique of the Design-Expert software, the optimal conditions of UACE for the extraction of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> polysaccharides and triterpenoids, with the 
 <italic>D</italic> value as the response variable, were determined to be the following: ultrasonic power 210 W, extraction temperature 80.77C, ratio of liquid/solid 49.85 mL/g, and extraction time 103.56 min. In consideration of actual experimental conditions, optimal extraction conditions were modified as ultrasonic power 210 W, extraction temperature 80C, ratio of liquid/solid 50 mL/g, and extraction time 100 min.
