<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, a longer ultrasonic time helped to extract polysaccharides and triterpenoids, whereas the change in ultrasonic power input had little effect on the 
 <italic>D</italic> value. The surface plot presents a flat plain, indicating that they had little interaction. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2D</xref> shows that a small change in either the liquid/solid ratio or extraction temperature would lead to a considerable variation in the 
 <italic>D</italic> value, and higher 
 <italic>D</italic> values would be attained when a high liquid/solid ratio along with moderate extraction temperature were simultaneously applied in the extraction.
