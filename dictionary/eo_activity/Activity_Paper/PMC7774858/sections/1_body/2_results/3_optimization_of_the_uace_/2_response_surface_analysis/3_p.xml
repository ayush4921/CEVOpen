<p>As is evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, the 
 <italic>D</italic> value increased first and then declined with time. Extraction temperature had an effect on the 
 <italic>D</italic> value similar to extraction time. The maximum 
 <italic>D</italic> value was attained at around intermediate levels (extraction temperature of 80C and 90 min extraction time) for both variables. As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, the 
 <italic>D</italic> value first increased with extraction time, then decreased when extraction time reached a high level (around 105 min). At all investigated extraction times, the 
 <italic>D</italic> value increased first, then decreased when the liquid/solid ratio was greater than 50 mL/g.
