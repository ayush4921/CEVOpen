<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, the reducing power of polysaccharides obtained by optimal UACE and HWE methods exhibited a dosage-dependent pattern, and the polysaccharides obtained by optimal UACE showed a stronger reducing power than those extracted by the HWE method in the tested concentration range. At 0.2 mg/mL, the absorbance at 700 nm was 0.34 for the polysaccharides from optimal UACE, while it was only 0.24 for the HWE polysaccharides. The reducing power for both extracted polysaccharides was lower than that of BHT at the same concentration. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows that the reducing power of the triterpenoid-rich extracts obtained by the optimized UACE process and the ethanol maceration method was strongly dependent on their concentration, and there were no significant differences between the two extracts at all tested concentrations. The reducing power for both triterpenoid-rich extracts was considerably lower than that of the positive standard BHT.
