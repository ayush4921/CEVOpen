<p>As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, the yield of polysaccharides slowly increased with increasing extraction temperature within the tested range from 40 to 90C. The highest polysaccharide yield was 0.41% at 90C. The triterpenoid yield increased from 0.11% to 0.15% as extraction temperature changed from 40 to 80C, and then decreased above 80C. As to the combined performance, the 
 <italic>D</italic> value increased with the increase of extraction temperature and reached the maximum value of 0.13 when extraction temperature was 80C, and then it started to decline. Thus, an extraction temperature of 70âˆ’90C was considered the optimal range in subsequent RSM optimization studies.
