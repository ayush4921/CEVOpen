<p>The efficient extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> is a prerequisite for their further research and industrial application. Hence, studying the extraction of this medicinal mushroom for these two active ingredients is of particular importance. In the present investigation, the environmentally friendly ultrasonic-assisted extraction technology was employed for the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> in a simple process (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244749.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), with a resulting satisfactory performance. The success of synchronously extracting these two contrasting components (in terms of water solubility) by the developed UACE process could be attributed to the synergistic action of an appropriate extraction solvent, a relatively high extraction temperature, and acoustic cavitations generated by ultrasound. In this process, the polysaccharides and triterpenoids might not dissolve well in the extraction solvent applied, while a relatively high temperature increases their solubility, and finally ultrasound accelerates the extraction. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report on the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> in a simple extraction process.
