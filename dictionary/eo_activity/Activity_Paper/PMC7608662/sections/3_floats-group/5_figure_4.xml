  <p>Effect of 
   <italic>Thymus albicans</italic> essential oil on macrophages viability (
   <bold>A</bold>) and nitrites production (
   <bold>B</bold>). Cell viability is expressed as a percentage of MTT reduction in comparison to control cells (100% viability). Nitrite production is expressed as a percentage of nitrite production in comparison to cells stimulated with LPS alone (100% nitrite production). Each value represents the mean ± SEM from three experiments, performed in duplicate. Statistical differences between groups were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (###
