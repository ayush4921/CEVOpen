<p id="Par24">Another mechanism by which 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil could reduce the nitrite levels is the modulation of genes coding for key enzymes along the inflammatory pathway, namely iNOS and COX-2. Our results show that the expression of both enzymes by LPS-stimulated macrophages was significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in comparison to the LPS-free control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), demonstrating the ability of LPS to induce the expression of these enzymes in our inflammatory-like model. Cells treated only with essential oils revealed neglectable levels of iNOS and COX-2 expression, ruling out possible pro-inflammatory effects of the oil.
