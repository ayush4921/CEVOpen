<p id="Par23">To clarify whether the lower levels of nitrites observed after 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil treatment were due to its direct scavenging potential, a reaction between a NO donor (SNAP) and different concentrations of the oil was performed. Since 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil failed to scavenge NO (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), we could exclude this hypothesis to justify the reduction of nitrite levels in LPS-stimulated macrophages. In the study of Aazza, et al.

 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil was shown to scavenge NO in vitro, however at much higher concentrations than those tested in our study.
