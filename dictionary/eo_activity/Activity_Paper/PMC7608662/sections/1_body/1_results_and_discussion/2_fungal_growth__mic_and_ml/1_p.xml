<p id="Par11">As far as it is known, this is the first report on the antifungal effect of 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil. The oil showed some degree of inhibition against all 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, dermatophytes and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> strains tested (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), thus showing a broad-spectrum antifungal effect. Moreover, for the majority of yeast and all dermatophyte strains, MIC values were similar to MLC ones, pointing out a fungicidal effect of the oil. The highest antifungal activity was observed against 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> CECT 2794 and 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> FF9 (MIC and MLC of 0.64 μL/mL).
