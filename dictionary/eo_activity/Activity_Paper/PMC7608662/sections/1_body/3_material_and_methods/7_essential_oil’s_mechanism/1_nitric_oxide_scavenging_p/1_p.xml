 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil was evaluated using S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) reagent as a NO donor. The essential oil dilutions in culture medium were incubated with 300 μM SNAP for 3 h in the dark at room temperature. An oil free control was included. Nitrite quantification was performed as described previously for nitric oxide production.
