<p>Benzothiazole is a pharmacophore widely used in medicinal chemistry. This review points out to a growing interest in the development of lead or hybrid structures bearing the BTA moiety as antiproliferative and anticancer agents. The present work describes the potential of BTA scaffolds in the management of various types of cancers such as ovarian, prostate, central nervous system, renal, gastric, pancreatic, liver, breast and colon cancers. SAR studies reaveled that the anticancer activity of BTA scaffolds depends upon the nature of substituents present in these molecules, being multifactorial and not always easy to rationalise. The plethora of research on the anticancer profile of BTA derivatives mentioned in this review and their rationalisation based on the drug targets of these derivatives, when this was possible, may be useful for the development of novel such agents.</p>
