<p>Kumbhare et al. reported the synthesis of mannich base arylimidazo derivatives containing benzothiazole moiety and screened for their anticancer activities against HepG2, MCF -7 and HeLa cell lines. All these synthesised mannich bases BTA scaffolds showed cytotoxicity against all tested cell lines but the pyrrolidine based imidazo benzothiazole derivative 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrated specific features of apoptosis as enhancement in the levels of caspase-3. The compound 
 <bold>4</bold> exhibited anti cancer activity and proved to be the best antiproliferative agent as compared to other derivatives against HepG2, MCF-7 and HeLa cell line when screened at 4.0 µM concentrations. The SAR studies revealed that the incorporation of fluorine atom at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> position of derivative 
 <bold>4</bold> enhanced the cytotoxicity. The compound 
 <bold>4</bold> have potential to lead in the treatment of cancer especially against hepatocaricinoma. The anticancer activity potential of BTA scaffold 
 <bold>4</bold> is encourging for the development of new anti-cancer therapeutic agents and this will be good addition in armamentarium that consists of paclitaxel, cisplatin and doxorubicin drugs
