<p>Caputo et al. afforded two types of five derivatives on the basis of an aryl amide and an aryl urea functionalities attached at C-2 of benzothiazole core and these scaffolds were screened against 60 human cancer cell lines. The urea moiety based fluorophenyl containing benzothiazole derivative 
 <bold>4</bold> (

 <bold>5</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>) demonstrated remarkable anticancer activities. The BTA derivative 
 <bold>4</bold> exhibited the anticancer activity at 10
 <sup>−5 </sup>M against different cell lines such as leukaemia cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.48), non-small cell lung cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.48), colon cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.51), central nervous system cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.49), melanoma cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.48), ovarian cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.49), renal cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.53), prostate cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.50) and breast cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.56) in comparison with reference drug 5-fluorouracil NSC 19893. The BTA scaffold 
 <bold>5</bold> showed remarkable growth inhibitory activities against different human tumour cell lines such as leukaemia cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.93), non-small cell lung cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −6.0), colon cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.89), central nervous system cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.73), melanoma cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.89), ovarian cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.74), renal cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.90), prostate cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −5.72) and breast cancer cell lines (log GI
 <sub>50</sub> value −6.0) as compared with reference drug 5-fluorouracil NSC 19893. The scaffolds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> showed the best anticancer therapeutic potential due to presence of electron with drawing groups on
