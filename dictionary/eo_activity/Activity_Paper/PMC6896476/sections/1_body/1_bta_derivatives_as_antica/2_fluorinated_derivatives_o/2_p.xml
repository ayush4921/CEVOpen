<p>Aiello et al. synthesised fluorinated 2-aryl benzothiazole derivatives and evaluate them for anti-tumour activities against cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-468 (mammary gland/breast tissues derived from metastatic site) and MCF-7 cell line (human breast adenocarcinoma). The fluorinated BTA derivatives 
 <bold>1</bold> (3–(5-fluorobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenol) and 
 <bold>2</bold> (4–(5-fluorobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenol) having hydroxyl substituents on the third and fourth position of phenyl exhibited the best activity having GI
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.57 and 0.4 µM respectively against MCF-cell line as compared to BTA derivatives containing alkoxy, methyl sulphonyl and ethyl substituents on the benzothiazole (

 <italic>N</italic>-bis-benzothiazole and benzothiazolyl thiocarbamide derivatives and screened for cytotoxic activities against two human cell lines U-937 (human macrophage cell line), THP-1 (human leukaemia monocytic cell line) and B16-F10 (mouse melanoma cell line). The thiourea containing benzothiazole derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> (

 <bold>3</bold> were higher (16.23 ± 0.81 µM)), (4847.73 ± 2.39 µM)) and (34.58 ± 1.73 µM)) as compared to standard compound etoposide IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (17.94 ± 0.89), (18.69 ± 0.94) and (2.16 ± 0.11 µM)) against U-937, B16-F10 and THP-1 cell lines respectively
