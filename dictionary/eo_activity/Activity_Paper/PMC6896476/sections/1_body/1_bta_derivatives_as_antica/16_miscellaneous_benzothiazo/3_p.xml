<p>Noolvi et al. reported the synthesis of chloro substituted benzothiazole amines in order to produce isothiocyanates and thioureases. These BTA derivatives were tested for their anticancer activities. The dichlorophenyl containing chlorobenzothiazole 
 <bold>51</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0031">Figure 31</xref>) showed good anticancer activity against 9 different cancer cell lines having GI
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 1.60 µM–71.8 nM. The derivative 
 <bold>51</bold> exhibited GI
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.18 × 10
 <sup>−8 </sup>M against non-small cell lung cancer (HOP-92). The SAR studies showed that the highest activity of compound 
 <bold>51</bold> was due to the presence of three chlorine atoms in the compound as compared to other derivatives
