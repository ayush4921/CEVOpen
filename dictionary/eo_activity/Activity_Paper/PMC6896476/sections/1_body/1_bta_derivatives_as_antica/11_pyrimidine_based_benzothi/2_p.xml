<p>Kambhare et al. synthesised the isoxazole pyrimidine based BTAs and evaluated them for anticancer activity by the MTT assay against different cell lines such as A549, Colo205, MCF-7 and U937 cell lines, in comparison with the standard drug etoposide. The pyridine containing pyrimidine derivative
