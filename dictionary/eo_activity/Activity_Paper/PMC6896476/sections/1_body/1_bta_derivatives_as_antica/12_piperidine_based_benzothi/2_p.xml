<p>Osmaniye et al. prepared BTA acylhydrazone using 4-fluorobenzaldehyde refluxed with substituted amines, to afford the desired derivatives and studied their anticancer activities against rat brain glioma (carcinogenic C6) cell line, human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549) cell line, human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell line, human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell line and mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH3T3) cell line. The piperidine based acetohydrazide derivative
