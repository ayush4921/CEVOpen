<p>Anthocyanidins are redâ€“purple pigments found in plants and come in glycosylated forms. These substances are known to have antioxidants proprieties and they are found in the blue, purple and red fruits, vegetables and flowers. Cell culture studies, animal models, and human clinical trials show that anthocyanidins and anthocyanins possess antioxidative and antimicrobial activities, and improve visual and neurological health (Khoo et al., 2019). Specifically in vision health, the effects of anthocyanins are to: 1) improve the visual function in patients with normal tension glaucoma; 2) prevent the impairment of photoreceptor cell function during retinal inflammation; 3) decrease lens opacity, together with a lower MDA level, by suppressing the cell death of HLE-B3 (lens epithelial cell line) under H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress; 4) prevent retinal degeneration induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea; 5) increase ocular blood flow, but no significant changes in intraocular pressure (Khoo et al., 2017). Particularly, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3g) proves an effective ROS scavenger. In addition, C3g down-regulates VEGF and inhibits senescence induced by light exposure. C3g is shown to inhibit the activation of the G-protein transducing by metarhodopsin II. In addition, C3g stimulates the rhodopsin regeneration, as other anthocyanins present in blackcurrants (Pawlowska et al., 2019).
