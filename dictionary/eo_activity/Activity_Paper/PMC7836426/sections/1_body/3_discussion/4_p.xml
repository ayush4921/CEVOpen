<p id="para0038">The present study revealed that a total of 20 medicinal species relating to 19 genera and 14 botanical families were generally utilized by herbalists in the prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The Lamiaceae family was present in a high number of medicinal plants (3 species, 15%). The calculated results of MUV showed that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill. was ranked first (MUV =0.967) followed by 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> A. Juss. (MUV =0.933), 
 <italic>and Ziziphus lotus</italic> (L.) Lam. (MUV =0.9). These results are similar to international work, particularly in Pakistan. These medicinal species having high MUV must be further assessed for phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological studies to identify their active constituents for an effective and non-toxic drug extraction.
