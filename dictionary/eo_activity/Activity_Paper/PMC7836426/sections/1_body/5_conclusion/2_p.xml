<p id="para0049">Our study showed that medicinal plants continue to play an essential role in the fundamental healthcare system for the local people living in the Sal√© Prefecture. Herbalists appear to have a beneficial role in the healthcare of the local population, despite the revolution in modern health technology. The abundance of plant species documented for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is a major indication of the potential that exists locally, so long as the scientific procedure is added to the indigenous knowledge. Furthermore, additional research on the sustainable use and conservation of medicinal species is highly suggested. Finally, pharmacological, phytochemical, and toxicological investigations on medicinal plant species with possible anti-COVID-19 effects are carried out for laboratory validation of the ancestral uses of these plants and to obtain the traditional medicines bios. A combination of natural products or herbal mixtures with validated anti-COVID-19 drugs may constitute a promising preventive and therapeutic alternative but should be assessed.</p>
