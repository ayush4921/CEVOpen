   <title>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR PATIENTS?</title>
   <p>This is an article that aims to help patients with endometriosis-related pain symptoms through the difficult obstacles posed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Across the world, care for patients with endometriosis has changed dramatically: patients may be unable to visit their doctors or allied healthcare providers in person or obtain imaging tests, surgery or fertility treatments. Patients with endometriosis may be experiencing increased stress during this time.</p>
   <p>In addition to the more typical treatments for endometriosis, such as drug treatments or surgery, it is widely accepted that complementary or alternative treatments should be used. We encourage patients and healthcare providers to more strongly consider using these strategies at this time. Some examples of those that aim to directly target the problem of endometriosis-related pain are improving sleep hygiene, low-intensity physical activity (including pelvic exercises, yoga), dietary changes, application of heat and medical cannabis. Other examples target the emotional aspect of endometriosis-related pain and these include relaxation/mindfulness, acceptance of chronic illness (e.g. via Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)) and improving a balance toward positive attitude.</p>
   <p>Some patients may already be using these strategies during normal times, but many will not have been counseled on them or advised to use them. Some of these strategies could be implemented directly by patients whilst others may require the guidance of healthcare providers through telephone and online avenues. Initiating any of these strategies now to combat endometriosis symptoms may prove beneficial for patients and may encourage ongoing use once life gets back to normal.</p>
