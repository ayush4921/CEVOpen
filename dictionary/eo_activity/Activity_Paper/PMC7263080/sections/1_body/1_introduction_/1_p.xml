<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the resultant required self-isolation, is having a huge impact on the care of patients with endometriosis worldwide. With the support of several gynecological associations (
 <xref rid="hoaa028-B1" ref-type="bibr">AAGL – Elevating Gynecologic Surgery, 2020</xref>), many medical centers have temporarily stopped offering surgical management for endometriosis. Similarly, many outpatient appointments for endometriosis with family physicians, gynecologists, fertility specialists and/or other allied healthcare professionals (e.g. physiotherapists, psychologists, dieticians) have been canceled or postponed. In addition, the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology has recommended postponing ultrasound evaluation of non-acute pelvic pain (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020
 </xref>). To offset the direct healthcare obstacles, we hope that as much as possible, patients are still able to connect with their healthcare providers by telephone or virtually online. We encourage healthcare providers and patients alike to consider medical management options that they have not yet trialed and that are within reach during this period of self-isolation despite the closure of services they may otherwise access. In combination with medical therapies or as an alternative, we encourage patients to consider self-management strategies that may be effective in combating the negative physical or psychological effects triggered by COVID-19 restrictions. The importance of integrating self-management strategies into the broad biopsychological approach to endometriosis is not novel (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>) nor will it be exclusively relevant during this time. The necessity of long-term and multimodal treatments for endometriosis, including the self-management strategies described here, means the usefulness of the content of this article will extend beyond the current situation. We have therefore prepared the following expert opinion-based guidance on self-management strategies for patients to consider using during self-isolation and beyond (
