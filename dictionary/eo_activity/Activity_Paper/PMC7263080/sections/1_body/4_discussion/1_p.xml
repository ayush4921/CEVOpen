<p>Our review article briefly touches on the various problem-focused and emotions-focused strategies that are non-medication and non-surgical, which patients with endometriosis and their healthcare providers could discuss and consider implementing during the pandemic of COVID-19. These strategies could be attempted in combination with medical management strategies that may still be prescribed via telephone or video consultations. In addition, regardless of whether exacerbated by endometriosis or not, the COVID-19 restrictions may trigger negative psychological effects (

 </xref>) in patients with endometriosis, which require diverse and multimodal strategies. The strategies discussed here may have merit not necessarily because they specifically target endometriosis, but because they target overall well-being. In relation to endometriosis, the literature on these self-management strategies is scarce and/or limited by lower methodological quality. In many cases, no RCTs have been completed within endometriosis populations to test the efficacy or safety of the strategies. For some (e.g. diet, sleep, mindfulness), the likelihood and severity of possible adverse events are low enough that the potential benefits would outweigh the risk. These may be more reasonable to attempt as novel strategies and patients could use their judgment and independent research to guide their decisions. For other strategies (e.g. pelvic floor exercises, cannabis), the risks are greater or they require guidance by healthcare providers. As such, greater caution should be used in initiating these strategies, though maintenance may be easier if the patient had initiated them before COVID-19 and had a period of adequate supervision or training.
