<p>However, to date, the genetic regulation of thujone synthesis pathway has been studied in two species: 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Thuja plicata</italic>. Geranyldiphosphate (GPP) and neryl-diphosphate are the general precursors’ starting points and follow a four-step pathway. Sabinene is the first monoterpene in this path, being catalyzed by the enzyme sabinene-synthase (SS). It has been showed that sabinene is the precursor of thujone in 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic>. Next, in three consecutive steps, thujone is formed from sabinene. The next intermediary in thujones’ synthesis is sabinone, from which begins the thujone synthesis. There are some corresponding enzymes of this transformation which have not yet been clarified and also the formation of the two isomers of thujone (α and β). There are some species who get both isomers, while other plants accumulate just one of them [
