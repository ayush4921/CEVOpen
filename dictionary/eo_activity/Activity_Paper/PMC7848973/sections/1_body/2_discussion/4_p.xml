<p>Our identification of 12 new metabolites of cycleanine in both plasma and urine in rats using LC-MS/MS has indicated that there are various metabolic pathways of cycleanine. These metabolites of cycleanine found in rats are also likely generated in mice after the same route of oral administration, and therefore they could contribute to its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial efficacy found in the murine malarial model and its toxicity finding in healthy mice. Hydroxylation and demethylation of cycleanine were the common pathways consistent with those found in isoliensinine, neferine, and isotetrandrine described above. Preparation of these metabolites through chemical synthesis (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biotransformation using hepatic microsomes and/or P450 enzymes (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) is possible and necessary to evaluate their potency and toxicity. Such information can be used to further guide the chemical design and modification of cycleanine to improve its potency and pharmacokinetics and to increase metabolic stability (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Further work is necessary and ongoing in our laboratory to determine the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial effects of BBIQ alkaloids (compounds 2 and 3) and semisynthetic derivatives (compounds 4 and 5) and the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity of the metabolites of cycleanine. Novel active drugs, particularly those with a wide safety margin, are required to help alleviate malaria morbidity and mortality and to contribute to the global control of malaria and infectious diseases.
