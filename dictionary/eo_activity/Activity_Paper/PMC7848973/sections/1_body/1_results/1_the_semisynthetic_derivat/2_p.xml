<p>Data from cytotoxicity studies of BBIQ alkaloids 1 to 3 in human oral epidermoid carcinoma (KB) or HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells suggest low to moderate selectivity, with a selectivity index (SI) of 14 to &gt;133. Fifty percent cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) data for all five compounds are available from human ovarian epithelial (HOE) cells (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data reinforce the findings of low selectivity, albeit improved in semisynthetic products 4 and 5.
