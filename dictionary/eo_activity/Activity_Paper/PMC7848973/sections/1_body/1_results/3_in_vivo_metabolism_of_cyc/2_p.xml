<p>Twelve peaks on LC-MS/MS chromatograms relevant to cycleanine were detected in either urine or plasma samples (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). The original form of cycleanine and 11 metabolites were found from the urine of rats, which were presumed to be hydroxylation (M1 and M2), demethylation and hydroxylation (M3), monodemethylation (M4), didemethylation (M5), dehydrogenation and hydroxylation (M6 and M12), and dehydrogenation and dihydroxylation (M7) metabolites, and the isomeric metabolites of M7 (M8, M9, and M11). From the cycleanine-containing plasma of rats, the original form cycleanine (M0) and five metabolites were found, which were presumed to be hydroxylation (M2 and M10), dehydrogenation and hydroxylation (M6 and M12), and dehydrogenation and dihydroxylation (M7) metabolites. Among them, the prototype (M0), hydroxylation (M1), and dehydrogenation and hydroxylation (M6, M12) metabolites were detected in both rat urine and plasma (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and supplemental material). Therefore, the metabolic pathway of cycleanine in rats involves hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and demethylation or their combination, which are the main means of biotransformation of cycleanine to generate a large number of metabolites (M1 to M12) (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material).
