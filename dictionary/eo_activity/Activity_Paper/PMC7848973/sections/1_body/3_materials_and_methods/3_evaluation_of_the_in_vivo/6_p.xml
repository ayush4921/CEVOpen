 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). On the first day, 20 to 24 mice were infected with the parasite and randomly separated into four groups. The mice in groups 1 and 2 were given 25 and 50 mg/kg of cycleanine, respectively, those in group 3 were given 5 mg/kg of chloroquine (positive control), and those in group 4 were given distilled water (10 ml/kg, negative control) for four consecutive days. Thin films were made from the tail blood on the fifth day. Parasitized erythrocytes were counted in stained films (Giemsa stain) under a microscope. The average suppression of parasitemia (%) was calculated as follows:
