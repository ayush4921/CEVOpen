 <bold>(viii) Curative activity of cycleanine.</bold> The curative activity of cycleanine was assessed according to a method described previously (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> was injected intraperitoneally into another 24 mice on the first day. Three days later, the mice were also separated into four groups of six mice per group. Groups 1 and 2 were administered different doses of cycleanine, 25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, group 3 was given 5 mg/kg chloroquine (positive control), and group 4 was given 10 ml/kg distilled water (negative control). Cycleanine and chloroquine were given once a day for 5 days. Mouse tail blood samples were collected on each day, and Giemsa-stained thin smears were prepared to determine the parasitemia level. The MST of the mice in each group was determined over a period of 30 days.
