<p>Essential oils analysis was done using a gas chromatography device (model: Agilent 7890 A G). The separation was carried out using the Column MS HP‐5 (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm). The oven temperature program was set at 50°C (3 min) to 260°C with a ramp‐up of 3°C/min and then held for 5 min. The detector and the injector temperature were adjusted at 270 and 240°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a rate of 1 ml/min.</p>
