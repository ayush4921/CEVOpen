<p>Changes in essential oil compounds in different phenological stages of 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> growth are probably due to the fact that the production of essential oil and aromatic compounds are under the control of interactions between physiological, biochemical, and metabolic mechanisms which they depend on age and growth stages of plant. Besides, these changes related to terpene biosynthesis as well as its accumulation in the secretory organs (Németh,
