<p>Considering the higher extract content quantity or quality in the general floral budding and full flowering stage, it is possible to point the suitability of harvest in these stages for producing a higher extract content. The final growth stage also had higher essential oil percentage, indicating the effect of different phenological stages on the essential oil percentage quality. So we can pinpoint the phytochemical compounds extracted from the plant strongly depend on the plant organ and phenological stage. (Kaškonienė et al.,
