<p>The effect of the methanol extract as well as the partitioned extracts of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, are presented in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The result revealed the ability of the extract and partitioned fractions to reduce acid-abdominal constrictions and stretching of mice hind limbs in a dose-dependent manner. These reductions were statistically (p&lt;0.001) significant relative to distilled water but not as potent as ASA.
