<p>In systemic anti-inflammation study, two mechanisms of inhibition of oedema are recognized. The first being the local release or formation of autacoids such as histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) kinins, prostanoids while the second is the neurogenic stimulation of primary sensory neurons followed by the release of prostaglandins, a mediator of inflammation (Ajaghaku et al., 2013
