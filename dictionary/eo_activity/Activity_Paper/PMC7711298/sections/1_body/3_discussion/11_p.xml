<p>The result of the study which indicated the ability of the extracts of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>to suppress paw diameter induced by egg albumin, a phlogistic agent in a manner similar to ASA, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, suggests that the extract has systemic potential in the inhibition of oedema. The result of phytochemical screening of the extract did reveal the presence of many secondary metabolites which are implicated in intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, hence the ability of these extracts in inhibiting paw oedema may not be unconnected with these compounds (Dahham et al., 2015
