<p>Adult albino mice of both sexes (20-30 g) were divided into 10 groups of five animals each for the extract (methanol) and fractions (hexane, DCM and aqueous). The animals were used for the experiment after 24 hr fast and were only deprived of water during the experiment. Inflammation of the hind paw was induced by injecting 0.1 ml of fresh egg albumin (Phlogistic agent) subcutaneously (s.c.) into the sub-plantar surface of the right hind paw (Akah and Nwambie, 1994

The test groups (groups 2-7) of mice were pre-treated with 310, 620 and 930 mg/kg of the extract as well as 160 mg/kg of n-hexane, DCM and aqueous fractions (i.p.), respectively. The linear circumference of the injected paw was measured before administering the fresh egg albumin (C
 <sub>0</sub>) and every 30 min thereafter for 5 hr (C
 <sub>t</sub>) using digital veneer caliper (Tianheng Tools Co. Ltd, China). The difference between C
 <sub>1 </sub>and C
 <sub>0</sub> within a given time, represented the degree of inflammation (Hess and Milonig, 1972
