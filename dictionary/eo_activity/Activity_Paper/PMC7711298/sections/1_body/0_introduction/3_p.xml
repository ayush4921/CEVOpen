<p>There are scanty reports on the stembark of the plant. The available reports include: isolation of a pentacyclic triterpenoid lupeol from the stembark of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>(Abdullahi et al., 2013
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>) as well as the anticonvulsant activity of methanol extract of the stem bark of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>(Musa et al., 2006
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). However, there is no report on the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the stembark of 
 <italic>L. sericeus </italic>despite its wide usage in ethnobotany, hence, the present study was carried out to validate this claim.
