 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> contains phytoconstituents including, phenols, tannins, alkaloids, triterpene, flavonoids, anthraquinones, steroids, polysterols, coumarins, and glycosides.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Flavonoids, tannin, and an alkaloid were some of the renowned compounds that were isolated from the extracts that are capable of reducing the elevated BGL.

 <xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Therefore, the significant anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of the solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> could be because of the attendance of the aforementioned secondary metabolites in the plant.
