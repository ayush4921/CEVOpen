<p>Abnormalities in lipid profiles are common complications in diabetes mellitus. In addition to its anti-hyperglycemic effect, an aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> was also able to alter the levels of serum lipid levels such as TC, TG, HDL, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol levels in diabetic mice suggesting a remarkable anti-hyperlipidemic effect. The serum lipid levels are typically raised in diabetic patients and such increments indicate a risk factor for CHD.
