<p>The loss of body weight in diabetic mice is due to increased muscle wasting,

However, all tested doses (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg) of the aqueous fraction treated groups have shown significant body weight gain on day 14 from the initial (0) day when compared with the diabetic control group. The ability of aqueous solvent fraction to prevent weight loss may be due to its ability to reduce the elevated blood glucose level which is the sign of suitable glucose utilization,

 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> The current finding showed that all tested doses (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg) of the aqueous fraction have shown a significant body weight gain on day 14 from the initial (0) day as compared to diabetic control. This result is consistent with previous similar studies.
