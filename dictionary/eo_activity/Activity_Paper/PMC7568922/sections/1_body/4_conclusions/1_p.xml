<p>In the present study, the administration of solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> has shown significant antidiabetic activity in normoglycemic mice, oral glucose loaded mice, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The solvent fractions also improve the serum biochemical parameters such as lipid profile: total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterols, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. From the observed antidiabetic activity of solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic>, the study may support the use of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> herb for the treatment of diabetes mellitus by a traditional healer. Further researches are needed to identify the lead compound (s) present in 
 <italic>Bersama abyssinica Fresen</italic> (Melianthaceae) with its (their) molecular mechanism of action on PPAR, insulin sensitization, histological analysis, and other insulin targets based on the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.
