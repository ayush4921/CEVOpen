<p>Overnight fasted mice were grouped into eight groups (six test groups and two control groups), of six mice each. Then, Group 1 received distilled water (10 mL/kg) and served as a negative control, Group 2 received glibenclamide 5 mg/kg and served as a positive control, Group 3–5 received aqueous solvent fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> at doses of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg body weight, and Group 6–8 received ethyl acetate solvent fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> at doses of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg body weight. Then, following 30 min post solvent fractions, standard drug, and water administration all the mice were fed with glucose (2000 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected from the tail vein before dosing and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after administration of glucose to evaluate their blood glucose level. The blood glucose level was analyzed using glucose-oxidase peroxide reactive strips.
