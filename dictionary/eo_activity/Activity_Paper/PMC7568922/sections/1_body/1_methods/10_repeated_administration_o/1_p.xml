<p>Overnight fasted mice were grouped into six groups (three test groups and three control groups), of six mice each. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were administered (orally) 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg of the aqueous solvent fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> for test groups; 5mg/kg glibenclamide for the positive control group; and 1 mL of distilled water for the negative control group. There was also a normal control group that received 1 mL of distilled water orally. Aqueous solvent fraction, standard drug, and water were administered once daily for 14 days. Blood glucose level and body weight were measured on 0-day, 7th day, and 14th day following the induction. The blood glucose level was measured using glucometer blood drawn from the tail of the mice.
