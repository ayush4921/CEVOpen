<p>The HPLC-DAD method was established, validated, and applied for the quantitative analysis of the 12 marker compounds in 57 different medicinal parts of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>, including 15 root bark samples, 11 twig samples, 12 fruit samples, and 19 leaf samples. The contents of the marker compounds varied by the medicinal part, with compound levels in the levels and root barks. Principal component analysis and heatmap analysis showed that the marker compounds were strongly associated in clusters for the different parts, such as mulberroside A, taxifolin, kuwanon G and morusin for the root barks; 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and oxyresveratrol for the twigs, and skimmin, chlorogenic acid, rutin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, and quercitrin for the leaves. The HPLC, coupled with chemometric analysis, provide a comprehensive understanding of the medicinal part-specific chemical markers in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>, a multisource-usable medicinal plant.
