<p>In the principal component (PC) score plot, samples from single medicinal parts had similar PC1 and PC2 scores. The root bark samples (SBs) had negative PC1 and PC2 scores, except for SB02, −04, −05, −07, −11, and −15. The positive SBs overlapped with the positive PC2 scores of the fruit samples. The twig samples (SJs) were negative for PC1 and positive for PC2. The fruit samples (SSs) were in the narrow ranges of positive and negative PC1 scores, and positive PC2 scores. The leaf samples (SYs) were positive for PC1 and negative for PC2, except for SY01, −07, and −18. The positive SYs also overlapped with the fruit samples for positive PC2 scores (
