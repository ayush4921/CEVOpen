<p>The contents of the 12 marker compounds varied considerably in the samples from single medicinal parts, and between the different medicinal parts (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05592">Table S3</xref>). Significantly higher contents of mulberroside A, kuwanon G, and morusin were contained in the root barks (100.19 ± 63.62 mg/g, 24.05 ± 23.17 mg/g, and 10.98 ± 10.49 mg/g, respectively) than in the twigs (44.55 ± 34.61 mg/g, 3.86 ± 2.54 mg/g, and 2.63 ± 1.97 mg/g). Morusin was also found in significantly low amounts in the fruit samples (0.11 ± 0.10 mg/g) compared to the root barks. In contrast, oxyresveratrol showed higher amounts in the twigs (6.15 ± 8.47 mg/g) than in the root barks (1.27 ± 1.19 mg/g), but the difference was not statistically significant. The contents of chlorogenic acid, rutin, and isoquercitrin were significantly greater in the leaves (19.99 ± 9.36 mg/g, 3.25 ± 1.47 mg/g, and 3.83 ± 2.42 mg/g, respectively) than in the fruits (3.21 ± 2.40 mg/g, 1.35 ± 0.84 mg/g, and 0.66 ± 0.60 mg/g, respectively) and the root barks (6.77 ± 8.81 mg/g for chlorogenic acid). The 4-hydroxycinnamic acid content was significantly higher in the twigs (0.26 ± 0.11 mg/g). Taxifolin was non-significantly higher in the root barks (0.43 ± 0.33 mg/g). Both of these were higher than in the fruits (0.03 ± 0.01 mg/g for 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 0.04 ± 0.02 mg/g for taxifolin). Skimmin and astragalin were detected only in the leaves of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> (0.49 ± 0.41 mg/g and 1.55 ± 0.93 mg/g, respectively). Quercitrin was only found in small amounts in some of the leaf samples (5 out of 19 samples), with a content of 0.26 ± 0.14 mg/g (
