<p>Previous studies report that 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid) is derived from cinnamic acid via the P450-dependent enzyme 4-cinnamic acid hydroxylase [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It has been primarily found in the fruits of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> at lower levels than other compounds [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but this study indicates that the twigs of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> may be another key accumulation part for 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, as previously reported [
