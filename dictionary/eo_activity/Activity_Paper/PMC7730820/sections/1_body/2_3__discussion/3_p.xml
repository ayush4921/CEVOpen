<p>Higher levels of mulberroside A (oxyresveratrol diglucoside) in the root bark is also confirmed by a previous study [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The root is considered a substantial site for the biosynthesis of mulberroside A via glycosylation of oxyresveratrol (hydroxy-resveratrol), which is found as a precursor in the root of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Oxyresveratrol is known as one of the key compounds in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> twigs, following its mono- or di-glucosylated moieties [
