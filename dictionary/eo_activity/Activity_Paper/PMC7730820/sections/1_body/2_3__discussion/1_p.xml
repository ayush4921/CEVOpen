<p>The phytochemical levels, particularly the secondary metabolites, showed part-specific or tissue-specific variation of single plants, which corresponds to the fact that gene expression for phytochemical biosynthesis is highly plant-part dependent [

However, some compounds represented significant variations of the contents even in same medicinal part, presumably due to intra-species factors (i.e., different levels of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, deposit or transformation) or extrinsic factors (i.e., circumstance of growing, harvesting season, degree of sample dryness, etc.).
