<p>The quantitative analysis of the marker compounds was performed using an Agilent 1260 liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with an autosampler, degasser, quaternary solvent pump, and diode array detector. Data was processed using ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). Twelve marker compounds were separated on a Capcell Pak Mg II C
 <sub>18</sub> column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) at 35 °C. The flow rate was set at 1 mL/min and an injection volume was set at 10 μL. The mobile phase consisted of water containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). A gradient elution was applied as follows: 10% (solvent B, %) for 0–5 min, 10–12% (solvent B, %) for 5–15 min, 12–20% (solvent B, %) for 15–27 min, 20–70% (solvent B, %) for 27––65 min, 70–95% (solvent B, %) for 65–66 min, held for 3 min, then re-equilibrated to 10% (solvent B, %) until the end of the analysis. The diode-array detector was set at ultraviolet wavelengths of 255, 265, 275, 290, 310, and 325 nm.
