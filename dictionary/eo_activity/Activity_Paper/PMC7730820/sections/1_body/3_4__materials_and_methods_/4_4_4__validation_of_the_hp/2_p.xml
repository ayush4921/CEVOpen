<p>The repeatability of the HPLC method was determined via a precision test by analyzing low, medium, and high concentrations of the above-mentioned solutions three times within one day (intraday precision) and over three consecutive days (interday precision). Precisions are given as relative standard deviations (RSDs) (where RSD (%) = [(standard deviation / mean) Ã— 100]). </p>
