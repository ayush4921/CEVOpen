<p>Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) are essential to produce prostaglandins which are important for the inflammatory reaction. THCA inhibited COX1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1700 µM) and COX2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 630 µM) using an enzyme-based in vitro assay and human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cell line. Prostaglandin production was also inhibited (10% inhibition, 62.5 µM) in HT29 cell line by THCA [

Another report showed that THCA inhibited COX2 expression in a dose-dependent manner in three colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT29, and CaCO2. In addition, THCA inhibited Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression in colon cell lines indicating that THCA plays an efficient role against colon inflammation [
