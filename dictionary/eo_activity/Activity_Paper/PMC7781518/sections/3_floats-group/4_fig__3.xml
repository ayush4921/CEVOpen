  <p>Main pathways of inflammation mediated by the immune system and possible polysaccharide signaling mechanisms that contribute to the immunosuppression of pro-inflammatory substances production pathways. 
   <bold>A</bold>) Direct route mediated by mitochondria; 
   <bold>B</bold>) MyD88 protein signaling pathway; 
   <bold>C</bold>) MAPK protein signaling pathway. In addition, the main polysaccharide-mediated immunosuppression pathways are shown with red arrows. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
