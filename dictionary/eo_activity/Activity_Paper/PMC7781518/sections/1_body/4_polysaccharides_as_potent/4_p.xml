Some of these vaccine production projects are in the exploratory phase, while others are already more advanced, already in clinical development. As an example we have mRNA-1273 from Moderna, Ad5-nCoV from CanSino Biologicals, INO-4800 from Inovio and LV-SMENP-DC and aAPC specific to pathogens from Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute. There are many candidates for vaccine production and include, from LNP encapsulated mRNA vaccine that encodes protein S, Type 5 adenovirus vector that expresses protein S, DNA plasmid encoding protein S delivered by electroporation and aAPCs modified with a lentiviral vector that express synthetic minigene based on selected viral protein domains (
