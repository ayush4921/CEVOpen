<p id="p0280">As previously described, polysaccharides can modulate the immune response to infections. Therefore, the use of polysaccharides for vaccine production has been reported as a possibility. Recent studies (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), show that polysaccharides can be used as cheap and efficient platforms in the development of vaccine formulations. We believe that more in-depth studies can be conducted to apply polysaccharides in the production of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
