<p id="p0235">Polysaccharides modulate the immune response in several ways, increasing macrophage phagocytosis, production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), NO (nitrous oxide), the release of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) and by activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB, toll-like 4 (TLR4), type A hijacker receptor (SRA) and glucan receptor (GR). In the study conducted by 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2020)</xref> A neutral polysaccharide, obtained from Kushui rose residues, showed immunomodulatory activity, increasing macrophage phagocytosis, production of ROS, NO, IL-6, TNF-α by the activation of signaling pathways NF-κB. 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2020)</xref>, isolated and purified a new polysaccharide from the roots of 
 <italic>Millettia Speciosa</italic> Champ. The polysaccharide increased pinocytic capacity and promoted the secretion of NO and cytokines in RAW 264.7 cells. Macrophage production was mediated by signaling receptors such as toll-like 4 (TLR4), type A hijacker (RAS) and glucan (GR). Finally, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2019)</xref> isolated and purified a homogeneous polysaccharide, with bioactive properties of the lotus root. It has been shown that the polysaccharide induces macrophage activation through the PI3K/Akt and MAPKs signal pathways, which had not yet been reported. Also, the polysaccharide promoted the secretion of TNF-α and interleukin-2 in artificially induced immunosuppressive mice.
