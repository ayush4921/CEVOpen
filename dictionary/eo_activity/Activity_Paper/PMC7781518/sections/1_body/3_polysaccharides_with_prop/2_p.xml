<p id="p0205">The polysaccharide potential in modulating the immune system will be the focus of this topic. Also, the polysaccharide immunomodulatory potential will be used as an indication of the ability of these biopolymers to stimulate the body to improve the immune response to viral infections, especially by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, for a better understanding of the reader on the subject, we will initially address important aspects of inflammatory immunopathogenesis related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Then, the main polysaccharides with immunomodulatory activity will be addressed.</p>
