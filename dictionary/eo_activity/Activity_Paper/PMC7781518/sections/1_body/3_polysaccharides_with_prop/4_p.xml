<p id="p0215">The virus replicates continuously in the epithelial cells of the airways, causing high levels of pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death. This is probably the trigger for the localized inflammatory response. Subsequently, IL-1β, a cytokine released during pyroptosis increases considerably, attracting an immediate inflammatory response. Using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), cells such as alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells identify receptors for pathogens such as viral RNA, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Thus these cells initiate localized inflammation, with increased cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-6, IFNγ, MCP1, and IP-10 in the blood (

In response to the high level of pro-inflammatory substances, defense cells such as monocytes and T lymphocytes initiate a coordinated attack at the sites of inflammation. In most cases, recruited cells can respond adequately to the immune system and patients recover. However, in other cases, still poorly understood, patients exhibited higher blood plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IP-10, MCP1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP1α) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus subverts the antiviral response is still unknown, but it is known that the cytokine storm has side effects on the body, leading to septic shock and multiple organ failure. Also, adults, the elderly and people with morbidities have lower levels of defense cells when compared to children, therefore, the inflammatory response can be harmful (
