<p id="p0060">Polysaccharides are complex molecules, composed of monosaccharides, united by glycidic bonds, with different branched grains, composition of monosaccharides, molecular weight and structural conformation. Polysaccharides are present in all living organisms, are part of structural biochemistry and have relevant functions in the cellular environment (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2020</xref>). Natural foods such as mushrooms, yeasts, fruits, algae and cereals have polysaccharides in their chemical composition, these biopolymers can be obtained and purified to be used as potent substances in the activation of the immune system, especially the adaptive system, as shown by recent studies (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">He, Chen, et al., 2020</xref>), interesting biological properties, which can be used in innovative therapies. Thus polysaccharides can be used as an activating agent of the immune system, reducing the damage caused by infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2.
