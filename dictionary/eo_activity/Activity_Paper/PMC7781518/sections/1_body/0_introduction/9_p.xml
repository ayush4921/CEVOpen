<p id="p0070">Here, we review the literature on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, its characteristics, interactions with target cells, and the possibility of using polysaccharides obtained from functional foods as activators of the immune response. We highlight several natural foods, rich in polysaccharides, making a survey by categories, in order to contextualize the reader about the diversity of food sources with promising potential. However, the focus is on the extracted polysaccharides and not on the food. Therefore, the implications of the specific molecular characteristics of polysaccharides that can be used for promising therapeutic interventions are discussed in detail. In addition, we discussed how polysaccharides produce a crucial adaptive immune response to inform the development of antibodies and in detail the main mechanisms of modulation of the immune system. Finally, to complement the discussion, a contextualized dialogue is opened about the potential of polysaccharides to be applied as efficient and safe platforms in the development of vaccines and potential immunity-boosting therapies.</p>
