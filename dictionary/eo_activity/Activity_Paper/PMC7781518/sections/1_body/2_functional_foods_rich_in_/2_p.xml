<p id="p0110">Polysaccharides are distributed throughout nature, from microorganisms to complex organisms. We functional foods such as fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, algae, herbs and plants in general, these biopolymers are found in abundance. In fact, in recent years, a great effort has been made by researchers worldwide to understand the importance and distribution of polysaccharides in natural foods. Also, considerable efforts have been made to establish a well-founded understanding of the influence of polysaccharides on human health. Thus, in this topic, we will address the main polysaccharides obtained from natural foods, with special emphasis on their structural properties that may attribute some biological potential. Meanwhile, (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ), summarizes some functional foods rich in biologically active polysaccharides. Although this topic deals exclusively with functional foods rich in biologically active polysaccharides, we must make it clear that the role of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of polysaccharides isolated from these edible natural sources.
