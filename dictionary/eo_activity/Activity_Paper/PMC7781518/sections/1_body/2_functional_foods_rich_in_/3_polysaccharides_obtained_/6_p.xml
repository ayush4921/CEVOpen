<p id="p0135">Mushrooms are the main foods with a high content of polysaccharides, mainly polysaccharides with antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity. As demonstrated in a study by 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa et al. (2020b)</xref> using a supercritical binary hot water and CO
 <sub>2</sub> system for the first time, it was possible to obtain polysaccharide-rich fractions from the edible mushroom 
 <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic>. The study revealed that the extracts were a mixture of several polysaccharides, including glucans. The antioxidant activity of the extracts in the DPPH models showed a radical reduction potential of up to 80%. The antioxidant potential of the extracts has also been confirmed in studies with a cell model, which revealed the potential of the extracts in protecting cells from oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide. Another study demonstrated that the mushroom 
 <italic>Phallus atrovovatus</italic> has high concentrations of polysaccharides, mainly fractions of β-glucan and α-glucan. The polysaccharides obtained from this mushroom are known to have immune system modulating activity, as fractions of up to 50 μg of the polysaccharides have been shown to significantly reduce the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), as well as reduced cytokine secretion TNF-α, IL- 6 and IL-10, that is, anti-inflammatory activity (
