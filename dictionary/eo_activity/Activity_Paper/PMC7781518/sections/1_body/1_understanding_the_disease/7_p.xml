<p id="p0100">The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SDRA) observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by low blood oxygen level, drop in blood pressure and difficulty breathing. Due to the negative effects of low oxygenation of blood and organs, some patients end up acquiring other diseases such as infections caused by fungi, bacteria and even other viruses, resulting in the worsening of the clinical picture (

Also, the storm of cytokines released by the immune system in response to the infection (viral infection and/or secondary infections), results in the worsening of sepsis symptoms (symptoms: include fever, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, and mental confusion), responsible for more than 28% of deaths from SARS-CoV-2. In these cases, the condition of uncontrolled inflammation causes multiple damage, mainly to the organs of the heart, liver, kidney and respiratory system, making it very difficult for patients to recover (
