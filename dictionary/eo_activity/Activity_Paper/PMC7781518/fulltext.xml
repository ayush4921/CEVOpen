Clinical and pathophysiological studies carried out in Wuhan province, China, have identified the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as the infectious agent responsible for serious respiratory complications and damage to multiple organs. Although the true origin of the virus is still unknown, it is believed based on recent studies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, &#x00026; Garry, 2020</xref>) that it occurred from zoonotic transmission.</p><p id="p0040">The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from human to human and has spread with frightening frequency. Currently, the virus is distributed throughout the world, affecting millions of people, causing human, economic and social losses. As reported by the World Health Organization (OMS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19, has become a global health pandemic, affecting all people, regardless of social class, creed or religion (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Tay, Poh, R&#x000e9;nia, MacAry, &#x00026; Ng, 2020</xref>). Daily reports provided by all countries in the world show that the number of infected and dead has grown continuously. Good news during this crisis comes from the considerable number of people healed and the international effort to develop vaccines and new drugs capable of mitigating the side effects of the disease and reducing human losses (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Tay et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Worldwide, several research groups are engaged in the search for new drugs and vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 and its adverse effects. However, although vaccine development is ideal, it still requires a lot of effort and investment. Recent studies (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Weitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2020</xref>), show that the immune system plays a crucial role in the body's response to viral infection. Therefore, promising new therapeutic interventions should somehow improve the hosts' immune response. The immune system is the focus of some of the therapeutic interventions being developed. In particular, the adaptive immune system, which needs to be, stimulated with immunoregulatory agents or immune system activators. The polysaccharides that are present in some foods have biologically active properties, such as the ability to activate immune functions, inducing the production of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune function regulating substances (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fu, Belwal, Cravotto, &#x00026; Luo, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Yockey, Lucas, &#x00026; Iwasaki, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">In the midst of the current crisis caused by the pandemic of COVID-19, the consumption of healthy foods, especially those with functional properties, has become a necessity, mainly as a way to prevent and improve the immune system (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Galanakis, 2020</xref>). One of the current perspectives is to apply new technologies to obtain biologically active compounds from natural sources and waste (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Galanakis, 2018</xref>). Technologies such as electro-osmotic dehydration, high hydrostatic pressure, ultrasound-assisted extraction, supercritical fluid technology, and pulsed electric field, among countless others have been applied in the extraction of polyphenols, polysaccharides and various molecules of high commercial value (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zinoviadou et al., 2015</xref>). The technologies for extracting added value compounds are one of the most relevant steps in the process of prospecting molecules, so it is important that the reader is up to date with the new trends on this subject. As a result, the following articles are suggested for more information (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Galanakis, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">In addition, it is important to emphasize that food supply has always been a global concern, especially considering the worrying scenarios of global economic slowdown, trade war and obvious obstacles caused by the very peculiarities of the current moment. Considering this scenario, where the consumption of healthy foods is more than necessary, important concerns about food security arise, mainly with the real possibility of transmission of COVID-19 through the food supply chain. Therefore, new security strategies and measures, in addition to detection technologies for SARS-CoV-2 are still a prevalent need. Readers can search for more information on relevant issues related to food security, food supply chain and SARS-CoV-2 detection strategies in articles published in Trends in Food Science &#x00026; Technology by <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Rizou, Galanakis, Aldawoud, &#x00026; Galanakis (2020)</xref>.</p><p id="p0060">Polysaccharides are complex molecules, composed of monosaccharides, united by glycidic bonds, with different branched grains, composition of monosaccharides, molecular weight and structural conformation. Polysaccharides are present in all living organisms, are part of structural biochemistry and have relevant functions in the cellular environment (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2020</xref>). Natural foods such as mushrooms, yeasts, fruits, algae and cereals have polysaccharides in their chemical composition, these biopolymers can be obtained and purified to be used as potent substances in the activation of the immune system, especially the adaptive system, as shown by recent studies (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Mohan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Zhang, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Zeng, et al., 2020</xref>). Also, these biopolymers have interesting biological properties as an antioxidant activity (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Su &#x00026; Li, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Wu, Luo, Yao, &#x00026; Yu, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>), anti-inflammatory (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">de Lacerda Bezerra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>), antiviral (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Wang, et al., 2020</xref>), biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">He, Chen, et al., 2020</xref>), interesting biological properties, which can be used in innovative therapies. Thus polysaccharides can be used as an activating agent of the immune system, reducing the damage caused by infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="p0065">Given the current scenario, the use of foods rich in immunomodulator polysaccharides is a viable option to increase immunity and reduce risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 contamination. Also, understanding the biology resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 host-pathogen will provide relevant information on the treatment and management of the disease. Although the use of polysaccharides as a therapy strategy is not yet a reality, the application as supplements is a rational possibility, based on all scientific evidence on the immunomodulatory potential of these biopolymers (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Zhang, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Zeng, et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Here, we review the literature on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, its characteristics, interactions with target cells, and the possibility of using polysaccharides obtained from functional foods as activators of the immune response. We highlight several natural foods, rich in polysaccharides, making a survey by categories, in order to contextualize the reader about the diversity of food sources with promising potential. However, the focus is on the extracted polysaccharides and not on the food. Therefore, the implications of the specific molecular characteristics of polysaccharides that can be used for promising therapeutic interventions are discussed in detail. In addition, we discussed how polysaccharides produce a crucial adaptive immune response to inform the development of antibodies and in detail the main mechanisms of modulation of the immune system. Finally, to complement the discussion, a contextualized dialogue is opened about the potential of polysaccharides to be applied as efficient and safe platforms in the development of vaccines and potential immunity-boosting therapies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Understanding the disease, its characteristics, and clinical evolution</title><p id="p0075">A severe type of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus in 2019 in China has become known worldwide as COVID-19. Currently, the disease is expanding worldwide, is highly infectious, lethal, and still poorly comprehended. The world health organization (OMS) recently declared that the outbreak of the new coronavirus is a global health emergency and needs the engagement of government organizations, civil society, and the military, all of which are committed to reducing contamination and mortality rates (<xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">Recently, an article published in The Lancet by <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, Yu, et al. (2020)</xref>, showed the main characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia, through clinical results obtained from patients in the year 2019&#x02013;2020 in Wuhan, China. The report describes the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, as well as the treatment and clinical results, however, of adult patients only. Common symptoms at the beginning of the disease were fever, cough, and fatigue. Less common symptoms were sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. In severe cases the disease progressed to inflammation of the lungs, causing pneumonia. The main symptoms in these cases were acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and secondary infections that in most cases caused severe pulmonary complications and deaths in several patients.</p><p id="p0085">The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been known to the medical community and infectologist for many years, however, until 2019, there were no reports of infections in humans, until the first cases of the outbreak of COVID-19 were reported in China. It is known that viruses of the coronavirus family can cause disease and illness in both humans and animals. Four types of coronaviruses known as (human coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), infect the respiratory tract and cause symptoms considered moderate (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>).

Among these, SARS-CoV-2 is a virus belonging to the genus betacoronavirus, with much genetic similarity to SARS-CoV. Also, SARS-CoV-2 has a 98% similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and the scaly anteater coronavirus (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, Yang, et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0090">SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is transmitted through respiratory droplets or other fluids, however, these other pathways are not proven. The (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

After infection, the virus undergoes a 4&#x02013;5 day incubation period, before the onset of symptoms (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). Generally, patients at the time of hospitalization have difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, nausea and bloody cough, less common symptoms such as fever and dry cough also occur (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Wu, et al., 2020</xref>). After the incubation period, on average 5&#x02013;6 days, the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 reaches its peak, interestingly earlier than that of SARS-CoV, which reaches its viral load around 10 days after the start of the symptoms (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Pan, Zhang, Yang, Poon, &#x00026; Wang, 2020</xref>).

The organisms' strong response to infection is accompanied by serious complications to multiple organs. Also, associated with risk factors such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, old age, spinal cord injuries and other morbidities, the clinical condition of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may worsen (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">He, Fang, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kujawski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Li, Hu, Yu, &#x00026; Ma, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Stillman, Capron, Alexander, Di Giusto, &#x00026; Scivoletto, 2020</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Induction of inflammatory process and production of an immune response.

Immediately monocytes, macrophages, and T cells are attracted to pro-inflammatory proteins, initiating localized inflammation, with the production of IFN&#x003b3; by T cells. In some situations, an additional accumulation of immune cells in the lungs can occur, causing a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which damage the pulmonary infrastructure and other organs. A balanced immune response occurs as follows: the initial inflammation attracts specific T cells, which can attack the virus and eliminate infected cells. The production of neutralizing antibodies helps to block viral infection, reducing the associated risks. Finally, alveolar macrophages initiate a coordinated attack on neutralized viruses and apoptotic cells and eliminate them by phagocytosis.

Due to the negative effects of low oxygenation of blood and organs, some patients end up acquiring other diseases such as infections caused by fungi, bacteria and even other viruses, resulting in the worsening of the clinical picture (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Li, Chen, et al., 2020</xref>). About 70% of cases of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 result from the worsening clinical picture of respiratory failure. Also, the storm of cytokines released by the immune system in response to the infection (viral infection and/or secondary infections), results in the worsening of sepsis symptoms (symptoms: include fever, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, and mental confusion), responsible for more than 28% of deaths from SARS-CoV-2. In these cases, the condition of uncontrolled inflammation causes multiple damage, mainly to the organs of the heart, liver, kidney and respiratory system, making it very difficult for patients to recover (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Li, Pei, et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">One of the great current challenges is to understand the role of the immune system in the face of SARS-CoV-2 infection. So far we know that the protective effects of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 suffer widespread failures. However, the real causes and mechanisms by which the immune response is compromised in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear. In addition, the picture of infections is very varied, as has been discussed previously, several types of patients can be observed, from asymptomatic patients to severe cases, with a wide spectrum of impaired vital functions. However, we know that immunity remains the Holy Grail of COVID-19 research. Although the immunity of individuals appears to have a central role, we know that there is still some mechanism to be identified that acts as an immune response imbalance system. This has been observed and shows that even patients with good immunity can progress to severe clinical conditions, although the highest mortality rate can be observed in patients with comorbidities and advanced age (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ghinai et al., 2020</xref>). The central role of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection is no different than that seen for other viral infections. As already described by <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gorbalenya et al. (2020)</xref>, immunity acts directly, initially controlling and managing an innate immune response against viral infection, then, if innate immunity manages to overcome the infection, a new immune response is achieved, that is, the acquired immune response. The innate immune response acts directly after the identification of an infectious process, by stimulating the natural mechanisms of protection against the penetration of pathogens, such as the skin, enzymes and antiviral peptides. However, in several cases, of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system itself already suffers serious damage and its functionality is impaired, even at the beginning of the innate immune response. What has been the subject of many discussions about, what are the mechanisms for activating an inadequate immune response? Therefore, in these cases, the majority of infected individuals have several clinical signs of inflammation and, in several cases, processes of hyperinflammation and serious impairment of vital organs. On the other hand, Individuals who manage to overcome all infections properly, that is, with the immune system acting in a balanced way, obtain the acquired immune response. Although it is not clear how long the immune response acquired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection can prevent new infections, we know that the immune system after the infection has recovered is prepared to deal with possible new infections in a more balanced way (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020a</xref>). To understand in more detail about immune system failures in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we will address the recent findings by <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Lucas et al.

The balance between defense cells and the mechanisms of the production of pro-inflammatory substances are crucial for compression about the mechanisms involved in immune response in children. Although, a complete picture of the factors critical to the development of inflammatory responses remains somewhat undefined. But, it is known that stimulation of the immune system with substances that modulate the immune response helps to adapt the body before serious infections, helping in a more controlled response (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">He, Fang, et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, although polysaccharides are not a therapy proposed during infection, mainly due to the few targeted studies, they can modulate an adequate immune response beforehand, preparing the body to face infection in a balanced way.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Polysaccharides activate immune responses</title><p id="p0225">Polysaccharides stimulate immune cells by means of specific receptors, for example in necrophagous and macrophage cells by means of bonds between functional groups of polysaccharides and molecular groups on the cell surface. From the moment the polysaccharides bind to membrane receptors in the defense cells, the signaling pathways are activated, and a cycle of biochemical processes begins that leads to the positive regulation of gene expression in the ribosomes, initiating the protein production. In cells such as macrophages, polysaccharides activate the protein pathways, which in turn are activated by mitogens (MAPKs) and others such as the nuclear factor (NF-kB), stimulating the immune response control processes. Macrophages can initiate an immune response in several ways, but it is common for polysaccharides to stimulate the production of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa, dos Santos Freitas, da Silva Martins &#x00026; de Carvalho Junior, 2020</xref>). Another relevant aspect about the modulating activity of polysaccharides can be found in studies on gene expression. Some polysaccharides stimulate the production and expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) during the synthesis of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, at the genetic level, some signaling proteins such as p38, p65, p50, signal regulated kinase and JNK are activated by polysaccharides. Polysaccharides obtained from these functional foods significantly increase the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA), and cytokines, both by active regulation of receptors such as TLR2 and TLR4 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa, dos Santos Freitas, da Silva Martins &#x00026; de Carvalho Junior, 2020</xref>). Recently, studies conducted by <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. (2017)</xref>, with polysaccharides from wheat, show that they can possibly induce cytokine expression through the MAP38 p38 signaling pathway mediated by the toll-like receptor 4. Another study conducted by <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Deng, Fu, Shang, Chen, and Xu (2018)</xref> with <italic>Dictyophora indusiata</italic> demonstrated that the Dectin-1 receptor on the surface of macrophages is activated by &#x003b2;-D-glucan, composed of a main chain of (1&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;3) -&#x003b2;-glucan with side chains of residues (1&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;6) -&#x003b2;-glucan and molecular weight of 650&#x000a0;kDa. It was confirmed that the polysaccharide activates macrophages and increases their phagocytic activity; in addition, the MAPK pathway is activated and promotes nuclear translocation of NF-kB. In short, these results shed light on the molecular pathways involved in macrophage immunomodulation activity. In addition to macrophages, other cells are activated and stimulated by polysaccharides, and assist in modulating the immune system, among these cells, they can highlight T cells and dendritic cells. <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Hwang, et al.

It has been identified that tooth cells are modulated by expressing expression of CD86, CD40 and MHC-II. Likewise, polysaccharides can also modulate the secretion of IL-12 by dendritic cells and increase the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the levels of CD4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;and CD8-T cells.</p><p id="p0230">Another edible and medicinal fungus, <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> has polysaccharides that modulate the immune response. <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Li, Gu, et al.

In cases of viral infections, the appropriate immune response helps to balance the level of pro-inflammatory substances and the cell recovery cycle. However, an exaggerated immune response is at the center of numerous problems such as organ damage and failure of vital functions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa, dos Santos Freitas, da Silva Martins &#x00026; de Carvalho Junior, 2020</xref>). It is easy to understand how the immune system is important, making a brief example. Individuals with clinical allergies have several imbalances in the immune system, in which case the immune system cannot accurately identify foreign bodies and therefore the immune response is compromised. In cases of people infected with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, the role of the immune system is evident. In these cases, as discussed in the previous topic, the immune response is so exaggerated that complex hyperinflammation is observed, in addition to serious side effects, such as hypercoagulation and multiple organ failure (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). As already highlighted in the previous topic, there are several polysaccharides that stimulate the immune system through indirect ways, mainly by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory substances. These polysaccharides are ideal for use in long-term immunity-enhancing therapies. However, these polysaccharides could not be used in patients with severe cases of COVID-19, as they could help to worsen the conditions of hyperinflammation. However, there are polysaccharides, which activate immunosuppression pathways, and could be used to stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory substances, which can be applied in the treatment of severe cases. From now on, we will take a targeted approach to the polysaccharides that activate the immunosuppression pathways.</p><p id="p0260">Inflammatory processes can start in many ways, however the endotoxin-mediated pathway (LPS) is the, but well elucidated. This is a molecule composed of two highly complex parts, one of lipid and the other of carbohydrate, a type of glucan. Endotoxin (LPS) molecules are present on the outer membrane of cells and are responsible for strong immune system responses in healthy organisms. Cells such as macrophages, B lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells, when they come into contact with an LPS, either by binding to the TLR4 receptor, or other, promote an inflammatory response such as fever, vasodilation due to the production of nitric oxide and secretion of eicosanoids (prostanoids, leukotrienes and lipoxins). Defense cells like macrophages are the most active in the immune system, although we have other defense cells, macrophages are usually cells, but agile when stimulated (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, considering macrophages as a study model, we can evaluate how the cycle of stimuli and responses that induces the defense system to produce an inflammatory response. Next, we will evaluate how polysaccharides manage to modulate an immunosuppressive response, controlling the flow of pro-inflammatory substances production and regulating the ways of maintaining the oxide-reducing balance.</p><p id="p0265">Extracellular stimuli lead to the activation of three pathways, namely the MAP Kinase pathway (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases), the MyD88 protein pathway and the direct pathway with mitochondria activation, both of which induce the production of inflammation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The MAPk activation pathway initiates the regulation of a series of biological processes, especially through the action of the kinase JNK, p38 and ERK 1/2. At the end, the signaling kinases activate the AP-1 protein (activator protein 1), responsible for the regulation of gene expression. The stimulus of the TRL4 receptor can activate the domain of the MyD88 protein, which in turn activates I&#x003ba;B kinase, an enzyme complex responsible for the propagation of the cellular response to inflammation (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). The IkB kinase complex induces a cascade of signal transduction mediated by phosphorylation processes until activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), a protein complex that performs functions as a transcription factor of genetic material and induction of protein synthesis. Finally, signaling of the direct pathway mediated by mitochondria can also occur, which initiates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), initiating an apoptosis cycle. On the other hand, the ROS pathway can also induce the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway, which has functions as a transcription factor for genetic material and induction of protein synthesis. Therefore, as already observed in case of serious infections by COVID-19, where the side effects of hyperinflation are clear, the inhibition of inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages or other cells of the immune system, must suppress or control the signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa, dos Santos Freitas, da Silva Martins &#x00026; de Carvalho Junior, 2020</xref>). All the mechanisms described can be seen in (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>

Especially the polysaccharides that have in their structure monomers of Gal, Glc, GalA and Rha, revealed potent anti-inflammatory activity in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. As highlighted earlier, the endotoxin-mediated pathway (LPS) is best elucidated in studies on the onset of inflammatory processes. Therefore, polysaccharides that block pro-inflammatory signaling pathways are essential as possible treatments for cases of COVID-19. For example, mixing three fractions of mannan-like polysaccharides isolated from wines inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;) and the mediator (NO) in RAW 264.7&#x000a0;cells stimulated with LPS (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">de Lacerda Bezerra et al., 2018</xref>). An isolated and purified fraction of polysaccharide obtained from the edible mushroom <italic>Phellinus linteus</italic> inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory substances in a cell and animal model. It was demonstrated based on the study directed by the LPS pathway that the polysaccharide fraction significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissues, and reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the MAPK pathway, as well as the translocations of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). In another study, conducted by <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Sousa et al.

It has been shown that the virus has a preference for airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages in the lung (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). When the virus attacks these cells, the cells immediately express the target receptor of the host of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS-CoV-2 uses the same input receptor, there is a reduction in the expression of ACE2 in lung cells. ECA2 reduction after a viral infection can result in dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system, influencing blood pressure, and electrolyte balance in the cell. Understanding the relationship between target cell interactions is important for the development of therapies.

Recent studies (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), show that polysaccharides can be used as cheap and efficient platforms in the development of vaccine formulations. We believe that more in-depth studies can be conducted to apply polysaccharides in the production of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="p0285">As of April 2020, 115 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates were being produced globally.

Now, during a COVID-19 pandemic, platforms for vaccine development have been the focus of numerous researches.

In a short time, the disease spread across the world through infected people, thus increasing the spread of the disease. The disease has caused major changes in the world's routine, isolating people in their homes, destabilizing the world economy, and increasing mortality rates worldwide. Also, serious problems with the collapse of hospital networks and the economy in different countries have increased social insecurity and contributed to the reduction of people's physical and mental health. The disease, although known in several aspects about its immunopathogenesis, biology, and forms of transmission, is not yet fully understood as to the conditions under which the virus subverts the immune response.</p><p id="p0315">Polysaccharides obtained from functional foods have interesting structural properties that contribute to a diversity of biological potentialities. The review showed that polysaccharides can modulate an immune response by various biochemical pathways. Also, these biopolymers can be found in natural and edible sources such as mushrooms, plants, algae, fruits, and other matrices. The potential of natural polysaccharides for disease prevention is clear, as demonstrated by several updated research reports. Foods rich in these biopolymers can be used safely since they have no toxic effects are biocompatible and biodegradable. In addition, polysaccharides obtained and purified from these food sources may be the key in the development of new drugs and immunity-boosting therapies.</p><p id="p0320">Although several studies, some well advanced, and research groups distributed around the world are committed to the development of vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the disease continues to progress exponentially worldwide. Thus, new ways of preventing and stimulating efficient immune responses must be tested. In this context, polysaccharides can play a crucial role. Based on several studies carried out in the last 5 years, we concluded that natural polysaccharides can be used as platforms for the production of vaccines, acting as coadjuvants, since they can easily bind to various cell receptors. Finally, we conclude that although the use of isolated polysaccharides is ideal due to bioavailability, we emphasize that the consumption of foods rich in biologically active polysaccharides is also useful. Even though the biological effects are not equivalent to those of the isolated polysaccharides, it can still help people to increase immunity, reducing the risk of a complicated clinical condition if
