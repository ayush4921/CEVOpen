<p id="p0100">The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then a loopful (10 μl) of the cultures of each of the specimens of microorganisms was streaked onto agar plates. The streaked plates were incubated aerobically at 37 °C and inspected after 24 h to measure MIC. Then the growth of the bacterial cells was assessed as partial or total inhibition and recorded for each strain. The minimum inhibitory concentration was considered to be the lowest honey concentration at which bacterial growth was totally inhibited. The testing was repeated three times for each strain at each concentration level. The average value for the minimum inhibitory concentration was taken from the three replicates for each strain for each concentration level.</p>
