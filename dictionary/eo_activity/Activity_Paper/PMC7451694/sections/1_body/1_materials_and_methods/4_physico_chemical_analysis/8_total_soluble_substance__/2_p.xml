<p id="p0075">The TSS as 
 <sup>o</sup>Brix was determined through measuring, the total soluble substances in the honeys using a refractometer (Atago, No. 3840, Japan). During testing some honey drops were smeared on the prism of the refractometer and a reading was made directly from the scale. For the values above or below the standard temperature of 20 °C were corrected through adding or subtracting 0.00023/
 <sup>0</sup>C as correction factor. The results were expressed in 
 <sup>o</sup>Brix as total soluble substance (%) = 100 – % moisture content).
