<p id="p0140">Moreover, the same 
 <italic>V. amygdalina, C. macrostachyes, Eucalyptus globules</italic> and 
 <italic>B. grandiflorum</italic> honeys have showed relatively strong antimicrobial properties in inhibiting the growth of the tested gram positive bacteria at an average of 14.9 ± 0.72, 16.7 ± 0.86, 22.5 ± 0.9 &amp; 22.5 ± 0.76 MIC (% v/v) respectively. Among the gram positive bacteria,

 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic> become more susceptible to 
 <italic>C. macrostachys</italic> and 
 <italic>V. amygdalina,</italic> honeys at 10.5 ± 0.9 and 10.5 ± 0.5 MIC (% v/v) respectively. The MIC results of the current study were closer to the findings of 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Mullai and Menon (2007)</xref> who reported MIC of 11–20% v/v for isolates of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> Moreover, most of the current study results were within the MIC range of 10–25% v/v reported for the antimicrobial properties of Argentina honeys against different gram positive and gram negative bacteria [(
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Isla et al., 2011</xref>). However, the MIC of the current study results were relatively higher from the findings of 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Suarez et al. (2010b)</xref> who reported MIC 2.5–10.4%v/v for gram positive bacteria and 7.2–16% v/v for gram negative bacteria for Cuban mono-floral honeys. Moreover, the MIC values of the current results were higher than the report of Andargachew et al. (2004) who recorded MIC (6.25% and 7.5% v/v) activities of honeys against some human pathogens: 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> respectively. Moreover, 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Sherlock et al. (2010)</xref> reported MIC of 6.3% and 12.5% v/v for Ulmo (Chile) and Manuka honeys respectively. The variations among results could be due to the qualities, freshness and the botanical and geographical sources of the honeys. The existences of large variation in the antimicrobial properties of natural honeys due to their spatial and temporal variations in sources of nectar is well documented (
