 <italic>V. amygdalina, C. macrostachyes, E. globules</italic> and 
 <italic>B. grandiflorum</italic> showed relatively stronger antimicrobial potencies compered to others. These could be due to the medicinal properties of the plants and the presence of some floral specific bioactive substances in their honeys. In this regard, besides the widely utilization of the different parts of the above plants in traditional medicines, the strong antimicrobial properties of the different parts of the plants have been well documented. For instance: the medicinal potentials of 
 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic> leaves, barks, stem and fruits for treatment of wider range of human and animal diseases and aliments (

 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic> extracts against wide range of human pathogens (2010;
