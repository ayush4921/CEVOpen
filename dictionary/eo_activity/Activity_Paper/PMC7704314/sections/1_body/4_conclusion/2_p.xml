<p>Different lineages of angiosperms produce useful metabolites for treating tropical diseases. In this study, it was shown that different species belonging to the Magnoliids — a basal group within the flowering plants — and the rest, which belongs to much more recent lineages, are endowed with molecules that can control tropical parasites. This is evident that the molecules of interest for controlling these diseases are widely distributed in the lineages of flowering plants.</p>
