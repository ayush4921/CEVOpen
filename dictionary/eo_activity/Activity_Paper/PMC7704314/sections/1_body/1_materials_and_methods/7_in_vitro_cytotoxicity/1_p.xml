<p>The cytotoxic activity of extracts was assessed based on the viability of the human promonocytic cell line U937 (ATCC CRL-1593.2) evaluated using the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay following the methodology described previously [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, cells were grown in 96-well cell-culture dishes at a concentration of 100,000 cells/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the corresponding concentrations of the extracts, starting at 200 μg/mL in duplicate. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 72 h in the presence of the extracts and then the effect of the extracts was determined by adding 10 μL/well of MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL) and incubating at 37°C for 3 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μL/well of 50% isopropanol solution with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and incubating for 30 min. Cell viability was determined based on the quantity of formazan produced according to the color intensity (absorbance) — registered as optical density (O.D) — obtained at 570 nm in a Varioskan LUX multimode microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Francisco, CA, USA). Cultured cells in the absence of the extracts were used as control of viability (negative control), while doxorubicin was used as a positive control for toxicity. The cytotoxicity of two conventional drugs (meglumine antimoniate and Amphotericin B) was also determined. Assays were conducted in duplicates with three replicates per concentration tested.
