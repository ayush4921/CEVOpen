<p>Fresh plant materials were cleaned by distilled water and then dried under the outdoor shady conditions, finally, at roughly 75°C for 48 h in an electro- thermostatic blast oven (Bluepard Instruments CO., LTD, Shanghai, China). Materials were then powdered by the pulverizer and filtered through a 40-mesh screen. 1g dried sample was separately extracted with 25 mL of 60% ethanol for 2 h at 50°C in the polyscience. Ultrasound-assisted extraction was performed for 20 min. The extraction process was repeated twice. The mixture was then filtered via a vacuum suction filter pump and the extract solutions were collected. The extract solution was measured at 8 mL and was extracted twice with 8 mL petroleum ether, and then the residue solution was extracted with dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol, respectively. Each fraction was concentrated to dryness by evaporation on a rotary evaporator and dissolved with 1 mL ethanol, respectively. Before testing, the solutions were filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Samples were then prepared for HPLC analysis.</p>
