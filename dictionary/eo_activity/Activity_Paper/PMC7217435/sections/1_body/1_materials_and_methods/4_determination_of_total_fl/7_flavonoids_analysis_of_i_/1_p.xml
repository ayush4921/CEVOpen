<p>Lastly, an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to perform the chromatographic separation. The system was equipped with an abinary pump, amicrodegasser, Hi-performance well-plateauto sampler, thermostated column compartment, and diode-array detector (DAD). The UV Spectrum was recorded between 190â€“400 nm; the UV detector was set at 254 nm. SHISEIDO MG-C18 (1003.3 mm; i.d. 3.0 mm) column using a gradient elution [methanol (A)/ water (0.1% HCOOH)(B)] was chosen. All of the MS experiments were conducted on an Agilent 6220 Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (TOF) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Agilent Technologies, USA).</p>
