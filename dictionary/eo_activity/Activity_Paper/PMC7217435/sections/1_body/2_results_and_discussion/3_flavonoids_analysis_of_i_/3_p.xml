<p>Flavonoid content of Isoetaceae was poorly known but appears to contain mainly flavone, apigenin, luteolin, chrysoeriol, selgin, tricin, and isoetin (as the 5'-glucoside), which had been reported in other species of

 <italic>sinensis</italic> as well. Flavones and flavonols were the main flavonoids in most species from filicinae [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Flavones, flavonols, flavanones, aurones, and dihydrochalcones were the main flavonoids in bryophytes [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The dihydrochalcones observed in this study suggested that Isoetaceae and bryophytes may be phylogenetically similar.
