<p>With the increasing of the concentration, the DPPH free radical scavenging potential observably increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232185.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Roughly 111.9 μL of the extracts could scavenge about 50% of the free radicals. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of DPPH scavenging activity was recorded as 4.8 mg/μL, 10 mg/μL extracts could scavenge 100% DPPH free radicals.
