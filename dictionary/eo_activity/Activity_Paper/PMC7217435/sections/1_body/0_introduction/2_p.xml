 <italic>Isoetes</italic> are considered rare living fossils. With the rapid development of the economy resulting in habitat degradation, wild populations have declined dramatically. Thus far, resource utilization of 
 <italic>Isoetes</italic> has yet to be reported, especially for the specific species, 
 <italic>Isoetes sinensis</italic> Palmer. 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> was a common species in the wetlands of An’hui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Provinces before 1980. In the last 20 years, this species has all but disappeared [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to this dramatic decline, 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> has been considered a critically endangered, first-class protected plant in China since 1999 [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Fortunately, our lab has propagated tens of thousands of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> by way of creative spore propagation, which has allowed for the development of 
 <italic>Isoetes</italic> and its continued use in present and future research.
