<p id="Par21">To account for the time needed to accumulate sufficient data as justification for an introduction or discontinuation, we calculated the probability of introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs within 5 and 10 years after authorisation, using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. The cut-offs of 5 and 10 years are of particular interest, since MAs in the EU have initial duration of 5 years, after which the MA may be renewed with unlimited validity following a re-examination of the benefit–risk balance. Additionally, 10 years is the duration of market protection for innovative medicines.</p>
