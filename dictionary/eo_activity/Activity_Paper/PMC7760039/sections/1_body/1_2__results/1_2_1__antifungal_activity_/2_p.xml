<p>Application of individual extracts from 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> demonstrated poor (&lt;50% inhibition) antifungal activity against both 
 <italic>F. subglutinans</italic> and 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> ethyl acetate extract appeared to show a synergistic activity with 67% inhibition against 
 <italic>F. subglutinans</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, a combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extracts showed strong, synergistic antifungal activity (96% inhibition) against 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>. Notably, this activity was significantly higher than that of amphotericin B used as a positive control (
