<p>The previous study had shown that combining extracts from different plant species improved antifungal potency in vitro through synergistic and additive interactions, as compared to their individual application [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the current study, a combined application of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract also showed improved antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, which was 15 and 7 times stronger when compared to the individual application of 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> and 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>, respectively. This combined extract also showed improved activity against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> and 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. Nonetheless, a combined ethyl acetate extract from the same plant species (
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> and 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>) demonstrated reduced activity against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> whereas an improved activity was demonstrated against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. The combined acetone extract of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> exhibited an improved antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. chlamydosporum</italic>. An improvement in the antifungal activity of combined extracts may be due to an increased concentration of antifungal compounds at the inhibition sites on the pathogen. It may also be due to the formation of different chemical constituents with different modes of action. However, not all combined extracts demonstrated an improved activity.
