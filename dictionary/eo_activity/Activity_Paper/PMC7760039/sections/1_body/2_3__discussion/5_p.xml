<p>Notably, solvent polarity plays an important role in the antifungal activity of medicinal plant extracts. For example, the leaf ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> was effective (â‰¥50% inhibition) in inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. In contrast, acetone extract from 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> was not active against both 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. Similarly, the leaf acetone extract of 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> was very effective in inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, while its ethyl acetate extract was ineffective against the same pathogen. The difference in the antifungal activity of acetone and ethyl acetate extracts from the same plant species was also observed with 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. subglutinans</italic>, 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. Acetone is slightly more polar than ethyl acetate [

Medicinal plants contain a wide variety of secondary metabolites including tannins, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins and other chemical constituents [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The polarity of the constituent metabolites differs significantly and has influence on their solubility during extraction and thereafter the antifungal activity of the extracts.
