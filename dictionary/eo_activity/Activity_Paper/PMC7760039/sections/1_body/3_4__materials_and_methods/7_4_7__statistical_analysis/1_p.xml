<p>The data was analysed using STATISTICA-8 software. The difference between the treatments for each parameter was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data were expressed as mean ± standard error. Where a statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) was established, means separation was done using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The difference in growth parameter between negative control and plant extract in the seedling phytotoxicity experiment was analysed using Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).
