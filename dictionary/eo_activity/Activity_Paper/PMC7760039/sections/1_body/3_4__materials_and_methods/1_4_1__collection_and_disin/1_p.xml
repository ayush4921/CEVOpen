<p>White maize seeds were obtained from smallholder farmers at Moletjie, ga-Maleka, in Limpopo Province of South Africa. The seeds were collected two weeks after harvest and were visually examined for spoilage, and mechanical and weevil damage. Disinfection of the seeds was achieved by soaking them in bleach (3.5% sodium hypochlorite) for 10 min, followed by rinsing several times with sterilized water and then spraying with 70% ethanol. Thereafter, they were air-dried aseptically in a bio-safety cabinet.</p>
