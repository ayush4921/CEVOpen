<p>Fresh green leaves (about 5.0 kg) were collected into brown paper bags and shade dried immediately at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). Dried material was grinded into fine powder using a pulveriser (Fritsch Pulverisette 14, Labotec, South Africa) and stored in brown paper bags at room temperature until extraction. Extraction was initiated by adding 100 g of dried powder into an Erlenmeyer flask, followed by addition of 1000 mL solvent. The extraction was done in an ultrasonic bath (Branson, 5510E-MT, Lasec, South Africa) for an hour. The material was extracted separately with each of the three different solvents (water, ethyl acetate and acetone) as previously described by Seepe et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The plant material/solvent mixture was filtered through Whatman No.1 filter paper. The residue was re-extracted with equivalent volume of solvent. Ethyl acetate and acetone extracts were separately concentrated using rotary evaporators (Stuart, RE300DB, Lasec, South Africa) and air-dried further in a fume hood. Water extracts were freeze-dried (Sentry 2.0 VirTis SP scientific, United Scientific, Johannesburg, South Africa). All the dried extracts were kept in airtight containers in the dark at room temperature.
