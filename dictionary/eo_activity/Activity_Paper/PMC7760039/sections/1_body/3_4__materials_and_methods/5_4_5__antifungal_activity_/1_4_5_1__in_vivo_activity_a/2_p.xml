<p>The experiment was repeated twice and each treatment was replicated thrice for every fungal pathogen. Amphotericin B
 <sup>®</sup> antibiotic (Phytotek Lab, Pretoria, South Africa) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL was used as a positive control. Ten percent aqueous acetone (used to dissolve the dried plant extracts) was included as a negative control. A mixture of seeds and plant extract was included for each treatment and was used for colour or turbidity correction. The jars were sealed and incubated at 27 °C for four days. After incubation period, 20 mL of sterile water was added to each jar and shaken for one minute. The treatments were filtered through cheesecloths and their absorbance measured at 700 nm using Specord 210 spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). Antifungal activity of the extracts was recorded as percentage inhibition of fungal growth, calculated from the absorbance readings of the control and treatment using the following equation:
