  <p>Percentage disease discoloration caused by 
   <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> spores/mL) inoculated on maize seedlings grown in a greenhouse. Plant compounds were extracted in AC: Acetone. The extracts were produced from 
   <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic>, 
   <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> and used as combined at a concentration of 2.5 mg dried extract/mL of 10% aqueous acetone. Commercial fungicide (Efekto-Virikop
   <sup>®</sup>, Efekto, Johannesburg, South Africa) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL was used as a positive control and water was used as a negative control. There were 10 replicates per treatment, each comprising one maize seedling per pot, and the experiment was conducted once. Bars bearing different letters indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), as determined by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test.
