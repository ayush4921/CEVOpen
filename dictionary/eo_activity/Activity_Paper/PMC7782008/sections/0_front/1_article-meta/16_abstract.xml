 <p>We reported the complete chloroplast genome sequences of 
  <italic>Rhus potaninii</italic> which was characterized by 
  <italic>de novo</italic> assembly with Illumina sequencing data. The size of 
  <italic>R. potaninii</italic> complete chloroplast genome is 159,620 bp in length and includes a large single copy region of 87,722 bp, a small single copy region of 18,948 bp, and a pair of inverted repeats of 26,475 bp. Its GC content is 37.9%. A total of 133 genes were predicted, including 86 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 2 pseudogenes. Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree indicates that 
  <italic>R. potaninii</italic> is sister to 
  <italic>R. chinensis</italic>.
