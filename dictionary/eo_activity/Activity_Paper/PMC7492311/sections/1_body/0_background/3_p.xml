<p id="Par6">The endogenous circadian clock, which controls daily rhythmic output processes, is maintained in constant laboratory conditions with a period of approximately 24 h in almost all phyla—from microorganisms to humans (Aschoff

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1993</xref>) under a light–dark cycle drive the rhythm or timing of varied biological activities—from bioluminescence, enzyme activities, and phototactic movements in unicellular algae (Balzer and Hardeland

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1993</xref>; Foulkes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1997</xref>). Other than that in vertebrates, melatonin was first discovered in unicellular photosynthetic marine algae (Poeggeler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1991</xref>) and then in plant species, such as some edible plants (Dubbels et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1995</xref>) and medicinal herbs (Murch et al.
