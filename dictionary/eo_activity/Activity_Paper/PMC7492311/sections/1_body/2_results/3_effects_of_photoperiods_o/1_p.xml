<p id="Par15">The influence of different photoperiods on the melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L. leaves was also investigated. The highest melatonin concentration (approximately 120 μg/g FW) was found at ZT6 under long-day conditions (18-h light:6-h darkness), whereas the lowest melatonin concentration (&lt; 20 μg/g FW) was found under short-day conditions (10-h light:14-h dark; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Thus, melatonin concentration is the highest under summer day conditions.
