<p id="Par24">The temperate areas worldwide feature approximately 450 species of 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> (Robson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2003</xref>). Nevertheless, 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L. remains the most widely used medicinal herb in the 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> genus for academia and industry thus far, owing to its evidence-based therapeutic effects against depression and other potential uses (Schempp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2002</xref>; Pasqua et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>; Ernst 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>; Deng 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>). Melatonin is more abundant in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> than in most of the other plants (Murch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1997</xref>; Murch and Saxena 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>; Erland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>) and is involved in many integrative physiological processes, including possible protection against stress (Tan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>), photoperiodic response, and the circadian system. Notably, the melatonin concentrations of two species in our 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> collection, namely 
 <italic>H. kouytchense</italic> Lev. and 
 <italic>H. coris</italic> L., were twice that in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L.
