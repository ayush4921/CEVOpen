<p>D. T. H. Castro et al. investigated antimelanoma effects of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Senna velutina</italic> roots shown to contain flavonoid derivatives of the catechin, anthraquinone, and piceatannol groups. B16F10-Nex2 murine cell line was used for the assessment of extract's effects. Results showed that the extract induced apoptotic cell death followed by caspase-3 activation and increased intracellular calcium and ROS levels. Tumor volume and pulmonary metastasis were followed after subcutaneous implantation of B16F10-Nex2 cells in the lumbosacral region of C57Bl/6 mice. Importantly, it was shown that both the primary tumor volume and the number of pulmonary nodules decreased over 50% when this ethanolic extract was applied.
