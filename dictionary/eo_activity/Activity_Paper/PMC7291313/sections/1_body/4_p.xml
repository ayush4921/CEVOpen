<p>Another review article by P. Aiello et al. comprehensively investigates medicinal plants in the prevention and treatment of colon cancer. Their study revealed that grape, soybean, green tea, garlic, olive, and pomegranate are the most effective plants against colon cancer. Diverse in vitro and in vivo models provided evidence that fruits, seeds, leaves, and roots of these plants are abundant in saponins, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, alkaloids, polyphenol glycosides, including flavonoids, and simple phenols, such as caffeic acid, catechins, quercetin and luteolin, and kaempferol and luteolin glycosides. These natural compounds exert various effects such as induction of superoxide dismutase, reduction of DNA oxidation, cell cycle arrest in S phase, suppression of prosurvival signaling pathways and cell invasion, reduction of antiapoptotic and increase of proapoptotic factors, and decrease of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and cyclin E.</p>
