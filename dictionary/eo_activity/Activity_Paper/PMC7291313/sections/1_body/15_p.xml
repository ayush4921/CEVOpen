<p>B. Yang et al. demonstrated that tetramethylpyrazine, an alkaloid extracted from the roots of 
 <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong</italic> Hort, can overcome doxorubicin-induced endothelian toxicity. To that end, the authors used vascular endothelium injury models in mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells and showed that tetramethylpyrazine protects the vascular endothelium against doxorubicin-induced injury via upregulating 14-3-3
 <italic>Î³</italic> expression, promoting translocation of Bcl-2 to the mitochondria, closing mitochondria permeability transition pore, maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppressing oxidative stress.
