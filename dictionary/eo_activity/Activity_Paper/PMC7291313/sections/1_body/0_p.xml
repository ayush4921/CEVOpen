<p>Nature is an inexhaustible reservoir of compounds with healing properties, and people used natural products to treat different medical conditions from ancient times. One of the main features of natural products is their ability to modulate directly and indirectly oxidative stress and protect human cells from aging and death [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Besides aging, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and neurodegeneration, cancer can be considered as an oxidative stress-related disease [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, natural products are also valuable for treating cancer. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which leads to oxidative stress and provokes inflammation eventually may cause carcinogenesis or stimulate cancer progression and metastatic behavior [

Despite still preserved indigenous knowledge about plants and other organisms with medicinal value, clinical development of natural preparations (both compounds and extracts) is difficult and slow. However, some of the most exploited chemotherapeutics have natural origin such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel [
