<p>Berberine, as an isoquinoline alkaloid, is found in various plants, especially in Berberis (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). This natural compound has numerous pharmacological effects (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), such as anti-fungal (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), anti-convulsant (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), anti-tumor (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), anti-viral (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), anti-inflammatory (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), reduction of ischemic brain damage (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), and anti-oxidative activities (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Also, different studies have reported its neuroprotective effects against neurological diseases, such as anxiety, brain stroke, mental depression, and AD (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Pharmacokinetic properties have revealed that berberine rapidly passes through the blood brain barrier, while slowly eliminating (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Sadeghnia 
 <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the protective effect of berberine (50–1000 µM) against glutamate excitotoxicity in PC12 and N2a cells. It was found that berberine reduced ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), DNA fragmentation, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Also, berberine attenuated the level of caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In agreement with their results, Lin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that berberine prevented glutamate release from rat’s cortical synaptosomes by the inhibition of presynaptic Cav2.1 channels and the ERK/synapsin I signaling pathway (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study has shown that berberine (25 μg/ml) improved viability, axonal outgrowth, and transport in calyculin A-injured N2a cells. The neuroprotective effect of this compound was related to anti-oxidant activity, decreasing of MDA, increasing of SOD, and inhibiting the hyper-phosphorylation of Tau protein, and neurofilaments (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Besides, berberine possesses neuroprotective effects through anti-oxidant defense stimulation, oxygen consumption inhibition, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) elevation (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that berberine has shown important memory improvement activities with several mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloid, anti-oxidant, and cholinesterase inhibitory activities (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Based on these findings, berberine could be a useful agent to improve AD and PD by modulating oxidative stress (
