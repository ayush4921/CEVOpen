<p>Huperzine A, a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alkaloid found in 
 <italic>Huperzia serrata</italic>, has been investigated as a promising treatment for neurological conditions such as AD. The protective effects of huperzine A against oxidative glutamate toxicity in mouse-derived hippocampal HT22 cells were evaluated to explore its probable mechanisms. It was shown that huperzine A attenuated oxidative glutamate excitotoxicity in murine hippocampal HT22 cells via activating the BDNF/TrkB-dependent PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (
