  <p>Glutamatergic transmission in the brain. Because of the high release of glutamate from the presynaptic axon, the glutamate receptor (mainly NMDA) is activated, and the raised levels of Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> are gathered in the mitochondria. Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> overload results in mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial changes as higher ROS development, adjusted redox potential, and the release of apoptotic mediators, and ATP synthesis failure can promote modified cellular homeostasis causing swelling and cellular disturbance
