<p>According to the heat map and HCA shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> along with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, 
 <italic>A. dahurica, F. albopurpurea,</italic> and 
 <italic>T. indica</italic> exerted potent activity against MCF-7 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> less than 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and SI more than 6. 
 <italic>M. siamensis</italic> exerted potent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 with SI more than 2. The results indicated that these extracts might have particularly beneficial effects for use in breast cancer treatment and prevention. 
 <italic>A. galanga, P. amarus,</italic> and 
 <italic>L. striatum</italic> exerted moderate cytotoxicity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) against all tested cancer cells with low toxicity to normal cells (SI &gt; 2). 
 <italic>H. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. vugare</italic> also selectively exerted mild to moderate cytotoxicity against the cancer cells.
