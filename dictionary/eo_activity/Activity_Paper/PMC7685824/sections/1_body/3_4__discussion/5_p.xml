 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> showed the highest content of flavonoids; however, it exerted mild cytotoxicity to all tested cancer cells indicating that the flavonoids in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>aromatica</italic> were not related to cytotoxicity against the cancer cells. Major chemical constituents found in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>aromatica</italic> were volatile terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and curcuminoids. These compounds may react with the chemicals used in the total flavonoid assay leading to the overestimation of the values [
