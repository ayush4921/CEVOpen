<p id="p0245">According to (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Onabanjo et al., 1991</xref>), methanol extract of 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> has proven analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, while same was reported for 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ibironke and Ajiboye, 2007</xref>). These attributes informed the selection of these plant species for the design of herbal formulations to be used in the management of pain and inflammation in this research. In confirming their activities, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> analgesic and anti-inflammatory screening of the methanol extracts was first carried out. The two plant extracts were tested for their inhibition against COX-2, PGE-2, TNF α and IL-10 and standard drug diclofenac was used as positive control. The plant extracts were tested at different concentrations of 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/mL as presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activities of the two extracts showed a dose dependent increase in percentage inhibition of expression of COX-2 enzymes, production of PGE-2 mediators, TNF α and IL-10 inflammatory cytokines activities tested. At 80 mg/mL, 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> extract showed highest inhibitory activities of 9.21, 57.32, 70.40 and 75.14% for IL-10, PGE-2, COX-2 and TNF α respectively. While 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> extract at 80 mg/mL, showed highest inhibitory activities of 5.06, 46.42, 56.50 and 72.10% for IL-10, PGE-2, TNF α and COX-2 respectively. The two extracts activities were compared with 5 mg/mL of standard drug diclofenac which showed 14.83, 52.33, 61.73 and 85.50% inhibitory activities against IL-10, PGE-2, TNF α and COX-2 respectively.
