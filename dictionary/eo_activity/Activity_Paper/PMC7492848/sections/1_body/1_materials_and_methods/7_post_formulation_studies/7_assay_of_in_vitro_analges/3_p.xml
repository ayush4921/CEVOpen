<p id="p0140">IL-10 Human Elisa Kit, COX-2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), PGE-2, and TNF-α EIA kit were used to measure the %Inhibition of IL-10, COX-2, PGE-2 and TNF-α respectively by the herbal gels and diclofenac gel control following the manufacturers’ instructions. A target-specific antibody had been pre-coated in the wells of the supplied microplate to which the target chemokine, the prepared sample and reaction buffer were added. The solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min after which the reaction was stopped by adding HCl, the plates were washed, the reagent to precipitate the colorimetrically assayed reaction was added and absorbance was taken spectrophotometrically at 412 nm, using the negative control in which the solvent (DMSO) was used as blank sample. The %Inhibition was calculated and recorded.</p>
