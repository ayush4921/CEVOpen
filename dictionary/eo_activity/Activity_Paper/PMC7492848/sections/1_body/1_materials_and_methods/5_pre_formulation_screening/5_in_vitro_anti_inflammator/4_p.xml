<p id="p0100">Enzymes immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was used to study the inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> extracts against Human Recombinant COX-2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction buffer solution (960 μL) containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 2 mM phenol; COX-2 enzymes (10 μL) in the presence of heme (10 μL) with 10 μL of the prepared extract solutions was added to the wells. The solutions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, 10 μL of arachidonic acid (AA) solution was added, and then the COX--2 reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 1 M HCl. The plate was washed to remove any unbound reagents and Ellman's reagent was added to the well. The distinct yellow colour obtained as a result of the enzymatic reaction was determined spectrophotometrically using a microtiter plate reader at a wavelength of 412 nm. The percentage inhibition (% inhibition) was obtained by comparison with the absorbance obtained from the blank/negative control. The procedure was repeated using TNF-α, IL-10 and PGE-2 ELISA kits respectively and the % inhibition of COX-2, TNF-α, IL-10 and PGE-2 by each prepared extract was calculated.
