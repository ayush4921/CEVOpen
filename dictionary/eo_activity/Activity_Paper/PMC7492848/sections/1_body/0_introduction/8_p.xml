 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2016</xref>). Another report on the toxicity of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> leaves, showed that no animals from either acute or sub chronic trial exhibited any signs of toxicity; however, slight hepatotoxic lesions in the rats were produced (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2014</xref>). An earlier report opined that for 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic>, dose corresponding to 120 g wet weight kg
 <sup>−1</sup> did not produce acute toxicity or lethality in mice, which suggested its safety when taken orally (
