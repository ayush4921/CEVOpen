The PC12 cells were cultured in collagen-coated plates or flasks containing 85% RPMI-1640 medium, augmented with 25 mM HEPES buffer, horse serum 10% heat inactivated, fetal bovine serum 5% heat inactivated, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 g/l d- (+) -glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 μg/ml streptomycin and 25 U/ml penicillin (all Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., USA). The cells were preserved in a humidified incubator at 37°C at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and the medium was changed every 48 h. The effects of pectolinarin on cell survival of the PC12 cells were made using an MTT kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Color development was observed at 595 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm using the Sunrise™ microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland).
