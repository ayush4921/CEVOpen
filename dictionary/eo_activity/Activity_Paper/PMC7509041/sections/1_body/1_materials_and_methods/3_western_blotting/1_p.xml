<p>Immunoblotting was carried out according to the standard procedure. The PC12 cells treated with pectolinarin were dissolute by the addition of SDS sample buffer [62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, 125 mM DTT, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue] and parted by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were moved to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was developed with the main antibodies. The rabbit anti-eIF2α antibody, eIF2α-P antibody and goat anti-actin antibody were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA. The mouse anti-ATF6 antibody was acquired from Novus Biologicals, LLC, USA. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Goat anti-actin antibody was used to systematize the quantity of sample proteins. The blots were developed by utilizing an upgraded chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham, Sweden). The experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the protein bands were defined employing Image J software (version 1.48;
