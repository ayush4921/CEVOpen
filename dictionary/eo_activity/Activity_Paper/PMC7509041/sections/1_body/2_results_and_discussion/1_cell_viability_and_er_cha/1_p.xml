<p>Pectolinarin is a representative component of flavonoid mixtures isolated from 
 <italic>Cirsium nipponicum</italic> (Maxim.) Makino (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It has anti-inflammatory activities and is similar in chemical structure to linarin (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It is well-known that one of the remarkable features of cellular injury is leakage of soluble lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the cells stimulated by any stimulant. As a result of assaying, pectolinarin did not induce LDH leakage, so it was proven not to cause cellular injury within a certain concentration (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to examine various neuronal diseases (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). At the beginning of this study, we tested the effects of pectolinarin on cell viability in the MTT assay following at 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μg/ml of pectolinarin treatment for 24 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, the result of the MTT assay has shown that no morphological differences were shown at concentrations below 100 μg/ml pectolinarin treatment and control cells were observed.
