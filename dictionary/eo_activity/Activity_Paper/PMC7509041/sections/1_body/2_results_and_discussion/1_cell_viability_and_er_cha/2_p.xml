<p>The endoplasmic reticulum which has newly-synthesized secretory and cell membrane proteins are post-translationally modified and correctly folded. Protein modification and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum are impaired by the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones, such as BiP, GRP94, calnexin, calreticulin, ERp29 and PDI. One of the most abundant endoplasmic reticulum chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen is BiP, a member of the Hsp70 family of proteins, which perceives newly synthesized proteins as they are transferred in the endoplasmic reticulum and sustains them in a state of competent for following folding and oligomerization. Like BiP, each endoplasmic reticulum chaperone exerts a unique function in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen to complete the correct protein folding (

Although the effect of pectolinarin on cell viability was not confirmed in the MTT assay, the expression of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones (PDI, BiP, calnexin and ERp29) which indicate the degree of cell stress, was examined by pectolinarin treatment in the PC12 cells. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, notable endoplasmic reticulum chaperone expression was not observed in the PC12 cells treated with pectolinarin. In summary, no remarkable cell viability and endoplasmic reticulum chaperone expression were observed by pectolinarin treatment on the PC 12 cells.
