<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle spotted in eukaryotic cells. It is a very important manufacturing site for the post-translational step that mediates the synthesis, folding, modification and transport of secretory proteins. Some kinds of stressors that disrupt the endoplasmic reticulum function lead to accumulation of un-, mis-, misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (

Though this study did not fully document the specific significance of endoplasmic reticulum stress protein expression, it demonstrated that pectolinarin controls the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors associated with apoptosis using the PC12 cells, which is widely used as a classical neuronal cell model.
