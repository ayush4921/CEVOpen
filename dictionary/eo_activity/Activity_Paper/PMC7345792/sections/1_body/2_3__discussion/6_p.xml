<p>This study shows another interesting result related to helminth infection and protozoal infection. According to the Karen lifestyles and limitations to access local health centers, it was expected that the Karen would have several plants with high CI values for treatments related to these infectious types. Only 
 <italic>Embelia sessiliflora</italic> had a high CI value. However, in total, the Karen had 33 species (26% of all useful species) used for protozoal infections and 28 species (22%) for helminth worm infection (

It is possible that many plants, but non-specific species, have potential as treatments, which leads to the use of a variety of plants for treatments. In addition, the study found that each village in Thailand has unique ethnomedicinal knowledge [
