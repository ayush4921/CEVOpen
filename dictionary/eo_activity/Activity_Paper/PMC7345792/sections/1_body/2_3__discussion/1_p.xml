<p>Our database for the treatment of infectious diseases is the largest for Thailand, and possibly in general, in terms of the number of studied villages. Excluding the number of reports for fever treatments, our study covers more plant species used for treating infectious diseases in Thailand than previous studies. We have shown that 59 plant families were found to have species that were used in treatment of infectious diseases, but only a few of them covered the overwhelming majority of uses. This was especially true for Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, Lauraceae, Apocynaceae, Menispermaceae, and Lamiaceae, some of which were used to treat multiple kinds of infectious diseases. These same plant families are known for their many medicinal uses in Thailand [
