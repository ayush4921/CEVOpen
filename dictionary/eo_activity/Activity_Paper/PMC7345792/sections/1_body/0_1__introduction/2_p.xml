<p>From an evolutionary perspective, we now face serious health problems caused by antibiotic-resistant strains of for example 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is expected that in this century infectious diseases will cause more deaths than it did in the past because of the rapid growth of the world population, which is predicted to reach eight billion, of which more than half will live in crowded areas [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nowadays, cheaper air transportation allows more than 100,000 people to fly on regional and global routes each day, which contributes to spreading diseases. Microorganisms move rapidly under warm conditions. By 2050, it is expected that approximately 50% of the world’s population, including 60% of the world’s children, will reside in the tropics [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-09-00298" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most tropical regions have poor developing countries with inadequate medical and public health care systems. Consequently, the mortality due to infections will be very high in those areas. Infectious diseases also make a considerable impact on the economy and the environment. The Avian Influenza or bird flu, caused by the virus H5N1 in 2004, caused the death of 12 percent of all domestic birds in Vietnam; many of them were deliberately killed to prevent the disease from spreading. Globally, approximately 0.2% of laborers in the poultry sector lost their jobs. In 2006, it was estimated that the global economic impact of this influenza was over $1.5 trillion corresponding to more than 3% of the world’s GDP. Therefore, in the near future, alternative and more powerful medicines will be needed to cure existing and new infectious diseases.
