<p>In the 16 references, that covered 25 Karen villages, we found 185 reports of plants, which included 127 species in 59 plant families, used to treat infectious diseases. Most reports mentioned uses for treatments of protozoal (23%), bacterial (20%), helminth worm (19%), and viral (16%) infections. There were also 16 reports of uses for fungal infection, and nine reports for small animal infestation (

Seven plant families had high total CI values (Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, Lauraceae, Apocynaceae, Menispermaceae, Lamiaceae), but only few of them had high CI values for each infection type. Apocynaceae was the most used family for the treatment of protozoal infections. Leguminosae was the top ranked family for treatments of bacterial, helminth worms, and fungal infections, and it was also important for treating small animal infestations. Lauraceae had the highest CI value for viral infection. Other families, e.g., Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, and Menispermaceae, had high CI values for treatments of various infection types (
