<p id="p0095">The extracts of all tested plant species (
 <italic>M. oleifera, A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. sativum</italic>) retained their antibacterial activities after 30 min of heat treatment at 45 °C against all test pathogen. The data showed that some of the plant crude extracts were more resistant to heat treatment and shows antibacterial activities regardless of time of exposure than others as from the result. According to (
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Ginovyan, 2017</xref>) some of the plant crude extracts retained their antimicrobial activity even after 121 °C heat exposures. This was indicated by methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera and L. sativum</italic>, persist there antibacterial activities against all tested pathogen after exposure for 60 min at temperature of 50  °C except crude extracts of 
 <italic>L. sativum</italic> against 
 <italic>Sh. Boydii</italic>. However, almost all aqueous extracts of plant material lost their antibacterial activities against after just 60 min of exposure to 50 °C except aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> which retain its antibacterial activities against Sal. Typhi, 
 <italic>Stp.aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Str.agalactiae</italic>. Similarly, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. sativum</italic> lost its antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Sh. boydii</italic> after 60 min of exposure to 50 °C, while aqueous extracts 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> lost its activities against all test pathogens after 60 min of exposure to 50 °C. The result was observed the same result for the control experiments as in non-heat treated plant material in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Aqueous solution used as negative control was not shown antimicrobial activities while Amoxicillin which used as positive control was shown the highest antibacterial activities against all tested pathogenic bacteria.
