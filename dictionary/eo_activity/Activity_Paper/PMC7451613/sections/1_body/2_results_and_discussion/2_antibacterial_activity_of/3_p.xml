 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Manikkuwadura et al., 2019</xref>) presence of inadequate quantities of active constituent or constituents in the extract to exhibit the antimicrobial activity can be the reason for the negative results. Absence of antimicrobial activity does not mean that the bioactive compounds are not present in the plant or the plant has no antimicrobial activity against microorganisms. The present study denotes that antimicrobial activities was dose dependent and influence of solvent on extraction of metabolites required for antibacterial activity, thus the availability of plant crude extracts is depending on type of solvent used for extraction and concentration of the plant material. The aqueous extract had minimum antibacterial activity against the test organisms. This for the reason that, activities of water extracted plant material has reduced due to the fact that time used during rotary evaporator has influence on crude extracts when compared to low boiling point solvents. Hence, the aqueous extracted crude extract has lower zone of inhibition than methanol crude extracts as in the results obtained by (
