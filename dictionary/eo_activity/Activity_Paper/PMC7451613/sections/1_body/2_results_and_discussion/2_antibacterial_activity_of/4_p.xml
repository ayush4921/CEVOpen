<p id="p0080">According to this study, various factors such as rotary evaporator used during extraction of crude also trigger influence on the activities of crudes based on boiling point of solvent used for extraction. For instance, the temperature used for methanol and water is different (i.e. the temperature used during Rotary evaporator is 45 °C for both solvents; because of water require high temperature than methanol, it require long duration during extraction) and this can adversely affect the activity of plant material. 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">El-Mahmood et al. (2010)</xref> states that, several factors are known to influence yield and biological activities of plant based products, including the age of the plant, time of harvest, drying and processing of the materials, methods of extraction and the solvents used.
