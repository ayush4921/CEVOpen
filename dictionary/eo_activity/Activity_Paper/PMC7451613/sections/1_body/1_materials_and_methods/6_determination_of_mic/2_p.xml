<p id="p0045">Minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated for extracts of non-heat-treated plant material. The MIC of each extract was determined by using concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 and 0.625 mg/mL) of the plant extracts by using the broth dilution method (
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Cheruiyot et al., 2009</xref>). 4 mL of the NB was pipetted into each of 6 test tubes. 0.1 mL of the prepared successive two-fold serial dilutions of the crude extract concentrations were mixed with the nutrient broth. Thereafter, 0.1 mL of the standardized inoculum of test pathogens was dispensed into each of the test tubes containing the suspension of nutrient broth and the crude extract. Then, all test tubes were properly corked and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MICs were read as least concentration that inhibited any visible growth (absence of turbidity) of the test organisms (
