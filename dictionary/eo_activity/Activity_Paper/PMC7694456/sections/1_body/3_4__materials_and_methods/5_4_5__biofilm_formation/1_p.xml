<p>Biofilm formation by MRSA isolates was determined using crystal violet assay on U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates, as detailed previously [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Each MRSA strain was tested three times. Wells with sterile TSB only were worked as controls. The optical density of each well was measured at 570 nm (OD570) using an automated Multiskan reader (GIO. DE VITA E C, Rome, Italy). Biofilm formation was interpreted as highly positive (OD570 ≥ 1), low-grade positive (0.1 ≤ OD570 &lt; 1), or negative (OD570 &lt; 0.1).
