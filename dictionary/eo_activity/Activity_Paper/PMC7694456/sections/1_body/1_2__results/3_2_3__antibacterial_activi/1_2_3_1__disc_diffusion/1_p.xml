<p>The antibacterial activity of EOs against MRSA isolates was assessed by the disc diffusion method (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00369-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> EO has shown strong inhibitory activity on 80% of the strains, succeeded by 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> that demonstrated a strong inhibitory action on 53.33% and 16.66% of the isolates, respectively. Moreover, according to the high percentage of anti-MRSA activity, 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic>O. majorana’</italic> EOs have a strong inhibitory action on 80% and 53.33% of the strains, respectively. However, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> had a slight inhibitory action on 46.66% of the strains. Thereby, 
 <italic>T. zygis’</italic> EO appeared as the EO with the highest antibacterial activity, succeeded by 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>. According to the type of specimen, globally, the same result was found as detected in cases of total isolates. 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> was regarded as an EO with strong inhibitory activity, succeeded by 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>.
