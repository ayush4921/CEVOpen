<p>The outcomes of this study support the medical application of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EOs for the prevention and/or treatment of MRSA infections and diseases as an alternative to or combined with antibiotics. These EOs, provided from Laboratoires OMEGA Pharma–Phytosun Arôms (Châtillon, France), are used orally and in high concentrations (doses), corroborating their non-toxic effect. Generally, the therapeutic application of EOs is limited by their solubility, skin-sensitization synonymous allergic contact dermatitis, and their physicochemical stability due to the volatile components and the conversion of components by cyclization, isomerization, oxidation, or dehydrogenation reactions. Further adequate in vitro testing or in vivo preclinical experiments are warranted to establish safety, efficacy, potential adverse effects, and interaction with other drugs of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EOs before including them in clinical practice.
