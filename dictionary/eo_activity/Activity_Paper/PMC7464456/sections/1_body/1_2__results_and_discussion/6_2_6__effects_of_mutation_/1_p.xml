<p>To determine whether 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> polysaccharides were detrimental to RAW 264.7 cells, the cell viability was examined using the cell counting kit-8 following treatment with different concentrations (50, 200, and 500 μg/mL) for 24 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, six polysaccharide fraction treatment did not induce RAW 264.7 cell death at concentrations up to 500 μg/mL.
