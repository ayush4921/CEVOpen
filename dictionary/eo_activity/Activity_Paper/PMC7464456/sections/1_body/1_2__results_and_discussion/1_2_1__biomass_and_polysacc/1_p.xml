<p>The mutant strain A130 and the original strain SH1 were cultured by liquid fermentation with the same inoculation amount, respectively. There are great differences between these two treatments and the comparison in the average biomass and polysaccharide content. According to 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03693-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the average biomass of mutant strain A130 increased by 14.43% compared with the original strain SH1. Meanwhile, the total polysaccharide contents of the mutant strain A130 increased by 4.53%. Therefore, the mutant strain A130 was a new strain with high polysaccharide yield and genetic stability. The high positive gene response effect, as well as unique response mechanism, contributes to the genetic stability of the mutagenesis mutant strain A130. Meanwhile, high-energy active particles from ARTP could repair the genetic damage, thus the characteristics from mutant strains could be stably inherited. The characterization of polysaccharides and biological activities are very important for efficient applications, therefore, we studied the differences of polysaccharide after ARTP mutation.
