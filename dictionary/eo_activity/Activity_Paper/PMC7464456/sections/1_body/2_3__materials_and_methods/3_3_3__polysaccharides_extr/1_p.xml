<p>500 g mycelia samples were accurately weighed and immersed in 9 L distilled water overnight before extraction. Subsequent extraction of the mycelia polysaccharides was performed at 100 °C for 4 h. The extracts were evaporated before being centrifuged to give the supernatant, which was then separated by gradient alcohol precipitation to 20, 50 and 70%. The precipitates were dissolved in distilled water and dialyzed to remove small molecule substance for three days at 4 °C with the following freeze-dry to yield polysaccharide fractions, named as SH1-20, SH1-50, SH1-70 and (A130-20, A130-50, A130-70) respectively. The protocols of polysaccharide extraction process were shown in
