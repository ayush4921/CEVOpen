<p>The six polysaccharide fractions were dissolved with sterilized PBS solution and diluted to final concentration of 50, 200, and 500 µg/mL. THP-1 cells were differentiated to form a mature macrophage-like state by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich). After treatment with PMA for 48 h, the medium was removed, and fresh medium (180 µL) and serial concentrations of samples (20 µL) were added into 96-well plate. The cell supernatants were collected after being co-cultured for 48 h. The cytokine levels (pg/mL) of culture supernatant were determined by human IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. All data were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p>
