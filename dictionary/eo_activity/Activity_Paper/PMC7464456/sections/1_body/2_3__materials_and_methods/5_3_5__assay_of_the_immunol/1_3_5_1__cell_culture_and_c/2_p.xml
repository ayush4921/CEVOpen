<p>Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay kit to explore the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> polysaccharides on RAW 264.7 cells. Aliquots of RAW 264.7 cell suspension (180 µL; 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) with 20 µL different concentrations of polysaccharide samples were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was served as the negative control. The cell viability rate was calculated according to protocol [
