<p>High-quality strain is the important factor to obtain 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> products with high polysaccharide content. However, in the last few decades, much attention was focused on fermentation, isolation and biological activities of 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic>, and there were few studies focused on strain breeding. ARTP mutagenesis is a novel microbial mutation breeding technology driven by radio-frequency power, affecting the structure and permeability of the cell wall and plasma membrane, followed by DNA damage, including missense mutation, deletion or frame shift mutation [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This technique can effectively mutate bacteria, microalgae, fungi, yeast, and actinomycetes, etc. [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] screened and bred 
 <italic>Monascus</italic> on the production of extracellular polysaccharides by UV-ARTP composite mutagenesis, and the polysaccharide production of mutant was 61.18% higher than that of parent strain. Fang et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that the ARTP could cause diverse mutations of the microalgae 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> and increase the polysaccharide content by 1.8-fold.
