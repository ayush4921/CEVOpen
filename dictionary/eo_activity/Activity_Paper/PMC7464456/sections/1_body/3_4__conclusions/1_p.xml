 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> is a rare medicinal fungus has been attracted more and more attention due to its remarkable anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects. The structure and bioactivities of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> have been reported and proven to be main functional components [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The increase of polysaccharide content will be of great value for 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> development and utilization. A new strain, A130, screened from the mutant strains by ARTP mutagenesis, with higher polysaccharide content in submerged fermentation mycelia, was obtained in our previous study and the intracellular polysaccharide yield of A130 was improved to 1.2-fold of that of the wild strain SH1. The structural characteristics and biological activities of intracellular polysaccharide derived from mutagenic 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> strain were investigated in this study. The polysaccharides differ in chemical composition, molecular mass, chain conformation and immune activity in vitro after mutation, and the main differences were found in polysaccharide fractions precipitated by 20% ethanol which showed a relatively expanded branching chain with higher molecular weight and better in vitro macrophage activation activities after mutation.
