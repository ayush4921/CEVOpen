<p>As aforementioned, glycosidases play a pivotal role in controlling not only the metabolic pathways where carbohydrates are present but also many other significant biochemical events, like cell-to-cell communication or recognition processes. Herein, a panel of five commercially-available glycosidases have been tested, as models of carbohydrate-mediated diseases: α-glucosidase (from

 <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>). Deficiencies in such enzymes are associated with diabetes, Gaucher’s disease, Fabry’s disease, and gangliosidosis, respectively
