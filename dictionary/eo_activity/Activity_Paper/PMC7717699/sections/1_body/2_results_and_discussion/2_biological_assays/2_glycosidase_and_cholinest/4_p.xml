 </xref>. For that purpose, Ellman’s colorimetric assay was used; this is an indirect test in which acetyl and butyryl thiocholine iodides are used as model substrates, which upon interaction with the enzyme release thiocholine, which in turn reacts with the chromogen reagent 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) to give 2-nitro-5-mercaptobenzoate (at pH 8.0). The monitoring of the latter at 405 nm furnishes the kinetic parameters.
