<p>The ten 1-DNJ derivatives prepared herein (
 <bold>11a–g</bold>, 
 <bold>12a</bold>, 
 <bold>c</bold>, and 
 <bold>d</bold>) were subjected to inhibition assays on two families of enzymes: glycosidases and cholinesterases. In both cases, an initial screening was performed at 100 µM inhibitor concentration. For those compounds exhibiting a percentage of inhibition higher than 50% under such conditions, the kinetic parameters (

 <sub>M,app</sub> and

 <sub>max,app</sub>) were obtained, that were used for calculating the inhibition constants (

 <sub>i</sub>’s). The mode of inhibition was also established for the most potent compounds, using the Cornish–Bowden method
