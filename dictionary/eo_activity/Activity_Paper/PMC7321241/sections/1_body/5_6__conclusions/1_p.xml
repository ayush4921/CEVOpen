<p>Non-communicable diseases as well as the risk factors for MetS contribute significantly to the burden of health care in South Africa. There is a rich biodiversity of plants in South Africa with demonstrated and scientifically validated medicinal properties, which are and can be exploited in reducing the burden of provision of health care. The role of the gut microbiota in metabolic diseases has gained a lot of attention. Several of the plants discussed in this review contain phytochemicals which have selective microbicidal activity which can alter the Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratio, imparting positive health beneficial effects [

However, whilst traditional practitioners may target specific gastrointestinal disorders, they do not have the capacity to assess the impact of their interventions on the gut microbiota. There is a need for further studies and, indeed, for a specific review dedicated to this important subject. However, what is clear from our review is that there is a need to protect plant biodiversity and ensure that plants are not over-exploited, as has been reported in China [
