<p>Dietary modifications, including a restricted food intake, are recognized as a potential therapeutic approach for the management of obesity and NAFLD. The succulent plant 
 <italic>Hoodia gordonii</italic> has been used by the Khoi San for decades as an appetite suppressant. Through its appetite-suppressing effects 
 <italic>H. gordonii</italic> is a potential candidate for the management of NAFLD. While some studies showed varied results in humans [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], recent studies using obese rats showed that dietary supplementation with 
 <italic>H. gordonii</italic> extracts decreased the ratsâ€™ body mass and reduced their muscle mass and adipocyte size [

 <italic>H. gordonii</italic> in the management of NAFLD. The legume 
 <italic>S. frutescens</italic> is widely used for its medicinal properties. As discussed earlier, recent studies have validated its antidiabetic properties, and it has also been shown to modify lipid metabolism in 3T3 adipocytes as well as in insulin-resistant rats [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Importantly, it has also been shown that its hot aqueous extracts were able to reverse fructose-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo [
