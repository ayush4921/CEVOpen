<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is generally associated with obesity and has been considered as the metabolic manifestation of MetS, recent evidence shows that it can develop independently of metabolic syndrome [

Consequently, traditional medical practitioners are highly unlikely to be able to diagnose NAFLD in patients. Therefore, in reporting on medicinal plants used for the management of or showing biological activity against NAFLD, this review will focus on South African plants which have been confirmed to demonstrate activity against hepatic steatosis. The available literature is also mainly from lab animal studies. High-fructose diets have been implicated in the development of NAFLD. We have recently shown that aqueous extracts of
