<p>Despite this perceived safety by those who prefer to use medicinal plants, there is a need for scientific validation to ensure safety and consistent medicinal preparations. In fact, the WHO is advocating for proof of safety, before establishing the therapeutic efficacy of medicinal plants to be used for primary healthcare [

There is indeed a plethora of information and claims about the benefits of herbal products and medicinal plants in the public press and forum. However, there is a scarcity of scientifically accurate reviews and experimental evidence on the efficacy and safety of medicinal plants. The systematic study of medicinal plants and the investigation of their biologically active phytochemical compounds for the management of metabolic disorders have emerged as a key development in modern medicine. The recent advances in molecular techniques have made it possible to intricately explore the mechanisms of action through which the phytochemical constituents of medicinal plants confer their health benefits.
