<p>Some traditional healers have used orally administered decoctions of 
 <italic>Helichrysum ceres</italic> to treat hypertension [

 <xref rid="B100-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Moreover in vivo studies have also shown that the ethanolic leaf extracts of 
 <italic>H. ceres</italic> act on vascular smooth muscles, causing a vasodilatory effect which in turn reduces the total peripheral resistance (TPR), thus lowering blood pressure [

 <italic>Ekebergia capensis</italic> leaf ethanolic extracts have also been used successfully to prevent the development of hypertension in murine models [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The hypotensive effects of 
 <italic>E. capensis</italic> are due to its modulatory effects on the TPR of the vascular smooth muscles [
