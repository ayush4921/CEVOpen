Their potential to be a part of a plant-based nutraceuticals source is imminent. Besides, the majority of the halophytes have traditionally been used, locally and worldwide, as a remedy for many diseases, and several symptomatic disorders, e.g., diabetes, hepatitis, jaundice, inflammation, and hypertension, have been treated or claimed to be treated. Nonetheless, the halophytes have also been used for the treatment of viral and bacterial infections and fevers as well [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The concurrently enhanced outlook and increased demands for complementary and alternative medicines in solving several therapeutic challenges, including the microbial resistance dilemma for regular and over-prescribed antibiotics, are concomitant. The indigenous systems of medicines have also propelled the search for natural anti-microbial molecular templates, new chemical entities, and leads for developing newer anti-microbial drug candidates, thereby initial screenings of plants of diversified environments have caught specific attention [

Besides, the ongoing search to find new structural templates, and novel molecular entities-based remedies from the natural products reservoir and pools of the plantsâ€™ kingdom for non-communicable diseases, e.g., diabetes, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and diseases of the central nervous system, is rapidly taking shape worldwide [

These plants are also normally used as part of traditional herbal remedies with every indigenous system of medicine and are of high folk-lore reputation in the parts of the world they perennially survive. In this region, the locals, and nomadic people, frequently use these plants as a remedy for certain physiological conditions, hormonal disorders based on symptomatic observations, and the diseases identified through primitive diagnosis, as well as in wounds, burns, cuts, bad skin conditions, pains, swellings, and joint-swellings [
