<p>The comparative quantities of the total phenolics and flavonoid contents in the halophytes, calculated as equivalents of the gallic acid and rutin-based presence, and expressed as mg of the per gram of dried extract of each plant are displayed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, these results are a supportive marker for the abundance of these types of phytochemical compounds in the halophytic plants. The total phenolics and flavonoid contents of these plants were measured in the average of 126.6 mg/g to 360 mg/g GAE, and of 20.5 mg/g to 70.5 mg/g RE of the different plants dried extracts, respectively. The quantity of total phenolics constituents was comparatively higher than their concentrations in the plants growing in non-saline conditions [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results reflected the effects of environmental conditions on the halophytes’ ability to excessively biosynthesize the phenolics and flavonoids. Major differences in the total phenolics and flavonoids contents were recorded for 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> growing in Saudi Arabia (360 mg/g GAE and 70.5 mg/g RE of the extract, respectively) to that reported for the same plant species growing in coastal areas of Karachi, Pakistan (≈8 mg/g GAE and 5 mg/g RE, respectively). A similar conclusion can also be drawn through a thorough comparison of the total phenolics contents obtained for 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> in comparison to the same species growing in Kolhapur, India, a non-coastal, non-sandy, non-high-salt soil region [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The noticeable differences in the total phenolics and flavonoids contents were also recorded for 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> which belonged to the same genus, 
 <italic>Salsola</italic>, wherein the highest quantities of phenolics and flavonoids contents were found at 360 mg/g of GAE, and 70.5 mg/g of RE for the 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic>. In contrast, the lowest concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids were recorded for 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> (126.6 mg/g of GAE and 20.5 mg/g of RE, respectively). Higher concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids contents were also quantified in 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> that showed total phenolics contents values at 293 mg/g and 260 mg/g of GAE, and total flavonoids contents values at 54.8 mg/g, and 35.5 mg/g of RE, respectively, (
