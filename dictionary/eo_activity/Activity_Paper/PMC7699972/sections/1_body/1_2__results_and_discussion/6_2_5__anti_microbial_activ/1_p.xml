<p>The anti-microbial activity testings of the plant extracts were performed against broad-spectrum microorganisms which included Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> fungal strain. The inhibition zone diameter (IZD) displayed by the plants’ extracts as compared to the standard antibiotics were recorded. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the plants’ extracts against particular microorganisms, selected according to the results obtained from the IZD assays, were also determined. Most of the extracts were either inactive or had weak activity against the microorganisms, i.e., the extracts obtained from 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> exhibited weak antimicrobial activity with IZD values of 11 and 8 mm, respectively, against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> as compared to the standard antibiotic drug. The weak anti-microbial effects were also observed for the 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> plant’s extract with IZD values of 9 mm and 8 mm against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> respectively. Additionally, the 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> extract was also inactive against all other tested microorganisms. The anti-microbial activity observations revealed moderate effects of 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> and 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> aq. ethanolic extracts against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> which showed equal IZD values of 13 mm, and MIC values at 125 µg/mL, and 112.5 µg/mL, respectively. The extract of 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> moderately inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, Methicillin resistance 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), and the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with IZD values ranging from 12 mm to 15 mm areas, except for the 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> where it was inactive. Additionally, the MIC measured for 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> extract against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, MRSA, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were ranging between 82 and 95 µg/mL of the extract. The strongest anti-microbial activity was recorded for the extract of 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> against MRSA with an IZD area of 33 mm, and a MIC value of 50 µg/mL. The results in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05457-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> summarized the anti-microbial activities of the plants extracts, of which the 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> was the most wide-spectrum active plant, followed by the 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic>. The results indicated that the anti-microbial potential of 
 <italic>Z. simplex,</italic> which showed 33 mm IZD against one of the most widely-resisted microorganisms, i.e., MRSA, may evolve as a probable candidate to cope with the infections caused by the MRSA to humans and cattle alike [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The plant’s extract may also yield an anti-microbial lead template in the future upon further investigation. The anti-microbial potential of 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> was most wide-spread and showed resistance against all tested microorganisms, except the 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.
