<p>The total phenolics contents (TPC) of all the plant extracts’ were determined as Gallic Acid Equivalents (GAE) using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent by the method described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Concisely, Folin Ciocalteu reagent (diluted 1:10, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, distilled water, 2.5 mL) was added to the extract in a concentration of 1 mg/mL (1 mL), and saturated solution of sodium carbonate (2 mL) was added and well mixed. The mixture was shaken vigorously and set aside for 30 min at 40 °C water-bath protected from light. The absorbance of the developed blue color was measured at 765 nm by UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Model V-630, JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan). The total phenolics contents of the extracts were expressed as mg/g of the dried plant extracts’ equivalent to the Gallic Acid using the generated Gallic Acid calibration curve. All the results were obtained as an average of three independent measurements, and their standard deviations were calculated.
