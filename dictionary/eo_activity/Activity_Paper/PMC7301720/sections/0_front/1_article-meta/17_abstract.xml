 <p>
  <bold>Context:</bold> There are numerous pharmacological activities for 
  <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> and its bioactive constituent, rutin, on learning and memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Objective:</bold> This study aimed to examine the effect of 
  <italic>R. graveolens</italic> and rutin on memory in rats.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Materials and methods:</bold> In this study animals were treated with the hydroalcholic extract of 
  <italic>R. graveolens</italic> and rutin by IP injection for 10 days. Behavioural and biochemical tests as well as HPLC analysis and antioxidant activity of extract have been evaluated.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold>
  <italic>R. graveolens</italic> extract and rutin significantly increased learning and improved spatial memory, as well as secondary latency; moreover, there were significant increases in the serum and brain antioxidant capacity as well as the level of TBARS in serum and brain tissues. Results also showed that 
  <italic>R. graveolens</italic> has significant DPPH radical scavenging effect (IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 159.17 ± 1.56 μg/mL). The HPLC analysis of extract showed that caffeic acid (19.92 ± 0.01), rutin (40.15 ± 0.01), and apigenin (0.84 ± 0.01) mg/g of dry extract are the main components of the extract.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Discussion and conclusion:</bold> Regarding the effects of 
  <italic>R</italic>. 
  <italic>graveolens</italic> extract and rutin on animal brain cells, memory function, and learning, additional studies, including clinical trials, might be beneficial in producing natural supplementary drugs from this herb.
