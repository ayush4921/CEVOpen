 <italic>graveolens</italic> extract, so that the memory-enhancing-effect of the 300 mg/kg of the extract and rutin is stronger than 30 and 100 mg/kg of the extract. By comparing the results of total extract and the pure substance of rutin as the main substance of this plant, it can be concluded that rutin is sufficiently potent in comparison to the 30 and 100 mg/kg of the extract. In most tests, the extract had relatively similar strength to rutin (10 mg/kg) only at 300 mg/kg. According to the results of the HPLC analysis, it seems that about 249 mg of the extract contains 10 mg of rutin, which confirms the equivalent response of rutin to that of the extract at the dose of 300 mg/kg. However, the effect of the extract at this dose can also be attributed to a phenolic acid, namely, caffeic acid, in addition to its main compound rutin.
