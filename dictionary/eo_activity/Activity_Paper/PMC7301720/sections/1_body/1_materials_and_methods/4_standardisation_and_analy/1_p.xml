<p>HPLC was used for qualitative analysis of the phenolic acid and flavonoids (Knauer, Germany). The system was equipped with a C18 column (5 µm particle size, i.d. 250 mm × 4.6 mm) and UV–visible detector (PDA Detector 2800). The binary mobile phase, including solvent A (methanol and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (deionized water and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) was eluted as follows to wash and equilibrate the column: 0–10 min, 20% solvent A and 80% solvent B; 10–40 min, 30% solvent A and 70% solvent B; 40–45 min, 60% solvent A and 40% solvent B; 45–50 min, 80% solvent A and 20% solvent B; and 50–55 min, 100% solvent A and 0% solvent B. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 µL. Detection was performed by scanning at 190–800 nm wavelength and reading the absorbance at 280–372 nm wavelength. Phenolic acid and flavonoids were identified by comparing their UV spectra and retention times to the analytical standards. Also, a calibration curve equation was used to calculate the content of each flavonoid and phenolic acid, and the results were expressed as µg/mg of the extract dry weight.</p>
