<p>Three solutions were used in order to measure serum and brain antioxidant capacity: 1. Buffer (1.55 mL sodium acetate, 8 mL concentrated acetic acid reaching 500 mL by adding distilled water), 2. Ferrous chloride solution (270 mg FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (6 H
 <sub>2</sub>O) increased to 50 mL by adding distilled water), and 3. Triazine solution (47 mg triazine dissolved in 40 mL of 40 mM HCl). The working solution was prepared by adding 10 mL of the first solution to 1 mL of the second solution and 1 mL of the third solution. Furthermore, 25 µL of the serum sample and 25 µL of the homogenized brain sample were added to 1.5 mL of the working solution and stored at 37 °C. Optical absorbance was measured at 593 nm (Benzie and Strain
