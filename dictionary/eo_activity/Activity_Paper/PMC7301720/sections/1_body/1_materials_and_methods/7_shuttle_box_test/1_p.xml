<p>The shuttle box test lasted 4 days for each rat. During the first and second days, each rat was left in the box to acclimatize to it. Moreover, an acquisition test was conducted on day 3. The rats were separately placed in the bright chamber of the shuttle box for this purpose. After a 2 min acclimatisation period, guillotine door was opened and after the rat got into the dark chamber, it was closed, and then an electrical shock (1 mA, for a second) was exerted to the rat, such that it only paddled. In this test, the length of primary latency in entering the dark chamber on the day 3 and the length of latency during passing on the day 4 were recorded (Rabiei et al.
