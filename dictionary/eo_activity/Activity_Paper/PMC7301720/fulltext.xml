Learning and memory are among the highest functional levels of the central nervous system (CNS) (Spencer et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Memory is a biological adaptation that enables a living organism to use past experiences to regulate its behaviour against environmental changes. Memory is assumed to be the result of long-term changes induced by learning in the relationship between neurons (Holroyd and Shepherd <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The spatial memory and long-term memory are constantly forming in the hippocampus (Diba et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Since learning and memory are important issues in science and technology advancement and the number of people with learning and memory disorders is increasing, using herbal drugs in the treatment of forgetfulness and enhancing memory has been a topic of interest for many researchers (Izadpanah et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These herbs have been used since ancient times and they rarely lead to side effects (Jamshidi-Kia et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). There are many medicinal herbs effective in enhancing memory and learning. <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> L. (Rutaceae), which has significant therapeutic properties, is one of the medicinal herbs used in traditional medicine in Iran and some other countries (Shojaii et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This herb is referred to as panacea due to its high therapeutic value include the treatment of anticular, ear, pharynx, neurological, pulmonary, digestive, renal, gynecological diseases, parasites excretion, pain relief, and treatment of spasm and inflammation <bold>(</bold>Asgarpanah and Khoshkam <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ratheesh et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Baharvand-Ahmadi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Javadi and Emami <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There are more than 120 compounds of different types of flavonoid glycosides, quinoline alkaloids, coumarins, lignins, and flavonoids as the active ingredients of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> (Stashenko et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gentile et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Among these flavonoids, rutin has been a topic of interest for researchers (Adsersen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Also, as a major compound of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic>, rutin enhances memory retrieval and has pharmacological activities, including anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, and antimycotic properties (Jianxiong et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate and compare the effect of hydroalcholic extract of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> and rutin on spatial memory and passive avoidance memory in rats.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Extraction</title><p>Fresh <italic>R. graveolens</italic> was purchased from local market on April 2016.

For centuries, natural compounds have been used by human beings for their health and well-being. Recently, demands for natural compounds and drugs have been increased due to the numerous side effects and the cost of these synthetic drugs used for treating disorders of the nervous system, learning, and memory (Forouzanfar and Hosseinzadeh <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Safiaghdam et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>The group receiving 300&#x02009;mg/kg of the extract and the group receiving rutin, compared to the control group, which this indicates the improving effect of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> on the spatial memory.

In 2006, Adsersen et&#x000a0;al. proved that the extract of <italic>R. graveolens</italic> can inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. Therefore, this plant has been suggested to be effective in memory improvement (Adsersen et&#x000a0;al. 2006). Tali&#x00107; et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also investigated the effect of <italic>R. graveolens</italic> on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), which are considered as promising strategies in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). According to this study, the strongest inhibition effect on AChE was detected within water extract of rue (IC<sub>50</sub> = 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL) and there was also a significant inhibition effect on BuChE. These results are consistent with our results. In a study conducted by Ratheesh et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) it was reported that methanol extract of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> reduced the oxidative stress and inflammation, and improved pathology induced in aorta of hypercholesterolemic rats, such that the herb decreased the activities of cyclooxygenase-2 and myeloperoxidase, as well as the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, and increased the antioxidant activities of certain enzymes such as glutathione, indicating the antioxidant activity of the herb, which this is in agreement with our study (Ratheesh et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Preethi et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) also reported that the low (homeopathic) concentrations of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> had cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma and fibroblastoma cells by controlling the oxygen free radicals and preventing the peroxidation of membrane lipids, and also saved the life of animals suffering from cancer (Preethi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In the study of Abidin et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), implemented on the relationship between oxidative stress and memory, stressful periods and increased stress levels were associated with adverse effect on memory and memory retention (Abidin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Therefore, oxidative stress accelerates the aging process and behaviours related to depression, dementia, and impairments of memory and learning. MDA is a product of cell membrane lipids peroxidation. Increasing the amounts of these lipid peroxides in the nerve cells leads to cell damage. The body uses the antioxidant system to cope with oxidative substances. In addition to these systems, some medicinal herbs reduce the oxidative stress and its adverse outcomes due to the antioxidants (Pandya et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rabiei et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The role of secondary metabolites in medicinal herbs, especially flavonoids, has been demonstrated in producing antioxidant effects in treating diseases related to oxidative stress, such as memory disorders and degenerative and inflammatory diseases (Bahmani et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kazemi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Rutin is one of the most important flavonoids, which is effective in memory impairment through its antioxidative activity (Ramalingayya et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> is one of the medicinal herbs that has high amounts of flavonoids, especially rutin, and phenolic acids, particularly caffeic acid. The current study separately evaluated and confirmed the positive effects of rutin on memory and learning.</p><p>In a study by Raghav et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), implemented on the anti-inflammatory effects of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> lavender extract on adipose tissue macrophages, it was indicated that the herb has an active flavonoid metabolite, which a large part of this flavonoid metabolite is consisted of rutin (Raghav et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>In standardising the extract in the present study, the amounts of rutin, apigenin, and caffeic acid were 40.15, 0.84, and 19.92&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL of dry extract, respectively, using HPLC analysis. In a study by Proestos et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), the amounts of phenolic and flavonoid compounds were measured in aromatic plants, such as <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic>, in which the amounts of caffeic acid, rutin, and quercetin were 20.1, 40.1 and 3.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL of dry extract, respectively, and the amounts of apigenin, luteolin, and naringenin were not adequate to be detected. Besides that, the antioxidant capacity of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> leaf was 159.17&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL in the DPPH method (IC<sub>50</sub>), and the total phenolic content of the herb extract was calculated at 14.1&#x02009;mg/g of dry extract.</p><p>These results &#x0200b;&#x0200b;indicate the presence of antioxidant substances in the herb, most important of which are rutin and caffeic acid. The investigations of Fernandes et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed that caffeic acid could improve the memory loss in mice through cholinergic mediators and by coping with oxidative stress.</p><p>The beneficial effects of this herb on memory and learning are likely to be due to the presence of caffeic acid and its efficacy is through this pathway. In addition, as the previous studies have demonstrated the effect of rutin in reducing oxidative stress and its optimal effects on memory (Habtemariam <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the results of this part of our study confirms the presence of high amounts of rutin in the herb. The properties of rutin observed in different tests in our study seem to be due to its antioxidant properties and the resulting decrease in inflammatory substances that damage the neurons.</p><p>The inhibitory effects of rutin on GABA transaminase (GABA-T) and succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase have been indicated in numerous in-vitro studies. Inhibition of the two enzymes in the brain tissue increases GABA levels and may have therapeutic applications in neurological disorders. In addition, GABA-T is known as an important target for some of the drugs effective in the brain. Therefore, the inhibition of flavonoids by these enzymes may lead to exhibiting neuro-pharmacological effects (Tao et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Therefore, it seems that improving memory and learning in the group receiving rutin in our study may also be due to increased amount of GABA.</p><p>In general, the memory-enhancing effects of the extract were increased by increasing the dose of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> extract, so that the memory-enhancing-effect of the 300&#x02009;mg/kg of the extract and rutin is stronger than 30 and 100&#x02009;mg/kg of the extract. By comparing the results of total extract and the pure substance of rutin as the main substance of this plant, it can be concluded that rutin is sufficiently potent in comparison to the 30 and 100&#x02009;mg/kg of the extract. In most tests, the extract had relatively similar strength to rutin (10&#x02009;mg/kg) only at 300&#x02009;mg/kg. According to the results of the HPLC analysis, it seems that about 249&#x02009;mg of the extract contains 10&#x02009;mg of rutin, which confirms the equivalent response of rutin to that of the extract at the dose of 300&#x02009;mg/kg. However, the effect of the extract at this dose can also be attributed to a phenolic acid, namely, caffeic acid, in addition to its main compound rutin.</p></sec><sec id="s0023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study showed that intraperitoneal injection of hydroalcholic extract of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>graveolens</italic> and rutin, due to their potent antioxidant activities, increased serum and brain antioxidant capacity and decreased serum and brain MDA levels. This herb is likely to enhance memory and learning performance through these mechanisms. It is therefore suggested that after additional studies on animal samples and human subjects, the herb can be used as a supplement in preventing and reducing the adverse effects of oxidative stress, regarding the acceleration of the aging process and behaviours associated with depression, dementia, and memory and learning disorders.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Research and Technology Deputy of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences for all provided supports.
