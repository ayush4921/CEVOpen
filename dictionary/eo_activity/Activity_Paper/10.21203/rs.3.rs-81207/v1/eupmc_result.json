    "<h4>Background: </h4> The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the global health concern since December 2019. It has become a big challenge for the researchers to find a solution for this newly evolved pandemic. In Ayurveda point of view, COVID-19 is a Janapadodhwamsa vikara (epidemic disease), a situation where the environment - air, water, land and seasons - is vitiated, causing a simultaneous manifestation of a disease among large populations. The aim of this study is to identify the active compounds of selected Ayurveda medicines recommended for covid-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> Chemical profiling of selected Ayurveda medicines such as Indukantham Kwatham (IK), Vilvadi Gulika (VG) and Mukkamukkatuvadi Gulika (MMG) were carried out by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatographic (HPTLC) analysis. <h4>Results: </h4> The selected preparations are traditionally recommended for the management of various kinds of fever including the infectious ones and to enhance the immunity. HPTLC analysis of the same showed presence of many active molecules like Umbelliferone, Scopoletin, Caffeic acid, Ferulic acid, Gallic acid, Piperin, Curcumin, Berberine and Palmatine. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> The study provided valuable scientific data regarding the active ingredients of the selected medicines with proven therapeutic potentials like anti-viral, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities and it will be beneficial to acquire immunity against Coronavirus-2 attack."
