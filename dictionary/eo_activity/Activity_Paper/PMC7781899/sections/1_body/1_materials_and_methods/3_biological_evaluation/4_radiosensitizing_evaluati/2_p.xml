<p>Irradiation was performed at the National Centre for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority, using Gamma cell-40 (
 <sup>137</sup>Cs) source. The promising compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> were selected to be re-evaluated for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxic activity after the cells containing the compounds were gamma-irradiated at a dose level of 8 Gy with a dose rate of 0.758 rad/s for 17.59 min. Cytotoxicity was measured two days after irradiation. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the tested compounds is calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.
