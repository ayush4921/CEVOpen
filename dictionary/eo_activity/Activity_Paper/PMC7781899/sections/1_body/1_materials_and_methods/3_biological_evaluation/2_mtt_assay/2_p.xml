<p>MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HepG-2, HCT-116 cancer cell lines and MCF-10A normal cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The 96-well plate was incubated for 24 h before the MTT assay. The cell layer was washed with 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA solution. Cells were cultured using DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 10 µg/mL insulin and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Reconstituted MTT (10%) was added and incubated for 2 h. Formazan crystals were dissolved by the MTT solubilizing solution after incubation. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm
