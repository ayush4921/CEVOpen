<p>Docking studies were performed using Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE, 2015.10) provided by chemical computing group, Canada. The software was used to carry out the docking of the promising compounds in the receptor's active site. The protein crystal structure was obtained from the Protein Databank, PDB: 1M17 containing the EGFR enzyme co-crystallized with erlotinib. All the water molecules were removed, 3D protonation was performed. The pocket was determined by the alpha triangle matcher technique. The Energy Minimization was performed using MMFF94X force field with RMSD gradient of 0.001 kcal mol
 <sup>−1 </sup>Å
 <sup>−1</sup> and the partial charges were calculated. The co-crystallized ligand was self-docked inside the active site. The compounds to be docked were drawn on ChemBioOffice 12 and copied as smiles to MOE followed by docking of 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>.
