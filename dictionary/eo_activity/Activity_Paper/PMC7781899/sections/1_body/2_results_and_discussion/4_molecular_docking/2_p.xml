<p>Molecular docking of compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> was performed on the active site of EGFR co-crystallized with erlotinib (PDB: 1M17) (

 </xref>. The active site of 1M17 consists mainly of these key amino acids; Met 769, Leu 694, Thr 766, Ala 719, Leu 764, Gln 767, Leu 768, Pro 770, Phe 771, Gly 772, Leu 820, Thr 830 and Asp 831. The ligand compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> were docked into the active site of the target protein 1M17 and the binding affinities, energy scores and RMSD values for compounds were recorded. Validation of molecular docking showed that the RMSD values are within acceptable limits (less than 2 Å)

 </xref>. The best binding affinity with the lowest energy score for the compounds was computed as −10.14 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> (compound 
 <bold>5</bold>) and −10.03 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> (compound 
 <bold>6</bold>). According to these findings, together with the above-mentioned biological evaluation, compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> may act as effective docking material for EGFR tyrosine kinase. The 2D and 3D visuals of the interaction map for compound 
 <bold>5</bold> can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0013">Figure 13</xref>. The hydrogen bond formation connected the CO of quinazolinone with Met 769 of the target protein with a length of 2.39 Å and Thr 766 by OH with 2.63 Å. Superimposing compound 
 <bold>5</bold> with erlotinib showed that they adopt the same orientation inside the active site with RMSD = 1.243 Å (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0014">Figure 14</xref>). On the other hand, four conventional hydrogen bond interactions were observed between compound 
 <bold>6</bold> and the macromolecule 1M17 as follows; the CO of the quinazolinone with Met 769 and Leu 768 with a recorded distance of 2.54 and 2.79 Å, respectively. In addition to Thr 766 that forms two hydrogen bonds with NH and CS at a distance of 2.88 and 3.01 Å (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0015">Figure 15</xref>). Overlaying of erlotinib and compound 
 <bold>6</bold> can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0016">Figure 16</xref> with RMSD = 1.236 Å.
