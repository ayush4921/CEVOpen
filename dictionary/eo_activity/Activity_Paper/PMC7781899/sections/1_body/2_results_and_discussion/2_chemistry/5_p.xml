<p>Treatment of

 <bold>2</bold> in EtOH 95%, in the presence of K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> afforded a mixture of 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold>. While when the same reaction was repeated in DMF instead of EtOH the unexpected dimer 
 <bold>14</bold> was formed. However, both reactions were expected to give 
 <bold>11</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH004">Scheme 4</xref>). The formation of 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> was assumed to proceed 
 <italic>via</italic> addition–elimination mechanisms, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. The NMR data structure of 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> indicated the disappearance of the S–CH
 <sub>3</sub> signals present in 
 <bold>7</bold>. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>12</bold> showed NH
 <sub>2</sub> signal at

 <sub>H</sub> 5.50 and OH signal at
