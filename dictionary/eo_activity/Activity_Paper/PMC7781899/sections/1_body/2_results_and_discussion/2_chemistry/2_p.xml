<p>The behaviour of the methyl 2-isothiocyanatobenzoate 
 <bold>1</bold> towards the natural alkaloid L-norephedrine 
 <bold>2</bold> was studied. When the isothiocyanate 
 <bold>1</bold> reacted with 
 <bold>2</bold> in chloroform containing a catalytic amount of triethylamine (TEA) at room temperature the unexpected quinazolinone 
 <bold>4</bold> was formed despite the prospective thiourea derivative 
 <bold>3</bold>. In a trial to obtain the open-chain thiourea derivative 
 <bold>3</bold>, NMR tube reaction was carried out between 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>. The structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> was confirmed by the presence of O–CH
 <sub>3</sub> singlet signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 3.83; 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 55.76 ppm in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR, ester carbonyl at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 167.96 ppm, C=S at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 179.68 and the two NH singlets at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 2.87 and 10.31 ppm. The M
 <sup>+</sup> at 344 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> confirmed the structure of 
 <bold>3</bold>. While in NMR data of 
 <bold>4</bold> the O–CH
 <sub>3</sub>, as well as one NH signal disappeared. The ester carbonyl signal in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR of 
 <bold>3</bold> was replaced by amide carbonyl at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 159.57 ppm in 
 <bold>4</bold> while C=S appeared at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 176.01 ppm. Methylation of 
 <bold>4</bold> by methyl iodide (MeI) in dry acetone in the presence of anhydrous K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> gave the corresponding 2-(methyl thio)quinazolin-4(
 <italic>3H</italic>)-one derivative 
 <bold>5</bold>. Both 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR supported the structure of 
 <bold>5</bold> by the appearance of S–CH
 <sub>3</sub> signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 2.47; 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 15.37 ppm. Moreover, the C=S signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 176.01 ppm in 
 <bold>4</bold> was replaced by C=N signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 161.09 ppm in 
 <bold>5.</bold> On the other hand, the reaction of 
 <bold>1</bold> with hydrazine hydrate afforded the reported quinazolinone derivative 
 <bold>6</bold>
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>26</sup>
 </xref>, which was further reacted with MeI to give 
 <bold>7</bold>. The structure of 
 <bold>6</bold> showed NH proton singlet at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 7.99 and carbon C=S signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 169.27 ppm. However, in 
 <bold>7</bold> the C=S signal was replaced by C=N signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 160.94 ppm. The NMR data of 
 <bold>7</bold> also showed the S–CH
 <sub>3</sub> signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 2.44; 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 14.09 ppm. Both 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR of 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> showed signals for NH
 <sub>2</sub> at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 6.39 and 5.77 ppm, respectively. The MS spectra of 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> at 193 and 207
