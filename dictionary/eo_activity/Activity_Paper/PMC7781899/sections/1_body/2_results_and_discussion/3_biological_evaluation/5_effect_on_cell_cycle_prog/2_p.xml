<p>The therapeutic effect of the anticancer agent depends upon its ability to stop cell cycle progression by arresting cell division at certain checkpoints promoting apoptosis. These checkpoints exist at G1-S, S and G2-M phases

 </xref>. The most potent and selective compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was chosen to determine its ability to induce apoptosis using MDA-MB-231 cells according to the reported method
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>37</sup>
 </xref>. The cells were treated with compound 
 <bold>5</bold> at a concentration equals to its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value on EGFR (0.76 μM) for 24 h. It is clear from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figures 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">9</xref> that compound 
 <bold>5</bold> interfered with the cell cycle in the G2-M phase. At that phase, accumulating cells reached 40.39% after treatment of control MDA-MB-231 cells (6.82%) with compound 
 <bold>5</bold>. Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> raised the percentage of cells at pri-G1 phase by 10 folds to reach 19.23% after being 1.91% in control cells. On the contrary, the cell population in G1 and S phases decrease after treatment with compound 
 <bold>5.</bold> So, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> induces apoptosis through cell cycle arrest in the G2-M phase.
