<p>All the newly synthesized compounds, 
 <bold>4–18</bold>, were subjected to EGFR-TK inhibitory assay. Furthermore, a representative compound eliciting superior EGFR inhibition was subjected to cell cycle analysis and apoptotic assay to investigate its effect on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the inhibition data of EGFR (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) for the examined compounds, erlotinib and staurosporine, as reference standards. All analogues showed excellent EGFR inhibition potential ranging from 0.76 to 9.78 µM. The 3-(1-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-2-yl)-2-(methylthio)quinazolin-4(
 <italic>3H</italic>)-one 
 <bold>5</bold> demonstrated superior enzyme inhibition better than that expressed by erlotinib (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=0.76 versus 0.92 µM). Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> is the most active compound towards all the tested cell lines and EGFR inhibitory activity with relative safety towards normal cells and high selectivity towards MDA-MB-231 cell line. The activity of 
 <bold>5</bold> displayed a remarkable decrease by the replacement of the methyl mercaptan with the thione group as in 
 <bold>4</bold>, while replacement with the 1-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-2-ylamino group as in 
 <bold>18</bold> demonstrates a narrow range change in activity from 0.76 to 0.99 µM. Furthermore, replacement of the 1-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-2-yl in 
 <bold>4</bold> with the amino group as in 
 <bold>6</bold> leads to lowering the EGFR inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.39 versus 2.13 µM). Also, replacement of the thione group in 
 <bold>6</bold> with methyl mercaptan 
 <bold>7</bold>, 1-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-2-ylamino 
 <bold>11</bold>, hydroxy 
 <bold>12</bold> or ethoxy group 
 <bold>13</bold> reduces the activity. Regarding the two homologues 
 <bold>8</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold>, the replacement of sulphur with oxygen greatly enhances the EGFR activity, while the opposite occurs in 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>10</bold>. The two dimers 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>17</bold> show very potent activity that demonstrates that a bulky rigid structure is favourable for binding with the receptor.
