<p>In continuation of our studies aiming to find new leads with potential anticancer activities, various substituted quinazolinones have been designed to accommodate different electronic natures as heterocycles representing the primary scaffold in many cytotoxic agents hoping to develop potent and safe anticancer agents and EGFR inhibitors. All the synthesized compounds were screened against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HepG-2, HCT-116 cancer cell lines and the most potent compounds were evaluated against MCF-10A normal cells to determine the selectivity of the compounds on the different cell lines. Also, the 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> EGFR inhibitory activity of the compounds was measured. The effect of the most potent compounds on cell cycle progression and the radiosensitizing activity were evaluated. Docking studies were carried out to confirm the possible mode of action of the promising compounds.
