<p>Protein kinases (PKs) play a pivotal role in cell proliferation by controlling signal transduction through the phosphorylation of different amino acid residues, namely tyrosine, threonine and serine

 </xref>. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) are divided into receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) in human genome. RTKs are vital components of cellular signaling pathways that are active during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Due to their role as growth factor receptors, many RTKs have been involved in the onset or progression of various cancers, either by mutations or receptor/ligand overexpression; thus, they are considered attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention

 </xref>. An example of RTK family members is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a member of the ErbB receptor family and plays an essential role in cell signaling. Signaling is initiated by binding ligands to the extracellular domain of the EGFR, activating kinases and promoting cancer cell survival, invasiveness and drug resistance

 </xref>. EGFR has a critical role in regulating several cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, leading to the development of several types of solid tumors

 </xref>. EGFR (HER-1) and ERB-B2 (HER-2) are characterized in solid tumors as breast, ovary, lung and others. The inhibition of EGFR is classified as targeted therapy as it aims at the differences between cancer and normal cells and is characterized by its high selectivity and lowered side effects.
