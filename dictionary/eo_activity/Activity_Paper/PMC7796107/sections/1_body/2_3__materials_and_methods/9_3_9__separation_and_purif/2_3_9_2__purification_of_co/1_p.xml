<p>The compound 
 <bold>7</bold> separated by pH-zone-refining CCC was found to be impure at 300 nm by HPLC analysis, which was further purified using the same preparative HPLC as mentioned above. In brief, about 50 mg of the impure compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was dissolved in 1.5 mL of 40% methanol aqueous solution and loaded to the sample loop (maximum 2 mL) for purification. A 40% methanol aqueous solution was acidified with 13 mM of trifluoroacetic acid and used as the mobile phase to elute compound 
 <bold>7</bold> at 4 mL/min, with the monitoring wavelength set at 300 nm.
