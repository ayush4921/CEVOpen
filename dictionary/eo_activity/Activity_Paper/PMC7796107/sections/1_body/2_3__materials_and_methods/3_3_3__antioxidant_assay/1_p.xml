<p>The antioxidant activities of the 70% methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> and the separated compounds were evaluated using DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC assays. The results were expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC, µg Trolox/µg extract or µM Trolox/µM compound), which were calculated with the equations obtained from the calibration curves of Trolox standards (final concentrations) versus their DPPH and ABTS radical inhibition (%) and the net AUC value (ORAC assay). A larger TEAC value indicates that the sample tested has higher antioxidant activity.
