<p>Targeting antioxidants, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and aldose reductase (AR) as potential therapeutic approaches for the prevention and amelioration of diabetic complications has attracted growing interest [

An overload of glucose induces the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondrial, and the rise of ROS alters the mitochondrial itself and the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby further increasing oxidative stress, which is a key contributor of diabetic complications [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the polyol pathway flux is significant in insulin-independent tissues, such as lens, glomerulus, and neural tissue, and it may cause a decrease in cytosolic NADPH/NADP
 <sup>+</sup> and an increase in cytosolic NADH/NAD
 <sup>+</sup> leading to ROS production and oxidative stress in those tissues. Moreover, the activated polyol pathway may also cause sorbitol-induced osmotic stress and fructose overproduction [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since ROS, AGEs, and the sorbitol-induced osmotic stress play an important role in the development of diabetic complications, such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], antioxidants, antiglycation agents, and inhibitors of AR, a key enzyme in the polyol pathway, have therapeutic potential for diabetic complications [
