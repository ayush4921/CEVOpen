<p>The evaluation of the separated compounds was carried out using DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC assays. The fluorescein fluorescence decay cure induced by AAPH in the presence of Trolox and the separated compounds and the calibration cures of DPPH and ABTS radical inhibition (%) or AUC value (ORAC assay) by Trolox are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00224">Figure S10 and Table S3</xref>, respectively, in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00224">Supplementary data</xref>. The antioxidant activities of the compounds tested were expressed as TEAC values (µM Trolox/µM compound). As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, except for shikimic acid, all the other compounds showed high antioxidant potentials, with the TEAC values ranging from 0.72 to 3.01 against DPPH radicals, from 0.88 to 3.61 against ABTS radicals, and from 1.43 to 6.93 against peroxyl radicals (ORAC assay). Among the compounds tested, gallic acid exhibited the highest antioxidant potential against the DPPH radical with a TEAC value of 3.01, whereas quercetin was found to be the most active compound against ABTS and peroxyl radicals with TEAC values of 3.61 and 6.39, respectively. Moreover, quercetin appeared to have higher activity against DPPH, ABTS, and peroxyl radicals than its 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glycosides miquelianin (quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide), quercitrin (quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside), and rutin (quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside), indicating that the 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of quercetin may diminish its antioxidant potential, which is in accordance with a previous study carried out by Cai et al. [
