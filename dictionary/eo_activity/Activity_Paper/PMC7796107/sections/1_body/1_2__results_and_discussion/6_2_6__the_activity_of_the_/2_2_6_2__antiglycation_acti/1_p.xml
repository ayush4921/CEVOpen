<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, compounds 4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-imino-di-benzoic acid, miquelianin, rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin showed considerable inhibitory activities toward the formation of AGEs by the glycation of BSA with fructose, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 17.65 to 60.46 µM, compared with that of the positive control aminoguanidine hydrochloride (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2180.9 µM). Among the compounds tested, quercitrin showed the most potent inhibitory activity against the fructose-mediated BSA glycation, which also exhibited considerable antiglycation activity in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, since 48.41% (close to 50% inhibition) antiglycation activity was observed for protocatechuic acid at 100 µM, it was supposed to be more active than aminoguanidine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2180.9 µM) against protein glycation. However, within the concentrations (12.5–100 µM) tested, gallic acid showed a weak antiglycation activity, whereas shikimic acid was inactive. In addition to the inhibition of fructose-mediated BSA glycation, flavonoids including quercitrin [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] can also inhibit AGEs by trapping methylglyoxal, which is a highly reactive AGEs precursor implicated in diabetic complications [

However, 4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-imino-di-benzoic acid and miquelianin are reported to have antiglycation potential for the first time in this study. Although no in vivo studies have been carried out yet to evaluate the antiglycation activities using the compounds reported in this study, the antiglycation potentials of some compounds have been observed in animal studies, including kaempferol [
