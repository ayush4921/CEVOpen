<p>DNA fragmentation, a prominent hallmark of apoptosis, was detected using TUNEL assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (2×10
 <sup>5 </sup>cells/well) were seeded in 6-well chamber slides (Nunc, France) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Following treatment with 48-h IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of DCM and MeOH extracts for 24 h, the treated and untreated cells (negative control) were fixed with 4 % (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at RT. The slides were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with blocking solution (3 % H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in methanol) for 10 min at the same temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed again and permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 % sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. After rinsing in PBS, 50 µl of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) reaction mixtures was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 50 µl Streptavidin HRP solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the cells were stained with 100 μl of DAB substrate for 10 m in a dark condition and evaluated under a light microscope (Nikon, Japan).
