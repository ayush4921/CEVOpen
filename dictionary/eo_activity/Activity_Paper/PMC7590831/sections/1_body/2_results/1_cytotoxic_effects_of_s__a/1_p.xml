<p>To assess the effects of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts on cell growth, MTT and trypan blue assays were performed. As shown in Figure 1A-B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>, DCM and MeOH extracts exhibited significant dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cell lines compared to the untreated control cells (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, no growth inhibition was observed following treatment with n-hexane extract. Furthermore, DCM extract inhibited the growth of cancer cells more powerfully than did the MeOH extract (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Considering all IC
 <sub>50</sub> values reported in Table 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>, MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to growth inhibitory effects of DCM and MeOH extracts compared with WEHI-164 cells at all tested time points. Interestingly, DCM and MeOH extracts revealed little cytotoxicity toward normal cell line HUVEC (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 400 µg/mL) (Figure 1C
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). Microscopic cell count using a hemocytometer showed a remarkable decrease in the number of viable MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells following exposure to DCM and MeOH extracts (Figure 2A-B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). In addition, paclitaxel decreased the viability of MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells to 59.2 % ± 0.4 and 83.5 % ± 0.7 in comparison to the control cells, respectively (data not shown).
