<p>A remarkable number of anticancer compounds that have been commercially available in the market are derived from medicinal plants. Some cytotoxic compounds have been derived from the 
 <italic>Scrophularia</italic> genus such as iridoid diglycoside, flavonoids, alkaloids, sugar esters and phenylpropanoid glycosides. Iridoid glycosides and their hydrolyzed compounds have exhibited anticancer properties against myeloid leukemia K562, gastric carcinoma MNK-45, and cervical carcinoma Hela cell lines. According to the phytochemical investigation, iridoid and phenylalkanoid glycosides have been identified in 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> and we presume that the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> may be attributed to the presence of these compounds; however, they should be explored in further studies.
