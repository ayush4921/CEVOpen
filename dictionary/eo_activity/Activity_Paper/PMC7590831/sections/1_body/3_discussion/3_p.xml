<p>Accumulated evidence demonstrated that p53 is a vital tumor suppressor gene that promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. p53 can specifically activate expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax and repress anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 (Al-Fatlawi et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; Mitupatum et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; Messeha et al., 2019[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). The Bax gene product localizes to the mitochondria, mediates the permeabilization of the outer membrane, and enhances the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which leads to activation of caspase cascade gene and subsequent apoptosis (Peña-Blanco and García-Sáez, 2018[
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; Xiong et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; Gheda et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). In contrast, Bcl-2 gene encodes a protein that prevents apoptosis by binding and antagonizing with Bax (Al-Fatlawi et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Caspases belong to a large family of cysteine proteases that play crucial roles during the apoptotic process. Caspase 9 as an initiator caspase is involved in the activation of the executioner caspase-3 and the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis (Palai and Mishra, 2015[
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; Kalkhoran et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). In the current study, we observed that treatment of cancer cells with DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> led to a decrease in the mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 and increases in p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax. These results suggest that 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts can induce apoptosis through mitochondria mediated signaling pathway. Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptotic activity of S
