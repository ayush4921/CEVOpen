 <italic>Scrophularia amplexicaulis </italic>Benth. is one of the Iranian endemic species of Scrophulariaceae family. Phytochemical analysis of the aerial parts of this species revealed the presence of two phenylalkanoid glycosides, salidroside and verbascoside, and two iridoid glycosides, scropolioside D and scrophuloside B4 (Pasdaran et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). The lack of any information about the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> prompted us to investigate the cytotoxic effects of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>extracts against MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells and determine their underlying molecular mechanisms. The mouse firosarcoma cell line WEHI-164 was selected to confirm the aforementioned effect with the aim of performing further 
 <italic>in vivo </italic>studies.
