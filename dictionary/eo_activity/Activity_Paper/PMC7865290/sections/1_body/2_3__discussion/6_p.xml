<p>The antibacterial effect of our fractions can be attributed to the effect of benzoic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00636-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) since earlier work reported the inhibitory effect of benzoic acid on the proliferation of bacteria and yeasts [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PR-AMPs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00636-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) characterized by a high content of proline residues can play a role in inhibiting several pathogenic bacteria and yeasts [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Cinnamic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00636-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) was found to have antibacterial activity by disrupting bacteria membranes [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Benzenepropanoic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00636-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>,) was also reported to be effective against different bacteria such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and some fungi including 
 <italic>candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, carboxylic acids, including oxalic acid and propanoic acid identified by GC-MS analysis in the hydroethanol fraction of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00636-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), might be involved in antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of these compounds facilitates their penetration between the lipid components of bacterial membrane and mitochondria, which increases the membrane permeability and leads to the eventual death of bacteria [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This mechanism of action could be involved in the antibacterial effect induced by our plant fractions. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect can result from individual compounds or synergy between a lot [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The findings found in this work are in agreement with the previous literature, which showed that essential oils from 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> exhibited antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Potential antifungal effects of 
 <italic>Caralluma. europaea</italic> essential oil might also be reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
