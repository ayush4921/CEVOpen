<p>After one hour of gastric gavage, the inflammation was induced by injecting 0.1 mL of the carrageenan agent in 0.9% saline solution into the right-hand paw of rats. The initial paw size was taken before the injection of carrageenan and after 3, 4, 5, and 6 h of treatment. The average increase in the paw size of each group was determined and compared to both the positive and the negative control. The percentage of inhibition of edema was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>% inhibition = ((St-S0) control − (St-So) treated/(St-S0) control) × 100</disp-formula> where is the paw size after the carrageenan injection and S0 is the initial paw size before the carrageenan injection.
