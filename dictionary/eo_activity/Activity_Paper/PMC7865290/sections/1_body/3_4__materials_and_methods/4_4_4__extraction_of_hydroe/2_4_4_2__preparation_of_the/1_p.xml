<p>The dried powder of 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> aerial parts (10 g) was extracted three times with 30 mL of methanol. Thereafter, the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and low temperature. The dry extract obtained was dissolved in 50 mL of water and successively extracted three times again with 20 mL of hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. Afterward, the ethyl acetate layer was evaporated at 40 °C under vacuum using a rotary evaporator (Model BÜCHI 461). The residue was redissolved in 30 mL of water and freeze-dried to obtain the polyphenol extract [
