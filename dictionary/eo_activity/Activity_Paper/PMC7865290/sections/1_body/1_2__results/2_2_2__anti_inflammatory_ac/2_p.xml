<p>The oral administration of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions at doses 100, 100, and 50 mg/Kg induced significant anti-inflammatory effects when compared to the indomethacin drug (positive control). The animals treated with 100 mg/Kg of n-butanol fraction showed maximum inhibition of the paw edema, which reached 69.50%, 76.32%, and 76.70% after 4, 5, and 6 h of treatment respectively. No significant difference was observed between these results and indomethacin used as a standard drug at a dose of 10 mg/Kg (
