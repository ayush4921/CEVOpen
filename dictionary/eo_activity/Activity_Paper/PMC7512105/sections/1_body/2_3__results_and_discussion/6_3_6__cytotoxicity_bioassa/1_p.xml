<p>The results of cytotoxicity bioassays with n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol from the root extracts showed good larvicidal activities for all extracts; high mortality was observed with high concentration (1 g/L) representing 1000 ppm dose of methanol extracts, and low mortality was observed in low to moderate concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 g/L) representing 10 ppm and 100 ppm. 100% mortality was not obtained at all concentrations. In general, n-hexane and ethyl acetate were showed safe effects and methanol showed moderate effect;
