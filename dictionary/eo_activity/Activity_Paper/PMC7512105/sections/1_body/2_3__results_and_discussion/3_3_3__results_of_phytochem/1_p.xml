 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1">Figure 1</xref> showed the different testing of preliminary phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>Senna occidentalis</italic> root; it gave the colors with few modifications according to the colors of extracts indicating the presence of the high concentrations of the various active phytoconstituents metabolites as follows: alkaloids (Dragendorff's Orange brown, Mayer's Yellow to creamshies, Hager's Yellow, and Wagner's reddish brown with precipitations), triterpenes (Liebermann–Burchard deep purple/violet and Salkowski deep red to brown color ring at the junction of the two layers), tannins (ferric chloride blackish blue to violet and salt gelatin white with precipitations), saponins (white foam at the upper layer persisting for 10 minutes), flavonoids (sodium hydroxide yellow, ammonium hydroxide deep yellow, Aluminum Chloride yellow-creamshies and magnesium turnate piece-sulfuric acid reddish), and sugars (Molisch's violets to green ring at the junction of the two layers; Benedict's few reducing monosaccharides; and Barfoed's high reducing disaccharides) followed by a moderate amount of proteins (Biuret violet and Coumarins blue fluorescence under UV light with KOH alcoholic), but low amount of amino acids (Ninhydrin purple color and xanthopreotic yellow-orange) and moderate amount of aromatic amino acids may be produced from degradation of proteins and glycosides (Anthraquinane pink-red and Cardiac A brown ring), respectively, in this part. Similar to the previous studies on other parts of this plant by Lawal et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], on 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>occidentalis</italic> leaves, the results found show that the leaves extracts contain glycosides (anthraquinones and cardiac), phenolic compounds such as terpene (has antivirial properties), flavonoids (have antiflammation and antioxidant), tannins (for wound healing), coumarins, and saponins with absence of alkaloids (have bloods pressure decrease and nervous system balancing). Also, similar findings were reported in [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>, tthyl acetate and methanol extracts of this plant, under 254 nm UV light, showed the presence of eight and twelve spots, respectively, where different

The Et Ac and MeOH extracts were subjected to the phytochemical screening for the detection of various plant constituents. It was found that terpenoids, flavanoids, and phenolic compounds were present as the major active principle [
