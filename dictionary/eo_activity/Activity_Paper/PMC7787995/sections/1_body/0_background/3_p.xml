<p id="par0035">Essential oils are traditionally used commonly in food processing or as medicines in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fresh or dried leaves of thymus species are used as condiments and ingredients in the preparation of “
 <italic>berbere”</italic> and 
 <italic>“shirro”</italic> (pepper and bean/pea flour) as well as Metata ayb (traditionally fermented cottage cheese) in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>Echinops kebericho</italic> Mesfin (family, Asteraceae) is among the commonly used EO-producing endemic medicinal plants in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ethno-pharmacological survey showed 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic>’s tremendous use in the treatment of infectious disease, stomachache, headache, heart disease, migraine, mental illness, kidney disease, where the smoke is inhaled in most cases [

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The traditional use of inhalation could imply volatile component’s therapeutic effect. It has been confirmed that the major constituent of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EO is dehydrocostus lactone [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which was proved to exert anticancer activity [

 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies revealed various pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EOs such as antibacterial and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], anti-mycobacterial activity (against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>) with significant resistance modulatory effects [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], stronger activity against leishmania [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], insect repellent activity [
