<p>The preliminary findings of this study revealed that because the extracts of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> have a wide spectrum of activity against selected bacteria, they may have potential beyond their current use in ethnomedicine. However, further detailed investigation and isolation of compounds from the extracts should be done so enable more precise testing for the development of newer and safer antibacterial agents. This work can be a basis for elucidation of the actual mechanism of action of these plants.
