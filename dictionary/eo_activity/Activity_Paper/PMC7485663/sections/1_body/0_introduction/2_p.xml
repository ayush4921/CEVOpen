<p>Antimicrobials remain valuable resources for treating and preventing infectious disease despite the global increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR).[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, AMR is a key issue in public health and has increased the rates of morbidity, mortality and socioeconomic costs.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The increase in multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria is limiting the choices of effective antibacterial treatment, as this phenomenon has not been paralleled by the development of new antibiotics.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Consequently, by the year 2050, an increase in AMR is estimated to annually put 10,000,000 lives at risk.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, there is an urgent need for newer antibacterial agents with novel mechanisms of action.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Some areas for discovering such antibacterials are natural products of plant origin and antimicrobial peptides.[
