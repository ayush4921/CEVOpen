<p>To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study on the antibacterial activity and phytoconstituents of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> extracts. Here, the qualitative phytochemical analysis of the extracts of both plants verified the existence of different secondary metabolites [
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>], which are well known to produce antimicrobial effects in other plants.[
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Thus, the antibacterial activity of both the plants in this study may be associated with the availability of these chemicals that act synergistically or individually.
