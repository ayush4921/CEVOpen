<p>In terms of the extracts of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic>, the acetone extract had significantly higher efficacy against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> than the 80% methanol and chloroform extracts [
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. The acetone extract consisted of saponins, which was absent in the chloroform extract and may be the differentiating factor for this higher efficacy. This also justifies the localization of active compounds in acetone extract, as 80% methanol and chloroform extract exhibit lesser effect on this microorganism. Against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, all crude extracts of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> showed comparable effects. This may describe the relativity of active phytoconstituent composition among those extracts and/or may be because these are Gram-positive bacteria.
