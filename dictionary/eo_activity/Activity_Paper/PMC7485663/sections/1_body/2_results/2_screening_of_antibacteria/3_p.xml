<p>In terms of comparison across the various extracts, it was found that all the tested extracts were lesser effective against 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> than 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, except the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic>. The methanol extracts of both the plants exhibited the same inhibition diameter (15 mm) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, but the inhibition diameter of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> methanol extract was greater against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> compared with that of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> (19.33 mm vs. 16.33 mm, respectively). Against 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> and the methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> had the same inhibition diameter (14 mm). Of all the extracts, the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> had the highest inhibition diameter (21.67 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, followed by 19.67 mm against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>). In terms of the acetone extracts, the zones of inhibitions of both the extracts against the Gram-positive bacteria were almost identical but differed by about 1 mm against the Gram-negative bacteria.
