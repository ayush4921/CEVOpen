<p>From 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> extract groups, the largest area of inhibition was attained by the acetone extract against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (20 mm) followed by methanol extract against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (19.33 mm). All of its extracts showed an inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, with no significant differences between them. However, the methanol and chloroform extracts had a significantly smaller zone of growth inhibition (
 <italic>P</italic> â‰¤ 0.001) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as compared with the acetone extract [
