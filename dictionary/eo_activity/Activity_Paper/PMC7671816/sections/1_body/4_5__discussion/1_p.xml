<p>Antibacterial activities were assayed to determine the zone of inhibition towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. The root, stem, and leaves extract of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> were found to have a negligible zone of inhibition, but flower and leaves of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> were found to have no zone of inhibition as compared to the reference drug ofloxacin and cefpodoxime even at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, but no zone of inhibition was shown by any selected plants extract at 1 mg/ml which is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. This activity was comparatively lower than that observed in methanolic leaves extract of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> by the agar diffusion method against Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>), at a concentration of 15 mg/ml [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and methanolic root extract of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> at a concentration of 1000 mcg/ml (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) by the cup plate method [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. No zones of inhibition were seen for both ethanolic leaves and root extracts of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> at 2 mg/ml by using a well diffusion method towards 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> It may be due to the solvent effect as well as concentration effect.
