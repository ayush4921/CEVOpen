<p>The antioxidant activities were assayed by DPPH free radical scavenging and NO scavenging assays. The DPPH free radical is a simple and acceptable method to evaluate the antioxidant activity of plant extracts. The DPPH forms a stable molecule on accepting an electron or a hydrogen atom and thus has applications in the determination of radical scavenging activity of natural products as well as synthetic compounds [

 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> exhibited high antioxidant activity by DPPH free radical scavenging assay with an IC

 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, respectively, which was very close to that of standard (ascorbic acid) shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It may suggest that the extract might contain an electron donor molecule that reacts with free radicals to convert them to more stable products and terminate radical chain [
