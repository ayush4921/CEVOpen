<p>Shade-dried samples were extracted by a double maceration process using ethanol as solvent. For this, 25 g of each sample was weighed and macerated in 175 ml ethanol (ethanol: crude drug = 7 : 1) for 24 hr. After 24 hr, filtration was done by using filter paper and the obtained residue was again macerated with 175 ml, i.e., the same volume of ethanol for 24 hr. Then, obtained filtrates were mixed and solvent evaporation was done by using a rotatory vacuum evaporator and collected in the Petri dish. Again, the samples were kept in a vacuum desiccator for the complete removal of the solvent present in the extract. The obtained dried extracts were collected in a sample vial. They were labeled with symbols using alphabetical letters and preserved in the refrigerator.</p>
