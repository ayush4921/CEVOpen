<p>The well diffusion method was done to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extract according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with some modifications. Wells (8 mm diameter and about 2 cm apart) were made in each of the plates using a sterile cork borer. A stock solution of each plant extract was prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. A volume of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of stock solution of plant extract was added by sterile syringe into the wells and allowed to diffuse at room temperature for 2 hr. Ofloxacin and cefpodoxime were taken as positive control where 10% DMSO solution was taken as a negative control. Then, medium plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr in an incubator. After 24 hr, zones of inhibition were measured.
