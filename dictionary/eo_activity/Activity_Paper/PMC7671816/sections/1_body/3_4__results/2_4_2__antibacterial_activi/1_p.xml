<p>Each of different parts of plant extract, i.e., root, stem, and leaves of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic>, and flower and leaves of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> were used to measure and compare the zone of inhibitions with the standard antibiotics ofloxacin and cefpodoxime at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml in 10% DMSO in test microorganisms, i.e., two Gram-negative bacteria, which are 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, and one Gram-positive bacteria, which are 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The standard drug, ofloxacin had shown zone of inhibition towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (45 mm), 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> (48 mm), and S. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> (34 mm), respectively. Similarly, cefpodoxime had shown zone of inhibition towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (36 mm), 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> (34 mm), and S. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> (24 mm), respectively. The root extract of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> was found to have a weak zone of inhibition towards 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, i.e., 12 mm, and leaves and stem extracts were found to have a weak zone of inhibition towards 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, i.e., 11 mm and 11 mm, respectively. However, the flower and leaves extract of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> were found to have no zone of inhibition towards the selected bacteria even in 2 mg/ml of concentration. At a concentration of 1 mg/ml, none of the extracts had shown a zone of inhibition towards the selected organism.
