<p>Even though taro corm (or taro) is a rich source of health-promoting compounds, this crop, as well as tubercle consumption worldwide, is highly neglected probably because it is mainly associated with subsistence agriculture [

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-22-00265" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In general, taro crops, as several subsistence crops, are cultivated in small farms, with low capital endowment, far from urban centers and with no access to capital markets, and low-off farm income [

The food processing sector can overcome these constraints and enhance taro crop availability and acceptance by urban populations by replacing corn and wheat in processed foods, enhancing raw product commercialization. In addition, this may also lead to attention regarding taro crops as a rich source of remarkable and unique compounds, whose pharmacological activities have been demonstrated both in in vitro and in animal models.
