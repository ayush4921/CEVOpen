<p>Under normal conditions, NF-κB is held inactive in the cytosol by the inhibitor of NF-κB proteins, inhibitor kappa B (IκB) (α, β, ε). Upon binding to different immune receptors, the IκB kinase complexes phosphorylate IκB and thereby induces its proteasomal degradation and the release of NF-κB. The released transcription factor NF-κB can translocate to the nucleus and mediates the expression of target genes. Polyphenols may act either by suppressing kinases complex phosphorylation, which avoids NF-κB translocation to the nucleus or inhibits the interaction of this transcription factor with targeted DNA genes. Both mechanisms can down-regulate the inflammatory cascade, inducing apoptosis, controlling both cell proliferation and metastasis [
