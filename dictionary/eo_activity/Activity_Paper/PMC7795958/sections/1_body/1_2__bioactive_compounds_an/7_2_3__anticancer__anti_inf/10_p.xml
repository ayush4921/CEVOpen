<p>Since tarin belongs to the 
 <italic>Galanthus nivalis</italic> agglutinin (GNA)-related lectins, sharing specificity and structural characteristics with them, its mechanism of action could be extrapolated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00265-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Different mechanisms of action were described for these lectin members and attributed to their binding to mannose-containing antigens. These mechanisms can be linked to PGE2 overexpression, which is a typical condition in cancer. GNA-related lectins exert their cytotoxic activities on cancer cells mainly by deactivating rat sarcoma-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Ras–Raf) and PI3K–Akt pathways previously activated by PGE2 autocrine action through the prostaglandin E receptor 1-4 (EP1-4) receptor, inhibiting the proliferation, migration/invasion, and survival of cancer cells. Once the anti-apoptotic pathways are inhibited, cell death can be induced through apoptosis or autophagy triggered by mitochondria injury following the accumulation of ROS and cytochrome 
 <italic>c</italic> release, culminating in the activation of ROS-p38-p53 and caspase-dependent pathways [
