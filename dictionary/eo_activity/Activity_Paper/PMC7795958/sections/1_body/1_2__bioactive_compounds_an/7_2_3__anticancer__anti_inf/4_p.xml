<p>Tarin nano-encapsulated in liposomes improved anticancer activity compared to the free protein against human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and glioblastoma (U87 MG) lineages, resulting in 41 and 65% inhibition, respectively. Nano-encapsulated tarin was as effective as cisplatin and temozolomide in controlling glioblastoma cell proliferation. However, the advantage relies on the non-cytotoxicity of both forms of tarin, free or nano-encapsulated, in effective concentrations when added to healthy cells [
