<p>Taro extracts have also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity against human and murine breast cancer cells by modulating the immune response through the reduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release accompanied by the abolishment of mRNA synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and decrease of COX-1 [

The tarin down-regulation of COX-2 gene depressed E-series prostaglandins by almost 70%, especially PGE2, which is an inflammatory mediator known to exert pro-tumorigenic effects, contributing to (i) the generation of additional mutations in cancer cells by stimulating the release of ROS; (ii) upregulation of a series of critical molecules such as Bcl-2, conferring resistance to apoptosis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involved in angiogenesis, type 2 and 9 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which confer invasive ability, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), facilitating cell proliferation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and membrane proteases also involved in invasion; (iii) suppression of antitumoral response by downregulating the immune system; (iv) activation of wingless-related integration (WNT)/Î²-catenin pathway that favor metastasis and maintain stem cell skills; (v) activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway that promotes cell proliferation and survival. As a result, the angiogenesis process, cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration would be prevented [
