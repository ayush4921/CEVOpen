<p>Taro components are traditionally known to boost the immunological response, which could be an indirect way to contribute to reducing cancer risk or controlling tumorigenesis (

Indeed, in mice, tarin proved to stimulate the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of bone marrow (BM) and spleen cells while protecting BM progenitor cells from death. B lymphocytes and granulocytic cells were identified among the proliferating cells when taro extract was intraperitoneally administered (1 mg/animal). Moreover, tarin-sensitized splenocytes were stimulated to release IL-2, IL-1b, TNF- α, and INF- γ, which are essential cytokines involved in the anticancer response, as mentioned previously [
