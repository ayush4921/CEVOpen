<p>Taro flour offered to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic rats restored glycemia after four weeks of intake. Proteinuria and glucosuria, kidney function, relative kidney weight, hepatic function, glycated hemoglobin, and body overweight, which are associated with type II diabetes, were also attenuated following taro consumption. Plasmatic levels of total cholesterol, VLDL- and LDL-cholesterols, triacylglycerol, serum pancreatic lipase, atherogenic, and coronary risk were all reverted, and the HDL-cholesterol levels were enhanced [

The anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects observed herein point out that taro may have the potential to manage diabetes and obesity. These effects are mainly attributed to flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, steroids, and tannins, but the participation of minerals (Mg, Ca, K, P, Fe, and Zn) and crude dietetic fiber have not been discarded [
