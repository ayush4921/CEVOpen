<p>The anti-hyperlipidemic activity exerted by taro could be explored as a source of natural inhibitors of human 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is the key point enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and the molecular target for drugs used to treat hypercholesterolemia. The continued use of such drugs by healthy individuals for hypercholesteremia prevention or long-term treatments may cause side effects. Based on this, the search for natural inhibitors was focused on enzymes downstream to HMG-CoA reductase, such as lanosterol synthase. From an extensive list of 130 plant extracts, one obtained from freeze-dried taro was able to cause a 55% inhibition of lanosterol synthase activity, which is an impressive result considering that less than 32 extracts showed a very slight effect, under 5% inhibition. Eight lipids purified from taro extract, three of them classified as monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs), and five as digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs), inhibited in vitro lanosterol synthase activity by 28â€“67%. The therapeutic potential of MGDGs and DGDGs should be further explored in preclinical studies, since similar lipids isolated from microalgae have already been reported as inhibiting tumor-promoting agents [
