<p id="Par71">The world is in the middle of a COVID-19 pandemic. Although the deadly threat posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic requires the development of new therapeutic agents, there are currently no efficacious and safe vaccines or drugs to prevent or treat this highly infectious disease. Even in developed nations, blockbuster vaccines or drugs have not yet been developed or approved for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Only one synthetic drug (remdesivir) has been approved for emergency use in the USA. Compared with placebo, remdesivir did not significantly reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients in clinical trials. Against this backdrop, this review provides a modest but insightful snapshot of medicinal plants, fungi, and marine organisms that contain putative active compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2.</p>
