<p id="Par70">The most notable gap identified in the current literature is that many countries in Africa, Asia (except China), Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America lag behind in terms of research efforts on anti-coronavirus remedies from medicinal plants and other natural products. In many countries all over the world, there is need to conduct detailed ethnobotanical studies to establish putative anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicinal plants and their active compounds. The search for new anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents should be rigorously extended to marine organisms. This review shows that there is a dearth of experimental data on posology and cytotoxicity of plant extracts and active compounds with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against SARS-CoV-2. More studies on pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) and SARS-CoV-2 immunomodulatory agents from plants and other natural products should be conducted. There is also lack of pharmacological and rigorous human clinical trial data in relation to natural products for treating COVID-19.
