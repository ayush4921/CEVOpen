<p id="Par68">This review shows that plants, fungi, and marine organisms have anti-SARS-CoV properties. Many of these plants, fungi, and marine organisms have other pharmacological benefits because structural diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions induce them to synthesize defensive compounds with assorted biological activities (Prinsloo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>). Corollary, diverse plant secondary metabolites are an important library of novel lead compounds that may be functional against SARS-CoV-2. Bio-assay-guided fractionation of medicinal plant extracts may provide a quicker pipeline for the discovery of novel compounds against SARS-CoV-2.
