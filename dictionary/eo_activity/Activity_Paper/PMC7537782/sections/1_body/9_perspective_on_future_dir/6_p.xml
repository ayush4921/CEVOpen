<p id="Par66">Moreover, plant active compounds should be subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2020</xref>). Analysis of structure-activity relationships may be helpful in understanding the mechanisms of certain active compounds such as myricetin (

 <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking simulations should be done to investigate the binding affinities of plant active compounds to SARS-CoV-2. A docking analysis can test whether the active compound has the potential to directly interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2020</xref>). Application of structure-based drug design strategies may aid in the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors from natural compounds. To predict the general
