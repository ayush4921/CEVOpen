<p id="Par3">Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause acute and chronic respiratory, enteric, and central nervous system diseases in many species of animals including humans. While the history of CoVs dates as far back as the 1940s, identification of the first human CoVs (HCoVs) as causative agents of mild respiratory infections was reported in the 1960s. These HCoVs were named human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-OC43 (Pillaiyar et al.

The replication and pathogenesis of CoVs were actively studied by virologists in the 1970s, leading to the discovery of four other human CoVs, namely HCoV-Hong Kong University 1 (HCoV-HKU1), human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (Pillaiyar et al.
