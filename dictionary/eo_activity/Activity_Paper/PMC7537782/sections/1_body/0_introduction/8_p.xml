<p id="Par10">Pillaiyar et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>) reviewed recent developments in the discovery and development of synthetic drugs to treat HCoVs. However, these drugs have not achieved extended distribution for clinical application because they have not yet been tested in rigorous randomized controlled clinical trials (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>). Zhou et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2020a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">b</xref>) reported that there were no effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>) also stated no efficacious and safe antiviral drugs or vaccines were available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. Supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate COVID-19 symptoms of the patient are the main options available.
