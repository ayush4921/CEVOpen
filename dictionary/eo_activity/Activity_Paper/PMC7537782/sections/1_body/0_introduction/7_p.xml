<p id="Par9">Currently, the seven identified human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 strains (Andersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Molecular evolutionary analysis shows that all HCoVs originate in animals; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E are derived from bats; HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are sourced from rodents (Forni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>). The 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs belong to alpha coronaviruses while OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 belong to beta coronaviruses (Elfiky
