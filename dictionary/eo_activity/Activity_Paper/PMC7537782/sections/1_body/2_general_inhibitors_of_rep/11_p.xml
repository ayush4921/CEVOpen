<p id="Par37">Tylophorine (
 <bold>17</bold>), a phenanthraindolizidine alkaloid, has anti-HCoV activity in the nanomolar concentrations, up to 1000 nM (Islam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). Tylophorine derivatives, including naturally occurring and synthetic phenanthroindolizidines and phenanthroquinolizidines, have been identified as potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitors of enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). This class of potent compounds showed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 8 to 1468 nM as determined by immunofluorescent assay of the expression of TGEV spike and nucleocapsid proteins and by real-time qRT-PCR analysis of viral yields. Tylophorine compounds could be novel leads for further drug development on their own or as templates for drug design (Islam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). Tylophorine and related alkaloids, isolated from 
 <italic>Tylophora indica</italic> Merr., inhibit TGEV replication for anti-coronavirus activity and suppress nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells, a measure of antiinflammation (Lee et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2012a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">b</xref>). Additionally, a pharmacokinetic study demonstrated high and comparable oral bioavailabilities of tylophorine (65.7%) in rats (Lee et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">b</xref>).
