<p id="p0160">In the lead acetate treated group, the increase in kidney relative weight reflected renal hypertrophy following previous studies. Another possible explanation for relative increase in kidney weight in the lead acetate treated group may be initial DNA replication and proximal tubular proliferation induced by lead acetate. Treatment of rats with EA possibly prevented these events from taking place. These observations suggest that EA may protect kidney tissue from lead acetate induced hypertrophy [
