<p id="p0145">Lead toxicity causes free radical damage by formation of hydroperoxides, singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxides. It can be evaluated by Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as it is the final product of lipid peroxidation. In the present study, a significant increase of MDA level has been observed in kidney of rodents that were treated with lead acetate compared to negative control, which signifies increased oxidative stress in the lead acetate treated group. It was observed that in the tissues of rodents treated with EA50, EA25, MDA levels are significantly lower compared with rodents group which did not receive the EA doses but were dosed with lead acetate. This indicates attenuation of lipid peroxidation by EA. Intense lipid peroxidation caused by lead exposure may be responsible for damage to the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic membranes causing severe oxidative damage in tissues. As a consequence, tissues release lipid hydroperoxides into circulation which reflects induction of oxidative stress. It is known that lead acetate-induced oxidative stress tissue damage could be caused by two mechanisms: increased generation of ROS and by causing direct depletion of antioxidant reserves. As observed in this study, EA decreased MDA level in kidney tissue homogenate caused by lead acetate which signifies powerful antioxidant and free radical scavenging property [
