<p id="p0055">Twenty four hours following terminal treatment, animals were anaesthetized with light ether anesthesia following which blood was withdrawn by retro-orbital puncture. Blood serum was separated from collected blood by centrifugation. The serum was used for estimation of urea, uric acid, creatinine, and albumin using enzymatic assays (Agappe Diagnostics Limited) by a semi-autoanalyser instrument (Robonik, Mumbai). Thereafter the animals were sacrificed; kidneys extracted from euthanized animals were weighed and used for preparation of homogenate. The homogenate preparation was utilized for estimation of antioxidants like catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX-2, iNOS and performance of assay of LC3B expression level. Remainder of renal tissues were embedded in saline solution (10%) of formalin for histological examination [
