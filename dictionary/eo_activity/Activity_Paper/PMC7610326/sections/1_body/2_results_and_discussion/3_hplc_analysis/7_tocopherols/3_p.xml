 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, it can be observed that the pulp contains only γ- and δ-tocopherols and their amount decreased significantly with the microwave, sun, hot and freeze drying by 98.82%, 98.8%, 68.64%, 97.82% and 84.69%, 96.82%, 86.04%, 98.56% respectively. γ-tocopherol insignificantly varied for BS and BM (p = 0.62). A significant variation was observed for all the other bael samples. The maximum retention of δ-tocopherol was observed in BM (15.18%), while the same for γ-tocopherol was observed in BH (31.69%). The relative higher content of the tocopherol in BH and BM might be due to the fact that the occurrence of the tocopherol within the lipid segment of the samples; which by virtue shielded the thermal destruction of tocopherol (

 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Van Hoed et al., 2009</xref>). The higher value of standard deviation for BH may have resulted from the uneven distribution of lipid segment and less uniform exposure to degrading drying conditions. A similar observation was also observed by 
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Uribe et al. (2019)</xref> for α-tocopherol. While being absent in BP, α-tocopherol was found for BM (0.07 ± 0.00 mg/100 g), BS (0.13 ± 0.00 mg/100 g), whereas presence of β-tocopherol was detected in BM (0.48 ± 0.01 mg/100 g), BS (0.47 ± 0.00 mg/100 g) and BH (0.50 ± 0.01 mg/100 g).
