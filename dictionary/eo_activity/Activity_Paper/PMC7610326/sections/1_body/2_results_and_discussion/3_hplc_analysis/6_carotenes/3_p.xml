<p id="p0240">There was no published study which compared the α-, β-, γ- and δ-carotene content of fresh 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) pulp and it's differently dried leathers treated until the present observation. The changes in the amount of these carotenes with different drying are provided in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. From the data, we can observe that the presence of α-carotene is highest in the pulp, which decreased by 97.48%, 67.44%, 68.41% for the BS, BH, and BF, respectively. Followed by γ- and β-, while δ-carotene is the lowest. We found 51.67 ± 1.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/100 g β-carotene in the pulp, which is in accordance with the study done by 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al. (2013)</xref> for 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) fruit must. It was also observed that the values increased in BS (151.58 ± 0.34 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/100 g), BF (153.43 ± 0.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/100 g), and BH (55.38 ± 0.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/100 g) by 1.93 folds, 1.97 folds, and 7.37%, respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. (2012)</xref> also found a similar enhancement in the values between fresh, freeze, sun, and hot air dried jujube fruit. For, α-carotene the content was insignificantly altered for BH and BF, while a similar observation was there for β-, γ- and δ-carotene during sun and freeze drying. The overall carotene content was observed to be the highest in the pulp, while the overall carotene retention was the highest in BH followed by BF, BS, and BM. Previously, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bechoff et al. (2009)</xref> also did a similar study, they observed higher retention of pro-vitamin A for hot air dried sweet potato than for sun drying.
