<p id="p0200">Vitamin B group encompasses a class of water-soluble compounds and consists of 8 major groups which are thiamine (vit B
 <sub>1</sub>), niacin (vit B
 <sub>3</sub>), pyridoxine (vit B
 <sub>6</sub>), pantothenic acid (vit B
 <sub>5</sub>), biotin (vit B
 <sub>7</sub>), cobalamins (vit B
 <sub>12</sub>), riboflavin (vit B
 <sub>2</sub>), and folate (vit B
 <sub>9</sub>). Most of these get deteriorated rapidly in UV-light, oxygen, and high temperatures. Riboflavin (vit B
 <sub>2</sub>) and pantothenic acid (vit B
 <sub>5</sub>) get deteriorated at a fast pace under higher temperatures while thiamine (B
 <sub>1</sub>), folate (B
 <sub>9</sub>) are extremely sensitive to both, oxygenated and high-temperature conditions.
