<p id="p0195">The amount of ascorbic acid was observed to be the highest for BP (8.40 ± 0.01 mg/100 g) and due to different drying methods, a significant decrement (p = 4.99 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) in the content was observed. Here, high aerial oxidation and long drying time may cause higher degradation for BH and BS, only 50.86%, and 44.57% retentions were observed. Also the application of higher temperature speeds up the ascorbic acid oxidation specifically for hot air drying. 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Maharaj and Sanket (1996)</xref> observed higher content of ascorbic acid in case of forced convective drying compared to natural convective drying for Dasheen leaves. Minimal destruction was observed for BF, which may be due to low-temperature processing followed by BM, owing to higher dehydration rate and shorter drying time (
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Qing-guo et al., 2006</xref>). For BF and BM, the retentions were 71.44% and 57.28%, respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2006)</xref> found better retention of vitamin C for freeze-dried sample compared to vacuum assisted microwave drying, whereas air drying stood last for carrot slices. Due to the heat-labile characteristics of ascorbic acid, it was expected to have a higher variation between BP, BF, and other dried leathers. Though BH showed high retention (50.83%) of vitamin C, but the result is in agreement within the range of 44.28–63.85% previously reported by 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2006)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al. (1997)</xref> for hot air dried tomatoes (I-Tien-Hung variety) and seaweed, respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Uribe et al. (2019)</xref> also reported an increase by 11.05% of vitamin C in the convective dried brown alga. It can be concluded that the retention of vitamin C is also dependent on sample characteristics.
