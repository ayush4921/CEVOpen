 <italic>μ</italic>g/100 g), a similar observation was previously reported by 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Alajaji and El-Adawy (2006)</xref> for chickpea. A significant overall reduction in amount was observed due to the drying methods (p = 4.25 × 10
 <sup>−12</sup>). The amount of thiamine decreased by 71.87%, 59.51%, and 20.78% for BM, BS, and BF, respectively. Previously, a similar trend between untreated bulgur, hot air, and sun dried bulgur was also observed (
