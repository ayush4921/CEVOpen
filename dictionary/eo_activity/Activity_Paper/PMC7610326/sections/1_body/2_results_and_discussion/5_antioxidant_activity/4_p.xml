<p id="p0275">The DPPH assay has been done by considering that the antioxidant is a hydrogen donor, owing to the fact that the purple-colored DPPH• (α,α-diphenyl-β-picryl hydrazine) is reduced to yellow colored DPPH-H upon the reaction with a hydrogen atom. Here the ability of different extracts of fresh and differently dried samples to donate hydrogen was measured. Among them, BM revealed the highest activity (64.81 ± 0.28%), while the BS showed the lowest activity (37.13 ± 0.25%). Different drying procedures caused a significant change in the activity (p = 8.21 × 10
 <sup>−21</sup>). A similar trend was reported previously, by
