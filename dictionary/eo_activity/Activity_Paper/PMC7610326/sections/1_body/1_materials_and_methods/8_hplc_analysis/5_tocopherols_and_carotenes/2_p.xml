<p id="p0090">To determine tocopherols and carotene content, 0.10 g of pyrogallic acid, 1.00 g sample, 3 ml (50%) KOH, and 7 ml ethanol were added, agitated, and heated up using a water bath at 50 °C for 40 min. To neutralize the preparation double-distilled water was used, further anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) was used to dehydrate it. The preparation was concentrated to 5 ml (approx.) with a water bath maintaining 50 °C, followed by dilution to 10.00 ml by using methanol and filtered with 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m Millipore filter (
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Sami et al., 2014</xref>). The filtrate was injected into the RP-HPLC system. The preparation was eluted using 100% methanol through a C
 <sub>18</sub> column of 4.6 mm internal diameter at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by maintaining 35 °C and absorbance was recorded at 292 nm and 450 nm respectively for tocopherols and carotenes. In total 8 standards were used α, β, γ, and δ forms for both tocopherols and carotenes.
