<p id="p0080">The quantification of the organic acids and vitamin C was carried out using an RP-HPLC system (Alliance 2695 HPLC system, Waters Corporation, Massachusetts, USA). We followed 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Sami et al. (2014)</xref>, to extract vitamin C using metaphosphoric acid (0.3 M) and acetic acid (1.4 M). For quantification, extracts were injected in the system and eluted with 10 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> solution (pH 2.5). The separation was done using a C
 <sub>18</sub> column of 4.6 mm internal diameter (3.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m pore size) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and chromatogram was observed at 214 nm (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). In total nine organic acids were quantified namely, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, and L-ascorbic acid.
