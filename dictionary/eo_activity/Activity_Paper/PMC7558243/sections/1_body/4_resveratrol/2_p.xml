<p id="Par11">Resveratrol is mainly present in pigments of several fruits and vegetables, for instance rhubarb, blueberries, many red grapes, raspberries, mulberries, peanuts and also in dark chocolate and red wine. Resveratrol received intensive studies due to its diverse biological activities, including, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, cardio protective, and antiviral activity, it also possesses other properties such as a preventive and defensive mean towards obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome; it can also beneficially regulate the immune system [
