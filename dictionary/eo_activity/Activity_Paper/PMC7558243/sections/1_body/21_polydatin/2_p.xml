<p id="Par45">Polydatin, an active compound isolated from the root of 
 <italic>Polygonumcus pidatum Sieb. et Zucc</italic>, has been widely used for treatment of hyperlipemia, inflammation, infection and cancer, fever, cough, hypertension and other pharmacological benefits. Polydatin is also detected in grape, peanut, hop cones, red wines, hop pellets, cocoa-containing products, chocolate products and many daily diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>]. Unlike resveratrol, which passively penetrates cells, polydatin enters cells via an active mechanism using glucose carrier and it is more resistant to enzymatic oxidation than resveratrol and possesses much better solubility in water [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>]. Polydatin has numerous benefits which is widely reported including anti‐inflammatory effect in chronic lung diseases, anti-oxidative, anti-platelet aggregative, anti-fibrosis, anti-cancer, benefits for neurological diseases and anxiolytic effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>]. A study has demonstrated that polydatin improves lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, polydatin has mediated Parkin-dependent mitophagy and protects against mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in ARDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>] niae (MP) infection, MP can infect both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, was found to be suppressed by polydatin treatment through inhibition of the NACHT domain-, leucine-rich repeat-, and pyd-containing protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) and the nuclear factor-κB pathway after MP infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">211</xref>]. Actually, several in vivo studies have reported an important protective role of polydatin treatment via different mechanisms in ovalbumin-induced bronchial asthma as well as in LPS-induced acute lung injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>]. Moreover, polydatin protects the respiratory system from the damage caused by fine particulate matters (aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 μm; PM2.5) during air pollution that may cause deleterious effects such as premature death among individuals due to lung disease, lung dysfunction and asthma exacerbation, mainly by the capacity of polydatin to reduce the injury from oxidative stress and inflammation in lung tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>]. Moreover, polydatin can attenuate hypoxic pulmonary hypertension through Protein Kinase C Mechanisms (PKC) and it might be a promising candidate for hypoxic pulmonary treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>]. Polydatin was found, among other phenolic compounds extracted from of 
 <italic>Polygonum cuspidatum</italic>, to inhibit influenza A virus replication in A549 cells through toll-like receptor 9-induced (TLR9) interferon beta (IFN-β) expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>]. A recent docking study has reveal that polydatin, is a potent COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor, among other natural phenolic compounds that have been demonstrated to have an anti-coronavirus activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>]. Therefore, regarding the enormous protective roles of this natural phenolic compound on the respiratory system, it is concluding that polydatin could be consecrated as a potential molecule against COVID-19 infections and its related symptoms.
