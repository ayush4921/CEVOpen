 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> contains, other than neobavaisoflavone, several active compounds including psoralen, isopsoralen, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, bavachin and bakuchiol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> seeds have been reported to possess a high activity against the SARS‐CoV papain‐like protease (PLpro) which is the main enzyme involved in SARS virus replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref>]. In fact, six phenolic compounds with an antiviral activity were isolated from the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> identified as, bavachinin, neobavaisoflavone, isobavachalcone, 4′-O-methylbavachalcone, psoralidin and corylifol A. Isobavachalcone and psoralidin were the greatest antiviral inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">222</xref>]. Actually, Neobavaisoflavone has numerous biological properties such as antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-cancer, anti-osteoporosis and anti-platelet aggregation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223">223</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR224">224</xref>]. In vitro, neobavaisoflavone significantly inhibited the production of ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, and TNF-α in LPS+IFN-γ- or PMA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223">223</xref>]. Actually, 
 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic>, which contains neobavaisoflavone and other phenolic and non-phenolic compounds maybe used as a target for a more focused research against COVID-19 and related symptoms, since its extract was found to inhibit a human coronavirus strain [
