<p>Forsythoside A (FTA) has been recognized to be responsible for multiple biological activities. Zeng et al. reported that FTA showed antiendotoxin or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activity, exerting its anti-LPS effect by inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway [

 <italic>Syringa vulgaris</italic> L. were evidenced to have good antioxidant activity, by inducing NRF2 protein which is a regulator of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus faecium</italic>. From such antibacterial activity, the methoxy group of campneoside I was postulated to be the essential element for the antibacterial activity [
