<p>Proteases are involved in almost all biological processes in organisms, including metabolic and physiological processes, indicating their crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. Indeed, unregulated and excessive protease activity has been implicated in pathological conditions, such as in neurodegenerative, cancer, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, inhibition on proteases is a potential target on the development of therapeutic drugs. In the present study, EEPS and WEPS were screened for their inhibition activity on protease. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>, EEPS showed inhibition activity against protease in a concentration-dependent manner (the IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). However, the activity was observed to be much weaker compared to the positive control sodium diclofenac (IC
 <sub>50</sub>24.62 ± 0.34 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), which was a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Results in the present study indicate that 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves are able to modulate protease activities thus can be further explored as a potential source for plant-based proteases inhibitors. To date, limited studies have been reported for plant-based protease inhibitors.
