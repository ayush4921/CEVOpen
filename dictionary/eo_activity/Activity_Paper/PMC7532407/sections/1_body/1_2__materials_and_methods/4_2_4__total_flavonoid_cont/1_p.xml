<p>The total flavonoid contents were determined based on an aluminium chloride colorimetric method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The reaction mixture consisted of extract solution (0.5 mL), NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (5%

 <sub>3</sub> (10% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 0.15 mL), and NaOH (1 M, 2 mL). After incubating for 15 mins, the absorbance was taken at 510 nm. Rutin (6.40–1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was used to generate a standard curve. Results were expressed as mg rutin equivalent (mgRE)/gram dried material.
