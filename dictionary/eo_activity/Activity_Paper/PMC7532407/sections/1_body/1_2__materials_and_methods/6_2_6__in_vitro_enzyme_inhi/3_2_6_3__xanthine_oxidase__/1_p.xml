<p>Inhibition activity of the extracts on xanthine oxidase (XO) was determined based on the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with modifications, using porcine pancreatic xanthine oxidase and xanthine as a substrate. Sample of different concentrations (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was mixed with xanthine oxidase (0.2 U/mL, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). The reaction mixture was added with phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (50 mM, with 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) and preincubated at 37°C for 5 mins. The reaction was started by the addition of xanthine (0.3 mM, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) and further incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. Thereafter, HCl (100 mM, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 290 nm. The absorbance was read against blank solution in which the enzyme was replaced by phosphate buffer. Allopurinol was used as a positive control, and buffer was used as a negative control. The percentage of inhibitions was calculated by the following formula:
