<p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical symptom characterized by an acute loss of renal function with high morbidity and mortality (9.5% of in-hospital mortality) [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. AKI can be caused by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, nephrotoxic damage, and sepsis. The pathogenesis involves excessive inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and an imbalance in the renal cell injury and repair; however, specific treatment targets in the pathological process and effective therapies are still lacking [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The main treatments for AKI include rehydration therapy, antibiotics, dialysis, and the discontinuation of certain medicines until renal function recovers. Although AKI is a reversible condition that can be cured, it can progress to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Given AKI is considered a global health problem, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies.
