<p>Annexin-V-positive apoptotic cells were few in cisplatin nontreated NRK and HK-2, while they were increased in the negative control of the renal cell injury model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, they trended to be reduced in NRK and HK-2 treated with the polyherbal formulas. There were significant main effects for the group in NRK (
 <italic>F</italic> = 115.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and HK-2 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 588.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The post hoc tests versus the negative control revealed significant decreases in the apoptotic cells of NRK and HK-2 treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The reduced ratios were 2.2-, 1.8-, 1.5-, and 2.3-folds in NRK treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR, respectively, and they were 1.2-, 1.5-, 1.2-, and 1.4-folds in HK-2. There were no significant differences in the early apoptotic cells (only annexin-V positive) or apoptotic cell death (annexin-V/PI double positive) between the negative control and treatment groups with polyherbal formulas. Similarly, the expression of caspase 3 was increased in the negative control of the renal cell injury model compared with cisplatin nontreated NRK and HK-2, while it was reduced in the treatment with the polyherbal formulas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). There were significant differences among groups in NRK (
 <italic>F</italic> = 160.7, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and HK-2 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 144.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The post hoc tests versus the negative control revealed significant decreases in the expression of caspase 3 in NRK and HK-2 treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The reduced ratios were 1.5-, 2.2-, 1.2-, and 1.9-folds in NRK treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR, respectively, and they were 1.4-, 1.7-, 1.3-, and 2.0-folds in HK-2.
