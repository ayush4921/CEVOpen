  <p>Antiapoptotic effects of polyherbal formulas in cisplatin-induced renal cell injury. The renal cell injury model was treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR at 1 mg/ml for 3 days, and the expression of cleaved caspase 3 (Cas3) was assessed by Western blotting (a, b). The expression was normalized by the 
   <italic>β</italic>-actin levels. Values are represented as a percentage to the cisplatin nontreated group (Veh) in NRK (c) and HK-2 (d).
