However, there is limited understanding of which processes shape social learning patterns and configuration in ecological knowledge networks, or how these processes apply to resource management and biological conservation. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the prestige (rarity or exclusivity) of knowledge shapes social learning networks. In addition, we test whether people tend to select who to learn from based on prestige (knowledge or reputation), and homophily (e.g., people of the same age or gender). We used interviews to assess five types of medicinal plant knowledge and how 303 people share this knowledge across four villages in Solomon Islands. We developed exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to test whether hypothesized patterns of knowledge sharing based on prestige and homophily are more common in the observed network than in randomly simulated networks of the same size. We found that prestige predicts five hypothesized network configurations and all three hypothesized learning patterns, while homophily predicts one of three hypothesized network configurations and five of the seven hypothesized learning patterns. These results compare the strength of different prestige and homophily effects on social learning and show how cultural practices such as intermarriage can affect certain aspects of prestige and homophily. By advancing our understanding of how prestige and homophily affect ecological knowledge networks, we identify which social learning patterns have the largest effects on biocultural conservation of ecological knowledge.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MOB was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org">https://www.nsfgrfp.org</ext-link>), the American Philosophical Society Lewis &#x00026; Clark Fund for Exploration &#x00026; Field Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amphilsoc.org/grants/lewis-and-clark-fund-exploration-and-field-research">https://www.amphilsoc.org/grants/lewis-and-clark-fund-exploration-and-field-research</ext-link>), and the Garden Club of America Anne S.

People have adapted to diverse environments across the world since prehistoric times and now dominate the entire globe [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The key to this global domination has been a network of biological and cultural adaptations [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Humans have developed many cultural adaptations, such as intricate construction knowledge for technologies such as boats, complex practices to detoxify foods, and belief systems to encourage conservation [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To understand these and other cultural adaptations fundamental to nature conservation and the success of our species, we need to understand the evolution of social learning [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Here, we define social learning as knowledge acquired through instruction, observation, and other social interactions, which accumulates skills and information over time that no individual could develop in a single lifetime. In contrast, asocial learning is experiential and involves trial and error [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>For social learning to produce an adaptive benefit, people must limit who they learn from; however, there is debate about how people choose who to learn from and how their choices affect social learning network structure [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cultural evolution theory predicts that there is variation in knowledge, and knowledge that has a fitness benefit is more likely to be passed on to others [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although social learning can increase fitness by saving time and energy, computer models show that fitness decreases as rates of social learning increase because the information learned becomes less accurate [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, to maximize their fitness humans must determine whether or not they should learn from another person [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The decision to use social learning can depend on the type of information encountered, how often the information is encountered, what kind of person you are, and what kind of people you encounter [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this paper, we test two processes about how the identities of the learner and the person they learn from affect social learning. One process suggests that people choose who to learn from based on <italic>prestige</italic>, a person&#x02019;s reputation of success or knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A second process suggests that social learning is based on <italic>homophily</italic>- the idea people are more likely to learn from people who are similar to them (e.g., same-age, same-family, or same-gender) [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although these processes are both well-supported individually, there is limited evidence of how they concurrently relate to social learning within the same network [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>One of the most fundamental knowledge domains for human survival is ecological knowledge (cultural adaptations to ecological environments) because in pre-industrial societies this knowledge can make the difference between life and death [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, in Indigenous subsistence societies hunting knowledge is associated with personal health [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and medicinal plant knowledge is linked with offspring health [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and social influence [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Medicinal plants remain relevant to contemporary survival, since plants are still the central component of health care for ~80% of the world&#x02019;s population, are used to make ~25% of pharmaceutical drugs [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and provide a global market worth over $84 billion [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Medicinal plants also support biocultural diversity, since at least 18,000 plant species are used for medicine- more species than any other type of ecological knowledge, including food and construction [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, understanding the distribution and transmission of ecological knowledge has critical implications for conservation, health, and economy, and exploring fundamental theories about social learning. However, no studies have tested whether hypotheses derived from both homophily and prestige can predict the configuration and learning patterns of medicinal plant knowledge networks [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Testing how homophily and prestige affect sharing of medicinal plant knowledge provides critical insight for conservation of biological and cultural diversity. Both biological diversity and ecological knowledge are essential to provide the benefits humans get from ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem services), such as food production, climate change regulation, recreation, and water purification [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ecological knowledge also contributes to biological conservation and restoration [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while biological diversity and conservation contribute to ecological knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because ecological knowledge, biodiversity, cultural diversity, and conservation are interconnected, 80% of the world's biodiversity is managed by Indigenous Peoples [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, worldwide biological and cultural changes [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] are a threat to ecological knowledge, especially medicinal plant knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how ecological knowledge is shared, especially by Indigenous Peoples, will inform management of both ecological knowledge and biodiversity around the world.</p><p>Following an approach combining semi-structured interviews, participant observation, checklist interviews, and social network analysis, we assess three hypotheses about the social learning processes that shape medicinal plant knowledge networks: prestige predicts network configuration, prestige predicts learning patterns, and homophily predicts learning patterns. These three hypotheses were further divided into subhypotheses to investigate the effects they predict on network patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0239345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To test these hypotheses, we use data from a network of medicinal plant knowledge sharing among residents of four subsistence villages in Solomon Islands that primarily share the same kinship

By explaining the implications of these social learning processes, we develop hypotheses that are tested using structural signatures in a network of medicinal plant knowledge sharing. To test our hypotheses, we compare the frequency of relevant network statistics in our observed data with the distribution of statistics to random graphs of the same structure as the observed data, called ERGMs (exponential random graph models), which control for simultaneous effects of multiple social processes [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is critical to recognize that ERGMs do not directly observe the exact mechanisms of social learning, such as the personal motivation for requesting medicinal knowledge from specific individuals. However, if prestige and homophily affect knowledge sharing, specific network configurations will be more common or rare than in a random network [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, presence and frequency of certain structural components in a network allows us to infer which social learning and cultural adaptation processes are influencing that network [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Hypothesis 1: Prestige predicts knowledge sharing network configuration</title><p>By its very nature, prestige is exclusive, typically shared selectively with kin or offspring to increase fitness [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is particularly true for medicinal knowledge in Solomon Islands, the area where this study takes place [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As a result of this restricted sharing, we predict that there will be fewer knowledge sharing relationships (called <italic>edges</italic>) in the observed network than in a random network of the same size (Hypothesis 1a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>A related concept, called centralization or preferential attachment, suggests that nodes who are connected to one other node are more likely to be make new connections with other nodes [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, the distribution of edges is not even among nodes [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the ERGM context, we test for network popularity with a geometrically weighted out degree (GWOD) term, which measures whether people who share knowledge with at least one person are more likely to share knowledge with more than one person [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, we predict that fewer nodes will have high popularity (&#x02265;2 edges) and more nodes will have low popularity (&#x02264;1 edges) in the observed network than in a random network (Hypothesis 1b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Because sharing is restricted, certain nodes may not meet the selective criteria for sharing knowledge. Therefore, we also predict that in our network more nodes will have no edges connecting them to another node than in a random network (Hypothesis 1c, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>Another well-established network property is closure, the tendency for nodes to form edges with their network partners&#x02019; partners [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This redundancy helps to improve the accuracy of social learning and ensure the resiliency of cultural adaptation if nodes are removed from the network [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the context of social learning, prestige predicts more triangles than a random network because people are likely to learn from their teacher&#x02019;s teacher, with an increased chance for every teacher that the node and the teacher&#x02019;s teacher have in common (Hypothesis 1d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In ERGMs, we test for these types of triangles with a geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners, outgoing two-path (GWESP-OTP) term [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Combining the ideas of centralization and closure suggests that medicinal knowledge sharing tends to be absent (leaving many nodes isolated or poorly connected) or redundant (with clustered edges that connect a few nodes). Therefore, we predict that the observed network will have less intermediate connectivity than a random graph (Hypothesis 1e, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Hypothesis 2: Homophily predicts knowledge sharing network configuration</title><p>Homophily predicts that you are more likely to learn from someone who is like you in some way. As a result of that similarity, so the person you learn from is also more likely to learn from you. Therefore, we predict that there will be more reciprocal relationships in the observed network than in a random network of the same size (Hypothesis 2a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>). If prestige drives learning patterns, the prediction for reciprocity is inverted because prestigious people don&#x02019;t need to learn from less prestigious people (Hypothesis 2a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Closure has already been mentioned above, but here we discuss two alternate triangle structures. Homophily predicts a higher chance of node &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; learning from node &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; if they both learned from person &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; or if person &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; learned from both of them, because person &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; must be like both of them, which means &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; are like each other [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

If prestige for any of these variables drives social learning, we expect to find patterns of popularity (the number of people who say they learned from a given person) in our observed network (Hypotheses 3a-c, <xref rid="pone.0239345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the cultural context of Solomon Islands, men and women have distinct gender roles and restrictions, and men tend to have more political power and ancestral knowledge than women, so men will tend to have more prestige [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Hypothesis 4: Homophily predicts learning patterns in knowledge sharing networks</title><p>Homophily encompasses many forms of similarity, including education, religion, and occupation, and affects many forms of social connection, such as friendship, membership, and sharing possessions [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in the cultural context of Solomon Islands, the most likely sources of homophily are house proximity, marriage, village of residence, descent group, gender, and age [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

If prestige drives learning patterns, the prediction for one variable, age, is inverted (Hypothesis 4g, <xref rid="pone.0239345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Research villages were selected because most residents share the same kinship lineage, which means that they are blood descendants from a single ancestor. Residents of two villages (Kolofi and Binaoli) 1.5 kilometers apart are descended from families who left their homeland region ~200 years ago because of inter-family conflict, and primarily speak Baelelea language. Residents of the other of two villages (Irobulu and Lagoe) 1 kilometer apart are descended from the families who remained in their homeland region and primarily speak Baegu language.

To calculate the conditional probability of an edge given a combination of processes, parameter estimates for the estimates are summed [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Before ERGM analysis, we visualized correlations between nodal variables by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) with the <italic>corrplot</italic> package [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Because all five medicinal knowledge variables are highly correlated, each type of knowledge was analyzed separately. ERGMs were calculated using the <italic>ergm</italic> command in R [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Because descent, marriage and house distance depend on data from the entire network, they were calculated as undirected 303 &#x000d7; 303 matrices. For descent, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents were coded 1 and all other relationships were coded 0. For marriage, spouses were coded 1 and non-spouses were coded 0. To measure the distance between houses, we calculated a matrix of the geodesic distance between each house using the <italic>geosphere</italic> r package [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. To reduce influence of positively skewed values, distance was log (x + 1)-transformed [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Remaining demographic data (e.g., age, gender) were added to the entire closed network as nodal attributes.</p><p>ERGMs were constructed by adding terms following the methods of Goodreau et al. [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], starting with the structural covariates (M1), including the two geometrically-weighted structural variables (GWOD and GWESP). For GWOD we specified a fixed decay-parameter value of &#x003b8;S = 0.5 to apply equal popularity effects to nodes with high and low out degree [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For the three GWESP terms we specified a fixed decay-parameter value of &#x003b8;T = 0.01 to represent a higher chance of node &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; learning from node &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; if they both have social learning relationships with person &#x0201c;C&#x0201d;, with a very slightly increased chance for every person that &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; both have social learning relationships with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref> H1d, H2b-c) [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. One additional model (M2) was constructed by adding all edge and node variables except medicinal plant knowledge to M1. Five additional models (M3-7) were constructed by one of the five measurements of medicinal plant knowledge to M2. After all seven ERGMs were complete, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values were calculated using the <italic>vif</italic>.<italic>ergm</italic> command for each model term [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Model terms with VIF values greater than 10 (&#x0201c;use uniqueness: same&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;species uniqueness: same&#x0201d;) were removed to avoid multicollinearity [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. To confirm that adding terms improved model fit we used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to test if more complex models had lower AIC than simpler models (M3-7&#x0003c;M2&#x0003c;M1), which indicates a better fit [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].

All configuration variables are significant in all models, except for popularity in M5 (# illnesses known). Consistent with H1a, edge estimates were strongly negative, indicating restricted sharing of medicinal plant knowledge. Edge estimates are also consistently more negative in the models that include edge and node variables (M2-7). For example, in M1 nodes have a 1% chance of being connected (compared to 50% chance in a random network). In M2-7, nodes have a 0.05&#x02013;0.01% chance of being connected, which suggests that edge and node effects in M2-7 explain more detail of how nodes connect, and that nodes are highly unlikely to connect without the influence of homophily or prestige. Consistent with H1b, estimates for popularity are significantly negative in M1 and M2, indicating that people are more likely to learn about medicinal species and uses from someone who at least one other person has also learned from, but that medicinal knowledge is more important than popularity which choosing who to learn from.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0239345.t002" orientation="portrait"

Culturally, relationships between men and women are discouraged, especially if they are close in age, unless they are spouses. Therefore, increased sharing of knowledge between spouses (who are close in age) may mask a slight positive effect of age prestige.

We analyzed medicinal knowledge sharing to test whether prestige and homophily affect network structure and learning patterns. We find multiple pieces of evidence for all four hypotheses, and these patterns are consistent across all five types of medicinal knowledge (<xref rid="pone.0239345.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, M3-7). These data have limitations, but we propose the following generalizations for medicinal plant knowledge social learning networks:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Prestige reduces the number of edges, intermediate connectivity, and reciprocity, but increases inequality of node popularity and node isolation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Homophily increases the amount of ISP triangles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g001">Fig 1</xref> H2c)</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the context of prestige, learning patterns are simultaneously affected by knowledge, gender, and age</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the context of homophily, learning patterns simultaneously affected by close kinship (direct ancestors), general kinship (nearby houses), marriage, co-residence, and gender</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cultural marriage practices affect the hypothesized effects of kinship homophily and age-based prestige</p></list-item><list-item><p>The strongest influences on network formation are the prestige of having unusual medicinal knowledge and the restriction of sharing knowledge to maintain prestige. However, homophily of close kin, general kin, spouses, and village residents also have large effects on knowledge sharing relationships</p></list-item></list><p>Together, these results suggest that prestige and homophily both affect social learning but have distinct functions.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first ERGM of social learning to confirm that knowledge is shared between a learner and the person they learned. This confirms that self-reports are not overestimating the role of parents or other relationships in social learning due to social expectations [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], which is similar to previous findings that self-reports accurately represent knowledge sharing between parents and offspring [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A second reason to believe that social norms did not affect who learners cited is the fact that many participants did not cite their parents, and several explicitly stated that their parents did not know about medicine or chose not to share medicinal knowledge with them. A different potential source of bias is the ability of participants to remember who taught them about plants at any point in their life. However, this study was designed so that participants were asked to name who they learned from immediately after looking at photographs and hearing the names of each plant, which can help trigger memories related to the plants [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Additionally, without prompting, many participants specifically listed which plants each person taught them about. These factors both suggest that memory bias had only minimal effect in this study.</p><p>Although we show that prestige increases popularity of men in this network, we are reluctant to generalize this result for two reasons. First, there are no significant gendered differences in medicinal knowledge a global scale, only continental and national scales [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Therefore, observed differences in medicinal knowledge and its accompanying prestige are limited by cultural patterns of gender roles. Our results are consistent with patterns of power and knowledge in Melanesia [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and are likely generalizable to other patrilineal cultures that associate medicine with prestige. Second, our findings may have been influenced by the fact that all data were collected by a male [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In a region where contact between men and women is very regulated, it may have been easier for men to share more openly and completely [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Other possible biases in data collection include hesitancy to share cultural knowledge with an outsider, or fatigue based on interview length. In addition, our data do quantify the number of plants or remedies learned from each person; additional research is needed to understand which relationships in a network tend to be the source of the largest quantity of information or certain types of information (i.e. remedies for specific illnesses such as infections) [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The cultural roles of men and women in the study region also explain our two non-significant results- kinship homophily and age prestige. The cluster of high probability man-woman pairs that are not both from the main kinship group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g004">Fig 4</xref>) suggests that marriage between kinship groups may mask a weak positive effect of kinship homophily. The cluster of high probability man-woman pairs with &#x0003c;10 years difference in age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g005">Fig 5</xref>) suggests that spousal homophily may mask a weak positive effect of age prestige. Future research is needed to establish whether the stronger effect of kinship homophily and age prestige in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] is because we account for additional factors such as network configuration and house proximity, or whether Melanesian cultures share medicinal knowledge less freely with relatives or peers [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>One of the major challenges in network analysis is defining network boundaries [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In our network, a large proportion of learning took place with people who were not interviewed: 35% of the edges in the global open network are between informants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239345.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and 65% of them are between informants and people who were not interviewed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), such as relatives in other villages, colleagues from school or temporary work in urban areas, and deceased persons. Because we could not collect personal information from these people, their effect on prestige and homophily is uncertain. Therefore, our results may not reflect the exchanges with individuals outside the four study villages. However, most people reported as sources of knowledge were older relatives that they had lived with (e.g., parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents), so including these persons in the model would likely confirm our conclusions about the importance of age, kinship, and proximity.</p><p>We are confident that our results are valid within the study area because our sampling effort was high (&#x0003e;90%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s018">S1 Table</xref>) and rarefaction curves show &#x0003e;99% coverage of medicinal plant species cited by study participants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We are also confident that study participants learned most of their medicinal plant knowledge via social learning because 97% of participants reported learning about medicinal plants exclusively other people. Study participants never mentioned learning from mass media influences (e.g., books, TV, internet). In all villages, cell phone service is intermittent and phones owned by residents are unable to use the internet. Video players are common, but only play downloaded content (i.e., movies). Radios and books are uncommon and do not include information about local plants. Participants only mentioned two methods of learning about plants through direct experimentation- sensory information and dreams. In this region, it is not uncommon for people to dream about specific plants, then experiment with what illness to treat with the plant [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, only 5 participants reported learning through dreams, and only 2 participants reported learning via sensory characteristics (e.g., smell, taste).</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Social learning implications</title><p>Our results are an important contribution to the limited number of studies that combine demographic data and social network metrics to test hypotheses of social learning in small-scale societies, especially for ecological knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Previous research has established that knowledge can be shared in three directions: vertically (from parents or grandparents), obliquely (from other elders), or horizontally (from peers) [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Previous research has also established that the choice of medicinal plant teacher can be associated with certain demographic variables [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results expand on this foundation by specifying which types of people are most likely to share knowledge in a particular direction. For example, we show that for vertical and oblique teachers tend to be men who are knowledgeable about medicinal plants, which expands on previous findings that people prefer to learn about medicinal plants from knowledgeable men [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or women [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], depending on the cultural system. Vertical and oblique teacher-learner pairs also tend to be same-gender relatives within the same village, a combination which is confirmed by previous research [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also show that there is no general pattern of horizontal learning; however, spouses are more likely to learn from each other, especially from the husband or the spouse that has more or unusual knowledge, and peers who are same-gender relatives in the same village are also more likely to learn from each other. Previous research confirms this combination entirely [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and for knowledgeable same-gender co-residents [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>For more insight on the mechanisms of social learning, future research should test whether certain directions of learning are associated with different learning processes. Potential situations for social learning suggested by the first author&#x02019;s participant observation include vertical learning via intentional teaching, horizontal learning via observation and imitation, and oblique learning via seeking specific knowledge. Another area for future study is to test how social learning networks change over time and whether certain kinds of knowledge are more likely to be learned or forgotten at certain ages. These and other temporal network questions will require longitudinal approaches, which have rarely been applied to medicinal knowledge (but see [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Biocultural conservation implications</title><p>Our results highlight several mechanisms of social learning with implications for conserving medicinal plant knowledge and other types of ecological knowledge.

However, loss of prestige could also decrease interest in learning, remembering, or sharing ecological knowledge, which would lead to the breakdown of personal knowledge sharing [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] or rise of learning from non-human sources (e.g., books, internet) [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p><p>These scenarios suggest several avenues to conserve transmission of prestige-associated knowledge, such as medicinal plant knowledge. One method is to increase documentation of ecological knowledge so that knowledge can be learned from media sources, such as books or recordings [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. However, the efficacy of this approach depends on empowering Indigenous and local people groups to choose which research questions are asked and how data are shared [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. A second method is to increase social and institutional support for the value of ecological knowledge. Examples include incorporating ecological knowledge or local languages in formal education curricula, adopting school schedules that accommodate significant social and ecological events, and supporting complimentary use of herbal treatments at hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, differences in the four research villages suggest that current educational, health, and economic systems in urban Solomon Islands are not supporting local knowledge. Kolofi is the only village adjacent to a gravel road which improves access to larger towns, markets, schools, and hospitals. Kolofi is also the least dense, least centralized, and most disconnected village; it also has the lowest average medicinal knowledge per resident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s018">S1 Table</xref>). These results confirm previous research, which links community market integration and migration to lower network density and less ecological knowledge, including medicinal plant knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].</p><p>Our results also demonstrate how homophily predicts similarities between people who share knowledge. The strongest homophily variable in our analysis is spouses, which has interesting implications in the context of rising intermarriage both in Solomon Islands [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] and globally [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Intermarriage of kinship groups has always existed in North Malaita [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but inter-island marriages are increasingly common. Spouses who enter the village may therefore serve as brokers of knowledge between physically and culturally distant groups [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], which may increase knowledge diversity and innovation [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, because ecological knowledge also depends on resource availability, spouses from regions that are ecologically distinct will not have access to the plants that they know and cannot introduce their knowledge to other people [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although spouses may transport and cultivate plants from their birth home, the limited availability of these plants is unlikely to affect other families in the village [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Thus, the global rise in intermarriage may increase ecological knowledge if the social groups are in regions with similar plants but have no effect on ecological knowledge diversity if the regions are ecologically distinct.</p><p>Another strong homophily variable in our results, co-residence, suggests another way to increase the resilience of medicinal plant knowledge. Globally, urban populations are increasing, including populations of Indigenous peoples [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. As urbanization increases population density, there may be more opportunities for sharing ecological knowledge. However, one of the main challenges for sharing ecological knowledge in urban areas is the lack of natural resources [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, government policies that increase urban plant quantity, diversity, non-toxic management, legality of sustainable harvest, and accessibility, such as landscaping, urban forests, school gardens, and community gardens, will support continued transmission of ecological knowledge in a future of increasing urbanization [<xref rid="pone.0239345.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study is the first test of whether hypotheses based on prestige and homophily predict both network structure and social learning patterns. By using ERGMs, we control for potentially confounding factors such as geographic proximity, network configuration, and stated versus actual knowledge sharing. Our work reveals that prestige and homophily have distinct effects on specific social learning strategies and knowledge types. By testing mechanisms of ecological knowledge sharing and the flow of medicinal plant information through social networks, this research suggests how ecological knowledge systems can be amended or supported to improve biocultural conservation. It also paves the way for quantifying the flow of medicinal knowledge based on cultural context and social networks. In an era of unprecedented global change, understanding social learning and ecological knowledge transmission is essential to support biocultural sustainability and enhance pharmaceutical development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0239345.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Medicinal plant knowledge sampling adequacy rarefaction curves demonstrate &#x0003e;99% coverage of medicinal plant species cited by study participants.</title><p>Curves show coverage-based rarefaction (solid lines) and extrapolation (dashed lines). 95% confidence intervals (the shaded area associated with each curve) were estimated using 500 bootstrap replicates.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;The study intitled &#x0201c;Prestige and homophily predict network structure for social learning&#x0201d; is very interesting since it contributes to the understanding of the factors that can influence the structure of the knowledge sharing network about medicinal plants in human groups. However, different aspects throughout the text need to be made clearer. Below, I highlight these points.</p><p>In lines 65-66, the authors define social learning as &#x0201c;&#x02026;the ability to transmit information and ideas between generations". However, for the works cited by the authors in the introduction, social learning would involve processes linked to learning information through observation, interaction with other members of the social group or contact with products built by other individuals, not necessarily between generations, but it can occur between individuals belonging to the same generation in a group. In this sense, I believe that this passage can be modified. In addition, social learning strategies do not only involve imitation, as suggested by the text in line 76, which would also need to be relativized.</p><p>In lines 68-69, the following excerpt: &#x0201c;Because humans are a single species, the key to this global domination is not biological adaptation, but the related concept of cultural adaptation..." can be rethought. Several studies suggest that cultural practices have favored the recent positive selection of certain genes in humans as well as biological factors may also influence cultural evolution (O'Brien &#x00026; Laland 2012; Mesoudi 2015; Altman &#x00026; Mesoudi 2019). Perhaps it is the case to adjust this stretch, incorporating that both biological and cultural adaptations and the interactions between these (biocultural) factors are relevant to our understanding of human success in different environments.</p><p>*Altman, A.; Mesoudi, A. 2019. Understanding agriculture within the frameworks of cumulative cultural evolution, gene-culture co-evolution, and cultural niche construction. Human Ecology 47: 483-497.</p><p>*Mesoudi, A. 2015.

Genes, culture, and agriculture: na example of human niche construction. Current Anthropology 53: 434-470.</p><p>In the paragraph on lines 76-82, the authors briefly present the possible role of prestige and homophily in explaining social learning patterns. However, the authors indicate different theories for each factor that are not clearly presented, which can confuse the reader about the different theoretical scenarios involved. In this case, it is possible to place prestige and homophily as distinct types of model-based social learning biases, based on the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (see Mesoudi 2015). The indication and brief presentation of the theory of cultural evolution can help in the theoretical understanding to which the factors presented are inserted.</p><p>*Mesoudi, A. 2015. Cultural evolution: a review of theory, findings and controversies. Evolutionary Biology 43: 481-497.</p><p>In line 83, the authors highlight the following: "One of the most fundamental types of social learning for human survival is ecological knowledge..." This passage may seem confusing to the reader, as the types of social learning can involve the different mechanisms and social learning strategies, but not necessarily the knowledge domains that are involved in these strategies. So, it may be interesting to substitute this excerpt for &#x0201c;One of the most fundamental knowledge domains for&#x02026;&#x0201d;.</p><p>In line 133, the authors indicate &#x0201c;social learning theories&#x0201d;. This passage can confuse the reader. In this case, they are not necessarily theories, but different processes or biases of social learning.</p><p>In the topic &#x0201c;Theoretical framework&#x0201d;, during the presentation of the hypotheses, it might be interesting to clearly indicate why a hypothesis about the influence of homophily on the knowledge sharing network configuration was not addressed in the text. At the beginning of this topic, the authors point out that the work investigate "how homophily and prestige...affect....specific patterns of network connections", but does not address a hypothesis that relates homophily to the network configuration.</p><p>In the topic &#x0201c;Fieldwork site&#x0201d;, I missed more explanations about the socioenvironmental characteristics of the groups studied, such as the ecosystems to which they belong, proximity to urban centers, beliefs, the social structure (and its variation between each group), the organization of people in different social roles, geographical distance between these groups. This can even help the reader to understand why certain sociocultural variables were analyzed in this study.</p><p>In the topic &#x0201c;ERGM analysis&#x0201d;, there are two repeated parts of the text (lines 297-299 and lines 300-301). I suggest deleting one of the parts.</p><p>In the results, in the topic &#x0201c;Hypothesis 1&#x0201d; it is still not clear to me why only the prestige is being considered in the hypothesis of the network configuration, considering that there are results on the effect of homophily. Perhaps the topic title needs to consider the effect of homophily.</p><p>In lines 421-423, the authors write the following excerpt &#x0201c;...the probability of an edge forming between two people whose age difference is &#x0003c;10 years is higher for man-woman pairs than for same-gender pairs, indicating that nonsignificance of age prestige may be related to cultural gender roles." I was confused in this part of the text because what seems to be being discussed here is a factor linked to homophily, that is, people with close ages. If it is the case to change this part of the text, some points of the discussion about this finding may also be modified (lines 448 and 480).</p><p>In the topic &#x0201c;Social learning implications&#x0201d;, the authors point out that "Our results address a lack of prior research on the process and patterns of social learning in small-scale societies, especially in learning ecological knowledge [21,76]. Previous research has established that knowledge can be shared in three directions: vertically (from parents or grandparents), obliquely (from other elders), or horizontally (from peers) [76]." However, there are studies that have investigated and discussed the sharing of local ecological knowledge (such as knowledge of medicinal plants) between people and the biases linked to social learning in small-scale societies (see, for example, Henrich &#x00026; Broesch 2011; Salpeteur et al. 2015; Brito et al. 2019; Santoro et al. 2020). In particular, the work of Henrich &#x00026; Broesch (2011), also cited by the authors of the manuscript, investigates learning biases (such as prestige, sex and age) involving local ecological knowledge through network analysis. The mentioned works indicate the possible biases that may be behind the processes of transmission of local ecological knowledge. It would be interesting, then, to discuss the findings of the present manuscript on this topic with previous studies that have investigated biases related to knowledge sharing about medicinal plants. If this adjustment is made on this topic, it will also be necessary to adjust the conclusion section on lines 565-566, in which the authors state "Our study is the first test of how prestige and homophily relate to network structure and social learning patterns" and an excerpt from the introduction of the manuscript, on lines 95-97. In this last point about the text of the introduction, the originality and relevance of the research can be rethought.</p><p>*Brito, C.C.; Ferreira J&#x000fa;nior, W.S.; Albuquerque, U.P.; Ramos, M.A.; Silva, T.C.; Costa-Neto, E.M.; Medeiros, P.M. 2019.

Some considerations:</p><p>Line 46 - I do not agree that there is a limited understanding of the processes that define the transmission of local ecological knowledge. There are several studies that analyze different variables, such as prestige, age and environmental condition.</p><p>Line 76 - according to Hoppitt and Laland (2008) and Rendell et al. (2010) there are many social learning processes, in addition to &#x0201c;imitation&#x0201d;, such as &#x0201c;pavovlian conditioning&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;contextual imitation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;teaching&#x0201d;.

However, it is possible that the same person may have been a model for the knowledge of more than one medicinal plant. In this case, the number of events established between a model and an leaner is also a fundamental variable to understand the structure of the transmission of knowledge in a social network.

ISSN 1677-941X, is original in presenting some data about the prestige and structure of the social network.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The authors show how prestige and homophilia are strong structurers of social learning patterns, for this they use networking tools to visualize the complexity of ethnobotanical systems using abstract models. In this way, the approach allows detecting interactions and components not observable with the naked eye, revealing highly relevant aspects in ethnobotanical theory. The work stands out for its logical coherence and supports each of its hypotheses and reflections with a theoretical framework of evolutionary ethnobiology and network theory, clearly reflected in the reference bibliography. The data is surveyed using current ethnobotanical methodological techniques, complies with the guidelines of the code of ethics and the analyzes have adequate statistical support.</p><p>The authors could discuss the vulnerability of a knowledge system with a distribution focused on few agents, Casti&#x000f1;eira Latorre et al. 2020 discusses hipotetical scenarios in botanical medical systems, it removes nodes for experimentally with varying degrees of connection and evaluates the robustness of the system. Finally, I highlight the global nature of the work and I thank the authors for their great contribution to the development of the knowledge area.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#x000a0;This is a very interesting article about social learning models. Combining semi-structured interviews, participant observation, checklist interviews, and a detailed social network analysis, authors assess different hypotheses about the social learning processes that shape medicinal plant knowledge across four villages in Solomon Islands. Hypothesis are well defined and presented, the text is clear and easy to follow. Figures and Tables are very informative. While I support the publication of this paper, there are few issues needed to be addressed beforehand. In general, the manuscript needs a larger cultural context, and a discussion that must go beyond of the exponential random graph models (ERGMs) findings:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>In my opinion, introduction section could be more focused in social learning models, containing other factors and experiences discussed in literature, including the importance of individual learning, mass media influence, gender, etc.</p><p>Fieldwork site</p><p>This section need to be enriched by socio cultural information about the people of the four communities of Salomon Islands. Are they indigenous communities? Is the same the importance of the medicinal plant use in the four communities? Which is the medical system in each community? What plants are mainly used? In what extend people depend on medicinal plants? Could also be of interest to know about the presence of biomedicine in local systems. I know that this is not the purpose of the manuscript, but a brief description could be of essential to understand the sociocultural context.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>Self-reports about people from who they learned about medicinal plants, has been object of criticism. It is argued that people tend to overvalue the role of parents in the learning process when asked from whom they learned any knowledge, overestimating vertical routes. Please discuss this limitation.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Hypothesized patterns of knowledge sharing based on prestige and homophily are more common in the observed network than in randomly simulated networks. Authors should discuss other influencing factors (not included in these framework) that could affect the network structure and learning processes of medicinal plants in these communities: such as individual learning, age, mass media influences, the effect of people that are not included in the studied networks. Because the results are not reflecting the exchanges with individuals outside the study area who were not interviewed. In addition, in my opinion could be of interest to discuss more the differences among Kolofi, Binaoli, Irobulu, and Lagoe. It is possible to read some local voices about their medicinal plant learning process?</p><p>As the authors say, the fieldwork was very limited (and unique!, in my opinion!), that they cannot used it as a general model to other cultural systems, could you please discuss more about of this limitation?</p><p>Authors say that their results are not reflecting the exchanges with individuals outside the study area who were not interviewed. Please could you please discuss more about this limitation of the model?</p><p>What about the spread of innovations in these communities with the models found?</p><p>The idea about intermarriage can &#x0201c;obscure&#x0201d; certain aspects of prestige and homophily, in my opinion, must be explained in a different way, avoiding gender bias in the interpretation.</p><p>Biocultural implications</p><p>Authors consider that the flow of medicinal plant information through social networks in these communities have the same behavior that the flow of ecological knowledge information. I suspect that they are very different to make inferences about to improve biocultural conservation. Significant differences in governance processes of natural resources can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization, but there are different rules in indigenous communities that shapes communal decisions, that are very different to individual decisions. Please, clarify this topic.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
