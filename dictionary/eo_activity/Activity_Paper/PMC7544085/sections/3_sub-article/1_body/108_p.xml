<p>Hypothesized patterns of knowledge sharing based on prestige and homophily are more common in the observed network than in randomly simulated networks. Authors should discuss other influencing factors (not included in these framework) that could affect the network structure and learning processes of medicinal plants in these communities: such as individual learning, age, mass media influences, the effect of people that are not included in the studied networks. Because the results are not reflecting the exchanges with individuals outside the study area who were not interviewed. In addition, in my opinion could be of interest to discuss more the differences among Kolofi, Binaoli, Irobulu, and Lagoe. It is possible to read some local voices about their medicinal plant learning process?</p>
