<p>For social learning to produce an adaptive benefit, people must limit who they learn from; however, there is debate about how people choose who to learn from and how their choices affect social learning network structure [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cultural evolution theory predicts that there is variation in knowledge, and knowledge that has a fitness benefit is more likely to be passed on to others [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although social learning can increase fitness by saving time and energy, computer models show that fitness decreases as rates of social learning increase because the information learned becomes less accurate [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, to maximize their fitness humans must determine whether or not they should learn from another person [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The decision to use social learning can depend on the type of information encountered, how often the information is encountered, what kind of person you are, and what kind of people you encounter [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this paper, we test two processes about how the identities of the learner and the person they learn from affect social learning. One process suggests that people choose who to learn from based on 
 <italic>prestige</italic>, a person’s reputation of success or knowledge [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A second process suggests that social learning is based on 
 <italic>homophily</italic>- the idea people are more likely to learn from people who are similar to them (e.g., same-age, same-family, or same-gender) [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although these processes are both well-supported individually, there is limited evidence of how they concurrently relate to social learning within the same network [
