<p>Consistent with H2a’s homophily prediction, estimates for reciprocity are significantly positive in M1; however, significant negative estimates in M2-M7 support H2a’s prestige prediction (
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The change in sign indicates that the reciprocity in this network is explained by homophily of people who are direct descendants, spouses, or from the same village. Reciprocity estimates are similarly negative across M2-7 (26–33% chance), which suggests that after accounting for node homophily, the lack of reciprocity supports prestige. In contrast to H2b, estimates for OSP triangles are close to zero and not significant. Consistent with H2c, estimates for ISP triangles are significantly positive, indicating that more people are more likely to learn from each other if they both learn from the same person, particularly if they both learn from the same two or more people. These estimates are higher in M1 (94% chance) than in M2-7 (72–75% change), which suggests that people who are direct descendants, spouses, or from the same village also tend to have the same teachers.
