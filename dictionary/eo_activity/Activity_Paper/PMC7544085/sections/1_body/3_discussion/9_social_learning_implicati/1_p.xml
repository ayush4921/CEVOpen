<p>Our results are an important contribution to the limited number of studies that combine demographic data and social network metrics to test hypotheses of social learning in small-scale societies, especially for ecological knowledge [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Previous research has established that knowledge can be shared in three directions: vertically (from parents or grandparents), obliquely (from other elders), or horizontally (from peers) [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Previous research has also established that the choice of medicinal plant teacher can be associated with certain demographic variables [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results expand on this foundation by specifying which types of people are most likely to share knowledge in a particular direction. For example, we show that for vertical and oblique teachers tend to be men who are knowledgeable about medicinal plants, which expands on previous findings that people prefer to learn about medicinal plants from knowledgeable men [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or women [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], depending on the cultural system. Vertical and oblique teacher-learner pairs also tend to be same-gender relatives within the same village, a combination which is confirmed by previous research [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also show that there is no general pattern of horizontal learning; however, spouses are more likely to learn from each other, especially from the husband or the spouse that has more or unusual knowledge, and peers who are same-gender relatives in the same village are also more likely to learn from each other. Previous research confirms this combination entirely [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and for knowledgeable same-gender co-residents [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
