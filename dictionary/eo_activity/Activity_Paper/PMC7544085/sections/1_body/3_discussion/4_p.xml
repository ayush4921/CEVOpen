<p>To our knowledge, this is the first ERGM of social learning to confirm that knowledge is shared between a learner and the person they learned. This confirms that self-reports are not overestimating the role of parents or other relationships in social learning due to social expectations [

A second reason to believe that social norms did not affect who learners cited is the fact that many participants did not cite their parents, and several explicitly stated that their parents did not know about medicine or chose not to share medicinal knowledge with them. A different potential source of bias is the ability of participants to remember who taught them about plants at any point in their life. However, this study was designed so that participants were asked to name who they learned from immediately after looking at photographs and hearing the names of each plant, which can help trigger memories related to the plants [
