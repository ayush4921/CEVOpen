<p>Our results also demonstrate how homophily predicts similarities between people who share knowledge. The strongest homophily variable in our analysis is spouses, which has interesting implications in the context of rising intermarriage both in Solomon Islands [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] and globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Intermarriage of kinship groups has always existed in North Malaita [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but inter-island marriages are increasingly common. Spouses who enter the village may therefore serve as brokers of knowledge between physically and culturally distant groups [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], which may increase knowledge diversity and innovation [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, because ecological knowledge also depends on resource availability, spouses from regions that are ecologically distinct will not have access to the plants that they know and cannot introduce their knowledge to other people [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although spouses may transport and cultivate plants from their birth home, the limited availability of these plants is unlikely to affect other families in the village [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Thus, the global rise in intermarriage may increase ecological knowledge if the social groups are in regions with similar plants but have no effect on ecological knowledge diversity if the regions are ecologically distinct.
