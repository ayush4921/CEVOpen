<p>All four villages are in tropical wet forests with similar plant species richness [

Additionally, Kolofi is the only village adjacent to a gravel road- residents in the other three villages must walk 1.5–4 kilometers to access a road, where transport to larger hospitals is possible. Because medical centers have limited supplies, irregular hours, and are hard to reach, residents of the study villages largely depend on herbal remedies. Because medicinal knowledge is highly valued in this region, it is often hidden from strangers and only shared with relatives or close friends. Herbal preparations may be shared with sick acquaintances if asked, but some form of return payment is often expected [
