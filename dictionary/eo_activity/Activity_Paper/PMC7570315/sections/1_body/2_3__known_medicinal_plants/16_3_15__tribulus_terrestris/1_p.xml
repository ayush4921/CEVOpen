 <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> (
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic>) is mostly found in China, India, Pakistan, South Americas, Bulgaria, Mexico and Spain, and is considered as a traditional medicinal plant. 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> belongs to the 
 <italic>Zygophyllaceae</italic> family and possesses several biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic and anti-urolithic properties [
