 <italic>Polygonum mulitflorum</italic> Thunb (PMT) is mostly found in China, Korea and Japan, belonging to 
 <italic>Polygonaceae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B245-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Radix Polygoni multiflori (root tubers of PMT) is mostly used in treating many kinds of diseases, such as rubella, scrofula, waist and knee pain, paralysis, vaginal discharge, hypercholesterolemia (liver and kidney), malaria, and various other diseases, possessing neuro-protective, antioxidation, immunomodulation, anti-hyperlipidemia, anticancer, heap-toprotection, anti-inflammation, and anti-CoV functions [

 <xref rid="B246-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. The potent bioactive compounds present in PMT which are responsible for the therapeutic effects against various diseases are listed in

 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The mode of action of PMT is similar to 
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> L and the major active constituent is found to be emodin in both plants. Therefore, it is highly recommended to focus on emodin for possible and effective management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, combination with other therapeutic approaches.
