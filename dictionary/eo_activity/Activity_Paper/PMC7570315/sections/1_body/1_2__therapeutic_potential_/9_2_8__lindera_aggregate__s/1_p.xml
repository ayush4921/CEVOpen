 <italic>L. aggregate</italic> leaves can also be used to drink as tea, due to their protective effect against oxidative stress [

 <italic>L. aggregate</italic> roots against SARS-CoV-1 [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. An in vitro study showed that 
 <italic>L. aggregate</italic> is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-1 with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 88.2 ± 7.7 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, the mode of action is still not clear, but it was suggested that 
 <italic>L. aggregate</italic> roots can possibly inhibit the viral replication and block the entry of virus [
