<p>The 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract exhibited Î±-amylase inhibition, a high level of free radical scavenging, and increased GLUT4 translocation onto cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, the extract of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> may be useful as a nutraceutical or as a source of drugs to treat type 2 diabetes disease. Its high activity might be due to the presence of supportive phytochemicals, which will need to be isolated and chemically identified, after which the biological activity of the individual phytochemicals, along with their mechanisms, should be verified.
