We suggest that subsequent studies validate the conclusions reached in the current study by testing other antidiabetic parameters. In addition, the biological activity of the isolated substances should be tested in diabetic mice. Preventing oxidative stress and balancing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice by orally administered natural products will significantly advance the development of natural drugs exhibiting both antidiabetic and antioxidant functions.
