<p>Because hyperglycemia can be managed to some extent by a low-carbohydrate diet, researchers and pharmaceutical companies seek methods to control it by modulating starch digestion [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, although it can control blood glycemia, making starch resistant to digestion is not recommended due to safety concerns [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Inhibition of the activity of starch-digesting enzymes within the intestine, which delays carbohydrate digestion, reduces glucose absorption, and thereby decreases postprandial blood glucose levels, has become a widely accepted approach [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. α-Amylase is a key player in dietary starch digestion, and because its inhibition plays an important role in reducing and regulating postprandial hyperglycemia [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it is considered a desirable biological target for DM treatment [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The enzyme catalyzes carbohydrate digestion inside the small intestine by hydrolyzing 1, 4-glycosidic linkages and converting polysaccharides (starch) to disaccharides. The drug acarbose is a pseudotetrasaccharide containing a nonhydrolyzable, nitrogen-linked bond, which binds α-amylase and suppresses its activity through competitive, reversible inhibition. It is one of the second-line drugs in the treatment of diabetes after metformin [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, its application is limited due to the cost of production and the side effects associated with its synthetic nature [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, in recent years, many studies have investigated the inhibition of α-amylase by natural products, such as plant extracts [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and found that plants constitute a rich source for antidiabetic drug candidates acting via α-amylase inhibition [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Due to their natural characteristics and long process of evolutionary selection, plant extracts may induce fewer side effects when compared to synthetic drugs. In general, natural-based medicines have been proven safer [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and are inherently better tolerated than synthetic drugs, and thus may be the best source of future medicines [
