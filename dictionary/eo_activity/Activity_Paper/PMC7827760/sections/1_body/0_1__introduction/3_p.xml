<p>In addition, there is a large body of evidence showing that oxidative stress is primarily induced by hyperglycemia and is associated with a key process in the initiation and progression of diabetic complications [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; however, the precise mechanisms by which oxidative stress accelerates the development of diabetic complications are only partly known [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Inflammatory mediators are generated, and these are stimulated by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, which leads to the production of free radical species [

This work aimed to perform a large-scale screening of plant extracts that exhibit both inhibitory effects on Î±-amylase and free radical-scavenging properties with minimal side effects. To this end, 41 extracts from plants widely used by people in the Middle East as food and medication were screened for such activities. Once a plant extract that can act as both an antidiabetic and antioxidant is identified, it can be further studied to isolate its bioactive compounds.
