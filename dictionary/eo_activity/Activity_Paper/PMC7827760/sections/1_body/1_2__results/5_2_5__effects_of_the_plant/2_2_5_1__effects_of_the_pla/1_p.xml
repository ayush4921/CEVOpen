 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. at concentrations ranging between 0.006 and 0.705 mg/mL had no effect on cell viability, while higher concentrations resulted in 85â€“95% cell viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). Exposure of cells to 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract at concentrations between 0.0078125 and 0.5 mg/mL had no effect on cell viability, while higher concentrations resulted in decreased cell viability (up to 15%) compared to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). Viability above 100% (the control), observed at some extract concentrations, can be explained by the absorption of some components within the extracts that had not been washed out.
