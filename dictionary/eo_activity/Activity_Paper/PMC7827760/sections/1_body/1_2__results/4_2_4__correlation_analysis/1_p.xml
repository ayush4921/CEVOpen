<p>Verifying the correlation between α-amylase inhibition and free radical scavenging activity will advance the subsequent screening of plant extracts by highlighting those with advantageous dual antidiabetic and antioxidant functions. The inhibition of α-amylase was first verified by screening all of the extracts at a concentration of 2 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00317-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The extracts that displayed a percentage of inhibition above 50% were then tested at lower concentrations to determine their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (

 <sub>50</sub> values &lt; 2 mg/mL—
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria.</italic> Their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, as measured by dose-response experiments, were 0.60 and 1.78 mg/mL, respectively. Treatment with 2 mg/mL of 
 <italic>Olea europaea, Petroselinum crispum, Stevia rebaudiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> inhibited α-amylase by 42.6, 37.5, 35.7 and 27.4%, respectively (
