 <xref rid="molecules-26-00317-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) scores and enrichment factors are utilized as criteria in the evaluation of the models. The calculations were based on the assumption that a 250 µg/mL-plant extract that produced α-amylase inhibition ≥25% was active (a true positive); extracts with inhibition below 25% were considered inactive. Six out of the 41 tested plant extracts showed an inhibition of α-amylase ≥25%.
