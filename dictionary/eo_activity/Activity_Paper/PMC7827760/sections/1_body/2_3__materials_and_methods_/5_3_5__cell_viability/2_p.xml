<p>L6-GLUT4myc cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/well) were seeded in 100 μL of growth medium in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. The 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extracts were then added at various concentrations, and the plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. The next day, XTT reagents were added to the plate (medium was added to the control wells) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The control samples were treated with 0.01% DMSO (the solvent in which the plant extracts were dissolved). Cell viability was evaluated according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using a Thermo Scientific Varioskan LUX Multimode Microplate Reader at 450 nm. The measured absorbance was subtracted from the reference absorbance (620 nm), and each experiment was repeated independently three times.
