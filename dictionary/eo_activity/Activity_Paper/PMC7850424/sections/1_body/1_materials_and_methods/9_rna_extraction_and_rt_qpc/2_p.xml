<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 100 μl supernatant of infected cells using the automated nucleic acid extraction system (TIANLONG, Hangzhou, China), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. SARS-CoV-2 virus detection was performed using the One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). ORF 1ab was amplified from cDNA and cloned into MS2-nCoV-ORF1ab and used as the plasmid standard after its identity was confirmed by sequencing. A standard curve was generated by determination of copy numbers from serially dilutions (10
 <sup>3</sup>–10
 <sup>9</sup> copies) of plasmid. The following primers used for quantitative PCR were 1ab-F: 5′-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3′; 1ab-R: 5′-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3′; and probe 5′-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTG ACCA-BHQ1-3′. The individual EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by the Origin 2018 software.
