<p>To confirm that baicalein and the crude extract inhibit viral replication by directly targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in cells, we tested their anti-SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity under complex cell environment. As the expression of SARS-CoV-2 3CL

 <sup>pro</sup> for the test. Both baicalein and the crude extract showed inhibition activity under this condition (
