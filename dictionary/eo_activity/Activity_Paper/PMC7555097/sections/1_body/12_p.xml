This review gives an overview on the on the use of natural extract from rosemary as a preservative in foods. Their use is limited due to their negative organoleptic properties, such as odour and taste. However, different new extraction methods have been developed in order to get colourless and odourless rosemary extracts. Several studies have reported that bioactive compounds, present in rosemary extracts and essential oils, delay lipid oxidation and microbiological spoilage, extending the shelf life of food. Taking into account all these aspects, rosemary extracts could be used in functional foods, pharmaceutical products, plant products and food preservation. The application of this natural extract can be complimented in different food systems such as meat, oils and dressing.
