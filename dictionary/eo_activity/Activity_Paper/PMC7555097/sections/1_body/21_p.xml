<p>Jongberg et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] study in their work the protein oxidation and sensory quality of brine-injected pork loins added ascorbate or extracts of green tea or maté during chill-storage in a high-oxygen modified atmosphere. They showed that green tea and maté were found to equally protect against lipid oxidation-derived off-flavors, and maté showed less prooxidative activity towards proteins as compared to ascorbate, resulting in more tender meat. Based on present results, maté extract could be a potential substitution for ascorbate in the production of brine-injected pork, more so than green tea extract, as maté extract did not affect protein cross-linking, tenderness, or juiciness negatively throughout storage. Compared to green tea, maté extract generated no off-flavor, and, hence, based on the findings, is a valuable alternative as an antioxidant in brine-injected meat.They reported that maté is a valuable substitute for ascorbate in brine-injected pork chops.
