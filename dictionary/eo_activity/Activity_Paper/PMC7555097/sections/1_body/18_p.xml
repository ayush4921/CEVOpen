<p>Grigorakis et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] describe their work to find biologically-active compounds, such as polyphenol, from 
 <italic>Stachys mucronata</italic> and study of its antiradical activity. These authors reported as major constituents: apigenin analogues, derivatives of the flavone luteolin, chlorogenate conjugates and flavonol glycosides, being the most potent radical-scavenging compounds detected in the n-butanol fraction of the extracts, suggesting that they are the most active antioxidants in 
 <italic>Stachys mucronata</italic>. This study showed valuable data for future studies that will aim at investigating the possible biological effects of 
 <italic>Stachys mucronata</italic>, which remain unexamined to date.
