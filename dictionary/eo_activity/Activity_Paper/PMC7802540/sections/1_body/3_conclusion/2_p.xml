<p>In view of the overall data presented in the study, HMR is thought to activate macrophages through the production of immunomodulators and phagocytosis activation through TLR2/4‐dependent MAPK signaling pathways (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Because macrophage activation is considered to be one of the targets for enhancing the immune system of the human body, HMR is considered to have the immune‐enhancing activity and can be used as an important natural product for the development of immune‐enhancing agents in the future.
