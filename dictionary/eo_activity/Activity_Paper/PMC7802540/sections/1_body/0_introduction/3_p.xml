<p>Numerous studies have reported that eating wild vegetables can reduce the risk of various diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and diabetes (Xie et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Thus, wild vegetables have been regarded as important plant resources for human health in recent decades (Afolayan &amp; Jimoh, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Flyman &amp; Afolayan, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Moreover, may natural products have been used for the development of immunotherapy in the treatment of human diseases (Chen &amp; Yu,

 <italic>Heracleum moellendorffii</italic> (
 <italic>H. moellendorffii</italic>) is a family of Umbelliferae and has long been used for food and medicinal purposes (Alam et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The young leaves of 
 <italic>H. moellendorffii</italic>, which have various pharmacological activities, including detoxification and antioxidant activity, have been used as wild vegetables. And the roots of 
 <italic>H. moellendorffii</italic> have traditionally been used to treat diseases related to chronic inflammation among various disease of human (Bang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Park et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Although there have been no studies related to the immune‐enhancing activity of 
 <italic>H. moellendorffii</italic>, several plants in the genus 
 <italic>Heracleum</italic> such as 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. maximum</italic> have been reported to enhance the body's immunity (Naeini et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Webster et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the immune‐enhancing activity through the macrophage activation of 
 <italic>H. moellendorffii</italic> was evaluated, and the mechanism of action was elucidated.
