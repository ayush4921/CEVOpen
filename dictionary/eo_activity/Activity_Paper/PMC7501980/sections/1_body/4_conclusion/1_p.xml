<p>From this study it was shown that in
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves crude extracts of both solvents (80% methanol and aqueous) showed significant reduction of BGL on diabetic mice and prevented body weight loss of diabetic. Methanolic extract showed a noticeable drop of blood glucose level related to respective doses of aqueous extract. Therefore, based on the results obtained from the antihyperglycemic study it is possible to say that 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves can be used as a substitute supplement for the management of DM. Moreover, additional investigation is needed for explanation of the appropriate mechanisms of action of the leaf extracts and its fractions.
