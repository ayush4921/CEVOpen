<p>Even though varieties of pharmacological agents are proposed to control the elevation of BGL, the prevalence of DM is still rising and the health of societies is being endangered.
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Plants may act on BGL through various mechanisms such as blocking potassium channel of beta cell of pancreatic, adrenomimeticism, stimulation of secondary messenger; providing essential heavy metals for the pancreatic beta cells, inhibition of α-glucosidase and β-galactosidase, inhibiting free radical generation which may have a role in insulin secreting cell dysfunction found in DM;

 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> activation of glycolysis, citric acid cycle and glycogenesis and block of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis;
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> enhancing efficacy of insulin, blocking insulinase enzymes activity, acting as insulin-like substances and increasing the number and/or efficacy of the beta cells of the pancreas through improving regeneration of beta cells to improve insulin activities. Secondary metabolites of herbs may also delay carbohydrate absorption; thus reducing glucose in the blood.
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, traditional medicine (TM) in Ethiopia has gained very little consideration in current medical research. Moreover, fewer struggles have been made to advance the contributions of TM practice in management of diseases and identification of side effects that may be associated with the use of plant medicines.
