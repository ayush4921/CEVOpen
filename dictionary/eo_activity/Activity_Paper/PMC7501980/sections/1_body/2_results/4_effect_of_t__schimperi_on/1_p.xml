<p>At the end of experimental study, body weights of mice in normal control group (nondiabetic) were increased compared to their original body weights while in the diabetic control group (diabetic mice without any treatment intervention) a significant drop in the body weight was observed, when their final body weights were compared with their initial body weights. Alloxan-induced diabetic mice displayed significant decline in body weight compared to normal mice as shown below in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Aqueous and methanol extract of two doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) treated groups mice indicated enhancement in body weight when compared to diabetic mice in control group, however, it was still less than in the normal control group. Similarly the body weights of the alloxan-induced diabetes+glibenclamide group were also increased significantly.
