<p>A polyphenol, pentagalloylglucose (PGG) (
 <bold>45</bold>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) demonstrated anti‐influenza virus activity by reducing virus release, site of virus assembly, and budding (microvillus) and inhibiting hemagglutination induced by the virus (G. Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Amplification of the HCV was inhibited by non‐nucleoside inhibitors (benzimidazole scaffold) through inhibition of RdRP, and its mechanism of action was studied (Tomei et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>).
