<p id="Par32">Plants have evolved antioxidant pathways that are usually sufficient to protect them from oxidative injury during periods of natural growth and moderate stress. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems protected tissue from the activated oxygen species, produced as the result of external environmental stresses, such as dryness, chilling and air pollution. Certain enzymatic antioxidant defense systems contain Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), and Guaiacol Peroxidase (GPX) [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. As shown, the maximum and the minimum activities of catalase were found in 
 <italic>J. conglomeratus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flavescens</italic> plants, respectively. Besides, guaiacol peroxidase activity assay indicated that 
 <italic>J. conglomeratus</italic> plant had the highest activity. Furthermore, the minimum guaiacol peroxidase activity was related to 
 <italic>R. repens</italic> plant. Moreover, the maximum and the minimum protein contents were observed in 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> fruit and 
 <italic>J. conglomeratus</italic> plant, respectively.
