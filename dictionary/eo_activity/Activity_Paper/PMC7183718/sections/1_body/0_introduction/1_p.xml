<p id="Par5">The plant essential oils and extracts, considered as possible sources of natural bioactive molecules, have been utilized globally in new antimicrobial compounds, food preservatives, and alternatives to treat infectious disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are many researches about the antibacterial and antifungal activities of plant extracts and essential oils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, Srinivasan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] measured the antimicrobial activity of 50 medicinal plants including 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>. The results showed that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> had antimicrobial activity versus 
 <italic>Chromobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella partyphy</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria and did not show any antifungal activity on the tested fungus. Nagata et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity of macrocarpals, phloroglucinol derivatives contained in Eucalyptus leaves, versus a diversity of bacteria containing oral bacteria. Among the tested bacteria, 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> presented the maximum sensitivity to macrocarpals. Furthermore, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. Hayet et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] evaluated the antibacterial activities of ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>peganum harmala</italic> leaves against some pathogens containing 11 g-positive and 6 g-negative bacteria, among which methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited a higher antibacterial activity versus gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. Han and Guo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] investigated the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic> extract (AE), 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic> extract (SE), and herb pair 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flavescens</italic> extract (HPE), according to the result of which HPE had strong antibacterial activity on 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella castellani</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chalmers</italic>. Besides, SE was moderately active to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, Sen and Batra [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] examined the antimicrobial activity of ethanol, methanol, petroleum ether and water extracts of 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> L. leaves versus 8 human pathogens including 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxisporum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhizopus stolonifera</italic>. All the extracts indicated considerable activity versus all pathogens; however, the alcoholic extract exhibited the maximum inhibitory concentration versus all the microorganisms. Ahmad et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] studied the antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>Alhagi maurorum</italic> leaves extract and showed that the crude extract, chloroform, and ethyl acetate fractions had prominent effects, giving over 80% inhibition versus 
 <italic>Bacillus anthrax</italic>. The crude extract displayed 80% inhibition versus 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>. Similarly, the ethyl acetate and crude extract acted well versus 
 <italic>Salmonella typhe</italic> by 78.35% and 76.50% inhibition respectively.
