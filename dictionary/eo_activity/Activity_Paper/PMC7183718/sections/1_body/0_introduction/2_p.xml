<p id="Par6">Furthermore, antioxidants helped to prevent cancer or heart diseases, as they could act as scavengers of free radicals and neutralized the damaging reactive free radicals in body cells before they could cause protein and lipid oxidation and decrease potential mutation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many researches have reported the antioxidant effect of essential oils and plant extracts. For example, Hayet et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] examined the antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> leaves, demonstrating that methanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity. Nesrin and Tolan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] proved the antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic>; however, it was lower than butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid. Ahmad et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] indicated that extracts/fractions from 
 <italic>Alhagi maurorum</italic> leaves displayed powerful radical scavenging activity, probably because of the existence of phenolic compounds in the plant.
