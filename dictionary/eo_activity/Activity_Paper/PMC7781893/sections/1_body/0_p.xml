 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> (synonym: 
 <italic>Tetradium ruticarpum)</italic>, recorded in in Chinese Pharmacopeia, is one of the well-known medicinal herbs in China. The dried unripe fruit of 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> known as ‘Wuzhuyu’ is traditionally and ethnically used as crude medicine drug (Zhao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In traditional Chinese medicine, Wuzhuyu could be used either alone or in combination with other herbal medicines to cure a lot of diseases, such as headache, epigastric pain, menorrhalgia, dermatophytosis, emesis and aphtha (Tian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Although the chemical constituents (Zhou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), anti-inflammatory effects (Liao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and complete chloroplast genome of its variant 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> var. 
 <italic>bodinieri</italic> (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) were ever reported, available genetic resource currently for 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> is still limited. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the genetic resources to further investigate the germplasm of this species.
