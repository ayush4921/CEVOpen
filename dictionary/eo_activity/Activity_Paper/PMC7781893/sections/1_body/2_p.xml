<p>NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) was used to construct a genomic library consisting of an insert size of 350 bp. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NovaSeq platform. The output was a 7.0 Gb raw data of 150 bp paired-end reads, further trimmed and assembled using SPAdes (Bankevich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Annotations of chloroplast genome were conducted by the GeSeq website and software PGA (Plastid Genome Annotator) (Qu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and checked by comparison against the

 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
