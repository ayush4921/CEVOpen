  <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> is a medicinal plant recorded in in Chinese Pharmacopeia. Here we report on the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
  <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic>. The chloroplast genome is 158,762 bp in size and includes two inverted repeat regions of 54,230 bp, which is separated by a large single-copy region of 86,267 bp and a small single copy region of 18,265 bp. A total of 131 genes were predicted, including 37 tRNA, 8 rRNA, and 86 protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis placed 
  <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> under the family Rutaceae.
