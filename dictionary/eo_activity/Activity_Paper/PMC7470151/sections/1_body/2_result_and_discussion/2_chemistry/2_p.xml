 </xref> by treating various aldehydes (
 <bold>1–5</bold>) with methyldichloroacetate (
 <bold>6</bold>) in dry ether under basic condition using sodium methoxide. Compounds 
 <bold>7–11</bold> on further reaction with thiourea under reflux condition in methanol resulted in the formation of methyl 2-amino-5-substituted-4-carboxylate derivatives (
 <bold>12–16</bold>). Hydrolysis of compounds 
 <bold>12–16</bold> with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution resulted in the formation of 2-amino-5-substituted-4-carboxylic acid derivatives (
 <bold>12a–16a</bold>). Compounds 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> on reaction with 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride and 4-methoxybenzoyl chloride, respectively, at room temperature under basic medium (triethylamine) resulted in the formation of compounds 
 <bold>12b</bold>, and 
 <bold>14b</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>14b</bold> on hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide resulted in the formation of compound 
 <bold>14c</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>12, 16, 12a,</bold> and 
 <bold>16a</bold> were prepared according to the reported procedures and their physical and spectral properties were found to be on par with the literature report
