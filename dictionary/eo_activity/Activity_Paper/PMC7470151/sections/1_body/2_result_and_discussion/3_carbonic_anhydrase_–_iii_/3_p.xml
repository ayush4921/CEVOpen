<p>The chromatographic analysis by HDM is basically based on the measurement of the intensity of the formation of vacancy (negative) peak due to the subtraction of CA-III bound portion of analytes from the mobile phase. This method is also independent of the enzyme catalytic activity, thereby considered as more sensitive method for the estimation of inhibitory activities of analytes as compared to the colorimetric assay

 </xref>. Thus, weak inhibitors created weak vacancy peaks independent of the enzyme concentrations. In case of potent inhibitors, intense vacancy peaks directly proportional to the low concentrations of CA-III was observed, followed by a steady state at higher concentrations of CA-III solutions (
