<p>Compounds 
 <bold>(12a–16a)</bold> with a free amino group at 2-position and a carboxylic acid moiety at 4-position, having an aromatic ring at 5-position of the thiazole scaffold showed good CA-III inhibitory activity. In particular, compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> with a phenyl ring at 5-position was found to be the most potent CA-III inhibitor (

 </italic>= 0.5 μM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Substitution at the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of the phenyl ring of the scaffold reduced the activity for compounds 
 <bold>13a, 14a,</bold> and 
 <bold>15a</bold> (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> = 18.9, 86.6, and 81.2 μM, respectively). However, replacing the phenyl ring with a benzyl ring completely abolished the activity for the compound 
 <bold>16a</bold> (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i </sub>
 </italic>&gt; 500 μM). Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>12–16, 12b, 13b, 14b, 14d,</bold> and 
 <bold>16b</bold> with carboxylic ester group at 4-position did not show any activity (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i </sub>
 </italic>&gt; 500 μM), indicating the importance of the carboxylic group in CA-III inhibitory activity for compounds 
 <bold>12a–16a</bold> probably by inducing electrostatic interaction at the binding site of the enzyme. Further, it has been observed that in case of carboxylic acid derivatives, conversion of free amino group into amide and urea group in compounds 
 <bold>13c</bold> and 
 <bold>14c</bold> resulted in a significant reduction of activity (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i </sub>
 </italic>= 174.1 and 186.2 μM, respectively) as compared to the compounds 
 <bold>13a</bold> and 
 <bold>14a</bold> (
