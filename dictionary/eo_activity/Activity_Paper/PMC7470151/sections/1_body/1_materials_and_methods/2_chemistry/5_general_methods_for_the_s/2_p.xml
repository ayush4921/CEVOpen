<p>Compounds 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold> (2 mM) were dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran, and triethylamine (2 mM) was added. Then 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride (2.5 mM)/4-methoxybenzoyl chloride (2.5 mM) was gradually added dropwise to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was kept in stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated to dryness and then suspended in water, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer extract was dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness. The solid product thus obtained was recrystallized with ethyl acetate, and hexane to get the target compounds 
 <bold>12b</bold> and 
 <bold>14b</bold> in quantitative yields (70–77%). Compound 
 <bold>14b</bold> on further hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide resulted in the formation of compound 
 <bold>14c</bold>.
