<p>The interaction between the enzyme and ligand in the Hummelâ€“Dreyer method (HDM) was optimised using vanillic acid as a reference standard, while changing four experimental conditions: buffer concentration, pH of the mobile phase, temperature, and proportion of organic modifier, respectively. In order to study the effect of a particular chromatographic condition, one of the four conditions was varied, and the other three conditions were kept constant. Each reading represents the average of duplicate measurements and the one achieving the optimum interaction between the enzyme and ligand was used for further consideration.</p>
