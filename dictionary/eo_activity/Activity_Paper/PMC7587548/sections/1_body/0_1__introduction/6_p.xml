<p>However, despite such popularity and the medicinal value of this plant, to date there is still lack of scientific validation on the phytochemical and pharmacological points of view. Therefore, we have aimed to evaluate the presence of anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anxiolytic, locomotion, sedative and anti-diarrheal activity of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> leaves. As one compound was identified for the plant by FTIR analysis, we carried out computational studies by using molecular docking, PASS prediction and ADME properties analysis.
