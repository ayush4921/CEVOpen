<p>To evaluate the anti-diarrheal effect of MEBPL, the method of castor-oil induced diarrhoea test was followed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-04737" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The mice were separated into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and remained unfed for 24 h. Mice from groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, received 10 mL/kg of 1% Tween-80 orally as negative control, standard drug loperamide (5 mg/kg) as positive control, doses of 200 mg/kg b.w. of MEBPL and doses of 400 mg/kg b.w. of MEBPL. After 1 h, 1 mL castor oil was given orally to every mouse and they were placed separately into boxes of blotting white paper. For each mouse, the consistency and number of both wet and dry faecal drops were observed as well as noted after each hour interval over a 4-h period. The paper was changed after every hour. Afterward, the faeces (means) of the treated groups were compared to the control group and the percentage of inhibition of defecation was calculated using the following equation (Equation (3)):
