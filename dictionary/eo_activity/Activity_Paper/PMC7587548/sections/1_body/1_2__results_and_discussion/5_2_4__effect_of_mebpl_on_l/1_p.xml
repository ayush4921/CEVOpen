<p>During the open field test, mice treated with MEBPL manifested central nervous system (CNS) depressive activity, such as decreases in exploration and locomotion. Diazepam is a drug of the benzodiazepine group and acts as a central sensory depressant through binding with the GABA receptor, moderates excitement and calms the recipient. Quantitatively, the most excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters are GABA and glutamate [

Here MEBPL (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly and dose dependently reduced the square movements in the open field test of locomotion activity (
