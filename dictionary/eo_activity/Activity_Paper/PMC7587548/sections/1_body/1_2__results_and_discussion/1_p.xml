<p>Humans have been using natural-derived medicines since primitive times to prevent and treat different diseases [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04737" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As a natural assortment, plant-derived medicines are the crucial wellspring of possibly helpful structures for the development of new compounds which could lead to establishing safe drugs [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04737" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The physiological and therapeutic activities of a plant extract are disclosed through the phytochemical analysis. The presence of numerous phyto-constituents increases the possibility of having different kinds of therapeutic activities like anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-diarrheal, thrombolytic and so on. An important phytoconstituent “alkaloids” is very beneficial for the treatment of different disorders of both humans and animals [

In our study, the analysis of qualitative phytoconstituents of MEBPL revealed that various secondary metabolites are present like alkaloids, carbohydrates, glycosides, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, fixed oil, quinones and resins, but the absence of cholesterol and protein (

However, by considering the phytochemical and ethnomedicinal value of this plant we scientifically explored the possible pharmacological potentials of
