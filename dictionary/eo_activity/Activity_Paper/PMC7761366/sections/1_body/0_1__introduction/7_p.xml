<p>Information on the antioxidant response of lambs suffering from nematode infection to feed supplementation with herbal nutraceuticals and/or zinc has thus been limited, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been undertaken to examine whether the use of dietary additives alone or in combination can affect microelements tissue uptake. Considering the occurrence of oxidative stress in lambs experimentally infected with the gastrointestinal nematode
