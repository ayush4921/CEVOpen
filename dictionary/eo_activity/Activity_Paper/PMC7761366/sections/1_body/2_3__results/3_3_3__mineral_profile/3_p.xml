<p>An interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.024) between Hmix and Zn was recorded for the Cu concentration in the kidney, with an increased Cu level in lambs fed diets with Zn alone in comparison with those fed the CON diet (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) or the one supplemented with the Hmix and Zn combination (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The dietary inclusion of Zn resulted in an elevated Cu concentration in the duodenal mucosa (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.039). The Cu concentrations in the liver and intestinal mucosa of the jejunum and ileum were not influenced by the Zn and Hmix treatment.
