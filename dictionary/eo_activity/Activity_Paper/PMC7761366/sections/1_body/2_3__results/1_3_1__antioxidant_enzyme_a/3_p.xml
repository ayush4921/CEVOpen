<p>An interaction of Hmix Ã— Zn was identified for GPx activity in the liver (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), duodenal mucosa (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and blood (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.020), and increased GPx activity was found in lambs fed diets with Hmix or Zn alone as compared to those receiving the CON diet or the Hmix and Zn combination (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01172-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and Table 4). GPx activity in the kidney, jejunal and ileal mucosa was not affected by the treatment.
