<p>The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx, EC 1.11.1.9) in tissues was performed by measuring the oxidation of NADPH according to Paglia and Valentine [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The assays were carried out at 25 °C and hydrogen peroxide was used as the substrate. The absorbance was read at a wavelength of 340 nm and enzymatic activity was presented as U/g protein. One unit of GPx activity was defined as the amount of sample needed to oxidize 1 µmol of NADPH per min at 25 °C. The activity of blood GPx and hemoglobin (Hb) content was analyzed using commercial kits from Randox, UK.
