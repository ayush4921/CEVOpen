<p>Total superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) activity was determined by spectrophotometric assay according to the procedure of Marklund and Marklund [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This method is based on the ability of SOD to inhibit the pyrogallol autoxidation at alkaline pH. Briefly, an aliquot of tissue extract was mixed with Tris-cacodylic buffer (50 mM, pH 8.2) containing diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (1 mM) and a pyrogallol solution (5 mM) and subsequently the absorbance was monitored at 420 nm for 3 min. using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550, Kyoto, Japan). The activity was expressed as the amount of enzyme that inhibits the oxidation of pyrogallol by 50%, which is equal to 1 unit per mg of protein. The activity of Cu/Zn SOD was assayed by inhibition of cytosolic SOD with 1 mM KCN under the same experimental conditions.
