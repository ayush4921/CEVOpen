<p>For the determination of antioxidant parameters, samples from each tissue were separated into three parts. Each tissue piece was weighed into a test tube and homogenized separately using a homogenizer (Polytron
 <sup>®</sup> PT 1600 E, Kinematica AG, Switzerland). One part was homogenized in a cold 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA to give a 5% homogenate (

For determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Cu/Zn SOD activity, homogenization was carried out in an ice-cold 10 mM TRIS buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose (pH 7.4) to make a 10% homogenate (

 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was used for enzyme assays. The last portion of the tissue sample, used for estimating lipid oxidation products by means of the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) method, was homogenized for 15 s at high speed in deionized distilled water (DDW) to make a 10% homogenate (
