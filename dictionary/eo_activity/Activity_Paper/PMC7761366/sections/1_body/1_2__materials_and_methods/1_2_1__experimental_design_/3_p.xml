<p>The herbal mixture (Hmix) used in our study was a non-commercial product composed of herbs typical for Central Europe, which were chosen based on the information about their phytotherapeutic properties from traditional ethnomedicine practice. The Hmix was prepared as a mixture of 9 different dry herbs obtained from commercial sources (AGROKARPATY, Plavnica, Slovak Republic, and BYLINY Mikeš s.r.o, Čičenice, Czech Republic). The mix of medicinal herbs consisted of 11.8% each of 
 <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic> L. (root), 
 <italic>Petasites hybridus</italic> L. (root), 
 <italic>Inula helenium</italic> L. (root), 
 <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic> L. (leaf), 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. (leaf), 
 <italic>Solidago virgaurea</italic> L. (stem), 
 <italic>Fumaria officinalis</italic> L. (stem), 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> L. (stem), and 5.6% 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. (seed). Quantitative analysis of the bioactive compounds in Hmix identified three main groups: Flavonoids (54%) with a high concentration of quercetin, verbascoside and luteolin; diterpenes (27%) with a high concentration of carnosic acid and carnosol; and phenolic acids (19%) with a high concentration of rosmarinic acid and chlorogenic acid [
