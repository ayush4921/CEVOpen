<p id="p0500">Aiming at finding new agents with ability of protecting the gastric mucosa, the effect of the essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Cantinoa americana</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis spicigera</italic>), containing 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (
 <bold>238</bold>), 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>250</bold>) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (
 <bold>241</bold>), was evaluated for the gastroprotective and healing activities. The results of this study showed that the tested oil (100 mg/kg, p.o.) provided effective protection against lesions induced by absolute ethanol (97%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) (84%) in rats. Furthermore, it seems that this effect is due to an increase in the gastric mucus production (28%) induced by prostaglandin-E
 <sub>2</sub> levels and a healing capacity (87%) could be observed (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Caldas et al. (2011)</xref> have demonstrated that the oral administration of 
 <italic>Medusantha martiusii</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis martiusii</italic>) essential oil, principally composed by bicyclogermacrene (
 <bold>264</bold>) (100, 200, 40 mg/kg) inhibited the ethanol, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin-induced ulcers in rats. Ethnopharmacological data reinforce this result, since this species is used to treat intestinal and stomach diseases (
