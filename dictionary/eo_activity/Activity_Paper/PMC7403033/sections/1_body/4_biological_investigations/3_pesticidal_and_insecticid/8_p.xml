<p id="p0325">Bioinseticides are promising eco-friendly substitutes to the chemical insecticides. This approach is interesting because these agents can be more selective and may last for shorter periods in the environment (

 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Elumalai et al. (2017)</xref> described the synthesis of silver nanoparticles produced with the aqueous extracts from the leaves of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>) and its insecticidal activity. The results demonstrated 100% of mortality (10 μg/mL) of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, the vectors of malaria, dengue and filariasis, respectively. These findings suggest that the nanoparticles have potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly agent for the control of the mosquito larvae. Other study reported the activity of a petroleum ether extract of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>) against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 38.39 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 64.49 μg/mL) (
