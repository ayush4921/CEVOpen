 <xref rid="bib218" ref-type="bibr">Rolim et al. (2017)</xref> evaluated the toxicity (mice erythrocytes, acute preclinical and genotoxicity) of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum sidifolium</italic> and its main component, fenchone (
 <bold>253</bold>). The results demonstrated that the essential oil induced weight loss, but presented no positive results in hematological, biochemical or histological parameters. On the other hand, fenchone (
 <bold>253</bold>) induced a decrease of hepatic enzymes, suggesting liver damage which could be a hindrance in the use of this compound in therapeutics.
