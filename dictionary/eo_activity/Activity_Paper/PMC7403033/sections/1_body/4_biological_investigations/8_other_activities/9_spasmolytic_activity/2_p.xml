 <italic>macrostachys</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis</italic>
 <italic>macrostachys</italic>) was assessed on smooth muscle models. The results demonstrated that the extract presented spasmolytic action (27–729 μg/mL) on guinea pig ileum, by blockage of calcium channels, in a concentration-dependent manner (
