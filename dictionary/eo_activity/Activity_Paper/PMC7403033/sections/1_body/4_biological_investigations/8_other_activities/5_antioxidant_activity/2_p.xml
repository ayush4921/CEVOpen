<p id="p0550">Natural antioxidants are widely distributed in food and medicinal plants. In this context, ethanolic and buthanolic extracts from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Condea undulata</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis fasciculata</italic>) were evaluated concerning their antioxidant properties. The results demonstrated a DPPH radical scavenging activity higher than that obtained with 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba,</italic> a reference plant with well documented antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="bib232" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2005</xref>). The extracts were also able to protect the eukaryotic microorganism 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> of the oxidative damage by hydrogen peroxide and menadione, a source of superoxide radical (
 <xref rid="bib233" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, essential oils of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>), 
 <italic>Hyptis rhomboidea</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyptis brevipes</italic> were tested in front of DPPH radical, being the better results obtained with 
 <italic>Hyptis brevipes</italic> (main compounds 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (
 <bold>262</bold>), methyl eugenol (
 <bold>254</bold>) and 3-allylguaiacol (
 <bold>255</bold>)) with SC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.02 μg/mL (
