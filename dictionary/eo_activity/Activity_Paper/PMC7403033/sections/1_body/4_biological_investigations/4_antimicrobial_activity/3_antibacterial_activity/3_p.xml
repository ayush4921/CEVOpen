<p id="p0355">The essential oil of 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum pectinatum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis pectinata</italic>) demonstrated a slightly inhibitory effect (MIC 200 μg/mL) against clinical isolated (patients saliva) and ATCC strains (10 449 and 25 175) of 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib182" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento et al., 2008</xref>). The same species afforded the 
 <italic>α</italic>-pyrone pectinolide H (
 <bold>157</bold>), which was active against multidrug resistant strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC 32–64 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Fragoso-Serrano et al., 2005</xref>). These results could justify the use of the referred species as antiseptic by Mexican populations, for example (

 <xref rid="bib251" ref-type="bibr">Tesch et al. (2015)</xref> compared the antibacterial activity of essential oils from the leaves and flowers and found a weak activity against gram negative bacteria strains from Enterobacteriaceae family: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> with MIC values between 300 and 450 μg/mL.
