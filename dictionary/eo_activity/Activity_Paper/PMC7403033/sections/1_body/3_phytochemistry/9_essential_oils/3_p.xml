<p id="p0240">Several studies regarding the composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>) were published up to the present time (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The specimens were collected in different parts of the world including Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Cuba, China, El Salvador, Guinea-Bissau, India, Italy, Laos, Nigeria and Venezuela. Although the plants have different origins, the chemical composition is somewhat similar, being sabinene (
 <bold>246</bold>), 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>250</bold>) and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene (
 <bold>262</bold>) the most abundant components cited in the majority of the reports.
