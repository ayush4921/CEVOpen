  <p>The subtribe Hyptidinae contains approximately 400 accepted species distributed in 19 genera (
   <italic>Hyptis</italic>, 
   <italic>Eriope</italic>, 
   <italic>Condea</italic>, 
   <italic>Cantinoa</italic>, 
   <italic>Mesosphaerum</italic>, 
   <italic>Cyanocephalus</italic>, 
   <italic>Hypenia</italic>, 
   <italic>Hyptidendron</italic>, 
   <italic>Oocephalus</italic>, 
   <italic>Medusantha</italic>, 
   <italic>Gymneia</italic>, 
   <italic>Marsypianthes</italic>, 
   <italic>Leptohyptis</italic>, 
   <italic>Martianthus</italic>, 
   <italic>Asterohyptis</italic>, 
   <italic>Eplingiella</italic>, 
   <italic>Physominthe</italic>, 
   <italic>Eriopidion</italic> and 
   <italic>Rhaphiodon</italic>). This is the Lamiaceae clade with the largest number of species in Brazil and high rates of endemism. Some species have been used in different parts of the world mainly as insecticides/pest repellents, wound healing and pain-relief agents, as well as for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders.

  <title>Aim of the review</title>
  <p>This review aims to discuss the current status concerning the taxonomy, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry and biological properties of species which compose the subtribe Hyptidinae.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Materials and methods</title>
  <p>The available information was collected from scientific databases (ScienceDirect, Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, ChemSpider, SciFinder ACS Publications, Wiley Online Library), as well as other literature sources (e.g. books, theses).</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The phytochemical investigations of plants of this subtribe have led to the identification of almost 300 chemical constituents of different classes such as diterpenes, triterpenes, lignans, 
   <italic>Î±</italic>-pyrones, flavonoids, phenolic acids and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, as components of essential oils. Extracts, essential oils and isolated compounds showed a series of biological activities such as insecticide/repellent, antimicrobial and antinociceptive, justifying some of the popular uses of the plants. In addition, a very relevant fact is that several species produce podophyllotoxin and related lignans.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Several species of Hyptidinae are used in folk medicine for treating many diseases but only a small fraction of the species has been explored and most of the traditional uses have not been validated by current investigations. In addition, the species of the subtribe appear to be very promising as alternative sources of podophyllotoxin-like lignans which are the lead compounds for the semi-synthesis of teniposide and etoposide, important antineoplastic agents. Thus, there is a wide-open door for future studies, both to support the popular uses of the plants and to find new biologically active compounds in this large number of species not yet explored.</p>
