<p>The prepared NEs were stored at a range of temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C, and 60 °C) for 3 months. In terms of physical appearance, the emulsions stored at 4 or 25 °C did not show any color changes and phase separation. After storage at 60 °C, creaming of the NE was evident, but phase separation did not occur; the size of the NE droplets increased twice than the initial value (

We also assessed the size of the NE droplets in a different condition where at 4 °C storage conditions, we could not find any significant difference in droplet size. The smaller the droplet size, the better the stability of the NE. The pH of the 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> NEs was between 5 and 6 and also had a stable zeta potential of −26. The ideal pH for NEs is 4.5−6.0 to ensure good skin absorption and stability of the formulation [
