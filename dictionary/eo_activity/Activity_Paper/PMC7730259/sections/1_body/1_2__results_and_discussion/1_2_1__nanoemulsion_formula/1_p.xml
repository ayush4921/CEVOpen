<p>Many variables are considered in the preparation of NEs for cosmetics or medicinal product formulation. Sea buckthorn oil is often used as the oil phase due to its skin conditioning properties and nongreasy feel. The type of NE (O/W or W/O) depends on the surfactant, water, or oil percentage in each phase. In oil-in-water emulsions, the water content ranges between 50% and 92%, while the surfactant content ranges between 1.5% and 10% [

 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> nanoemulsion preparations. Different types of nonionic surfactant are suitable for oil in water nanoemulsion preparation, like nonionic polysorbates surfactants (Tweens), but have different effects on size of the droplets. The smallest droplet size can produce by Tween 80 where the hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB = 15; however, others Tweens like Tween 21 (HLB = 7.6) produce larger droplet size [

In Tween 80, the double bond of oleate ester in its hydrophobic chain induce more mobility from organic phase to aqueous phase for faster production of emulsion but the unsaturated surfactant like Tween 21 reduce the mobility of the two phase resulting in poor and unstable nanoemulsion formulation [

In addition, the surfactant concentration is key factors for droplet size of the nanoemulsion. Surfactant lowers the interfacial tension between the two phase (dispersed and continuous) that leads to smaller particles size as well as the ultrasonic or homogenization time [

The higher amount of surfactant can produce the small size when high pressure method is applied due to more reduction in interfacial tension. Besides, the lower concentration of surfactant increase the droplet size due to insufficient amount of surfactant that cannot cover the droplet fully hence coalescence can occurred [
