<p>The NEs were prepared using varying proportions of the aqueous COR-Ex, oil, and surfactant, and the stability of the resulting emulsions was assessed. A NE was considered stable only when there was no creaming, flocculation, or phase separation during the observation period [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Three different formulations, S1, S2, and S3, were optimized (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05733-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We used oil and surfactant ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 where we kept that oil percentage same because high amount of oil content has tendency to form bigger droplet due to higher viscosity and also it encourages the agglomeration that form bigger particles [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among the three formulations, the S2 and S3 formulations showed a little creaming after 7 days of observation. These observations may be due to higher surfactant concentrations that made diffusion layer, which tends to cause excessive coverage of particles by surfactants and finally agglomerates the formulation by lowering the zeta-potential value [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Only the S1 formulation did not show any modification and was chosen as the most stable NE. We also used high-molecular-weight chitosan as a polymer because it can reduce instability and aggregation due to high shear thinning (pseudo plastic) with a high viscosity and a low shear rate, which is mostly used to establish a stable continuous phase [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. So finally, 88% water extract, 0.1% chitosan, 6% oil, and 6% Tween 80 was used for nanoemulsion preparation.
