<p>Sea buckthorn oil exhibited typical absorption bands in the hydrophobic region at 3009, 2936, and 2834, which were associated with antisymmetric CH
 <sub>3</sub> and CH
 <sub>2</sub> scissoring and antisymmetric CH
 <sub>2</sub> functional groups, respectively. An additional band was evident at 1752 representing C=O stretching of the ester bond. The COR-NE displayed several strong absorption bands at 3334, 2926, 1636 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> associated with –OH stretch (–OH phenolic group). The –CH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching (alkane), C=O stretch (amide), and absorption bands at 1458, 1354, 1250, and 1058 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were associated with amides I (N-H bending), ester carbonyl (C-O-C stretch), and polysaccharides, respectively. The functional group at 2926 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> represents the hydrophobic interaction between the extract and oil as part of forming the NE and the –OH bond present in the NE, which is also indicated in the COR-Ex.
