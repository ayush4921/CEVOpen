<p>COR-Ex have previously been shown to inhibit both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and Hu et al. isolated a CSAP protein from the mycelia of 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> species that showed good antibacterial efficacy [

Our results suggest that increased inhibition of Gram-negative rather than Gram-positive bacteria after formulating the COR-Ex as a nanoemulsion may have been due to differences in the bacterial cell wall/membrane, given the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall renders the outer surface highly hydrophilic. In contrast, teichoic acids in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria may facilitate penetration by hydrophobic compounds [
