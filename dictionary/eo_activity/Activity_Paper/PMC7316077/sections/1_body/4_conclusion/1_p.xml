<p>The results from this study showed that 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> methanolic extract caused no mortality, no behavioural abnormality and no significant biochemical alteration in rats, although methanolic extract modulated some of the haematology parameters. Therefore, it could be deduced that extract will probably be safe up to 2,000 mg/kg BW.The obtained result could be used to justify the safety of traditional application of the plant for treatment of various ailments, however further studies are needed to confirm these pharmacological activities and to investigate the underlying mechanism of actions of the isolated bioactive constituents of this plant.
