<p>Conversely in the present study, a significant increase was observed in some of haematology parameters, such as MCHC (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), WBC and platelets (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) when compared between treated groups and control. The increment in WBC and platelets in animals treated with 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> extract may suggest that the plant administration could induce inflammatory reaction such as inflammatory bowel disease, however further studies are needed to confirm this adverse effect. Inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease has been reported to cause increment in platelets (

 <italic>Abrus precatorius</italic> of aqueous leaves extract to rats for 21 days, which showed a significant decrease (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the levels of red blood cells, haemoglobin, packed cell volume and platelets in groups treated with 200 and 400 mg/kg BW of the extract (
