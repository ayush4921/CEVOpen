<p>The presence of different phytochemicals in medicinal plants can be linked to several biological activities and alterations in the biochemical parameters and histology patterns of the organs, especially on the liver and kidney. Phytochemical studies revealed that 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> contained several organically active metabolites such as polyphenols, saponins, phenolic glycosides, phytosterols and terpenes were identified in roots part of the plant of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Abera, Ashebir &amp; Basha, 2019</xref>). These findings are in line with our phytochemical analysis of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> which revealed the presence of steroidal saponins such as sarsasapogenin and stigmasterol (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">El-Ishaq, Alshawsh &amp; Chik, 2019a</xref>). This saponins is most implicated bioactive phytochemical for its oestrogenic properties and anti-implantation activities, which could be also alter some of the haematological parameters. The presence of saponins and other non-steroidal compounds in 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> might have different pharmacological and physiological effects on animal tissues or might act synergistically to produce different biological and toxicological effect (

 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Okello, David &amp; Oloro (2019)</xref> have revealed the presence of anti-fertility bioactive compounds such as saponins, alkaloids and phenolic in 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> root extract. In addition, the same study concluded that 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> was non-toxic up to the maximum dose of 12.8 g and the anti-fertility activity of the aqueous crude extract was found to be dose dependent.
