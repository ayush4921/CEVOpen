<p>Due to the failure in obtaining the essential oil from black morel by steam distillation, we turned to the extraction of lipophilic extracts by petroleum ether. A total of 29 constituents were identified from lipophilic extracts of fresh, oven-dried, and freeze-dried black morels, including two aldehydes, two ketones, six alcohols, eleven carboxylic acids, and carboxylic acid derivatives, six steroids, and two others (

From the fresh and freeze-dried black morels, linoleic acid was found to be the major component (77.37% and 56.46%, respectively), but no linoleic acid was found in oven-dried black morel. Linoleic acid, a member of polyunsaturated fatty acids, is a key nutrient throughout all human life [

Higher linoleic acid status was associated with reduced risk of heart diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it also improves insulin sensitivity and modulates body composition, which argues for the key role of linoleic acid-rich oils to promote cardiometabolic health [
