<p>The principle of antioxidant activity is based on the availability of electrons to neutralize any free radicals [

 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All of the tested extracts were able to reduce the stable violet-colored DPPH radical to yellow-colored DPPH-H, and showed moderate antioxidant activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 7.56 ∼ 17.52 mg/mL), compared with ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.41 mg/mL). Moreover, the lipophilic extracts of oven-dried black morel (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 7.56 mg/mL) were twice more active than that of fresh (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 17.52 mg/mL) and freeze-dried (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 14.63 mg/mL) black morel.
