<p>The aromas extraction by HS-SPME was performed as previously reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Different samples (fresh, oven-dried, and freeze-dried fruit bodies of black morel) were ground adequately and weighed (2.5 g each sample) into a 20 mL glass vial with a silicon cap. The cap was perforated with a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS, 50/30 µm) fibers holder (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA). The vial perforated with fibers was incubated in a 50 °C water bath for 45 min. The fibers were desorbed for 1 min at 270 °C in the GC injector in splitless mode.
