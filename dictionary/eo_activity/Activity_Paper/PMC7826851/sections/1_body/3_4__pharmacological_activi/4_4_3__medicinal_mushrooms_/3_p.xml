<p>Compared to the placebo group, at weeks 8, 12, and 16 of treatment, and 4 weeks of follow-up, the yamabushitake group showed significantly increased scores, although at the fourth week, after the end of ingestion, the values decreased significantly. Regardless, this fungal species has proved to be very useful in improving average cognitive impairment. Additionally, on the side of these promising results, Li et al. [

 <italic>erinaceusHE</italic> (HE) mycelium (350 mg/capsule; 5 mg/g erinacin A as active ingredient) were administered daily to patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease for 49 weeks. When comparing these subjects with the placebo group, there were significant differences in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score, a significant improvement in the Mini-Mental State Examination score, and contrast sensitivity. Furthermore, whereas in the placebo group the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from the arcuate fasciculus region in the dominant hemisphere increased significantly, in the mushroom-treated group, this was not the case, and a significant decrease in ADC values from the parahippocampal cingulum region in the dominant hemisphere was detected.
