<p>Seventy-seven subjects affected by overweight or obesity and with one or more mood disorders were randomized to receive three capsules of an HE dietary supplement for two months daily and under a low-calorie diet regimen. The supplement administered (“Mycotherapy Hericium”) consisted of 80% bulk mycelium and 20% fruiting body extract. Before treatment, after the first month, and after the second month, the abovementioned complaints were assessed by using the Symptom Checklist-90, Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale, Zung’s Self-Assessment Anxiety Scale, and Binge Eating Scale (BES). All evaluations revealed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and sleep quality in the HE-treated group. Moreover, with reference to the serum balance between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor pro-BDNF, an increase in circulating pro-BDNF levels was detected, but without fully clarifying whether these neurotrophins can actually be used as biomarkers of mood disorders.</p>
