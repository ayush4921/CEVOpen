<p>Interesting considerations were made by Deng et al. [

 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>frondosa</italic> extract orally. They found that the resulting immunological effects were quite complex and varied according to the cell type and specific cytokine. Maitake intake seemed to have a stimulatory effect on some parameters but a suppressive one on others. In particular, the biggest functional changes were observed in granulocyte response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation, IL-10 production from CD14+ cells stimulated by PMA, IL-10 production from CD3+ cells stimulated by PMA, IL-2 production from unstimulated CD56+ CD3+ cell, and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) production from CD3+ cells stimulated by LPS, all parameters for which a medium dose (5–7 mg/kg) of the fungal extract was optimal, as well as for others such as IL-10 production from CD14+ cells stimulated by PMA, monocyte oxidative burst response stimulated by N-formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), and TNF-α production from unstimulated CD3+ cells. In contrast, for augmented granulocytes’ response to fMLP, augmented IFN-γ production from unstimulated CD45RO+ CD4+ memory T helper cells, and suppressed IFN-γ production from CD45RA+ CD4+ cells stimulated by PMA, the optimal dose was the highest one (10 mg/kg). This highlights that it is often difficult to find an “optimal dose” for botanical agents, probably because they generally contain several compounds that may act differently on a variety of target cells or with different strengths. Therefore, extreme caution should be exercised when treating individuals with major illnesses.
