 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Seventy-eight cancer survivors (30/24/24) were given one, two, or three packs of Senseiro (1800 mg/pack) daily for 6 months. Adverse events were defined by subjective/objective symptoms and laboratory data according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0). Consumption of the mushroom proved safe in almost all patients. Only in nine cases were adverse events recorded, mainly digestive, such as nausea and diarrhea. Only one patient complained of a liver dysfunction-related food allergy, a drug-ymphocyte product. None of these adverse events occurred in a dose-dependent manner. No immune outcome was implemented.
