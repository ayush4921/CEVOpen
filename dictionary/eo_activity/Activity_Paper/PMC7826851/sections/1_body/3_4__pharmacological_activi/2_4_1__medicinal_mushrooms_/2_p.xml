 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>blazei</italic> Murrill, and administered them orally for six months to a total of 51 prostate cancer patients following radical prostatectomy. The parameters assessed before and after treatment were serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and PSA doubling time, with a partial response rate evaluated as the primary outcome; hormonal status (represented by serum testosterone levels) and toxicity were also evaluated. Both medicinal mushrooms had no significant cancer effect, showing no partial response in terms of PSA, and no correlation between PSA doubling time and serum testosterone levels.
