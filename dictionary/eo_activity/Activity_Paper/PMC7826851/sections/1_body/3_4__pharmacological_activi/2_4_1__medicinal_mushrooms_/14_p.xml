<p>Despite the positive results of some studies and the common therapeutic use of PSK on tumors in Asian regions, several studies in this area have shown it to be ineffective. This is the case of the RCT carried out by Miyake et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], in which they compared chemotherapy treatment based on UFT plus leucovorin (UFT/LV) with immunotherapy treatment with PSK implementation (UFT/PSK) in 357 stage IIIB or III colorectal cancer patients who had undergone Japanese D2/D3 lymph node dissection. Both the 3-year disease free-survival (DFS) and the 3-year overall survival (albeit with less marked differences) were lower in the UFT/PSK group, thus demonstrating the ineffectiveness, if not the disadvantage, of using this glycoprotein as an adjuvant to standard chemotherapy treatments in this type of patient.
