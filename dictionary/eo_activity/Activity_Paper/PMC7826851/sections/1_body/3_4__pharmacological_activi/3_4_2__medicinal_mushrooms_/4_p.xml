<p>The capacity of 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic>
 <italic>ostreatus</italic> to reduce blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides in diabetic patients was investigated by Kathun et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], while also checking for possible hepatic and renal toxicity. A clinical trial was conducted with 89 subjects consuming 50g of cooked mushroom thrice daily for 24 days, by alternating 7 days of the mushroom diet and 7 days of no mushrooms and measuring different parameters at the start and after every 7 days. The significant effects found in patients were the reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), plasma glucose, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TGs), while there was no substantial change in weight and HDL. When mushrooms were not consumed, there were significant increases in DBP, FPG and PG 2 h after breakfast (2 hPG), TC, and TGs, while SBP, HDL, and weight did not change. On resuming mushroom intake, the changes described above occurred again. Therefore, this fungal species can provide important beneficial effects in diabetic patients, without compromising liver and kidney function.
