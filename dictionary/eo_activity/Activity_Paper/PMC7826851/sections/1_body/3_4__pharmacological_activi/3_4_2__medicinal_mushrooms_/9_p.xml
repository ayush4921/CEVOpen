<p>These results suggest that 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>ostreatus</italic> might be prescribed to improve the atherogenic lipid profile, primarily TC and LDC-L, of obese hypertensive individuals. Additionally, Sayeed et al. [
 <xref rid="B106-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] performed a clinical trial to evaluate the metabolic effects of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>ostreatus</italic> in diabetic DMT2 drug-treated subjects, randomly assigning 73 women to consume 200 g/d mushrooms or placebo (equal calorie diet of vegetables) for 1 year. Significant decreases of FBG, 2-hPG, TC, TG, and LDL were observed in the treated group, whereas no differences were detected among groups for BMI, SBP, DBP, HDL, Hb, ALT, and creatinine. Finally, the hypolipidemic effects of the oyster mushroom and 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic>
 <italic>cystidiosus</italic> O.K. Mill. were tested by Jayasuriya et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] on both healthy individuals and dietetically treated DMT2 diabetics, by oral daily administration for two weeks of a suspension of one of the two freeze-dried and pulverized mushrooms at a dose of 50 mg/kg BW, followed by a glucose load. In healthy subjects, both fungal species showed a significant decrease in FPG and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG). Equally significant was the lowering of PPG in diabetic patients for both mushrooms, for whom an increase in postprandial serum insulin levels was also observed, thus indicating these mushrooms as beneficial functional foods for diabetes mellitus.
