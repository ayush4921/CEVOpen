<p>Mushrooms have been traditionally used for the maintenance of physical well-being and the treatment of numerous diseases since ancient times, especially in Asian regions. Since fairly recent times, they have become part of the sphere of dietary supplements widely employed for their health benefits, the use of which has largely entered into complementary alternative medicine (CAM) and complementary integrated medicine (CIM). Today, they are among the most commonly used of all integrative, complementary, and alternative therapies, especially in the field of oncology. This is especially the case in Asian countries, where mycotherapy has ancient and deep-rooted origins, while in Western areas, the application of mushrooms in medical therapies is still rather limited, especially in conventional medical institutions [

First of all, although a great deal of research has been carried out to highlight their various beneficial properties and thus their potential use in therapeutics, many mushrooms have only been tested in vitro or in vivo in animal models, mainly mice and rats, with little or no scientific support in vivo in humans [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, although supplement companies often specify research to support their product claims, these are preclinical or even in vitro studies. Another aspect to take into account is undoubtedly the fact that there are innumerable mushroom supplements on the market today, but for the same species, doses, preparations, manufacturing practices, and claims vary considerably between manufacturers. In the absence of standardization, significant differences can be found even in different batches from the same manufacturer. This leads to considerable difficulties in the scientific practice of clinical trials, both because they are difficult to compare, but also and above all because there is no standardization of parameters such as dose, active ingredient/s, composition, adverse effects, and interactions, which ends up compromising the validity and repeatability of any results obtained and, consequently, their use in medical practice according to the criteria it requires.
