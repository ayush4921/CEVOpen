<p>The lack of regulation and monitoring by many governments means that supplements are often not monitored to ensure that they contain the ingredients or the amount of active ingredient declared by the manufacturer. Indeed, unlisted components may be present, which may be either harmful or inert. Furthermore, the very fact that a fungal extract contains a multitude of demonstrably or potentially bioactive compounds often makes it difficult to link the effect to its true responsible agent, which also requires knowledge of the real concentration of the bioactive compounds contained in a supplement. Moreover, there is a risk that the consumer will not ingest the correct dose of an active substance, which may be higher, lower, or even non-existent [

This is due to the complexity of identifying both the “optimal dose” of the preparation needed to guarantee the desired effect and the cause–effect relationship, since the different substances may act on several parameters at the same time and, moreover, in a synergistic or antagonistic manner.
