<p>The most important are polysaccharides, structural components of the fungal cell wall. The polysaccharides have a strong ability to carry biological information. More specifically, they have antitumor, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic activity. In reality, the type and modulation of these biological activities are influenced by the specific structural features of the molecule, such as the weighted degree of branching, backbone linkage, side-chain units, and the type of constituent monosaccharides. The best known and most abundant are α- and β-glucans. Heteroglycans, peptidoglycans, and polysaccharide–protein complexes also contribute to biological activity [

They are primarily responsible for immunomodulatory effects due to their ability to bind to specific cell wall receptors and stimulate specific immune responses. Medicinal mushrooms are usually used in cancer treatments as biological response modifiers (BRMs), useful for treating cancer, reducing the side effects of therapies, and improving the quality of the patient’s life [
