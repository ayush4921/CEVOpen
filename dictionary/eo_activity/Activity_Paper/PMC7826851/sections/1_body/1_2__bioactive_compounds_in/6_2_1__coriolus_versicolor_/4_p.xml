<p>Many in vitro studies in different models (human PBMCs from healthy or cancer subjects, murine splenic lymphocytes, primary mouse peritoneal macrophages, etc.) have shown that PSP treatment induces higher levels of TNF-α and the cytokines associated with it and IL-1β (the proinflammatory signal that enhances lymphocyte proliferation), but also IL-12 (enhancer of NK and CD8+ T cell activity and inducer of interferon IFN-γ), IL-6, and Il-1α, affecting the expression of many other pleiotropic cytokines, e.g., transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (proinflammatory effects on monocytes and Th17 cells; anti-inflammatory effects on B cells and regulatory T cells (T(regs)) and the activation of macrophages, and it also induces superoxide dismutase (SOD) and increases the sensitivity of immune cells to other stimuli [
