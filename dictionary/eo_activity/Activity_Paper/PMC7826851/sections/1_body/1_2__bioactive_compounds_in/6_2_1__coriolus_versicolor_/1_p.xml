 <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic>, commonly known as tunzhi in China or turkey tail, has always been used as a “magic herb” in Asian regions and particularly in China, where ancient formulations based on this mushroom have been and are still widely used to promote good health, strength, and longevity [

The immunomodulatory properties of this mushroom are due to two protein-bound polysaccharides present in the fungal extract: the polysaccharide peptide (PSP), extracted from the deep layer cultivated mycelia of the COV-1 fungal strain and used most extensively in China, and the glycoprotein PSK (krestin), derived from the strain CM101 and used most widely in Japan. They are mainly composed of β-glucans and are among the most studied mushroom bio-compounds.
