<p>In addition to anticancer activity, cardioprotective activity was also reported by [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in their preliminary study using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice to model pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy and treatment with spore oil; the treatment resulted in a normalized ejection fraction, corrected the fractional shortening generated by TAC and reduced left ventricular hypertrophy; analysis of total RNA expression revealed the reduced expression of genes associated with cardiac failure, as well as reduced levels of RNA circ-Foxo3.
