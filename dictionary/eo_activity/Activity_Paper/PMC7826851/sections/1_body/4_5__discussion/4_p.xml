<p>All these factors also make it difficult to compare the results obtained in separate clinical studies. In this regard, it must be emphasized that another factor also comes into play, namely the preparation used to carry out the trial. Even if the same fungal species is tested, sometimes opposite or different results are obtained, as in the case of Yoshimura et al. [

 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This is also explained by the type of extract used, either because the extraction method influences the substances present or their activity, or because the concentration of a given metabolite in the extract cannot be ascertained. Furthermore, even under the same conditions, the medicinal properties of a given mushroom can vary enormously depending on the strain, the geographical area, the growing conditions and substrate used, the part of the mushroom used, and the growing stage at the moment of processing. All these parameters change the composition of the mushroom and, consequently, its bioactive capacity.
