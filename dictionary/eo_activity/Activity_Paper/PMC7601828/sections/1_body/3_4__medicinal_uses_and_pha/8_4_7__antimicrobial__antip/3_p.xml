<p>The human complementary system plays a essential role in the host’s defense against overseas invasive organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, as well as an external infection of the wound. However, activation of this system may lead to inflammatory and degenerative pathological reactions, such as systemic lupus, dermatological disorders, Sjogren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and gout [
