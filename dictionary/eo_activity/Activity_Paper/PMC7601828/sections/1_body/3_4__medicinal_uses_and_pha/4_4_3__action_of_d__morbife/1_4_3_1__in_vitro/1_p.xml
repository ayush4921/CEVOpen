<p>Several studies have previously reported the neuroprotective effect of 
 <italic>D. morbifera,</italic> and its bioactive compound mechanisms of action have been proposed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00962-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Kim et al. evaluated the neuroprotective effects of ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> against high glucose-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 and MC-ⅨC cells. Ultimately, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> treatment effectively prevented oxidative damage through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as an acetylcholine (ACh)-hydrolyzing enzyme activity in high glucose-induced PC12 and MC-ⅨC cells [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at different concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μg/mL significantly and dose-dependently inhibited mitochondrial ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the elevation of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> levels, and significantly reversed, subsequently, the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducible factor (AIF) in glutamate-induced HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and its isolated compound chlorogenic acid effectively attenuated inflammatory marker expression in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. Pre-treatment with 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at different concentrations of 100, 250, and 500 μg/mL and administration of chlorogenic acid at 0.5, 1, and 2 mM attenuated NO production, and proinflammatory mediators, and subsequently, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> suppressed the phosphorylation of both the IκB-α and NF-κB p65 subunits and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a similar study, Shim et al. demonstrated that treatment with 10 μg/mL of significantly suppressed the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuated the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling. In addition, the treatment up-regulated the M2 polarization of alternative anti-inflammatory markers, while reducing the expression of the classical, pro-inflammatory M1 activation in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells [
 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We also recently reported on the neuroprotective action of rutin, which is isolated from 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> in SH-SY5Y cellular models of neurotoxicity induced by rotenone. Rutin administration at 1, 5, and 10 µM significantly attenuated high levels of intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and reduced the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), subsequently lessening the rotenone-induced generation of ROS levels in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, rutin treatment modulated the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and caspase-3 activation and prevented apoptotic cell death. Finally, it was also observed that rutin effectively suppressed JNK and p38 MAPK signaling induced by rotenone [
