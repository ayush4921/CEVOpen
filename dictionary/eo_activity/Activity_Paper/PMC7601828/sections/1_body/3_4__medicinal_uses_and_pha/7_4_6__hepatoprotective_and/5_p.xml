<p>The immunomodulatory effect of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> branch water extracts increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the inflammatory mediators in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> was involved in the activation of NF-κB signaling, as well as the phospho-IκBa. The translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, was also increased in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, an in vivo study demonstrated that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> given orally at 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg increased splenocyte cytokines, NO production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, as compared to the control group. Collectively, the results of this study suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts enhanced innate immune response by modulation of NF-κB signaling, leading to the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and acted as a therapeutic in the context of immune stimulation [
