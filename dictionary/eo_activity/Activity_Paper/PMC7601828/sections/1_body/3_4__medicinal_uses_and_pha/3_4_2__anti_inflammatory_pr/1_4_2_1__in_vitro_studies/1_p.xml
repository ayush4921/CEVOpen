<p>Several findings have previously confirmed that extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> have potential anti-inflammatory activities. The main mechanism involved here is thought to be the down-regulation of the protein nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Choo et al. demonstrated that anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts from the leaves of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Their study results displayed that 200 and 400 µg/mL of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> significantly inhibited the nitric oxide (NO) production and the lowered expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in LPS-stimulated cells. Further, it was also determined that 
 <italic>D.</italic>
 <italic>morbifera</italic> treatment significantly decreased NF-κB activation in the LPS-stimulated group. However, the activation of IκB-α was not significantly changed [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Other in vitro studies have suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts have anti-inflammatory activities. The in vitro experiments result revealed that varying methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> (10, 25, 50, and 100-µg/mL chloroform fractions) significantly and, in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited the production of NO, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>), IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 8.2 and 14.8 µg/mL, respectively. The levels of messenger (mRNA) expression in each cytokine were also inhibited by 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> chloroform fraction, supporting that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> has potential anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hyun et al. reported that methanolic extracts collected from two different period of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaves (green and senescent leaves)
 <italic>,</italic> and its bioactive derivative phenolic compounds, such as quercetin, rutin, ferulic acid, (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, myricetin, and resveratrol exhibited a strong anti-inflammatory effect against LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Kim et al. reported that 1-tetradecanol, which was isolated from the n-hexane fraction of 
 <italic>D. morbifera,</italic> effectively inhibits Helicobacter pylori stain-induced pro-inflammatory mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-8 in gastric epithelial cells. These results confirmed that treatment with different concentrations of 1-tetradecanol (30, 100, and 300 µM) treatments may have a potential preventive effect on gastric inflammation induced by H. pylori [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic>, suppresses LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines and their mediators in a dose-dependent manner. More specifically, different concentrations of oleifolioside-A (0, 5, 10, and 15 μM) effectively suppressed NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in both the mRNA and protein expression, and following treatment, significantly and dose-dependently inhibited IκB-α degradation and phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit to the nucleus [
