<p>Several findings have strongly confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> demonstrated by animal experiments. Kim et al. demonstrated that water extracts from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 25-mg/kg oral administration favorable anti-inflammatory effects in cisplatin-induced male Sprague–Dawley rats. It could significantly reduce the inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression. The same study also found that IL-10 expression was significantly diminished by 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administration in cisplatin-induced rats [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and suggested that water extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 25 mg/kg administration suppressed proinflammatory cytokine secretion and significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in diabetic rats. The authors also confirmed that extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> markedly inhibited transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression in diabetic rats [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg daily for 14 days significantly and dose-dependently reduced levels of TNF-α, various interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-12p70, and IL-13), and elevated interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in immunized BALB/C mice [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taken together, both these cellular and animal experiments confirm that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> and its bioactive compounds have potential as novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents capable of targeting NF-κB signaling.
