<p>Obesity is a complex disease. It is linked with several metabolic complications, including insulin resistance, hypertension, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Herein, the authors reported that water extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> demonstrated no toxicity at a concentration ranging from 5 to 500 Î¼g/Ml in 3T3-L1 cells. It has also been suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> might ensure improved cell viability and may trigger reduction in intracellular triglyceride level and glucose uptake. Furthermore, 
 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> treatment inhibits adipogenesis-related genes in both protein and mRNA expression, suggesting the presence of anti-obesity effects, especially also given an earlier report confirmed that 
 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> is a cholesterol-lowering agent [
