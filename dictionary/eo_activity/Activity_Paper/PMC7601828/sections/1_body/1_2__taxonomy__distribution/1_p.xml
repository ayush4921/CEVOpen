<p>Araliaceae is a broadly distributed family that presently consists of 55 genera, 1500 species, and one subfamily (Aralioideae) [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which the genus 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> belongs to. This genus of 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> has the highest species diversity, and consists of 91 to 95 species that are distributed across China, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, Taiwan, Laos, Mexico, Central America, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela, of which five are found in Brazil [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00962-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus presents a high level of morphological diversity. The species of the genus 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> plants are evergreen trees occurring in tropical and subtropical regions, which is a small understory shrub. In these plants, the stem is vertical; can grow to a height of 5 m; and may be unlobed, or have either two or three to five lobes. Plants of the 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus grow moderately, at a rate of up to 1.5 feet per year [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The flowers are yellowish-green, and their smooth bark is pale yellowish-gray, borne on umbels, up to 0.4 wide. The species of the genus 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> prefer to grow in partial shade on well-drained soil. 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> species generally have a solitary terminal flower clusters and inflorescence morphology, and also there is the presence of simple umbel to a small compound inflorescence within the same species been observed in 
 <italic>D. chevalieri</italic> and 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> [

 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Species of 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> is limited in its distribution and have limited genetic variation out of genetic disorders or close mating, compared to the other species of trees [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among the species of the genus 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic>, the scientific name of the Hwangchil tree is 
 <italic>D. morbifera,</italic> and this plant is widespread in South-western Brazil, Korea, and Japan. In Greek, “dendro” means tree, and “panax” means panacea [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> is a golden color medium-sized tree of 15 meters in height with oval-shaped duck feet like leaves. Blooming of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> flowers happens between June to August and produce black fruits between the September and November [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> tree grows mainly in wet tropical regions of warm temperate places around the world, especially in Korea [
