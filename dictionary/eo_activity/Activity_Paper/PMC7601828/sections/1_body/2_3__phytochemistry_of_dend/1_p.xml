<p>Despite the growing interest in pharmacologically active phytochemicals sourced 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> species, as far as we know, only a few studies considering the phytochemical and pharmacological features of this genus plant species have been conducted to date. The 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> genus has been shown to contain polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, pyrimidines, essential oils, terpenoids, phenol carboxylic acids, and alkaloids. From the available literature, the species 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> has been the most-widely investigated, although 
 <italic>D. dentiger, D. arboreus, D. chevalieri, D. proteus,</italic> and 
 <italic>D. querceti</italic> have also been examined. In recent decades, the phytochemical and main bioactive compounds of
