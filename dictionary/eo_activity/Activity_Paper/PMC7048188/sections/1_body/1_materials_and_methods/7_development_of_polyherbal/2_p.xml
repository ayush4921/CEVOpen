<p>Further, the stock solution was diluted and used for testing purposes. A total of 10 combinations was subjected to evaluation. Polyherbal combination from randomized block design was ABCD, ABC, BCD, ABD, ACD, AB, AC, AD, BD and CD where A, B, C and D denote 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic>, 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic>, respectively. The combinations were screened for XO inhibition potential and DPPH scavenging activity. For validation of the statistical model, different concentrations of one combination were tested for the selection of the best combination. The best combinations of the extract, which showed maximum XO inhibition and DPPH scavenging potential were selected for further 
 <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> evaluation.
