 <italic>B. diffusa</italic> (roots), 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic> (roots), 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> (flowers) and 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic> (stem bark) were procured from M/s Universal Biotech, Delhi, India. Taxonomist Dr H. B. Singh, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR), New Delhi, authenticated the collected plant materials. The voucher specimen of plant materials was deposited in the Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, with voucher No. GM/SS/PP/FP-08 to 11. The plant samples were dried individually in a hot air oven at 50 °C for 72 h. The dried plant materials were coarsely powdered (passed through 20 mesh) and kept in air-tight containers until used. Individual plant materials were separately extracted by heating at 60 °C with ethanol-water (70:30 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for 8 h. The hydroethanolic extract was concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) for the complete removal of solvent. The residue was weighed for determination of extractive value and stored at 4 °C for further characterization.
