<p>Each dried extract (100 mg) was dissolved separately in 20 mL of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade methanol (5 mg/mL). Prepared solutions were vortexed, sonicated, filtered and used for analysis. The chromatographic profiling was carried out with the use of HPLC system (Shimadzu, JAPAN) equipped with a ultraviolet (UV) detector, a gradient pump and the CLASS-VP software for data acquisition and processing. Filtered extract (10 µL) solution was injected and allowed to separate in the gradient elution mode using a Hypersil C18 (5 µ particle size) column (150 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Water with 0.5% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) were used as a mobile phase in a gradient elution programme: from 0 to 5 min, 80% A; from 5 to 12 min, 60% A; from 12 to 20 min, 40% A; from 20 to 30 min, 10% A and further it was returned to the initial composition of phase. The flow rate of mobile phase was set to 1 mL/min and a total run time of 30 min. The UV-Visible detector was set at 254 nm to record the chromatograms. For the determination of the quality of the extract, the total number of peaks were identified.
