<p>XO inhibitory activity was measured as described in the manufacturer’s protocol of EnzyChrom
 <sup>TM</sup> Xanthine Oxidase Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) as per a previously developed method (Bustanji et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The substrate and the enzyme solutions were prepared immediately before use. The absorption of the reaction mixture was recorded at 570 nm immediately and after 20 min incubation at room temperature and the initial rate was calculated. The extract, dissolved in 70% methanol and diluted with sodium phosphate buffer, was incorporated in the enzyme assay to assess its inhibitory activity at different concentrations ranging from 50–300 μg/mL. All tests were run in triplicate. Inhibition percentages are the mean of three observations. A negative control (blank; 0% XO inhibition activity) was carried out following the same procedure without the extract. Allopurinol was used as a positive control in the assay mixture. The XO inhibitory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition and was calculated as follows:
