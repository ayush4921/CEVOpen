<p>The levels of TNF-α in the serum were increased after methotrexate injection. An increase in serum TNF-α was reported earlier in a model of nephrotoxicity (Morsy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The elevated renal expression of TNF-α appears to play a pathogenic role in methotrexate nephrotoxicity. Taken together, these results provide strong support for the view that TNF-α is an essential component in the mechanism of nephrotoxicity. Recent reports suggest that TNF-α may play a role in acute renal ischaemia (Harken et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and endotoxemic injury (Knotek et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Inhibition of TNF-α action, either with a TNF-binding protein or neutralizing antibodies reduced ischaemic injury in rats (Harken et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We note that the TNF-α inhibitors reduced but did not wholly prevent nephrotoxicity. Further studies will be necessary to conclude if the measurement of serum or urine TNF-α levels may have value in identifying individuals with early methotrexate nephrotoxicity. Inhibition of TNF-α release or TNF-α activity afforded protection from methotrexate nephrotoxicity.
