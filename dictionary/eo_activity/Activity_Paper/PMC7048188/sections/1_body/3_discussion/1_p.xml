<p>Nephrotoxicity signifies a condition of renal dysfunction that arises due to exposure to environmental chemicals or drugs. Oxidative stress and inflammation are the main pathological pathways involved in its aetiology, among others. A multifactorial condition like nephrotoxicity demands for a multipronged treatment modality for its mitigations. In this context, our current study aimed to develop a polyherbal combination for the amelioration of drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Four traditionally used Indian Medicinal plants were selected for this study. The extracts were characterized through their total phenolic content, flavonoid content and HPLC analysis. The parameters to maximize extraction efficiency were optimized using RSM. The different combinations were developed by randomized block design and screened for their XO inhibition potential and antioxidant activity. Out of these, the two best combinations were selected and tested against methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity in rats to generate scientific data in support of
