<p>The inflammatory mediator, TNF-α, was also assessed in different groups. It is a crucial player in the inflammatory response during methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity. Polyherbal combination treatment significantly decreased the elevation of TNF-α levels in comparison to the methotrexate intoxicated group (
