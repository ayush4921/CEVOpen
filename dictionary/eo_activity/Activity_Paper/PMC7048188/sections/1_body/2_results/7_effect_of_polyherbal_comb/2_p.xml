<p>Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, catalase, malonaldehyde and alkaline phosphatase in serum as well as in kidney homogenates. The level of oxidative markers in serum and kidney homogenates of normal rats, methotrexate-treated rats and methotrexate-induced nephrotoxic rats treated with combinations are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. Serum malondialdehyde was evaluated as an indicator of renal lipid peroxidation and catalase as a ROS indicator. Combinations significantly suppressed both lipid peroxidation and ROS production. Oxidative markers in both serum and kidney homogenates were increased significantly in methotrexate-treated rats as compared to normal rats. The treatment with both the combinations significantly reversed the elevated oxidative markers. However, no significant changes in oxidative markers of normal rats treated with combination were observed.
