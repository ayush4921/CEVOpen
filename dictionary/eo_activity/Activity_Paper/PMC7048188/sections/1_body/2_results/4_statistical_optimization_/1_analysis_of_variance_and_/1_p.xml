<p>Three significant parameters that affect the extraction efficiency and antioxidant potential, namely extraction time, drug-solvent ratio and alcohol-water ratio, were optimized using Box-Behnkenâ€™s Design. Four selected plant materials were extracted under specified conditions separately. The yield of extract and its antioxidant activity were the two responses considered for optimization. The experimental and the predicted yield values of each plant extract are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the experimental and predicted antioxidant activities of each extract prepared. Results were the average of three independent assays.
