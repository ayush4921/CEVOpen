<p>Randomization has been widely accepted to reduce the risk of error considerably. Blocking reduces known but irrelevant sources of variation between conditions, thus allow a more precise estimation of the real causes of the variation. A total of 10 combinations were formulated by combining four optimized extracts and were screened 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for their antioxidant activity and xanthine oxidase inhibition potential. The results of antioxidant activity and XO inhibition potential of these combinations have been shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. Combination ABCD showed better XO inhibition potential followed by ABD as compared to other combinations. Thus, these two combinations were selected for further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation.
