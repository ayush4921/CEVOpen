<p>To support the outcomes of the renal function markers, histopathological modifications were examined. Both control and combination-treated groups showed a typical histological pattern. Histopathological examination revealed that injection of methotrexate produced degeneration of renal tubules that showed cystic luminal dilatation as compared to the control group. Administration of both combinations at different doses was able to reverse methotrexate-induced histopathological damage (
