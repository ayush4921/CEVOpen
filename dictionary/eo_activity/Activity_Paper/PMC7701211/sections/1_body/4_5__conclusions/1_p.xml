<p>Alkaloids are the major components in CR extracts, and the anti-inflammatory property of CR extracts increased in parallel to the amount of alkaloid in CR extracts. Besides, the highest abundant, quality chemical, and/or analgesic alkaloids, including dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine, demonstrated good anti-inflammatory activity in reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokine and suppressing the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokine. In addition, their application promoted I

 <italic>α</italic> expression, suppressed activation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B transcriptional element, and reduced the nuclear accumulation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B. Therefore, the results supported that the alkaloids were the major anti-inflammatory active compounds in CR extracts, and the anti-inflammation pathway of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine was firstly revealed.
