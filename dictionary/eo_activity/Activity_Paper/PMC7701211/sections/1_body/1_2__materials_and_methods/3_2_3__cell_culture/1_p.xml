<p>Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC account number TIB-71; Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fatal bovine serum (FBS, A Biochemical Company, Shanghai, China), 100 IU/mL penicillin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of streptomycin (Sigma). The cells were cultured in 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> plastic plate in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C and supplied with fresh DMEM culture medium every other day. After 80% confluence, the cells were scraped with a scraper, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in fresh DMEM culture medium, and seeded into new cell plate for inflammatory activity assay. Reagents for cell cultures were purchased from Shanghai Univ Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).
