<p>The vector, pGL4.32 [luc2P/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>BRE/Hygro], contains five copies of an NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B response element (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, 5′-GGG AAT TTC CG-3′) that drives transcription of the luciferase reporter gene luc2P (
 <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic>) (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Transient transfection of RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plate with the cDNA vector was performed with jetPRIME® reagent, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The transfection efficiency was over 50% in RAW cell culture, as determined by another control plasmid having a 
 <italic>β</italic>-galactosidase gene under a cytomegalovirus enhancer promoter. The luciferase assay was performed by a commercial kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). In brief, the transfected cells in 24-well plate were treated with different concentrations of dehydrocorydaline (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydaline (10, 15, 30, and 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydalmine (15, 30, 60, and 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and dexamethasone (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), followed by treated with LPS (20 ng/mL) referring to steps in “measurement of proinflammatory cytokines.” The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS after the medium was aspirated and lysed by 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 4°C. The resuspended lysate was centrifuged at 13,200 rpm 20 min; then the supernatant was collected and used to perform luciferase assay (Tropix). The activity was expressed as absorbance (up to 560 nm) per mg of protein.
