<p>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) is an important transcription factor playing a crucial role in promoting expression of proinflammatory cytokine. Normally, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is a deactivated state by masking with I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> in cytosol [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which is activated by degrading I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> when stimulated by LPS. In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory pathway of alkaloids in cultured RAW 264.7 cells, the expressions of I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> protein and pNF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B-Luc were determined by western blot and luciferase assay. In LPS-treated cultures, application of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine promoted the expression of I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> in a dose-dependent manner: the maximal induction was robust, as good as that of dexamethasone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>). In this activation, corydaline showed the best result. In pNF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B-Luc transfected cultures, the applied LPS induced the luciferase activity by ∼20 folds. The induction was markedly suppressed by dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine in dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Here, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine showed better regulation in suppressing pNF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B-Luc activity in RAW 264.7 cells.
