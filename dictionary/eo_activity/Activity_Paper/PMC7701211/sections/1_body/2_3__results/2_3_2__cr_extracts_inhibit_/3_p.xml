<p>The mRNA expressions of proinflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 cells, determined by quantitative real-time PCR, were markedly induced by LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In LPS-treated cultures, application of ethanolic CR extract suppressed the expressions of mRNAs encoding TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, which were in dose-dependent manners. The ethanolic CR extract at 20 mg/mL fully suppressed the inflammation, triggered by applied LPS: this robust suppression was similar to that of dexamethasone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As seen from the alkaloid composition of CR extract, the quaternary protoberberine alkaloids were the main components in CR. Besides, dehydrocorydaline was the highest abundant component among CR quaternary protoberberine alkaloids. Therefore, it was strongly indicated that dehydrocorydaline and other quaternary protoberberine alkaloids could be the major player in anti-inflammatory property of CR.
