  <p>CR extracts inhibit protein expressions of proinflammatory cytokines. Cultured RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plates were treated with different doses of CR extracts by water and different fractions of ethanol (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for 2 hours, followed by added LPS (20 ng/mL) and cultured for further 6 hours. The doses of CR extracts from 5 to 20 mg/mL were chosen as noncytotoxicity according to their cell viability in Supplement 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure 1</xref>. The cultured medium was collected and tested for levels of proinflammatory cytokines by ELISA. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM,
