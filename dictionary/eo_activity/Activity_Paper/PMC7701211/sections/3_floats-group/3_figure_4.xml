  <p>CR extract inhibits transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. Cultured RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plates were treated with the different doses of CR extract of 100% ethanol, as well as LPS (20 ng/mL), as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. After the treatment, the cells were harvested for measurement of TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
   <italic>β</italic> mRNAs by real-time PCR. Data are expressed as fold of change to basal (no drug), in mean ± SEM, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, each with triplicate samples.
