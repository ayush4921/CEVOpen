<p>However, in the case of human melanoma A375 cells, the data obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f003">Figure 3</xref>) revealed that both extracts, OBHE and OBAE manifest an important cytotoxic effect, the lowest viability (64.42%) being registered when the cells were exposed to the highest concentration—150 µg/mL of OBHE. Nevertheless, the A375 cells stimulated with the concentration of 150 µg/mL OBAE expressed viability of 76.40%. Apart from these treatment groups, cell viability rates were above 83%.
