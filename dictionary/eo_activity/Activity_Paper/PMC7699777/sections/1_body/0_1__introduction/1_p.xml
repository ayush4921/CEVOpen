 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. (basil) belongs to the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family, genus 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic>, is a medicinal plant used for many years as a culinary herb for flavoring the food products. 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. also known as sweet basil, basil extracts or basil based formulations, are very important due to their medicinal value, being a promising approach for the treatment of various illnesses [

Moreover, basil is used in perfumery, cosmetology, dental and oral products, sanitary due to its aroma given by the essential oils extracted which possess remarkable biological properties, such as: antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, larvicidal and antihelmintic properties [

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. is diverse and it is characterized by a great variability in its chemotypes: linoleic acid, linalool, eugenol, methyl chavicol, methyl eugenol, geraniol, geranial, neral, methyl cinnamate, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, phytol, palmitin 2-mono, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol being the major compounds [

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. has an impressive background in traditional medicine in order to treat various diseases like headaches, coughs, fever, diarrhea, constipation, warts, worms, internal piles and kidney malfunctions [

 <italic>Ocimum bascilicum</italic> L. oil can be used to protect from insect bites, snake bites, colds and for the treatment of rhinitis. In addition, basil treats the acne by applying its oil directly to the human skin [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Due to a defective epidermal permeability barrier function, the human skin becomes sensitized and its constant contact with the surrounding environment leads to an aggravation of its awareness [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Exposed to external factors (environmental—solar radiation, air pollution; lifestyle—cosmetic usage, smoking, alcohol; psychological—stress), sensitive skin manifests certain unpleasant sensations such as: stinging, burning, itching, pain and tingling [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After the appearance of these unpleasant sensations, the first clinical signs of sensitive skin are erythema, inflammation, edema and facial flush [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Nowadays, various pharmaceutical formulations can relieve the detailed signs and symptoms, but the advantages of using these products regarding the improvement or even to reduce erythema are limited. Extensive research studies are focused on the preparation and evaluation of pharmaceutical formulation based on plant phytocompounds in order to reduce erythema of sensitive skin. Wang and co-workers have demonstrated that the cream formulation based on a mixture of plant extract and essential oil (with anti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties), improved stratum corneum hydration, roughness, and erythema, without changing TEWL (transepidermal water loss). Moreover, after 28 days of treatment, the plant formulation improved texture and skin hydration [

The authors found that the herbal formulation improves permeability barrier function as well as skin brightness and reduces the skin sensitivity and erythema in all subjects with sensitive skin [
