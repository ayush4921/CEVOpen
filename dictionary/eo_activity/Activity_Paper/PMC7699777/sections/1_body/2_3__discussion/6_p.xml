The evaluation of the antioxidant activity is directly related to type and plant organs; geographic region; conditions of the atmosphere; soil consistency; as well as to the method employed for antioxidant activity evaluation. Many methods regarding the assessment of AOA, both in vitro and in vivo, are published in literature. The DPPH assay is by far the most widely used method due to its simplicity, low cost, reproducibility and precise result. DPPH method is based on the ability of an antioxidant (contained in the plant extract) to reduce an oxidant (in this caseâ€”DPPH radical). The redox reaction takes place with color change, from deep purple in solution to pale yellow. The stronger the oxidant is decolorized, the higher the antioxidant capacity is [
