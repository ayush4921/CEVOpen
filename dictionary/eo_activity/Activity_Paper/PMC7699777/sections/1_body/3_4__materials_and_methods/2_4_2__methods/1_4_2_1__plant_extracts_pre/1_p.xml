The final extracts were filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure at 35 °C using a rotary evaporator, subsequently lyophilized and stored in the refrigerator (−4 °C) until further testing. Both extracts—OBAE and OBHE—were characterized in order to enhance the knowledge about the phytochemistry of this ancient medicinal plant with important medicinal potential.
