<p>The TF and TFv content of both hydro-alcoholic extracts were evaluated using the aluminium colorimetric assay according to Rouphael et al. method, slightly modified [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 mL of each extract was treated with 0.5 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> ethanolic solution (2%), allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature and for flavonols evaluation samples, 0.5 mL of each extract was mixed with AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> 2% and CH
 <sub>3</sub>COONa 5%, and allowed to stand for 3 h at room temperature. Absorbance values were read at 417 nm for flavonoid content and at 445 nm for flavonols content by using the UviLine 9400 Spectrophotometer (from SI Analytics). Rutin was used as reference standard (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.998) and results are expressed as milligrams of rutin equivalents (RE) per gram of dry material.
