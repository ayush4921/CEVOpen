  <p>Viability percentage of HaCaT, 1BR3, HEMa and JB6Cl41-5a cells after stimulation with basil hydro-alcoholic extracts (25, 50, 75 and 150 µg/mL), at 24 h post-stimulation. The results are expressed as cell viability percentage (%) normalized to control cells. The data represent the mean value ±SD obtained from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. One-way ANOVA analysis was applied to determine the statistical differences in rapport with positive control-treated cells followed by the Tukey’s test (*
