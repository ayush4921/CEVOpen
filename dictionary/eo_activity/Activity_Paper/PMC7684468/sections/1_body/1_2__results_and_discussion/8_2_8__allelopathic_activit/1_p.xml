<p>The seed germination, seedling growth and hydration of 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> L. (kohlorobi) and 
 <italic>lens culinaris</italic> Medik (lentils) were obtained upon exposure to 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol extracts at five different concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05032-f005">Figure 5</xref>). For germination, water control showed 60% and 90% germination in kohlrabi and lentils seeds, respectively.The organic extracts of 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem showed different percentages of seed germination inhibition, which decreased as the concentration decreased. A complete failure of germination was recorded in chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts at a concentration of 20 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, while a stimulation of germination of kohlrabi was noticed in dichloromethane and ethanol extracts at 1.25 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, the germination of lentil species was moderately inhibited by all extracts. The inhibition percentage on seed seedling differed among extracts and the species. Indeed, kohlrabi shoot and root lengths were reduced at the highest concentration of each extract (20 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). For lentils, the shoot length was reduced at 20 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> with percentages ranging from 2.71% to 71% and stimulated at lower concentrations with a percentage range from −24.63% to 2.71%. In contrast, the root lengths were stimulated with a percentage from −357% to −5%. Compared to control, the hydration effect on seedling was similar. The attained results demonstrate the allelopathic effect of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>atropurpurea</italic> L. stems, and this effect depended on the quality and quantity of allelochemical compounds, e.g.; phenolic compounds, which are reported as herbicides or pesticides according to their structure [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], namely chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid derivatives [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, and vanillin [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Such results might support the use of 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. extracts as potential allelopathic substances, which would be tested as a potential natural herbicide resource.
