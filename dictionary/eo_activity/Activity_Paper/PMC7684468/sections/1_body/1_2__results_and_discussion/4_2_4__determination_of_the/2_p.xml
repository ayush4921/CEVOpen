<p>Quantitative investigations demonstrated an important difference between polar and apolar extracts for vanillin. In apolar extracts (dichloromethane and chloroform extract), the vanillin was detected as the major compound, with a value of 104.11 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>; nevertheless, it was not detected in polar extracts (ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts). Vanillin, a condensed tannin, is used as a food additive and its presence was previously highlighted in 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species; 
 <italic>S. hymettia</italic> [

 <italic>S. stellata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, the flavones luteolin hexoside (564.58 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and two dicaffeoylquinic isomers (224.38 and 213.63 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) were major acids detected exclusively in a polar extract with important values (

 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. leaves and stems, with no quantitative data [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The same study revealed luteolin-7-O-gentiobioside, luteolin-7-O-D-rutinoside, and luteolin derivatives in methanol and butanol extracts. Additionally, luteolin was found to be ubiquitous in other 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species (
 <italic>S. tenuis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. stellata</italic>) and identified in ethanol and methanol extracts [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A high dietary intake of luteolin seems to low the risk of acute myocardial infarction, and it was proven to have in vivo cancer chemopreventive properties [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers detected herein indicating a molecular formula of C
 <sub>25</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub> and showing a deprotonated ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 515, was closely related to the chlorogenic derivatives 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic and 4,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acids, with the same formula and different protonation level (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 517), recently isolated from 
 <italic>S. stellata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of dicaffeoylquinic acids have also been reported [
