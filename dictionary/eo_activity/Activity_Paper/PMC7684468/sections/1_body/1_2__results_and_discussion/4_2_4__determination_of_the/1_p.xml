<p>Identification of the phenolic compounds was carried out by the comparison of PDA absorption (λ
 <sub>max</sub>), the specific mass-to-charge ratio (
 <italic>m/z</italic>) with data reported from literature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05032-f002">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05032-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A total of 19 compounds were characterized by HPLC-PDA and HPLC-ESI/MS, and tentative identification is summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05032-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. These compounds belong to two different phenolic classes according to their chemical structure, including seven phenolic acids and seven flavonoids. A distribution that tracked the number of phenolic compounds in each sub-class revealed the presence of esters (chlorogenic acid), phenolic aldehyde (vanillin), hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (caffeic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamic acid, and dicaffeoylquinic acid), flavones (cynaroside, hyperoside, luteolin hexoside, and luteolin), isoflavonoid (isoquercitrin), and lignin (syringaresinol hexoside) in 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem extracts. Among the characterized molecules, all compounds detected in dichloromethane extract were also detected in chloroform extract, while only nine of them were common in the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts. A total of four compounds were present in all extracts (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamic acid, and cynaroside). This difference might be explained by the difference in polarity between the solvents used in the extraction process. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the profiling in phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem extracts is herein reported for the first time. The phenolic concentration reached a maximum at 2790.74 μg per gram of ethanol extract, followed by ethyl acetate extract (199.31 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), the chloroform extract (201.83 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and dichloromethane extract (129.15 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Cynaroside was the most abundant phenolic compound in the range of 39.79–741.60 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, with the highest amount detected in the ethanol extract. Such a compound was reported as anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic agent [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and it has been detected frequently in 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. from Egypt, but also in other 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species (
 <italic>S. olgae, S. tenuis,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. argentea</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Chlorogenic acid was present in all extracts with a value ranging from 6.08 to 657.78 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and relatively the highest amount was detected in ethanol extract. Chlorogenic acid is a dietary polyphenol known for its important biological activities [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and it has been detected in 
 <italic>Scabiosa olgae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and 
 <italic>Scabiosa bipinnata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Recently, HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>S. tschiliensis</italic> whole plant demonstrated a high content in chlorogenic acid, especially in the ethyl acetate extract (45.35 ± 2.63 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Caffeic acid and quercimeritrin were also common with this 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species [
