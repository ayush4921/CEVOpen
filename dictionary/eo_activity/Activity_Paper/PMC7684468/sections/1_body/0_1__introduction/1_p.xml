<p>Extracts and essential oils recovered from plants have been described as a good natural reservoir, harboring bioactive secondary metabolites, with wide use in cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical industries. They present a diversity of chemical structures, which are unsurpassed by the synthetic libraries. Novel scientific trends imply the usage of natural products, such as essential oils, plant extracts, or pure compounds in medical therapies [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Lately, researchers became interested to highlight the chemical composition of several plants, used by our ancestors to treat diseases. Subsequently, many instrumental techniques have been developed to give prompt information, which is the main choice for profiling complexes, especially for extracts and essential oils. Among these techniques, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) turned out to be the most selected technique to identify bioactive compounds of extracts, providing corresponding phenolic and pigment profiles. On the other hand, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been maintained to obtain the volatile profile of plants [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The bioactive compounds obtained from plants correspond to the major biochemical classes; among them, phenols, pigments, alkaloids, and terpenes possess very important biological activities, namely antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, and allelopathic [

 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> is a small genus of Dipsacaceae (Caprifoliaceae) family, represented by about 100 species all over the world and most of them grows in the Mediterranean region [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Eleven species of 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> were identified from Tunisian flora: 
 <italic>Scabiosa arenaria</italic> forssk, 
 <italic>Scabiosa stellata</italic> L.; 
 <italic>Scabiosa crenata</italic> Cyr.; 
 <italic>Scabiosa daucoides</italic> Desf.; 
 <italic>Scabiosa robertii</italic> Bonn, 
 <italic>Scabiosa atropurpurea</italic> L. (

 <italic>Scabiosa rutifolia</italic> Vahl.; 
 <italic>Scabiosa farinose</italic> Coss.; 
 <italic>Scabiosa succisa</italic> L.;

 <italic>Scabiosa thysdrusiana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many sources indicated various biopotential and therapeutic benefits of 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species in the Mediterranean area. Accordingly, the aerial part of 
 <italic>S. columbaria</italic> was used to treat diphtheria in Spain [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the flowers and the leaves of 
 <italic>Scabiosa stellata</italic> L were used as a cracked heel remedy in Moroccan tradition [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, several biological proprieties, such as antibacterial [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] activities, were accredited to 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species. The health benefits of 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> are often attributed to its content in phenols [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and iridoid glucosides [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. is a perennial herb reaching 60 cm in size [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], distributed in the Mediterranean, Europe, Asia, and southern Africa [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The flowers of 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. have been used as herbal tea to treat hypoglycemia [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but also in several diseases, such as acne, bronchitis, cold, and cough, thanks to its analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities. Aerial parts have been used as a veterinary diuretic (Iberia) and for menstrual regulation (Northern Peru) [

 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L.; and only the roots and flowers of the plant have been subjected to silica gel column chromatography after extraction with methanol [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The pre-cited study described the iridoid glycosides as the main isolated compounds from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. In this study, for the first time the inspection of photochemical profiles on volatiles compounds, phenols, and carotenoids from Tunisian 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stems, using the GC-FID/MS, LC-PDA-ESI/MS, and LC-PDA-APCI/MS analyses, respectively, were investigated. Before these techniques could be applied, dry content was dissolved in distilled water to extract the essential oil, then fractioned with hexane and chloroform through a hydrodistillation process. Equally, the powder was dissolved successively in four solvents (dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol), to obtain four different extracts by hot extraction.
