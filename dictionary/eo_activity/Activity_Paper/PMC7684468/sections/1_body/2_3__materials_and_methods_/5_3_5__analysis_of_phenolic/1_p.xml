<p>The phenolic analysis of the dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem (identification and quantification) followed the methodology described by Hrichi et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and Haoujar et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The phenolic compounds were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography system coupled to photodiode array and mass spectrometry detection (LC-PDA- ESI/MS).
