<p>All three doses of the concoction showed significant anti-inflammatory activity which was comparable to the positive control indomethacin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). There was a significant decrease in paw volumes in all three groups, compared to water control at 3
 <sup>rd</sup>, 4
 <sup>th</sup>, and 5
 <sup>th</sup> hours (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The doses, 1/2HED and HED, overlapped at the first and the third hour and the ½HED showed the highest percentage inhibition in paw volumes at the fourth (83.5%) and the fifth (80.1%) hours followed by HED (72%). The percent inhibition of the double dose (2 × HED) increased gradually and reached its maximum at the 5
 <sup>th</sup> hour (55.6%); however, its overall anti-inflammatory effect was low compared to the other two doses (1/2HED and HED). This resulted in an inverse dose-dependent activity at 4
 <sup>th</sup> (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.99; 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.03) and 5
 <sup>th</sup> (
 <italic>r</italic> = −1.00; 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.001) hours. Since HED showed a significant level of anti-inflammatory activity in the first and second phases of inflammation, it was selected as the optimum dose for further assays. The concoction reported hereafter in the results section is the HED of the concoction.
