<p>In the carrageenan-induced paw-edema assay, the two doses (HED and 1/2HED) of the concoction showed significant anti-inflammatory effect during both early and late phases and there was marked inhibition during the late phase. The difference in the phases of the assay may occur due to different chemical and cellular components which come into action in the early, intermediate, and late phases of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The inhibition in the first phase of inflammation is attributed to activities against serotonin and histamine, whereas inhibition during second phase is mainly due to activities against prostaglandins and suppression of mononuclear leukocyte migration [

 <sup>nd</sup> hour (intermediate phase) shown by the HED of the concoction indicates that it may have inhibited the kinins which are known to play a role in between the first and second phases [

The inverse dose response observed in the present study with the 2 × HED exhibiting a lower anti-inflammatory activity is consistent with the results of a previous study where the potency of a high dose of an alcoholic preparation of coriander (500 mg/ml) was less compared to a low dose (200 mg/ml) [

 <italic>C. sativum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Ammar et al. have attributed the inhibitory effects of coriander fruits (one of the components in the concoction) to inhibition of all mediators released before the second phase as well as prostaglandin, the mediator in the second phase. Phytochemical studies on bioactive extracts of coriander have revealed the presence of unsaturated fatty acids, flavanoids, that is, quarcertin which may together produce an anti-inflammatory effect [
