<p>One of the most immediate responses of monocytes to a variety of pathogenic stimuli is the production of the potent oxygen free radical, superoxide anion. The enzyme complex primarily responsible for the production of this highly reactive oxygen species is the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. Superoxide anion is the first ROS produced and it can combine with nitric oxide to produce peroxinitrite which is highly deleterious to tissues [

Quantitative assessment of superoxide anion production by NBT assay showed the capability of concoction to inhibit superoxide anion production in rat peritoneal cells. Thus, the ability of the concoction to inhibit production of both NO and superoxide anion would contribute to preventing the formation of peroxinitrite. Our previous studies using the quantitative NBT assay have shown similar ROS inhibitory activity with methanolic leaf extracts of
