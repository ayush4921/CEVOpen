<p>Recent studies have shown that seed oil of 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> contains 53 compounds of which the major compounds are linalool, geranyl acetate, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, m-cymene, citronellal, citronellol, citral, geraniol, citronellyl acetate, 
 <italic>α</italic>-cedrene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-farnesene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-sesquiphellandrene [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The major alkaloids in 
 <italic>Coscinium fenestratum</italic> are yellow crystalline berberine, protoberberine, and jatrorrhizine. Many other alkaloids, mainly of the protoberberine type, isolated from stem are magnoflorine, berberrubine, thalifendine, palmitine, and oxyberberine [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The stem also contains ceryl-alcohol, saponin, hentriacontane, sitosterol, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and sitosterol glucoside [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Other compounds reported from the stem are 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethyllindacarpine, oxypalmitine, (-)-8-oxotetrahydrothalifendine, (-)-8-oxoisocorypalmine and either (-)-8-oxothaicanine or (-)-8-oxo-3-hydroxy-2,4,9,10-tetramethoxyberberine and (-)-8-oxocanadine [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], 12,13-dihydro-8-oxoberberine, 5,6,13,13 a-tetrahydro-9,10, dimethoxydibenzo (a,g) 1,3-benzodioxolo (5,6a) quinalizine-8-one, stigmasterol [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], berlambine, dihydroberlambine, and noroxyhydrastinine [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Despite these phytochemical analyses, to date there is no reported study on attributing the anti-inflammatory activity to specific isolated components. Studies on identification of active components of the concoction are in progress. The consistency of the components in the concoction has been confirmed with the identical pattern obtained from thin layer chromatography (TLC) fingerprints (data not shown).
