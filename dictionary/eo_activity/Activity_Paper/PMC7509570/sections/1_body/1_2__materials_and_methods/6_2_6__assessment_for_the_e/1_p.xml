<p>Total RNA was extracted from rat peritoneal phagocytic cells using the TRIzol reagent (1 ml of TRIzol to 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, USA). Extracted RNA was quantified and then cDNA was synthesized using RNA (2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g), dNTPs mixture (2 mM), random primers (500 ng), RNAsin (25 units), M-MLV reverse transcriptase enzyme (200 units), and the RT buffer (1X) and PCR was carried out for selected genes iNOS, eNOS, nNOS, and GAPDH independently using the same cDNA. Primers for rat iNOS were selected according to Linenluke et al. and thermal cycle parameters were initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 62°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, and the final extension of 72°C for 10 min [
