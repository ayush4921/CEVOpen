<p>Acute lung injury (ALI) associated with sepsis is a common clinical problem with a high morbidity rate [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The pathogenesis of ALI involves disruption of epithelial integrity with massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung tissue, leading to pulmonary edema and severe inflammation [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Infiltered inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, release inflammatory mediators such as interleukins (ILs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and nitric oxide (NO) [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor that regulates and controls inflammatory response during ALI. NF-κB is present in the cytosol in inactive state due to linkage to its inhibitory protein (IκB). Upon stimulation, IκB rapidly degrades to liberate NF-κB, which then migrates into the nucleus where it potentiates gene expression of inflammatory mediators, hence inducing inflammatory responses [
