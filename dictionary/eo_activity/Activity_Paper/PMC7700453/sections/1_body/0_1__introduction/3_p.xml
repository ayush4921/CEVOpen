<p>Many people rely on traditional medicine for their primary healthcare, and it is increasingly becoming popular throughout the world. Medicinal plants have also attracted much attention by researchers that are looking for new leads for developing drugs to treat various ailments [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Euphorbiaceae is a large plant family comprising about 320 genera with 7950 species, which are distributed mainly in temperate and tropical regions. Some species of this family are of medicinal and economic importance [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> is one of the largest genera of this family, containing approximately 2160 plant species, which are characterized by milky irritant latex [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Several plants of this genus are used to treat diarrhea, dysentery, gonorrhea, gastric disorders, edema, warts, whooping cough, asthma, and migraine [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Some of these plants have also been shown to have spasmolytic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antileukemic, wound healing, hemostatic, and anti-hemorrhoid activities [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This genus is known to possess several phytochemicals, e.g., tannins, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, and flavonoids. 
 <italic>Euphorbia cuneata</italic> Vahl. (EC), one of the plant species in this genus, has various traditional uses in Saudi Arabia and Yemen [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The stem juice when mixed with water or milk is used to treat obesity, food poisoning, and constipation [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, in parts of northern Yemen, the stem juice is used on wound and injuries to reduce external bleeding. It is also used to treat postpartum hemorrhage, and also reported to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. cuneata</italic> was recently characterized as containing several phytochemicals, including triterpenes and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The hemostatic activity of the plant juice is attributed to its flavonoid constituents [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Unlike several members of the Euphorbiaceae family, 
 <italic>E. cuneata</italic> does not contain the usual toxic diterpenes [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the basis of the traditional anti-inflammatory activity of EC, this study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of EC against LPS-induced ALI in mice and the possible underlying mechanisms.
