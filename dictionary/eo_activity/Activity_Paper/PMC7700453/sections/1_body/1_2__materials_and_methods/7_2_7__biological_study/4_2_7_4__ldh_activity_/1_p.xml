<p>The LDH activity was determined in BALF samples on the basis of the protocol of the manufacturer kit. In brief, the reaction mixture consisted of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) (0.8 mmol/L), and sodium pyruvate (1.5 mmol/L) and Tris buffer (50 mmol/L, pH 7.4) was added to the sample. The changes in absorbance were recorded at 340 nm and enzyme activity was calculated and expressed in U/L.</p>
