<p>The air-dried powdered aerial parts of EC (1 g) were extracted with methanol (10 mL) as described above. The extract was then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged to remove plant debris. Supernatant was evaporated, and 20 mg of the dry residue (100 mg) was placed on a C18 cartridge preconditioned with methanol and water. The sample was eluted using 3 mL MeOH (100%) and the eluate evaporated. The dry residue was re-suspended in 500 Î¼L methanol, and 3 microliters of the supernatant were used for HPLC analysis.</p>
