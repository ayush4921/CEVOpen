<p>LPS injection to mice resulted in elevation of lung W/D ratio and total protein content of BALF compared to normal mice, indicating development of pulmonary edema (

On the contrary, EC pretreatment as well as dexamethasone significantly attenuated W/D ratio, total protein, and LDH activity in comparison with the untreated LPS group. Interestingly, the effect of EC at a high dose was nearly equivalent to the effect of dexamethasone, as there was no significant difference between EC 50 + LPS group compared to the dexamethasone-treated group (
