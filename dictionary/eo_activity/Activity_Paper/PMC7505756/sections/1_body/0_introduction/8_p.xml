<p id="p0040">Integration of traditional medicinal plants into global value chain could negatively impact plant genetic resource base and ecological sustainability at large. Since environmental vulnerability is shaped by the ability to access resources across time, space and across actors, there is need for innovative approaches in the commercialisation of medicinal plants. Peterson and David [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], define an endemic species in terms of the spatial spread and the degree to which the reference plant or animal taxa survival and growth is restricted in a given landscape such as a country, mountain range, riverine ecology, latitude, soil type or reserves within a region or a country. In this article we define endemic medicinal plants as plant taxa whose survival, expression of target metabolites (active ingredients) for production of plant derived pharmaceutical products and domestication is highly restricted to specific landscapes, such as high altitude montane areas of a country or a region. The slow growth, an underlying risk in ecological degradation is characteristic of such plant taxa.
