<p id="p0045">Our main contribution through this article is in resolving existing policy practice gaps on commercialisation of medicinal flora and paucity on pragmatic policies that guide the exploitation of threatened endemic plant species [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We thus examine the concept of property rights and collective action and the closely related triumvirate of knowledge, power and subjectivity to unpack human-environment interactions and their potential impacts in medicinal value chains. We further attempt at closing existing gaps on the role of institutional and environmental economic, and its utility in the exploitation and integration of medicinal plants into the global value chain. We ultimately suggest a conceptual framework with endless possibilities for forecasting and resolving social-policy constraints and conflicts at several interfaces in the bioprospection and commercialisation of medicinal flora. The conceptual framework from the article, can be used as a tool for reflective planning and Sustainability Impact Assessments in the integration of medicinal flora into global medicinal plants value chains.
