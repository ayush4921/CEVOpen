<p id="p0195">Biotechnology and domestication of medicinal plants species are some of the strategies that can be adopted to reverse resource overexploitation in medicinal plant value chains. The use of molecular marker assisted selection, tissue culture and genetic transformation which alter pathways for biosynthesis of target metabolites thus hold great potential in overcoming constraints such as the slow growth rates characteristic of medicinal plant wildings [

However, difficulties in the identification of the right cultivar, uncertainty on level of active ingredients in the domesticated cultivars, pest and disease challenges and low environmental tolerance or survival under cultivation stand out as agrotechnology challenges that constraint the domestication pathways [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Domestication of most medicinal plants is further constrained by limited knowledge on management, as well as inadequate basic research effort on the distribution, genetic diversity and ecology of the species [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This could be the plausible reason for preference of wildings in the medicinal value chain.
