<p id="p0205">The major sources of risks to commercialisation of medicinal plants through cultivation (domestication) include biopiracy, illegal collection, long gestation period to maturity, unresponsive permit/licencing systems, dispersed producers and lack of linkages among chain actors [

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As some of the medicinal plants are sources of multiple active ingredients in the production of plant based pharmaceutical products, there is high market risks for investors who wish to commit funding to a single plant development, a constraint that is exacerbated by high preferences for naturally sourced products among consumers which disadvantages processed alternatives in the value chain [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This increases preference for wildings as a conventional risk management strategy.
