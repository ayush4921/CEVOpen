 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EOs, mainly constituted by carvacrol and 5‑methylene-2,3,4,4-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone and 1,8-cineole, respectively, were the most effective to inhibit TNF‑α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, whereas only 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EO had the ability to inhibit CCL2 release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells.
