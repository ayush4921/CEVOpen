<p>Despite carvacrol being the main compound of 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), this phenol-like oxygen-containing monoterpene may not be the only compound accountable for 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> EO activity. Indeed, other carvacrol-rich EOs, such as those of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> and 
 <italic>Th. zygis</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), were not able to reduce TNF‑α release. The presence of antagonists in these EOs can also not be ignored. Moreover, it is relevant to highlight the important role of the minor compounds and/or some of the compounds’ enantiomeric ratio in the overall activity of EOs. Often overlooked, these factors can contribute to synergistic or antagonistic actions determining differences in the EOs’ activities [
