<p>The potential anti-inflammatory activity of essential oils (EOs) was investigated by measuring TNF‑α release by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells by employing an immunoassay. The toxicity of the EOs on THP-1 cells was accessed to determine the adequate EO working concentrations. When the cell viability of THP-1 cells was higher than 90%, samples were considered non-cytotoxic and adequate for further analysis. According to the availability of EO, at least three concentrations were checked for each essential oil (
