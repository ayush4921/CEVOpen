<p>The EOs of 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic>, 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic>, 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> significantly reduced TNF-α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, in comparison to the control cells. From these four EOs, those of 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> and 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> were the most effective. 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> EO showed an inhibition percentage of TNF-α release of 51 ± 7% at 20 μg/mL, whereas that of 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EO was 23 ± 1% at 30 μg/mL and 83 ± 8% at 90 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). These inhibition percentages were higher than those of 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> EO (49 ± 2% at 90 μg/mL), or 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> EO (22 ± 2% at 90 μg/mL) (
