<p id="par0025">Since the time immemorial the medicinal value of pteridophytes is known to man. The rhizome of 
 <italic>Tectaria cicutaria</italic> has been used in Ayurveda for the treatment of various disorders [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The decoction of 
 <italic>Tectaria cicutaria</italic> is employed for the treatment of various types of gynecological disorders as well as inflammatory conditions. Many researchers have confirmed the pharmacological activities of pteridophytes [

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Preeti and Namdeo [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] subjected 
 <italic>Tectaria cicutaria</italic> rhizomes, to phytochemical analysis, anti-microbial activity and 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> anticancer activity and confirmed the presence of bioactive metabolites in the extracts. They observed the antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Tectaria cicutaria</italic> rhizomes showed excellent anticancer activity against Human Leukemia Cell Line (K562) with GI
 <sub>50</sub> value 11.9 μg/mL. Castrejón-Arroyo et al., [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity and antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of 
 <italic>T. heracleifolia</italic> raw extracts. The 
 <italic>T. heracleifolia</italic> raw extracts showed the anti-inflammatory activity with 52 % and 0.084 mg/ml was required to obtain a 50 % antioxidant effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). Pawar et al., [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] revealed the phytochemical profiles of 
 <italic>Tectaria coadunata</italic>. Preeti and Namdeo [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] studied the anticancer action of 
 <italic>Tectaria cicutaria</italic> in human cancer cell lines. Johnson et al., [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have observed the inter-specific variation among the three 
 <italic>Tectaria</italic> species using isoperoxidase analysis. But there is no report on the phytochemical composition and biological activities of 
 <italic>Tectaria paradoxa</italic> (Fee.) Sledge. With this knowledge the present study was aimed to reveal the phytochemical composition and bio potentials of 
 <italic>Tectaria paradoxa</italic> (Fee.) Sledge.
