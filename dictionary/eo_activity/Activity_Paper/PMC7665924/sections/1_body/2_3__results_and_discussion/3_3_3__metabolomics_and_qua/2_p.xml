<p>On the other hand, the PCA score plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>) was also sharply divided into two regions represented natural samples and other commercial samples, whereas the CMS samples were also separated into four clusters on the PCA plot, which were similar on the HCA dendrogram. As can be seen from the scree plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the first two principal components (PCs) accounted for more than 90% of the total variation of samples. Thus, we suppose that these PCs carried major information of variables. Considerably, CMS_06 was determined as a specific sample on the PCA plot. These results indicated a clear difference in the contents of standard compounds between natural and commercial products of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora.</italic> Furthermore, CMS samples could be categorized into four CMS groups: group 1: CMS_06; group 2: CMS_08 to CMS_10; group 3: CMS_11 to CMS_12; group 4: rest of CMS samples, based on the results of PCA and HCA. Marker compounds for the clustering could be identified on the basis of the PCA loading plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). As can be seen, emodin 
 <bold>(4)</bold>, THSG 
 <bold>(1)</bold>, and 6-hydroxymusizin 8-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-apiofuranosyl-(1⟶6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>(5)</bold> could be clearly detected as marker compounds to distinguish 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> samples.
