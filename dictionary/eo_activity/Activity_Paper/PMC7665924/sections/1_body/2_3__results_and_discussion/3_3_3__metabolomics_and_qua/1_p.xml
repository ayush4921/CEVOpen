<p>Metabolomics was utilized to identify the similarity and dissimilarity among a large number of samples. In this study, peak areas of seven compounds in 18 samples were collected from the chromatograms at the selected wavelengths and transferred to the tablet form to conduct hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) for the discrimination of natural and commercial sliced 
 <italic>F. multiï¬‚ora.</italic> HCA was performed based on differences in contents of seven compounds which were represented by peak area values. The Euclidean distances among 18 samples were calculated on R package software that was illustrated on the HCA dendrogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As can be seen, the group of six natural samples showed a dramatic difference to the commercial sliced samples on the HCA dendrogram. Meanwhile, the commercial medicinal sliced samples clearly clustered among the samples CMS_06, CMS_08 to CMS_10, CMS_11 to CMS_12, and the rest of the CMS samples.
