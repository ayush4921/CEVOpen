<p>The calibration curve of each compound was established from at least six appropriate concentrations in triplicate by plotting the peak areas versus the concentrations. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, all calibration curves showed optimized linearities with the average determination coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) higher than 0.999. LOD values were determined between 0.4 to 6.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml illustrating a high sensitivity of the analytical method that was sufficient to determine the contents of 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> samples.
