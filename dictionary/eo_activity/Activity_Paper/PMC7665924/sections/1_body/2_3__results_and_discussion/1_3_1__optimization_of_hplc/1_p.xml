<p>An optimized strategy of the HPLC-DAD system was carried out to obtain the separated peaks of the compounds on the chromatogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All analytes were analyzed on the Agilent Series 1260 system using a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C18 column (150 mm x 4,6 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C18 guard column (12.5 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) kept at 30°C. A mixture of 0.1% v/v of acetic acid in water and methanol with a linear gradient exhibited a better separation and peak shapes of all analytes. The flow rate was set at 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient from 30 to 100% methanol over 40 min, followed by 5 min washing with 100% methanol and 5 min of the initial condition. The injection volume for each sample was 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l. The UV detector was simultaneously set at 320 nm (for determination of compounds 
 <bold>(1)</bold>, 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, and 
 <bold>(7)</bold>) and 280 nm (to identify compounds 
 <bold>(2)</bold>, 
 <bold>(3)</bold>, 
 <bold>(4)</bold>, and 
 <bold>(6)</bold>). The retention time (Rt) of each compound is shown in
