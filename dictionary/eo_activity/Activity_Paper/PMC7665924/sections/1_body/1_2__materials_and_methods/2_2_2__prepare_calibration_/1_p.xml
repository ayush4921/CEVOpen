<p>Seven standard compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were isolated from 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> as described in the previous paper [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Purities of these compounds were assessed at more than 95% by HPLC analyses (data not shown). Calibration solutions for each standard compound were prepared at the concentration range of 5–1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Quality control samples for the compounds were prepared at 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml.
