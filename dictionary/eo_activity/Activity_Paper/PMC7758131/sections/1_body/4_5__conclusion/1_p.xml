<p>Oral supplementation of THCs is shown to be an effective way of reducing inflammation and pain associated with gingivitis. The various gingival scores uniformly registered a reduction progressively over the course of the study period. A statistically significant gingival reduction was observed at the end of the study. In the assessment of efficacy of THC in patients with canker sore lesions, complete disappearance of the lesions was observed at the end of the 21-day study period. The clinical treatment was safe with no significant changes in the vital signs as well as clinical and hematological parameters in the subjects involved in the study. Thus, the oral treatment with THCs is an effective and safe way to reduce pain and suffering in subjects from gingivitis and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.</p>
