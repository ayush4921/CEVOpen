 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most importantly, safety assessments confirmed that THCs are safe and no adverse side effects were experienced by the patients during the study period. The overall findings from this study demonstrated that oral administration of THCs is safe and efficacious in patients suffering from canker sore and gingivitis.
