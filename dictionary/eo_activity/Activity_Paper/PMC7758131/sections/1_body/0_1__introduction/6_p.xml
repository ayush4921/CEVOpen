 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] evaluated the efficacy and safety of THCs over 12 weeks in the treatment of oral leukoplakia showing that THCs (2%) when topically applied in a gel form was remarkably effective in alleviating clinical symptoms, suggesting that THCs could safely provide symptomatic relief for patients with oral leukoplakia. A recent 90-day subchronic and reproductive/developmental toxicity study demonstrated that repeated administration of 400â€‰mg/kg THCs in rats was safe and was considered as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) [
