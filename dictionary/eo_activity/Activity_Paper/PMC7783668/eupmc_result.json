    "Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of <i>Euphorbia balsamifera</i>, fractions and pure compounds were evaluated. The cytotoxic assays for HCT116, HePG2 and MCF7 showed a significant IC<sub>50</sub>: 54.7 and 76.2 µg/mL of non-polar fraction \"<i>n</i>-hexane\" against HCT116 and HePG2, respectively. Antibacterial results revealed that plant fractions exhibited significant potential against the tested pathogens than the total extract where <i>n</i>-butanol and ethyl acetate fractions showed significant antibacterial activity (<i>P</i> < 0.05) against tested bacterial strains. Isolation and structure determination of compounds from <i>n</i>-hexane and <i>n</i>-butanol fractions were performed. From <i>n</i>-hexane fraction, 29-nor-cycloartanol (<b>1),</b> lanost-8-en-3-ol <b>(2a</b>)<b>,</b> cycloartanol <b>(2b)</b> and kampferol-3,4'-dimethyl ether (<b>3</b>) were isolated and structurally identified, along with 24 compounds were tentatively identified by GC-MS. From the polar <i>n</i>-butanol fraction, 4-<i>O</i>-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone (<b>4),</b> 4-<i>O</i>-α-L-rhamnosyl-(1 → 6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6methoxy-acetophenone (<b>5)</b>, quercetin-3-<i>O</i>-glucopyranoside (<b>6)</b> and isoorientin (<b>7)</b> were assigned. Structures of the obtained compounds were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Except compounds <b>1</b> and <b>5,</b> all reported compounds announced antibacterial efficiency. Compound <b>2</b> showed selectively the highest activity against <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> (22 ± 0.13 mm), meanwhile 4-<i>O</i>-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone (<b>4)</b> showed broadly the highest antibacterial activity with MIC of 1.15-1.88 mg/mL against the test Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cytotoxic assays indicated that kampferol-3,4'-dimethyl ether (<b>3)</b> exhibited the highest activity with matching IC<sub>50</sub> values to doxorubicin; 111.46, 42.67 and 44.90 µM against HCT116, HePG2 and MCF7, respectively, however, it is toxic on retina normal cell line RPE1."
