<p id="p0095">Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were evaluated using standard inoculums of 1.0–1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>CFU/ ml from each strains (
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Rex et al., 2001</xref>). Serial dilutions of each plant extract, previously dissolved in DMSO, were prepared to final concentrations of 0.0 up to 40.0 mg/ml of TSB. To each tube, 0.1 mL of each strain was inoculated and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. At the end of incubation time, MIC and MBC were visually identified as the lowest concentration of the test compound which inhibits the visible growth and confirmed by measuring the OD
 <sub>600</sub> and plating onto MHA of all treatments. Tests using sterilized distilled water as negative control and Chloramphenicol as positive control were carried out in parallel. All tests were performed in triplicate.
