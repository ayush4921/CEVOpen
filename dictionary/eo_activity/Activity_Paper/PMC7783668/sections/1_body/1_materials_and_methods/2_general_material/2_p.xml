GC–MS analysis was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument stands with the following specifications, Instrument: a TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific Corp., USA), coupled with a thermo mass spectrometer detector (ISQ Single Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer). Direct electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESIMS) were measured with Advion compact mass spectrometer (CMS) NY-USA, acquisition speed of 10.000

Analyses were carried out using helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a split ratio of 1:10 using the following temperature program: 60 °C for 1 min; rising at 4.0 °C/min to 240 °C and held for 1 min. The injector and detector were held at 210 °C. Diluted samples (1:10 hexane, v/v) of 1 μL of the mixtures were always injected. Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of
