 <bold>.</bold> All compounds showed antibacterial efficiency against all the tested bacteria except compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>. These compounds inhibited the growth of bacteria and showed inhibiting zone ranged from 9 ± 0.02 to 22 ± 0.13 mm. The largest of inhibition zone by compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was observed for EF (22 ± 0.13 mm). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MBC of five compounds are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The MIC or Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was ranged between 1.15 and 2.48 mg/mL and 2.05 to 3.00 mg/mL, respectively against the six bacteria indicating that the antibacterial action of the substances begins the highest concentration of compound 
 <bold>7</bold> against BC while the lowest concentration of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> against SA. Thus, the compound 
 <bold>4</bold> showed lowest MIC and MBC (1.15 and 2.05 mg/mL), respectively indicating its higher antibacterial activity than all tested compounds. While compound 
 <bold>7</bold> recorded the highest MIC and MBC (2.48 and 3.00 mg/mL) while no significant antimicrobial activity for compound 
 <bold>7</bold> is reported (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Kumarasamy et al., 2004</xref>). The antimicrobial activity of compound 
 <bold>6</bold> showed agreement with its previously published data (
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Mohammed et al., 2015</xref>).
