<p id="p0195">The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Euphorbia balsamifera</italic>, fractions and pure compounds were evaluated against eight pathogenic bacterial strains (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to this study, the ethanolic extract showed high activity against the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (25 mm) in comparison with chloramphenicol (26 ± 0.21 mm). Particularly, the ethanol extract was only effective against five strains: KP, PA, EC, BC, and SE at concentration of of 30 μg/mL. The obtained fractions, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fractions displayed higher antibacterial activity at low concentration 10 ~ 20 μg/mL (28 ± 0.15, 29 ± 0.19 mm at 10 μg/mL against SA) than those shown for 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction (11 ± 0.12 mm). This might be mostly attributed to their abundance with flavonoid and glycosidic compounds rather than those shown in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction.
