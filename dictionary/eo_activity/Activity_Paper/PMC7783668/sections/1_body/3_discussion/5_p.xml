<p id="p0190">29-Norcycloartanol (
 <bold>1</bold>) was reported before from other species, however, without full assignment (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>), and it is reported herein to first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic>, and its full assignment on the bases of 1D and 2D NMR data is recoded to first time as well. So far as we know as well, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was isolated herein to first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic>. Compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was isolated previously from the roots of 
 <italic>Prunus armeniaca</italic> and 
 <italic>Euphorbia fischeriana</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017</xref>,

 <italic>Erythroxylum cambodianum</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kanchanapoom et al., 2005</xref>), however, and as far as we know, it has never been reported from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic>. Likely, compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> (
