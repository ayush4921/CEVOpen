<p>Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis (version B.06.00 SP1) software (Santa clara, CA, USA) was used for processing MS and AutoMSMS data acquired using LC/GC/Q-TOF. The accurate mass MS data were processed using the tool “Find by Molecular Feature” to export the compounds to Agilent Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) software (Santa clara, CA, USA). In order to remove the molecular features arising from the background, the data obtained from each fraction were background-subtracted using the blank data again in MPP. The ID browser software was used to identify putative compounds by searching against the METLIN database (MassHunter PCDL Manager version B.04.00), which has 64,092 compounds. The GC/Q-TOF data were processed using MassHunter Unknown Analysis software (version B.06.00(Santa clara, CA, USA)). This software uses mass spectral deconvolution, which automatically finds peaks and deconvolutes spectra from co-eluting compounds using model ion traces. The spectral information was matched with the Agilent Fiehn library with retention time index with respect to FAME mix (Agilent Fiehn GC/MS Metabolomics Standards Kit, Part Number 400505). The data were also searched against NIST 11 and Wiley 9 mass spectral libraries. The compounds with library match scores &gt;70% were considered and were searched in the literature for their therapeutic importance.</p>
