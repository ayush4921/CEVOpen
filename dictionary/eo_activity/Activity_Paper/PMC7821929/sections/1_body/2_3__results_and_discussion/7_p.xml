<p>The LC/Q-TOF and GC/Q-TOF analysis resulted in identification of 449 and 62 compounds, respectively. The enhanced number of compounds observed for LC/Q-TOF was primarily due to the use of orthogonal separations. It is well established that LC/MS and GC/MS are complementary techniques for comprehensive metabolomics in order to identify non-volatile and volatile compounds (
