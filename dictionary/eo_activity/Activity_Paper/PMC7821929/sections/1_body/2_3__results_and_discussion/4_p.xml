<p>The compounds obtained from MS/MS analyses in positive and negative ionization modes are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00001-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Clear differentiation of compounds for both ionization modes was observed for all the column chemistries used in the study. Many sugars and acidic amino acids were detected by negative mode ionization compared to positive mode ionization. Less than nine compounds were common for positive and negative ionization modes among all the column types. This clearly reveals that use of single ionization mode could significantly reduce the coverage of metabolites.
