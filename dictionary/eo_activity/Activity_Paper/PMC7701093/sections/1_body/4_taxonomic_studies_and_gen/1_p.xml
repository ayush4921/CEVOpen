<p>For a more efficient search for better plant producers of specific secondary metabolites and their combinations, it makes sense to use the concept of plant chemotaxonomy â€“ a branch of the science of taxonomy, were plants are classified depending on the similarities and differences in the spectrum of their secondary metabolites. Since some chemicals can be found in nature only in organisms of certain genera, families, or orders, this can be used both for their classification and to search for certain metabolites in the related species (
