<p>Inside the host cell, two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, are directly translated from the viral RNA and then cleaved by two viral proteases, main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>, also called 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, or 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>). PL
 <sup>pro</sup> cleaves junctions of NSP 1, 2, and 3 while M
 <sup>pro</sup> cleaves polyprotein at 11 distinct sites downstream from the NSP4 to generate various NSPs that are important for viral replication (

 <sup>pro</sup> is one of the best-characterized drug targets among the coronaviruses (

 <sup>pro</sup> are unlikely to be toxic (

 <sup>pro</sup>, is also attractive antiviral drug target, because it affects not only coronaviral replication, but also has the additional function of deubiquitination of host cell proteins and ISG15 removal, finally leading to the immune suppression of host cells (
