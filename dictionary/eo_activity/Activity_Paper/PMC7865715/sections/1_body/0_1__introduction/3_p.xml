<p>In this review, we will look at rare and unusual polycyclic endoperoxides isolated from different terrestrial and marine sources. The biological activity of many polycyclic endoperoxides has not been determined, and we present the pharmacological activities detected experimentally and predicted based on the structure-activity relationships using the PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) software [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. PASS estimates the probabilities of several thousand biological activities with an average accuracy of about 96%. Probability of belonging to the class of “actives” Pa is calculated for each activity, providing the assessment of the hidden pharmacological potential of the investigated natural polycyclic endoperoxides [
