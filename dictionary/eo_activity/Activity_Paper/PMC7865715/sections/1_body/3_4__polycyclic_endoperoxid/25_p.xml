<p>Several adamantane type polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (
 <bold>155</bold>–
 <bold>164</bold>) possessing an unprecedented 
 <italic>seco</italic>-adamantane architecture combined with a peroxide ring have been isolated and identified from extracts of some plants [
 <xref rid="B240-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. Thus, one compound called hypersubone B (
 <bold>155</bold>) was isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Hypericum subsessile</italic> and exhibited significant cytotoxicity against four human cancer lines in vitro, HepG2, Eca109, HeLa, and A549 [
 <xref rid="B241-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>], and hyperisampsins N (
 <bold>157</bold>) and O (
 <bold>158</bold>), which exhibited significant cytotoxic activities toward HL-60 cells, were found in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>H. sampsonii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B242-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Structures (
 <bold>155</bold>–
 <bold>164</bold>) can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00686-f010">Figure 10</xref>, and their biological activity is presented in
