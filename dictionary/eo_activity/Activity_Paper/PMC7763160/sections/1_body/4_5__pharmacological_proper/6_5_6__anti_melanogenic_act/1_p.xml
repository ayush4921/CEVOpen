<p>The study suggested the antioxidant and whitening effects of LO on B16 melanoma F10 cells. 70% EtOH extracts of the leaf and branch of LO dose-dependently scavenged DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals. Moreover, leaf extracts demonstrated ERK pathway activation and downregulation of MITF and tyrosinase and, therefore, a decrease in melanogenesis in B16 melanoma F10 cells [

 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnopyranoside) and afzelin (kaempferol-3-O-α-
 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnoside) from the ethyl acetate fraction of LO and evaluated their antimelanogenic effect on melanoma cells. Both compounds showed significant antioxidant activities in a DPPH radical scavenging assay and FRAP assay as well as antimelanogenic activities through an inhibiting tyrosinase activity. In contrast, quercitrin modulated the ERK and MITF signalling pathway in B16F10 melanoma cells [
