<p>The human body is consistently fighting oxidative attacks from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) using a complex antioxidant defence system to maintain the pro-oxidantâ€“antioxidant balance [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Imbalance in the cellular antioxidant defence machinery can result from several factors, including ageing and environmental toxins [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, chronic imbalance in the cellular oxidative state may lead to several age- or un-related disorders such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, chronic obstructive pulmonary, and chronic kidney diseases as well as cancer [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Reactive oxygen participates in the high-energy electron transfer mechanism and the production of adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Imbalance in the production of RONS and antioxidant defence in the cell leads to oxidative stress and attack of many biological molecules such as proteins, lipids, or DNA [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several redox-sensitive transcriptional factors and enzymes such as nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf-2) and activate antioxidant response element (ARE) have been implicated in maintaining cellular oxidative homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Activation of ARE results in the up-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catalyzes the oxidative degradation of heme into bilirubin and free iron and NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1); this latter enzyme regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by reducing quinones to hydroquinones [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, Nrf-2/HO-1/NQO1 are involved in maintaining the balance of oxidative stress, thus protecting cells and tissues from oxidative damage [
