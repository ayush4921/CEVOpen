 <italic>Lindera obtusiloba</italic> Blume (LO), a member of the genus 
 <italic>Lindera</italic>, is widely distributed in northeast Asia. The use of LO as a traditional medicine for the treatment of improvement of blood circulation, inflammation fever, abdominal pain, etc., is well documented. Both extracts of the different parts of LO and its bioactive compounds have been reported to contain numerous antioxidative compounds, such as polyphenols, lignans, neolignans, flavonoids, and butenolides. The neuroprotective, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and antithrombotic properties of these bioactive compounds have been reported [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, LO presents a rich source of bioactive compounds, particularly antioxidants that have been investigated in many diseases associated with oxidative stress. Still, many new antioxidant compounds are being isolated from the extract of different parts of LO and need to be investigated for their antioxidant and pharmacological activity. Here, we briefly discuss the antioxidant properties of the genus 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> and focus on their traditional and ethnopharmacological use, bioactive compounds isolated from LO extracts and their antioxidant and pharmacological properties. Moreover, we mention many newly isolated or detected compounds from LO extracts that could prove beneficial to developing new therapeutic agents to treat oxidative stress-associated disorders such as cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, allergy, inflammation, and cancer.
