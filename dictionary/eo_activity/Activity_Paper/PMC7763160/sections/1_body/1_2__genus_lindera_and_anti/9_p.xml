<p>Several other species of the 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> genus, such as 
 <italic>L. reflexa, L. fruiticosa, L. angustifolia, L. oxyphila,</italic> and 
 <italic>L. umbrellata</italic> have been reported to possess antioxidant activity in separate studies [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,

 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, this genus represents a natural source of highly active antioxidant compounds that can scavenge free radicals and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Both extracts and bioactive compounds of this genus can modulate several oxidative pathways, including Nrf-2/HO-1, ERK, JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and ARE that are involved in oxidative stress-mediated cell death, cell proliferation, inflammation, etc.
