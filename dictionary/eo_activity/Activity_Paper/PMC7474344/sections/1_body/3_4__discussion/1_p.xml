<p>In this work, five medicinal plants were screened for their antiproliferative activities and possible anticancer activities. These plant extracts were selected based on the previous work, which indicated that they were used by traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs) in Borno State, Nigeria, for management of cancers [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. All five extracts produced significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) antiproliferative effects on one or both of the U87 and U251 cell lines used. In U87 cell line, the genetic defect affects PTEN while in U251 cell line, the genetic defects affect both PTEN and TP53. Highest activities against U87 were recorded in the decreasing order as follows 
 <italic>S. longependunculata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. inermis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. senegalensis, C. edulis</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic>. In contrast, the order of activity against U251 changed to 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. senegalensis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. inermis</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic>. Both PTEN and TP53 are tumor suppressor genes. The difference in the degree of antiproliferation on the two cell lines may suggest that the different extracts act through different mechanisms. 
 <italic>Carissa spinarum</italic> (
 <italic>C. edulis</italic>) has been reported to induce caspase 3/7 activity and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In brain tumor cell line U1242, 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> caused antiproliferation via epidermal growth factor (EGF) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.74 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is better than the results presented here on the U87 and U251 cell lines.
