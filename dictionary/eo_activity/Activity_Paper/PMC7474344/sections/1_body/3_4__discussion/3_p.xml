<p>When the extracts were tested on the induction of cleaved Poly-ADP-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP), only 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> extract had activity indicating there could be induction of apoptosis by this extract. This further supports the potential of 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> for its use in the treatment of cancer. This is in agreement with the work of Ngulde et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] where 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> induced cleavage of PARP in U87â€‰cell line. Also, Obasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that saponins from 
 <italic>Securidaca longepedunculata</italic> were found to induce apoptosis and inhibit migration and invasion in cervical cancer cells. Xanthones isolated from the plant inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cell line and acted as an inducer of apoptosis [
