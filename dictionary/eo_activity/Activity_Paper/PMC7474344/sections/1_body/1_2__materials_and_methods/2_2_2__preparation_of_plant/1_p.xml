<p>Plant samples collected were air-dried at room temperature (25°C). Each sample was weighed several times until a constant weight obtained. The samples were pulverized in a mortar and pestle. About 1 kg of the ground herb was soaked overnight in petroleum ether. The residue from defatted samples was further extracted in 95% ethanol for 24 h. Each sample was filtered using Whatman filter paper No. 1 and desiccated to dryness under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator.</p>
