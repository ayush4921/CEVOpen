<p>The scavenging activity of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs of the three samples from three regions in WB in Palestine was assessed using the methods described in [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Stock solutions at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in methanol and Trolox were prepared from 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs that were collected from three Palestinian regions. Each one of these stock solutions was diluted in methanol to prepare 12 of the working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. A freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.002% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was mixed with both methanol and with each of the abovementioned working solutions at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. In addition, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in a 1 : 1 ratio. All of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min. By the end of the incubation period, the optical density of these solutions was determined using spectrophotometric absorbances at a wavelength of 517 nm using methanol as the blank solution.
