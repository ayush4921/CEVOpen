 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown to mid logarithmic phase. They were diluted as described above in antimicrobial assay. The diluted bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU) was incubated with 1/2MIC, MIC and 2MIC concentration of oil/streptomycin or with 2FICI and 3FICI concentrations of their combination for different time period namely 10, 30, 60 and 120 min respectively. Post incubation, the cells were diluted by 10
 <sup>2</sup> times and 50 μL suspension was spread on nutrient agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the colonies appeared on them were counted [
