 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were treated with streptomycin/EO/combination at their 2xMICs for 2–3 h. Then, treated cells were centrifuged and washed with sterile PBS solution. They were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4 °C followed by washing and second fixation was done with 1% osmium tetraoxide for 6–7 h at 4 °C. Post fixations, dehydration of samples were done sequentially in ethanol of different concentrations (30, 50, 70, and 100%) for 30 min each. The drying of samples was achieved through hexamethyl disilazane/ethanol gradient series (50:50 and 100:0) for 30 min at each concentration. Finally, the samples were mounted on aluminium stubs and sputter-coated with gold, prior to inspection under microscope (JOEL JSM-6400, Japan).
