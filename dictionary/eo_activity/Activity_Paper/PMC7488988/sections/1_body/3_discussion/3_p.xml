<p id="Par40">Initially, the ratio of female to male practitioners who were notified of the study was 1:1,5. However, in the final participants group the ratio came to 1:3 (female to male practitioners). The explanation behind this observation could be that more female than male practitioners were reluctant to give out the information sort for and thus could not take part in the study. Nonetheless, the figures show that the TMPs who treat cancer in Zimbabwe are predominantly males. TMPs who volunteered in the study were from different religion backgrounds, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Most of the participants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] had a Christianity background, followed by traditional religion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This observation dovetails with the general religion distribution in the country where 84% of the population is reported to be Christians [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. As such, the participant sample reflects a mimicking of TMPs distribution across the religion divide in the country. It also shows that people could still practice traditional medicine regardless of their religion background.
