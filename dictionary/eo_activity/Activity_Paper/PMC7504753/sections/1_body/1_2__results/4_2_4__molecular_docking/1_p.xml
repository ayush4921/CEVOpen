<p>In this study, we are able to delineate the interaction between several isolated compounds of 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> with the M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6W63). The docking results demonstrated that all compounds obtained from 
 <italic>T. crispa</italic> interacted with the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme. Among these compounds, a total of seven possess higher docking scores in comparison with the others (
