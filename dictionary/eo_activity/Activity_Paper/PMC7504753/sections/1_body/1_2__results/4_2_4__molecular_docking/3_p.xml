<p>Additionally, spiro[4,5]dec-6-en-1-ol, 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl exhibits a docking score of −6.369 KJ/mol, but the interaction occurs with total four amino acids (Met165, His41, Met49, Met165) through pi-alkyl stacking, unlike imidazolidin-4-one, 2-imino-1-(4-methoxy-6-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl), which interacts through hydrogen bonding (

Moreover, 3.beta-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid also tends to interact with the receptor as it has obtained a docking score of −6.251 KJ/mol. In addition, 3.beta-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid possessed the affinity towards the receptor not only through hydrogen bonding but also pi-alkyl stacking (

In particular, our experiment also includes the calculation of binding affinity of two antiviral agents, nelfinavir and lopinavir and these aforementioned compounds exert a score of −7.596 and −8.251 Kcal/mol, respectively, withSARS-CoV-2 M
