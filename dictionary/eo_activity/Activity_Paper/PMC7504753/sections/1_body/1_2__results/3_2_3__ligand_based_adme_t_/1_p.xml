<p>Lipinski’s rule of five was followed to predict the drug-likeliness properties; the following five principles must be followed: (i) Molecular weight is not more than 500; (ii) Number of H-bond acceptors ≤ 10; (iii) Number of H-bond donors ≤ 5; (iv) Lipophilicity (Log 
 <italic>P</italic> value) &lt; 5; and (v) Molar refractivity between 40 to 130. Among the fifty-six compounds, twenty-three compounds fulfilled the rule of five, indicating that those compounds could be suitable for the new drug development process. The results of the ADME/T prediction of the compounds is exhibited in
