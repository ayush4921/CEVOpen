The extraction of phytochemicals has recently been established as a phenomenal subject matter in lead compound identification for active pharmaceutical moieties. More detailed information about various pharmacologically active medicinal plantsâ€™ crude extracts could be obtained using separation techniques, which involves the separation of active phytoconstituents [
