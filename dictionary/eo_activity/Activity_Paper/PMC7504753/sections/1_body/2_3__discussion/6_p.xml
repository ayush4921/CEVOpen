<p>Moreover, the selected compounds also followed Lipinskiâ€™s rule of five for drug-likeness properties. Furthermore, the ion channel inhibitor property of spiro[4,5]dec-6-en-1-ol, 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl were found more than standard compounds. Additionally, imidazolidin-4-one, 2-imino-1-(4-methoxy-6-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) possessed closer kinase inhibitor attributes in comparison with the standards. In addition, 3.beta-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid exerted greater nuclear receptor ligand than nelfinavir and lopinavir. Interestingly, both spiro[4,5]dec-6-en-1-ol, 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl, 3.beta-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid and 3.beta-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid presented greater enzyme inhibition than either antiviral drug, whereas imidazolidin-4-one, 2-imino-1-(4-methoxy-6-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) exhibited greater protease blocking activity.</p>
