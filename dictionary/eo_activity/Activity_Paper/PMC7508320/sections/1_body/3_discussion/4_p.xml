<p>It was observed from the previous studies in analgesic activity assay model the plant extract demonstrated analgesic effects. The examined fraction of MC remarkably and dose-dependently inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing in mice when compared to the standard. Acetic acid generally induces inflammatory pain via arousing capillary permeability (Amico-Roxas et al., 1984), and liberating substances that are responsible for the excitement of pain nerve endings (Raj, 1996). The peripheral analgesic effect is commonly mediated through NSAIDs by the inhibition of COX and/or LOX (and different inflammatory mediators) or inhibition of ache responses mediated by nociceptors peripherally (Koster et al., 1959). Therefore it is far feasible that crude methanolic extract can display analgesic potentiality through those mechanisms although the precise mechanism of motion is needed to be determined. </p>
