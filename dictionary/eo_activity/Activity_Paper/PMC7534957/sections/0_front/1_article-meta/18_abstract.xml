  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p> Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be a pandemic infection, important severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) non-structural proteins (nsp) have been analysed as promising targets in virtual screening approaches. Among these proteins, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), also named main protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been identified as fundamental targets due to its importance in the viral replication stages.</p>

  <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
  <p> To investigate, 
   <italic>in silico</italic>, two of the most abundant flavonoid glycosides from 
   <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic>; a medicinal plant found in many regions of the world, along with some of the putative derivatives of these flavonoid glycosides in the human organism as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp.

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p> Using a molecular docking approach, the interactions and the binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp were predicted for quercetin-3-
   <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (rutin), kaempferol-3-
   <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (nicotiflorin) and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives.

  <title>FINDINGS</title>
  <p> Docking analysis, based on the crystal structure of 3CLpro and RdRp, indicated rutin, nicotiflorin, and their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives as potential inhibitors for both proteins. Also, the importance of the hydrogen bond and Ï€-based interactions was evidenced for the presumed active sites.</p>

  <title>MAIN CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p> Overall, these results suggest that both flavonoid glycosides and their putative human metabolites can play a key role as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. Obviously, further researches, mainly 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, are necessary to certify the docking results reported here, as well as the adequate application of these substances. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the risks of 
   <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> as a phytomedicine for use against COVID-19.
