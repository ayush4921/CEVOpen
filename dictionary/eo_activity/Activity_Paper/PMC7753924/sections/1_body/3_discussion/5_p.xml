<p id="par0180">The MIC (41 μg/ ml) of bioactive compounds of our strain KD155 against 
 <italic>S. aureus, B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was found more or less similar to those reported in case of other species of genus 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> for example, Ahmed [
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] reported MIC of 
 <italic>P. stutzeri</italic> CMG1030 in the range of 50–125 μg/ mL against 
 <italic>B. cereus, S. aureus</italic> (MSSA and MRSA), S
 <italic>. epidermidis, E. faecalis and E. faecium</italic> etc. Comparable findings were also demonstrated by Wratten et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] who isolated 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. 102−3 displaying inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at a concentration range of 50 μg/disk-5 mg/disk. In another report by Levenfors et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] who isolated 
 <italic>P. protegens</italic> UP46 from soil samples reported the MIC value of 1−2 μg/ ml for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> while in same study 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed inhibition at a concentration of 32 μg/ ml. Therefore, it can be concluded that MIC values of present study showed variation than those of earlier reports which could be due to the differences between the tested bacterial strains or may be due to the different bioactive compounds.
