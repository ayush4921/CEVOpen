<p id="par0205">The GC-MS chromatogram of chloroform extract obtained from 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 showed presence of bioactive compounds such as Phenol, 2,4-bis(1,1dimethylethyl) [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. As a compound of natural origin, phenol, 2, 4-bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl) and its derivatives displayed wide range of activity in the field of medicine, food and agriculture [
 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Several workers have reported a wide range of bioactivities i.e., antibacterial [
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], antifungal [
 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], anticancer [

 <xref rid="bib0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] associated with phenol, 2, 4-bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl). The bioactive compound Phenol, 2, 4-bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl) reported in this study is also known to be originated from different microorganisms such as 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (79) and 
 <italic>Streptomycetes albidoflavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] displaying antifungal and antidermatophytic activities.
