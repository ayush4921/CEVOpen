<p id="par0155">The FTIR spectra, peak values and probable functional group of chloroform crude extract obtained from 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The identification of functional group present in the active components is identified based on the region of IR radiation displayed as peak values in FT-IR spectrum. When the extract was passed into the FT-IR, the functional groups of the components were separated based on its peaks ratio. The absorbance bands analysis in bioreduction process are observed in the region between 400–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The FTIR analysis of the crude extract revealed peak of different functional groups at 766 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> showing bending in C—H bond, 930 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=C Bending), peak at 1043 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> shows stretching in S=O bond, 1236 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-O Stretching), 1516 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-N Stretching), 1883 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-H Bending), 1992 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=N Stretching), 2140 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O Stretching), intramolecular forces between O-H group was evident from the peak 2424−2623 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (O-H Intramolecular forces), 2623 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (S-H Stretching), 2856−3280 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-H Stretching), 3677 cm
