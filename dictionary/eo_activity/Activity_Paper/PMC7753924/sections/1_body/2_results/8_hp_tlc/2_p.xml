<p id="par0150">The chloroform extract of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 was subjected to HPTLC analysis by specific solvent system ethyl acetate: acetone: AcOH: Water = 60:20:10:10. The bioactive compounds were clearly separated without any tailing and diffuseness. The analysis showed total four peaks with respective Rf values 0.01, 0.65, 0.87 and 0.98. The concentration of Quercetin (flavnoid) was found to be the highest through the densitometric analysis of the different peaks as shown in
