<p id="par0145">DPPH is a stable free radical having absorption maxima at 517 nm. A free radical scavenging property of strain KD155 was measured in terms of hydrogen donating or radical scavenging ability using the stable radical determination of 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH). The isolate KD155 inhibited 76.597 % DPPH. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 was also cultured on 5 % blood agar and showed no zone of clearance around the bacterial colonies depicting their non-hemolytic nature. Similarly, zone of clearance was also not observed in extracellular crude extract obtained from this isolate.
