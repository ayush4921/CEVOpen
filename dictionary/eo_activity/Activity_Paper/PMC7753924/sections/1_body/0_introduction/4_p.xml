<p id="par0040">In view of this, the present work describes isolation, characterization and identification of bioactive strain 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 from an easily available biological resource i.e., cow dung. The study was also extended to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of strain KD155. Furthermore, spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques such as HP-TLC, FT-IR and GC-MS were used for identification and characterization of different bioactive metabolites produced by the isolated strain KD155.
