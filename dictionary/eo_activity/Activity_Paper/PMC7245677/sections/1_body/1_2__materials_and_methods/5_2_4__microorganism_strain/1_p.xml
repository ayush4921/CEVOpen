<p>Microbial strains from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used in this study for preliminary antimicrobial assays, which included methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (SA), methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 33591 (SR), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC 29212 (EF), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 (EC), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 35657 (KP), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853 (PA), and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 (CA). Two clinical 
 <italic>non-albicans</italic> strains, 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> ND31 (CG) and 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> PNT20 (CT), which were provided by Anh et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and clinical isolates (15 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 15 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae),</italic> which were isolated from District 2 Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2016, were also applied for antimicrobial investigation on the potential extracts.
