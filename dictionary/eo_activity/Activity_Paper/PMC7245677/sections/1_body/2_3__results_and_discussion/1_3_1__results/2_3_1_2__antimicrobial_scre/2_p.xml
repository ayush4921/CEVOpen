<p>The ethanol crude extracts, which showed antimicrobial activity (active extracts), were decanted with different polarization solvents including 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate to obtain fractions. The diffusion method was conducted to determine antimicrobial activities of these fractions on microbial strains. Noticeably, antimicrobial agents are usually distributed in moderate polarity fractions such as chloroform and ethyl acetate (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> displayed the IZD on MSSA (23 mm), MRSA (21 mm), 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (15 mm), and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (14 mm). Similarly, 
 <italic>T. erecta's</italic> fraction of ethyl acetate shows IZD from 11 to 18 mm on MSSA, MRSA, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.
