 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> aerial part extracts had an effect on MSSA, MRSA, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> but the MIC values were higher than 
 <italic>T. erecta</italic> extracts. Amadi et al. demonstrated that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> displayed the significant inhibitory zone on 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Following the report of Akinyemi et al. (2005), ethanol extract from 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> indicated MIC and MBC on MRSA of 43 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 63.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Kouame et al. studied essential oils extracted from flower and stem of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; the results displayed antibacterial activities with MIC in the range of 64 to 256 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, the MIC values were higher than the previous reports [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; these differences can relate to the dissimilarity of the time of sampling and extraction condition.
