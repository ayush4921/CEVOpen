<p>Although there were many reports for antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of Asteraceae species, applications of these extracts in treating infectious diseases need an evaluation of pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the study, we screened antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of ethanol extracts and essential oils from nine species of Asteraceae on 30 clinical strains causing urinary tract infection, collected from District 2 Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The target was seeking the best extract to apply for a healthcare serum to prevent recurrent UTIs. The antioxidant activity might be a protective factor for urinary tract epithelium to avoid the impact of oxidative stress.
