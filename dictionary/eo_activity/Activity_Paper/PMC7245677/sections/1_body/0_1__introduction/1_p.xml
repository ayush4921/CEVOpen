<p>In recent years, antibiotic resistance has become more sophisticated, putting mankind into the postantibiotic era. Many clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> have extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Polymyxin plasmid-mediated resistance gene (mcr-1) especially was observed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, which was isolated from animals and in patients with infection during 2011–2014, in China [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, it is with profound concern that mcr-1 could be transferred to 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> via transformation [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2016, the first report about mcr-1 gene in a patient with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Pennsylvania, the United States, was shown by Abbasi [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to recent reports, the causative agents of UTIs include uropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</italic>, group B 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS), 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], in which 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the most common causative agents of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
