<p>In traditional descriptions, the “four natures,” also called the “four properties,” are divided into five different degrees, “hot,” “warm,” “plain,” “cool,” and “cold,” to describe the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicinal materials. A literature analysis showed that a total of 70 plant materials had been recorded previously. The most common characteristics of plant materials were cold (31.43%) and cool (28.57%) (

Based on this finding, we assumed that the “heat-clearing” effect of qīng-căo-chá tea should be related to its medicinal property, which aims to improve the “heat syndrome” symptoms (fever; flushed face; dysphoria and feverish sensation in chest, palms, and soles; scanty dark urine; and dry bound stool; etc.) in traditional diagnosis. Interestingly, qīng-căo-chá tea also contains a small proportion of warm raw materials (15.71%). According to interviews and investigations, the warm raw materials are typically used to “moderate the drug properties.” The concept of balance between cold and heat in traditional efficacy descriptions and the concept of balance between yin and yang in traditional Chinese medicine are embodied in the compatibility of the raw materials used in qīng-căo-chá tea.
