<p>Proximate analysis such as moisture content, ash, protein content, crude fiber, fat and NFE of milk thistle seeds grown in three different cities of Pakistan were carried out through AACC methods (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31990-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> revealed that in case of location, Islamabad contained highest amount of Protein, ash, moisture, and fiber that were 30.09 ± 1.50%, 2.37 ± 0.14%, 6.27 ± 0.37%, and 7.4 ± 0.37% than other cities. Whereas, in case of variety, blue variety contains higher amount than white. The findings are in harmony with the earlier work of Khan et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) who investigated the moisture, ash, fat, fiber, and protein content of milk thistle seeds as 4.24%–4.72%, 1.93%, 26.05%, 5.48%, and 26.01%. However, Malekzadeh et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) reported very low moisture content in comparison with the current results, due to climate changes and milk thistle cultivated from sandy land. Later, milk thistle crude fiber contents in the present research are in high conformity with the work of Mahmoud et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and Jadayil et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Furthermore, Khalil (2008) quantified low (1.5%) fiber content respectively. The finding of Mahmoud et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) are in accordance with the present observations regarding milk thistle seeds fat content, they expounded in the range of 29.68%–28.53% in two varieties. Wichtl and Bisset (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>) outlined that fat content of milk thistle was 20%–30%. Likewise, Perez et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) explained that the value of oil content of Asteraceae family is 25%. However, Khalil (2008) reported lowest 0.7% ash content in comparison with the current results, whereas Mahmoud et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) observed ash content in rang of 04.50%–03.25% in two different varieties.
