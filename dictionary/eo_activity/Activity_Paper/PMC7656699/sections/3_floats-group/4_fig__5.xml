  <p>Effect of HESAE on aconitase activity and MMP in PC-12 cells treated with high-dose corticosterone. 
   <bold>a</bold> Aconitase activity and 
   <bold>b</bold> MMP were evaluated by aconitase and MMP assays following pre-treatment with HESAE for 48 h and high-dose corticosterone of 400 μM for 24 h. Data are expressed as mean ± SD and statistically analysed by Tukey’s test. Asterisks (*) and hash signs (#) indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in aconitase activity and MMP compared to the corticosterone group and desipramine group, respectively
