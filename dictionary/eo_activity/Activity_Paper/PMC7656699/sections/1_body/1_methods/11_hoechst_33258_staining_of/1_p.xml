<p id="Par42">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 96-well black plate at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. Then, the medium was removed and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 10 min at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. Cells were washed twice with PBS and visualised using the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope with Intensilight C-HGFIE Precentered Fiber Illuminator (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 460 nm. The number of apoptotic cells in five random non-overlapping fields was quantified by ImageJ [
