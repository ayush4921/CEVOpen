<p id="Par35">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. The 96-well plate was then centrifuged at 250 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at room temperature to obtain the supernatant. The LDH release was determined using a LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm with 690 nm as background absorbance using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The cytotoxicity was expressed as the percentage of the negative control level.
