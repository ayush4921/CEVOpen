<p id="Par63">Neuroprotective effects of HESAE might be mediated by non-enzymatic antioxidant defence systems involving phenolic compounds and flavonoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and by enzymatic antioxidants including SOD, CAT, GPx, glutathione reductase (GR) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1). In this study, pre-treatment with HESAE successfully restored the SOD and CAT activities confirming the enzymatic antioxidant defence mechanisms of HESAE. Our findings are in accordance with Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and Han et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] found that a polysaccharide derived from the mycelium (designated as EP-1) increased intestinal serum SOD activity in a rat model of acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis and in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cellular model of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. Han et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] found that a polysaccharide derived from the fruiting bodies increased CAT levels in a rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The SOD is important in controlling cellular ROS levels, as it is responsible for the dismutation of O

 <sup>âˆ’</sup>, the principal ROS formed by the mitochondria to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>2</sub>.
