<p id="Par62">Several cellular mechanisms of high-dose corticosterone-mediated oxidative stress in PC-12 cells have been documented including the generation of ROS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], introduction of mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and fragmentation of DNA leading to apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Consistent with this, we showed that high-dose corticosterone markedly reduced the viability of PC-12 cells and increased the release of LDH into the extracellular space, confirming neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells. However, pre-treatment with HESAE at 0.25 to 1 mg/mL prior to exposure to 400 μM corticosterone significantly increased the viability in a dose-dependent manner. Zhou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Yu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] observed a similar degree of apoptosis in PC-12 cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone, which support our findings on the dose of corticosterone that induces neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells.
