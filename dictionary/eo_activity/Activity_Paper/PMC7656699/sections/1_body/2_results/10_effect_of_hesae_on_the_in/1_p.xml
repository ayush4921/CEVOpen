<p id="Par54">Oxidation of DCFH-DA to DCF exhibits green fluorescence indicating the presence of ROS. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, PC-12 cells in the negative control group exhibited homogenously dim-green irregularly shaped structures after staining with DCFH-DA. 400 μM corticosterone caused an increase in green fluorescence compared to the negative control, indicating high intracellular ROS levels. However, pre-treatment with 0.25 mg/mL HESAE markedly decreased the fluorescence intensity. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, 400 μM corticosterone significantly increased the intracellular ROS levels from 100.00 ± 7.51% to 128.52 ± 16.74% (
