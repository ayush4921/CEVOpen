<p id="Par48">LDH is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme that is released into extracellular space due to a damaged plasma membrane upon cell death. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, PC-12 cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone released 44.65 ± 2.60% LDH, being 17.1-fold higher compared to negative control (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the LDH release between higher concentrations of HESAE and corticosterone. Pre-treatment with 0.25 mg/mL HESAE was observed to be comparable to the effect of desipramine in reducing LDH release. As 0.25 mg/mL HESAE promoted highest viability as measured in the MTT and lowest LDH leakage, the concentration was selected for subsequent assays.
