<p id="Par57">Herierin III was isolated as a colorless oil. The UV spectrum showed absorption maxima at 213.0 and 251.0 nm, suggesting a pyrone chromophore. The IR absorption spectrum showed bands at 3325.42 cm
 <sup>− 1</sup> and 1662.89 cm
 <sup>− 1</sup> due to the presence of OH and unsaturated ketone functions. The molecular formula of herierin III was established as C
 <sub>8</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, based on HRESIMS spectrum where an [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> peak was observed at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 171.0653.
