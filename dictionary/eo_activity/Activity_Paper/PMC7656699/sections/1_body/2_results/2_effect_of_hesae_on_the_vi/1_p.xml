<p id="Par46">The effect of HESAE on the viability of PC-12 cells was determined prior to the investigation of the neuroprotective activities of HESAE to exclude the possibility of cytotoxic and proliferative effects. The vulnerability of the cells to HESAE-induced toxicity was investigated through exposure to various concentrations of HESAE ranged from 0.125 to 8 mg/mL. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, there was no cytotoxicity observed for all tested concentrations. As the relatively lower concentrations of 0.25 to 1 mg/mL HESAE showed no significant difference in the viability compared to negative control (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and higher viability compared to 0.125, 2 and 4 mg/mL HESAE, the lower concentrations of HESAE (0.25 to 1 mg/mL) were selected to investigate its neuroprotective effects on viability as measured in the MTT and LDH leakage assays upon exposure to 400 μM corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity.
