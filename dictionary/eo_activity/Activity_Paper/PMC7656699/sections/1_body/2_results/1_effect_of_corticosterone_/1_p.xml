<p id="Par45">The vulnerability of PC-12 cells to high-dose corticosterone-induced toxicity was investigated through exposure to various concentrations of corticosterone ranged from 200 to 800 μM. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, cell viability was significantly decreased by all tested concentrations (
