 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, PC-12 cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone significantly reduced the GPx activity to 83.05 ± 4.63% or 1.2-fold lower compared to negative control (

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, higher concentrations of HESAE at 0.5 and 1 mg/mL were tested for GPx activity. Nevertheless, the concentrations failed to restore the depleted activity. All tested concentrations of HESAE exhibited 1.2 to 2.0-fold lower in the activity compared to desipramine (
