<p id="Par72">Our study demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of HESAE via upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activities in an in vitro model of depression. The neuroprotective effects could possibly be attributed to the major compounds found in HESAE, namely adenosine and herierin III. HESAE could be a potential dietary supplement to be used to treat depression. Further pre-clinical trials are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of adenosine and herierin III as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants.</p>
