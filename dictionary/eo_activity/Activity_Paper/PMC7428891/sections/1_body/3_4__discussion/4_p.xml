<p>A drug agent that is capable of inhibiting fluid accumulation in this technique is considered as having anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results reported herein suggest remarkable anti-inflammatory effects of the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> as evidenced by their ability to inhibit/reduce xylene-induced ear oedema in experimental mice. Particularly, the aqueous stem bark extract of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> proved to be more potent than the methanolic extract of the same plant, at all the studied dose levels.
