Moreover, research has established that peripheral action differs from central action, and some centrally acting drugs, such as opioids, inhibit both phases of nociception equally [

Even though the specific mechanism through which the studied plant extracts exert their bioactivity has not been debunked, it is suggestive that the compounds in these extracts could possess both peripheral and central analgesic/anti-inflammatory effects.
