<p>In this study, acute oral toxicity effects of both the methanolic and aqueous stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> were investigated according to the guidelines described by the OECD [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There were no observable signs of toxicity in the experimental group mice at the various dose levels, up to the cut-off dose of 2000 mg/kg bw. Thus, the study agrees with previous findings, such as those by [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] which had found acute toxicity to be very low and that the extract is practically nontoxic at oral doses. Furthermore, [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that the leaf fraction of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> was not toxic to rats at oral doses.
