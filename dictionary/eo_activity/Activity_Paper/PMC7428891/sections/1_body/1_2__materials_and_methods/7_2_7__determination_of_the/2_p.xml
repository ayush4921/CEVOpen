<p>Thereafter, experimental mice were monitored individually, and the number of writhes was counted after 5 minutes of writhing induction, for 30 minutes, and recorded. The average number of writhes and the percentage inhibition of writhing were calculated as an indicator of analgesic activity following the equation described by Rashid et al. [
