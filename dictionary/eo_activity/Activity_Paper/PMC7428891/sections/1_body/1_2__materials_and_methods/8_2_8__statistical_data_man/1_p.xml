<p>The obtained data from anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities were tabulated on MS Excel spreadsheet (2016) and exported to GraphPad Prism statistical software version 8.3.0.538. The data were subjected to descriptive statistics and expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of replicate experiments. One-Way ANOVA was done to compare differences among means, followed by Tukey's 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> test for pairwise comparison and separation of means at 
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.05. Values with 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Acute oral toxicity data were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed according to OECD guideline document No. 425 [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and LD
