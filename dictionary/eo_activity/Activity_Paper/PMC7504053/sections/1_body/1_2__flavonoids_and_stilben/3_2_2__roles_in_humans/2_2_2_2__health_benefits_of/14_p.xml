<p>Daflon is a purified, micronized fraction of flavonoids, chiefly composed of diosmin (90%; 
 <bold>27</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f005">Figure 5</xref>, and smaller amounts of other flavonoids such as hesperidin. Diosmin is commonly found in members of the genus 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> (Rutaceae) but has also been isolated from non-rutaceous plants (such as 
 <italic>Teucrium gnaphalodes</italic>; Lamiaceae). Daflonâ€™s pharmacological profile is similar to that of the aforementioned glycosylated flavonoids. There is some evidence that daflon increases venous tone and resistance in small blood vessels, suggesting that it might be of value in the treatment of some cardiovascular conditions, such as CVI and post-thrombotic syndrome [

Daflon has a somewhat awkward position because, in some countries such as France and the Czech Republic, it is available as prescription drug, while in the U.S. and other countries it is treated as a dietary supplement and not approved as a prescription drug because of a lack of clinical evidence. Recently, it was also reported to be helpful in the treatment of haemorrhoids [
