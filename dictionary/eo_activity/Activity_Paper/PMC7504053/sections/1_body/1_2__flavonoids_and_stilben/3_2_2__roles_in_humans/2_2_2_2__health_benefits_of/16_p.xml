<p>Interestingly, if the glycosylated flavonoids neohesperidin and naringenin, are converted to dihydrochalcone (DHC) derivatives, neohesperidin-DHC and naringin-DHC;

Neohesperidin-DHC is used as a non-saccharide flavour enhancer, artificial sweetener, and a masking agent of some bitter-tasting components in both food and the pharmaceutical industry. It has a noticeable fruity and liquorice-like off note which, however, restricts its use to those products where this taste is not disturbing. Naringin-DHC is utilized as a sweetener as well, nevertheless, apparently not as often as neohesperidin-DHC. Some pharmacological activities have been suggested for these compounds: neuroprotective activity, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and apoptosis-inducing activity [

Some animal studies have indicated adverse side-effects such as CNS depression/activation, muscle-relaxation/convulsion, or embryotoxicity [
