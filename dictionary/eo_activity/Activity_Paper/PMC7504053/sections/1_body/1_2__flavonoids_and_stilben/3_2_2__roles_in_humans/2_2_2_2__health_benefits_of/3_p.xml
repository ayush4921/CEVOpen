<p>Kaempferol (
 <bold>6</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>, seems to have properties similar to quercetin. It showed a relatively broad spectrum of anticancer activity in vitro and in animal models of breast, ovarian, prostate, gastric, pancreatic, and lung cancer. In some types of cancer, the anticancer effects of kaempferol were believed to be associated with its ability to interact with oestrogenic receptors (compare with isoflavonoids discussed later in this text). It was also suggested to be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, suppression of metastasis, inhibition of angiogenesis, and the induction of apoptosis [

Kaempferol also inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of various endocannabinoids (such as anandamide), sleep-inducing lipids (oleamides), and various members of the transient receptor potential of calcium channels (e.g.,

Various studies also claimed that there was a link between the consumption of kaempferol-rich foods such as certain fruits, tea, and some vegetables from the Brassicaceae family, and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. A kaempferol derivative, 6-methoxykaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-Î²-D-robinobioside, inhibited aldose reductase, which is assumed to be associated with diabetes complications [
