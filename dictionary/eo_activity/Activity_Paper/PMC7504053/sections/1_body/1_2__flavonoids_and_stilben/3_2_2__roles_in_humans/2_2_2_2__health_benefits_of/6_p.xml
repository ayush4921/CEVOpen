<p>Apigenin (
 <bold>4</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>, was shown to interact with numerous receptors, including benzodiazepine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine, opioid, PPAR-γ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), and 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). It is an activator of the monoamine transporter system and was also found to have selective anticancer activity through interference with the cell cycle and the regulation of protease production [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; which would put it into the category of a potential therapeutic treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The evidence for apigenin’s pharmacological activity, however, has so far only come from in vitro experiments and animal models [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Like naringenin, apigenin appears to be a potential inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and thus may potentiate the action of some drugs [
