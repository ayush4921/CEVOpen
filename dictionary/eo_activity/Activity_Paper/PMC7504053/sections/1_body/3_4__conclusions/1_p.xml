<p>Natural products have always attracted interest as leads in the search for new pharmaceutical drugs. Among all the plant-derived natural compounds, flavonoids and their structurally related compounds have received a great deal of attention over the last decade. Flavonoids and plant-derived aromatic polyketides have been claimed to be beneficial in a vast array of human diseases from cancer and diabetes to cardiovascular problems. The outcome of all the effort that has been invested in researching flavonoids as possible drugs may be perceived as rather disappointing since few have actually proceeded to clinical use. Some of the major problems hindering their clinical use are low water solubility, rapid metabolism and excretion, and weak efficacy. Perhaps the only flavonoid-derived compound that has been approved for medicinal use is the injectable form of silymarin used in the treatment of acute poisoning with the mushroom, Amanita phalloides. Combretastatin A-4 phosphate, an agent with a novel mode of anticancer action, is in the later stages of clinical development. Phenoxodiol and the related analogues also demonstrated promising anticancer effects in clinical trials. Other flavonoid-derived analogues, despite showing considerable promise, appear to have some drawbacks, and in some cases, have been superseded by more effective agents such as analogues of rohitukine, or like the kavalactones, have severe adverse effects, or are orally inactive and have poor bioavailability like silymarin. Several studies suggest that promising dietary flavonoids and allied compounds such as quercetin, resveratrol, and curcumin have not shown consistently significant clinical efficacy in humans (to date). Thus, do the flavonoids and related plant-derived aromatic polyketides deserve to be called miracle compounds? Some of them such as combretastatins, phenoxodiol-related compounds, silymarin, and kavalactones, perhaps yes. The clinical efficiency of the other members is at least questionable. Only the course of time will tell.</p>
