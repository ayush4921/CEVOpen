<p>Isoflavonoids comprise a specific subgroup of structural variants of flavonoids, where the aromatic B ring has migrated to the neighbouring carbon on the heterocyclic C ring (from position C
 <sub>2</sub> to position C
 <sub>3</sub>), which requires the activity of isoflavone synthase (IFS) enzymes. Initially it was believed that only the leguminous plants do possess the necessary biosynthetic apparatus (i.e., IFS enzymes) for the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids, and thus that these compounds are entirely limited to members of the Fabaceae family. However, isoflavonoids have now been detected in more than 60 non-leguminous taxa, including those with medicinal importance, such as Apocynaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Iridaceae. The distribution of Malvaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, and Zingiberaceae [

As with flavonoids, isoflavonoids are prone to further modifications, including hydroxylation and alkylation, various levels of oxidation of the heterocyclic ring, or the formation of additional heterocyclic rings, which create a high level of structural complexity. Many natural derivatives of the basic isoflavone skeleton have been described, such as isoflavans, prenylated isoflavonoids, coumestans, pterocarpans, and rotenoids). It appears that plants produce isoflavonoids for defensive purposes, especially against fungi [
