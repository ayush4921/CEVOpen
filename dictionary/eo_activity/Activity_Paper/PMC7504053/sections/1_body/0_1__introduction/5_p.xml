<p>This review focused on the clinical data concerning flavonoids and the related aromatic polyketides obtained through an extensive literature review and a search of the relevant books and research articles with the use of Web of Knowledge, SciVerse, Scopus and PubMed databases. In order to highlight particular agents as clinically relevant, special emphasis was placed on their selection by applying the following criteria: what phases of clinical trials have been passed or, for those compounds introduced into medicinal practice, at what stage of clinical development are they. If clinical data were unavailable at the time, studies describing the results from animal or cell culture were taken into account. Besides the clinical efficacy, this review also describes the botanical source of each agent, for which disease it might be of value, its biological activity, proposed mechanism of action, and side-effects.</p>
