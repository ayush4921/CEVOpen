<p>To determine the range of saturation of the obtained PDHC preparation with endogenous TPP, the enzyme activity was evaluated (procedure given below) with the addition of exogenous TPP (0.2â€‰mM) without antivitamins in relation to evaluation without the addition of TPP in the reaction mixture. The results showed that the saturation of the preparation by endogenous TPP did not exceed 10%. Kinetic calculations were corrected to pure apoform.</p>
