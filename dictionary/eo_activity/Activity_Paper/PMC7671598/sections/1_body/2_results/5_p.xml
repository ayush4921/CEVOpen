<p>Sample results obtained by analysing the viability profile of HeLa control culture and after incubation with 0.02% of tested antivitamins are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>. Data obtained from three independent cultures for each antivitamin are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>, in which the changes in the percentage of live, dead, and apoptotic cells after incubation with different concentrations of antivitamins are clearly presented. Incubation of cells with OT and OTPP intensified the apoptosis process in a concentration-dependent manner compared to DATPP. The highest percentage of apoptotic cells was observed at the highest concentrations of OT and OTPP, while DATPP increased the apoptotic cells only by a much lower number. Simultaneously, after incubation with OT and OTPP, we observed a significantly reduced number of live cells (about 50%) in comparison to control and DATPP variants.
