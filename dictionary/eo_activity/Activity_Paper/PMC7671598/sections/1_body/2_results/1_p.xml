<p>Measurements of the activity of PDHC in the presence of various concentrations of TPP and with or without tested antivitamins allow to preparation Michaelis Menten and Lineweaver Burk plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). These plots showed that, in the presence of the natural coenzyme as well as anticoenzymes, PDHC exhibited hyperbolic kinetics. The addition of both tested anticoenzymes did not affect the
