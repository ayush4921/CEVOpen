<p>OT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, No. 
 <bold>3</bold>), in contrast to DAT, is one of the best-known antivitamins of thiamine. Research done in 1984 on transketolase and PDHC isolated from rat adrenals showed that the enzymes are inhibited in the presence of OT
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>12</sup>
 </xref>. Most importantly, another study
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>13</sup>
 </xref> showed four times lower activity of PDHC after the injection of OT (1 mM/kg of rats’ body weight), suggesting that this compound may be an inhibitor of TPP-dependent enzymes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, OT has been assumed to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. A study done on PC-12 cells showed over 90% inhibition of cell growth (depending on the concentration and duration of incubation)

 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>16–18</sup>
 </xref>). However, OT may have no effect on thiamine transport as well (as shown by a study on BeWo human trophoblasts
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>19</sup>
 </xref>). In addition, OT also may decrease the cell viability of colon carcinoma

 </xref>. Moreover, another research using 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells which focussed on the activity of TPP dependent enzymes in the presence of OT showed that this compound may be a stronger inhibitor of mitochondrial enzymes (such as PDHC decrease by 50%) than the TPP-dependent enzymes present in the cytosol (such as pyruvate decarboxylase)
