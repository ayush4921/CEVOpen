 <p>Oxythiamine (OT) and 3-deazathiamine (DAT) are the antimetabolites of thiamine. The aim of study was to compare the effects of OT and DAT pyrophosphates (-PP) on the kinetics of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and the 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of HeLa cells. The kinetic study showed that 3-deazathiamine pyrophosphate (DATPP) was a much stronger competitive inhibitor (

   <sub>i</sub>
  </italic> = 0.0026 μM) of PDHC than OTPP (
  <italic>K
   <sub>i</sub>
  </italic> = 0.025 μM). Both 
  <italic>K
   <sub>i</sub>
  </italic> values were much lower versus 
  <italic>K</italic>
  <sub>m</sub> for thiamine pyrophosphate (0.06 μM). However, DATPP added to the culture medium for the HeLa cells culture did not hamper the rate of cell growth and showed not significant impact on the viability of the cells, whereas OTPP and OT showed a significant cytostatic effect. The differences between the thiamine antivitamins in their effect on cell growth 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> may be due to differences in physicochemical properties and difficulty in DAT transport across the cell membrane.
