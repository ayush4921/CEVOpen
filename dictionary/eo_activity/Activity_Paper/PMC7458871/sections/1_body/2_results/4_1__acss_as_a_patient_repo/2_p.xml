 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows the severity of the individual typical symptoms of the ACSS at visits 1 to 4. At visit 1, most of the patients reported the five typical symptoms: frequent urination (99.8%), urgent urination (99.2%), dysuria (98.6%), incomplete bladder emptying (89.5%), and suprapubic pain (83.6%), but only 11.8% also complained about visible blood in urine, which is pathognomonic for hemorrhagic cystitis. In this trial the number of patients with visible blood in urine was rather small and almost not present at the follow-up visits. The other five symptoms showed distinct and somewhat parallel reductions in severity (
