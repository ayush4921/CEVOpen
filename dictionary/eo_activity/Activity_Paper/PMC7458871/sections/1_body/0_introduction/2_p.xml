<p>For nonantibacterial agents the elimination of bacteriuria cannot be one of the main objectives, especially since it is known that urine from healthy subjects is not sterile [

For such guidelines, clinical criteria should become the main inclusion and outcome criteria, although microbiological investigations may be included, especially if antibacterial and nonantibacterial approaches are compared directly. Although the clinical diagnosis of uUTI is based mainly on history and typical symptoms, these symptoms are not found exclusively in patients with AC. Therefore, not only the presence but also the severity of these symptoms (scoring) and probably also their impact on quality of life (QoL) are important. In clinical trials, a patient-reported outcome measure can be used to measure the effect of a medical intervention on one or more concepts [
