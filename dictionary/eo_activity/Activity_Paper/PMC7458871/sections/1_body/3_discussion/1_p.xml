<p>Current guidelines still recommend the use of antibiotics as the first choice of treatment for the acute phase of uUTIs [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, frequent use of antibiotics can cause collateral damage to the microbiome [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In order to combat the overuse of antibiotics and thus the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance, it is important to establish whether there are efficacious substitutes for antibiotics in the treatment of uUTIs. Commonly accepted guidelines for well-designed clinical studies are needed to test both antibacterial and nonantibacterial investigational medicinal products, indicated for the treatment of AC, for which clinical criteria for diagnostics and outcome need to be established as main objectives.
