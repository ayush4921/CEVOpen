 </xref> The 3 categories of Expanded Access are individual use, including emergency use; use in intermediate-sized populations of patients; and widespread use. Expanded Access provides access to drugs, including biologics, by patients when a use is not primarily intended for the collection of information about the tolerability or effectiveness of an investigational agent. Between 1992 and 2017, there were 92 FDA approvals of drugs, including biologics, with the Expanded Access designation, half of which were for use in patients with cancer.
