<p id="p0100">It is likely that each manufacturer of drug products, including biologics, or vaccine products will have short- and long-term postmarketing commitments to ensure the continuation of collecting postmarketing efficacy data, as well as to consider special populations and issues (eg, pediatric and elderly populations, patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, and patients with a risk for drugâ€“drug interactions) in the further evaluation of the product. To maintain the safety profile of marketed products, adverse-events reports on all products will be passively collected.</p>
