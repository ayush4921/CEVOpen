  <p>Effect on the seedling growth of cress of all fractions of the extracts of 
   <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> that has been obtained from the column of Sephadex LH-20: cress seeds were exposed to the concentration equivalent of the extracts gained from 1.2 g DW (dry weight) of 
   <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic>/mL for F1 (20% aqueous methanol), F2 (30% aqueous methanol), F3 (40% aqueous methanol), F4 (50% aqueous methanol), F5 (60% aqueous methanol), F6 (80% aqueous methanol), and F7 (methanol). The values are mean Â± SE for each treatment from the two independent experiments with 10 seedlings. Asterisks show major variations between treatments and control: *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (ANOVA one way and least significant difference (LSD) test post hoc).
