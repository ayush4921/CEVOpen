<p>The fresh stem bark was washed so as to remove dead materials and allowed to dry for three weeks under a shade. The dried stem bark was then pulverized by using a grinder. The powdered stem bark (1.52 Kg) was macerated in 80% methanol for 72 hrs in maceration jars, extraction was aided by orbital shaker and intermittent stirring. The extract was first filtered using a muslin cloth and then by Whatman filters paper No.1. For exhaustive extraction of the plant material, the residue was re-macerated for another 72 hrs twice and then filtered. The combined filtrates were dried in an oven dryer at a temperature of 40°C and weighed. Then, the dried extract (crude extract) was kept in a tightly closed amber bottle and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C until further use.</p>
