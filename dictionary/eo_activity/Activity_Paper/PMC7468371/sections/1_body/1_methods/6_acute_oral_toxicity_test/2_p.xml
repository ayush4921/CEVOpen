<p>The mice were fasted for food, but not water four hours prior to dosing and one hour after administration of the extract. A single dose of the extract (2000 mg/kg) was administered using oral gavage to the first mouse and observed for any physical and behavioral changes. After 24 hrs, four mice were fasted and 2000 mg/kg single dose was administered. The mice were observed individually for gross behavioral changes (locomotion, activity, hair texture, pupil size, and feeding) at least once during the first 30 min, periodically for 24 hours, with special attention given during the first four hours, and daily observation were made thereafter for a total period of 14 days.</p>
