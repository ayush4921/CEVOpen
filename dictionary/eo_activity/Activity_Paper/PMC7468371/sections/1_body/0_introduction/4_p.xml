<p>Cyclophosphamide causes damage to the urinary bladder and it might cause renal toxicity.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It has been revealed that generation of oxidative and nitrative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity.
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, cyclophosphamide decreases the activities of lysosomal protein digestive enzymes, which leads to the amassing of abnormal amounts of protein in the kidney; this might be another possible reason for cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity.
