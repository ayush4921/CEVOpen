<p>In the cyclophosphamide-treated group, both kidney weight (P &lt; 0.01) and kidney-to-body weight ratio (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly increased compared to normal control, whereas the kidney weight increment was significantly prevented by the treatment of crude extract 400 mg/kg compared with the cyclophosphamide control group (P &lt; 0.01). Treatment with the aqueous fraction 100 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05) and 200 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.01) significantly prevented kidney weight increment compared with the cyclophosphamide control group. Treatment with 200 mg/kg aqueous fraction significantly decreased kidney-to-body weight ratio compared to the cyclophosphamide control group (P &lt; 0.05).</p>
