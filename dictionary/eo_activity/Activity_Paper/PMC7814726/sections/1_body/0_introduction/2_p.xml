<p id="Par15">Herein, focusing on discovering bioactive secondary metabolites from Iranian 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we studied the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Salvia macrosiphon</italic> Boiss., Wild sage known as “Marvak” in Persian [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The plant is an endemic species growing in the west and center of Iran, and has been used in Iranian traditional medicine as diuretic, carminative and anti-flatulent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although, 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic> has been commonly used in traditional medicine, a few phytochemical studies have been developed. In this respect, flavonoids and phenolic compounds (e.g. apigenin and luteolin derivatives, and rosmarinic acid), β-sitosterol, and diterpenes (e.g. 13-epi-manoyl oxide) have been isolated and reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this work, we evaluated antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of different fractions of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic> and focusing on the efficacy of the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction, four compounds including diterpenes (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>), flavonoid (
 <bold>3</bold>), and steroid (
 <bold>4</bold>) were isolated and identified which one of them, compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was reported for the first time for this plant (Fig.
