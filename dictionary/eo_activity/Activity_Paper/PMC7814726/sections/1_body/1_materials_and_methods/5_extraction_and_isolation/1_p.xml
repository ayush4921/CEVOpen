<p id="Par22">The air-dried powdered aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. macrosiphon</italic> (1.8 kg) were crushed and extracted with methanol (8 × 8 L) at room temperature for 7 days. The extract was concentrated under vacuum to afford dark green gummy residue (90.0 g). The crude methanol extract was mixed with water (700 mL) to form a suspension and partitioned successively with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate to yield 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (40.0 g), chloroform (20.0 g), ethyl acetate (4.0 g) and water soluble (26.0 g) fractions.
