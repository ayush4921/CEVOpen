<p id="Par20">Two different human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), lung cancer cell line (A-549) and normal cell (Human Dermal Fibroblast) were purchased from Pasture Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran. The medium of RPMI 1640 (PAA, Germany) including sodium bicarbonate and 
 <italic>N</italic>-hydroxyethylpiperazone-n-2-ethanesulfonic Acid (HEPES, Biosera, England) was used to maintain the cell lines. The medium was enriched with fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and antibiotics. Then, incubated in air atmosphere enriched 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. The cytotoxic activity of all fractions and compounds were examined by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) assay.
