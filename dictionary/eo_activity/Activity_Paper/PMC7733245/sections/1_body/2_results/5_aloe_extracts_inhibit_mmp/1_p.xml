<p id="Par40">MMPs have been implicated in the migratory capacity of cancer cells due to its ability to degrade the extracellular matrix. Under this context, it was also our goal to test the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the extracellular media of the HT29 cells. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the specific MMP-9 and MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity present in the extracellular media of HT29 cells, using zymography. In the gelatin zymography, white bands are indicative of non-inhibited MMP gelatinolytic activity, including that of the pro-enzyme and its active form. Concerning the MMPs, they are generally synthesized as zymogens (pro-MMPs), with their catalytic activity blocked by a cysteine switch and are only activated by its removal, through limited proteolysis. In the zymography assay, the pro-gelatinases similarly become active because they are denaturated by the SDS, therefore exposing the catalytic site (hence the slightly higher mass of the pro-enzymes in the zymography, which still maintain the short amino acid sequence of the cysteine switch). Consequently, there are two white bands for each MMP, as observed in the controls in Fig.
