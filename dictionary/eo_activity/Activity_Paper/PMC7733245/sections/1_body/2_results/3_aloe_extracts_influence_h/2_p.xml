<p id="Par37">The results for the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), which in this work was determined as the lowest concentration which prevented 10% growth inhibition are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. MIC results point to much lower inhibitory concentrations, showing stronger inhibition for 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, with a MIC of 3.12 μg dry weight/mL, which is approximately half the MIC determined for 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>.
