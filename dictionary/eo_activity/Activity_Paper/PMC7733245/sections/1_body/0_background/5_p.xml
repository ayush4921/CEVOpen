<p id="Par16">These studies can be valuable to confirm the real effect of 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species on cancer and eventually provide the identification of innovative anticancer approaches. Furthermore, the analysis of gelatinase activity inhibition by 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> extracts may also constitute a novel perspective, which can help to comprehend the mechanisms of action of the plants from this genus. With that in mind, we set out to evaluate the content of several classes of potentially bioactive compounds, using different extraction procedures and their impact on the growth and migration of colon adenocarcinoma cells, as well as their effect on MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities.
