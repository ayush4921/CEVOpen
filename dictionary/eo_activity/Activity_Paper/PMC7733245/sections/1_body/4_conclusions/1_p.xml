<p id="Par50">Our general results suggest specific important issues: 1) the genus 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> is capable of inhibiting MMP-9 and MMP-2, although more efficiently MMP-9, 2) there are indeed differences among 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species, and 3) 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> is possibly not the most efficient 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species. These facts allow us to ask important questions: is all the debate and misconception about 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> being caused by erroneous uses of different species (more or less efficient, or more toxic than 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>)? And are we missing out on not testing other 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species, in search for important bioactivities, which can efficiently be used in medical treatments? Either way, results here show that when considering the potential of 
 <italic>Aloe</italic>, it is extremely important to take into consideration the type of extraction used, the species of 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> and also their effects on individual MMPs.
