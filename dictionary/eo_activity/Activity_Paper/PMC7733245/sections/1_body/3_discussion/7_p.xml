<p id="Par48">Our results demonstrated that both 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> extracts inhibited MMP-9 and MMP-2 enzymatic activities, especially towards MMP-9. Since MMP-9 is strongly associated to inflammation, wound healing and cancer migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], these results are more consistent to the anecdotal reports on 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> bioactivities. A higher MMP-9 enzymatic inhibition can be of noteworthy importance because it has been considered that most MMPIs are non-specific, and this is, in turn, responsible for their generalized adverse side effects observed in most MMP studies. A more specific activity inhibition targeted exclusively to MMP-9, particularly in colon cancer, where this MMPI might act in situ, may be of significant potential to anticancer and anti-inflammatory approaches in the gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, our results show that the detected inhibitory activities were due to direct binding of 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extract components to MMP-9, being this inhibition higher for 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> than for 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>. These results suggest that the higher MMP inhibitory activities in 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> can be related to the higher inhibition of cell migration found for this species. Nevertheless, the percentage of activity reduction was not as high as the one observed in the zymographic analysis, where MMP-9â€™s activity was reduced more than 50%., suggesting that the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts do not only inhibit directly this enzyme, but may also use alternative mechanisms. This is in agreement with the results obtained by Vijayalakshmi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] that showed 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> extracts down regulating metalloproteinase expression, specifically MMP-9.
