<p id="Par49">Regardless of having similar concentrations of various bioactive classes of compounds, 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> seems to be a more effective cancer cell migration inhibitor than 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>. This might be due to a larger concentration and/or greater number of bioactive compounds like anthraquinones present in 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, or to the presence of specific compounds not yet identified in this species. Even so, results show that in studies related to cancer prevention or therapy using 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species, 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> should be considered as an effective alternative to 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>. Additionally, our results also highlight the importance of the extraction procedure to obtain higher amounts of bioactive extracts, such as anthraquinones, phenolics and polysaccharides, particularly in 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>.
