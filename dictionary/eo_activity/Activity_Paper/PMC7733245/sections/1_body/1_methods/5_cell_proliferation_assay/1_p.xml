<p id="Par24">HT29 cultured cells were seeded on 96-well plates (2 Ã— 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> leaf extracts were added to the growth media to obtain different final concentrations, and incubated for 24 h. After each treatment, the extracellular media was collected, and the wells were washed with PBS to remove unattached cells. Cell proliferation and viability was determined using the standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described by Carmichael et al. [
