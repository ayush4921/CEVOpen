<p id="Par26">The fluorogenic substrate dye-quenched (DQ)-gelatin was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and dissolved in water at 1 mg/mL. All solutions and dilutions were prepared in assay-buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.01% v/v Tween 20). A 96-well micro-assay plate (chimney, 96-well, black) was used. Each well was loaded with 0.1 mM (for a final volume of 200 μL) MMP-9 (Sigma), to which 100 μg/mL protein of total 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extract (for a final volume of 200 μL) was added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, DQ-gelatin (at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/mL) was added to each well and the plate was incubated again, for 1 h. Fluorescence levels were measured (ex. 485 nm/em. 530 nm). In each experiment, both positive (no sample) and negative (no enzyme) controls were included for all samples, to correct for possible proteolytic activities present in the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts. All data were corrected by subtraction of their corresponding negative controls.
