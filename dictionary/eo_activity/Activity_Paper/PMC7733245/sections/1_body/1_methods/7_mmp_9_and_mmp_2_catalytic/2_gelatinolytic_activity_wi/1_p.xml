<p id="Par27">The same method described above was used, with some alterations. Roughly, each well was loaded with 100 μL of extracellular HT29 media (containing MMP-9 and MMP-2) after exposure to the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts. Subsequently, DQ-gelatin (at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/mL) was added to each well (for a final volume of 200 μL) and the plate was incubated again, for 1 h. Fluorescence levels were measured (ex. 485 nm/em. 530 nm).
