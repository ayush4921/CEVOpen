<p>Osmium poses as another interesting candidate from the PGM block for biological application. Osmium complexes with oxidation states 2+, 3+, and 4+ or higher are well-documented in the literature [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The occurrence of various oxidation states of osmium enables the fine-tuning of redox properties of the complexes for the regulation of redox-dependent biological processes, such as the generation of ROS, within the pathogenic cells of the targeted disease [

Furthermore, the choice of coordinating and ancillary ligands allows further tuning of photophysical properties and confers three-dimensional spatial configuration to the complex, which offers better recognition and guestâ€“host interaction with biological receptors [

 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The anticancer effects of osmium complexes are succinctly discussed in the reviews by Hanif et al. [

 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Examples of osmium complexes that demonstrate antiproliferative effects include the Os(II/III) analogues (
