<p>Iridium complexes are among the most studied complexes for their biological activity, within the PGM family of coordination compounds. Organometallic iridium compounds predominantly consist of half-sandwich pentamethylcyclopentadienyl-coordinated chemical entities that adopt the well-known three-legged piano-stool conformation. The investigation of iridium-based compounds, as antimalarial agents, was brought into prominence by the seminal study of Navarro and colleagues in 2009, who incorporated iridium into the scaffold of the quinolinyl clinical antimalarial drug, chloroquine (
 <bold>1</bold>, CQ), to generate new antiplasmodial iridium complexes (
 <bold>2</bold>â€“
 <bold>4</bold>) [

 <bold>2</bold> demonstrated superior activity to chloroquine. Since then, iridium complexes of non-chloroquine-based scaffolds, such as pyridyl esters (
 <bold>5</bold>) and salicylaldimine (
 <bold>6</bold>), have been expansively studied for their inhibitory effects against both drug-resistant and -sensitive strains of the
