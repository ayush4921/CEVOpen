<p>Encouraged by the promising biological performance of the 2-phenylbenzimidazole Ir(III)Cp* complexes (
 <bold>25</bold>) against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains, a follow-up study entailed conjugation of a 4-aminoquinoline motif to either 2-phenylbenzimidazole or 2-pyridylbenzimidazole, and subsequent complexation, to yield neutral and cationic IrCp* and RhCp* complexes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f006">Figure 6</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The 
 <italic>C^N</italic>-coordinated neutral complexes (
 <bold>26a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>) were more potent than their 
 <italic>N^N</italic>-complexed cationic counterparts (
 <bold>27a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>) against both the K1 and NF54 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Interestingly, the 2-phenylaminoquinoline-benzimidazole hybrid complexes (
 <bold>26</bold>) showed an improvement in activity compared with their corresponding 2-phenylbenzimidazole congeners (
 <bold>25</bold>) against the CQR K1 strain. Moreover, only the Me- and CF
 <sub>3</sub>-functionalized cationic derivatives (
 <bold>27b</bold> and 
 <bold>27c</bold>) were superior to their corresponding non-quinolyl containing counterparts (
 <bold>25c</bold> and 
 <bold>25b</bold>) against the CQS NF54 strain [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, the new quinolinyl complexes demonstrated a significant binding affinity for synthetic hemozoin, β-hematin, exceeding that of the positive control drug, CQ. These findings indicate that the introduction of the pharmacophoric quinoline moiety is vital for antiplasmodial activity, as attested to by the results of the biological assays and the remarkable hemozoin binding activity. Once again, the examination of the substituent effects on activity revealed that CF
 <sub>3</sub> enhances antiplasmodial efficacy. Finally, the neutral 
 <italic>C^N</italic>-cyclometallated complexes (
 <bold>26</bold>), which displayed the most promising activity toward the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> strains, revealed increased selectivity toward parasitic cells over the CHO mammalian cells, with selectivity indices of &gt;50 observed for complexes 
 <bold>26a</bold> and 
 <bold>26b</bold>.
