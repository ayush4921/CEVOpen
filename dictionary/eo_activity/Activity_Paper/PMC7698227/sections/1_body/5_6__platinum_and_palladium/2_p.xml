<p>Numerous examples of inorganic platinum complexes possessing antiplasmodial activity have been reported in the literature. Several reviews [

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] give detailed accounts of antiplasmodial platinum-based complexes. Representative examples of inorganic platinum complexes

 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In many cases, coordination of ligands, particularly known organic antimalarials, with the platinum metal leads to an improvement in antimalarial activity compared with the uncomplexed ligands. It is evident from these presented examples that platination may be an ingenious strategy to augment the efficacy of antimalarial agents, which is a crucial consideration in the fight against the plight of clinical resistance development. Notwithstanding, there is a limited account of cyclometallated platinum complexes, i.e., organometallic compounds with carbon to platinum (C-Pt) bonds, in the literature with antiplasmodial activity against
