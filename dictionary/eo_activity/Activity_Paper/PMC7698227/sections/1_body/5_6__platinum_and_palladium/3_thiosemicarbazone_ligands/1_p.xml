<p>Chellan et al. synthesized tridentate 
 <italic>C^N^S</italic> cycloplatinated TSC complexes with antiplasmodial activity against CQS D10 and CQR Dd2 strains as well as antiproliferative and antitrichomonal effects on ovarian cell lines and 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> parasites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f021">Figure 21</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Cycloplatination was achieved via C-H activation of the TSC ligand to generate a tetrameric complex (
 <bold>82</bold>) with platinum-sulfur bridges. Ligation of this tetramer with mono- and bi-phoshino ligands (triphenylphosphine (PPh
 <sub>3</sub>), PTA, and bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethylene, respectively) led to the attainment of the corresponding mono- and binuclear cycloplatinated TSC products (
 <bold>83a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold> and 
 <bold>84a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>). Pharmacological screening of complexes for their antiplasmodial effects in vitro revealed that only the tetra- and mononuclear complexes (
 <bold>82</bold> and 
 <bold>83a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) were active against the plasmodial parasites, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> activities between 19.93 and 32.92 μM, whereas the binuclear equivalents 
 <bold>84a,b</bold> endowed with bis-phosphino ligands were impotent. Intriguingly, compound 
 <bold>83a</bold> ligated with PPh
 <sub>3</sub> showed no indication of cross-resistance, as attested by its higher selectivity towards the resistant Dd2 strain (14.47 ± 1.98 μM) over the chemosensitive D10 variant (19.93 ± 3.74 μM). The PTA analogue similarly showed minimal effects of cross-resistance because activities on both strains were almost equivalent (21.42 ± 1.22 μM vs. 24.90 ± 3.24 μM).
