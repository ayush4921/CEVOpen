<p>In addition to the bidentate chloroquine-derived

 <bold>7</bold>–

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f002">Figure 2</xref>), Nordlander and colleagues reported the antiplasmodial activity of Rh(III)ClCp* congeners 
 <bold>59</bold>–

 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain (

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These rhodium complexes were more active than their Ir(III)ClCp* variants 
 <bold>7</bold>–
 <bold>10</bold> in the sub-micromolar range (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.16–0.209 μM) against the sensitive strain, although less active against the resistant strain (0.20–0.40 μM). Interrogation of complexation effects and influence of substitution effects on the benzene ring revealed similar SAR trends as the iridium derivatives (
 <bold>7</bold>–
 <bold>10</bold>) previously discussed. Likewise, Chellan et al. also studied the antiplasmodial potency of the rhodium(III) counterparts (
 <bold>63</bold>–
 <bold>64</bold>) of the organometallic iridium(III) pyridyl- and isoquinolyl-sulfadoxine conjugates (
 <bold>22</bold>–
 <bold>23</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f005">Figure 5</xref>) against CQS 3D7 and NF54 strains, as well as resistant Dd2 parasites, which generally displayed a significant improvement in activity relative to the Ir(III) complexes across all strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f015">Figure 15</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Again, the generated SAR trends were similar for both types of complexes, as discussed earlier. The results from the studies by these research groups seem to suggest that the oxidation state of the metallic centre is critical in regulating the activity of the rhodium complexes; particularly, the 3+ oxidation state of the rhodium metal confers overall favourable antimalarial activity to the resultant organometallic agents, while the 1+ state is less favourable.
