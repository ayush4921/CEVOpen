<p>The application of rhodium complexes, especially the forms with the 3+ oxidation state, i.e., Rh(III), for biological evaluation has often been overlooked because of the perception that they may show limited biological activity owing to their inert chemical nature [

However, recently, rhodium complexes have been increasingly gaining favour among medicinal organometallic chemists to expand the antimalarial drug arsenal and potentially diversify the mechanisms of action. An early example of an antimalarial rhodium complex is the Rh(I)-CQ conjugate of
