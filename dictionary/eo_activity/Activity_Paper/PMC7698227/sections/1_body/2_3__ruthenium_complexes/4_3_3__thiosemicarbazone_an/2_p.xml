<p>Premised on the promising antimalarial activity of Ru-TSC complexes and the beneficial organosilane motif, Smith and colleagues rationally combined TSC and organosilane moieties to produce 
 <italic>N^S</italic>-chelated silyl TSC Ru(II) complexes 
 <bold>40</bold>–
 <bold>41</bold> [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Despite the complexes showing high selectivity for the malaria parasites over the mammalian CHO cells, no significant improvement in activity was noticed upon complexation of the corresponding ferrocenyl and phenyl TSC ligands, as the resulting Ru(II) complexes exhibited lower, albeit comparable, toxicity to the ligands. An exception to this was the non-silyl 3,4-dichlorophenyl representative complex 
 <bold>41c</bold>, which was 68 times more active than its respective ligand against the CQS NF54 strain. On a positive note, these new silyl complexes were significantly more active than their related non-silyl analogues (
 <bold>42</bold>–
 <bold>43</bold>) that had been reported earlier [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Again, this was further confirmation of the pharmacological importance of the organosilane moiety appended to the side chain of the TSC structural motif, as previously shown for chloroquine and ferroquine Ru(II) complexes [
