<p>Ruthenium is one of the most versatile metals within the PGM block, with a myriad of applications that span many industries, ranging from catalysis, solar energy technologies, cell-labelling utilities, and various therapeutic applications [

 <sup>6</sup>-arene organometallic fragments and have been exhaustively explored in the field of oncology, as anticancer agents, with diverse modes of action. Evidence of the antimalarial activity of ruthenium-based compounds goes as far back as 1996 and has been demonstrated by several research groups, upon complexation of ruthenium to the chloroquine scaffold, which generated antiplasmodial agents with activity superior to chloroquine, against both CQR and CQS

 <sup>5</sup>-cyclopentadienyl)ruthenium motif (ruthenocene), in place of ferrocene, has proven to be invaluable in unveiling the mode of action of ferroquine, in erythrocytes, owing to the enhanced amenability of ruthenium for cell-labelling compared with iron [
