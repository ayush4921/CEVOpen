<p>Ekengard et al. reported on a series of quinoline-based ruthenium complexes, endowed with 
 <italic>N^O</italic>-salicylaldimine (
 <bold>37a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>) and 
 <italic>N^N</italic>-imidazolemethylamine (
 <bold>38</bold>) moieties [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These complexes were shown to inhibit the growth of CQS NF54 and D10 as well as CQR Dd2 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with no indication of cross-resistance (

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. SAR studies of the salicylaldimine complexes (
 <bold>37a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>) revealed a trend between the substituents and the antiplasmodial activity. This study suggested that an increase in the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituent, i.e., F &gt; Cl &gt; Br &gt; I and OMe &gt; H &gt; NO

 <bold>38</bold>) led to a drastic decrease in activity, by 8- to 10-fold. Intriguingly, the activity against both strains was significantly augmented upon complexation of the Ru(II)(

 <sub>2</sub> motif to the quinoline nitrogen atom (
