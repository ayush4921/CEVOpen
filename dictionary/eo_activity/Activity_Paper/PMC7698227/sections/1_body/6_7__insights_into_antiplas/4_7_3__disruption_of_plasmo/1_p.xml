<p>Transition metals are renowned for their catalytic activity in many chemical transformations. Similar chemical transformations and analogous processes effected by these metals such as transfer hydrogenation, oxidation, and reduction are known to also occur in biological systems where they are mediated by enzymes. It is no surprise that, in recent years, transition metals have begun to be explored for catalysis of chemical processes in biological systems [

 <xref rid="B111-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. This has inspired medicinal and bioinorganic chemists to devise innovative metal-based compounds capable of acting as intracellular catalysts in relevant biochemical processes that are pivotal in the normal functioning of pathogenic cells or organisms, hopefully leading to their disruption and eventual cell death to produce therapeutic effects [

 <xref rid="B111-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Considering that many clinical drugs react in stoichiometric equivalents with their biomolecular targets, which may require high dosages to deliver desired therapeutic efficacy and potentially lead to severe side effects, the intracellular catalysis strategy offers many advantages because only small quantities of the catalytic metallodrug would be needed to attain the same therapeutic effect, thus translating to lower drug dosages and minimal side effects [
