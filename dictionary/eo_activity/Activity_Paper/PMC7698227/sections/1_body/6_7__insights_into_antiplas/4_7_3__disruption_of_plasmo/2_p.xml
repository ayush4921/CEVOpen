<p>In malaria research, targeting biochemical processes by intracellular catalysis is still nascent. However, there are representative PGM complexes in the literature, some of which are discussed in this review, reported to catalyse the transformation of biomolecules such as NAD
 <sup>+</sup> and NADH, in an attempt to demonstrate their ability to perturb the associated biochemical process as a possible antiplasmodial mode of action. Studies by Melis et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Stringer et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] investigated the ability of quinolinyl Ir(III)Cp* and Rh(II)Cp* complexes to disrupt the transfer hydrogenation cycle of enzyme cofactors NAD
 <sup>+</sup>/NADH, a crucial biochemical process, via intracellular catalysis as a possible mechanistic modality to explain their antiplasmodial activity. The assay employed to realise this study is based on the principle of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) method first reported by Makler and associates, which has become a mainstay for detecting the antiplasmodial activity of bioactive compounds in vitro [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. In this protocol, NADH is utilised by pLDH to produce pyruvate from lactate while simultaneously reducing co-factor APAP
 <sup>+</sup> into APAPH, which can convert a tetrazolium dye to blue formazan, thereby allowing monitoring of pLDH activity and growth of parasitaemia, as the two are closely linked. NADH can also reduce a tetrazolium dye to blue formazan in a similar manner to APAPH. In the modified procedure for detecting potential intracellular catalysis of the complexes, transformation of NADH to NAD
 <sup>+</sup> in the presence of a catalytic PGM complex (and sodium formate as hydride source) was detected by following the absorbance of blue formazan formed from yellow tetrazolium dye in the reduction process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f025">Figure 25</xref>). In all cases, the formation of blue formazan was detected, and the measured absorbance was proportionate to the concentration of complexes, suggesting positive catalysis of the NAD
 <sup>+</sup>/NADH transfer hydrogenation cycle by the complexes.
