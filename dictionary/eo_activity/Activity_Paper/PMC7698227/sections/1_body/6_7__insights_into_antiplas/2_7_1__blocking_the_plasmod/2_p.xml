<p>Several antiplasmodial PGM organometallic complexes have been explored for the inhibition of the hemozoin pathway with selected iridium [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] complexes already discussed in this review showing positive inhibitory activity. These were investigated employing the detergent-mediated β-hematin bioassay developed by Ncokazi and Egan, an invaluable tool in detecting and measuring inhibition of the plasmodial heme biocrystallization process by antimalarial agents [

Although many complexes evaluated for the blockade of this pathway were less potent than the clinical antimalarial drug, chloroquine, their β-hematin inhibition activity was in agreement with their antiplasmodial effects against the tested

 <bold>66b</bold>, as well as ferroquine- and chloroquine-derived Ru(II), Rh(II), and Rh(I) complexes, were superior hemozoin inhibitors to the control drug (CQ) [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, a direct correlation between antiplasmodial activity and hemozoin inhibition could be discerned for the quinolinyl complexes [
