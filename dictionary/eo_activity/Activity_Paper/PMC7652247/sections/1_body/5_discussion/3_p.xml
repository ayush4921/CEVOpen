<p>Results in this study also indicated that the methanol plant extract of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> is more lethal compared to the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 at all concentrations. According to 
 <xref rid="b2-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)
 </xref>, the effectiveness of plant extracts depends on the phyto-constituent composition and type of solvent chosen for the extraction. This can be explained by the present of different level of secondary metabolites in the different extracts. Also, phenolic and tannins contents were higher in methanol extract compared to aqueous extract (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The variation in the types and quantity of secondary metabolites between the aqueous and methanol extract might be attributed to the difference in the polarity of the two solvents. Water extracts only polar compounds because it is purely a polar solvent whereas methanol which is a polar as well as none polar solvent and extracted both polar and none polar compounds. The polar and none polar characteristic of methanol enables it to extract more varieties of secondary metabolites than water as suggested by 
 <xref rid="b7-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Dailey and Vuong (2015)</xref>. In addition, the nonpolar characteristic of methanol also enables it to dissolve the nonpolar cell walls of the plants to release more quantity and varieties of secondary metabolites (

 </xref>). The presence of saponins, tannins, flavonoids, and other phenolic compounds in the extracts of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> might have been responsible for its anthelmintic activity based on the previous reports on the anthelmintic roles of these compounds. For instance, tannins interfere with energy phosphorylation inhibited in the nematodes thereby leading to energy depletion and starvation of the nematode and might eventually lead to paralysis and death of the nematode. Tannins also bind to the free protein of the nematode to form a complex as well as other structures in the nematode such as cuticle, digestive, reproductive tract thereby interfering with their normal functions. Tannins might also inhibit egg hatch and larval development (
