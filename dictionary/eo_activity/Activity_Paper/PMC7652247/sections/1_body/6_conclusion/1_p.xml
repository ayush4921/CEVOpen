<p>The different extracts of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> were studied for their secondary metabolites, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents in addition to anthelmintic potential against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 an ivermectin-resistant strain. Both extracts showed significant anthelmintic activities in all different concentrations. Methanol extract exhibited highest anthelmintic activity as well as more phenolic and tannins contents in comparison with the aqueous extract. Therefore, the results obtained support that 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> as potential source of anthelmintic compounds and activities that could be used for an alternative for the anthelmintic treatment. Further research work will focus on the isolation and characterisation of secondary metabolites responsible for anthelmintic activities.
