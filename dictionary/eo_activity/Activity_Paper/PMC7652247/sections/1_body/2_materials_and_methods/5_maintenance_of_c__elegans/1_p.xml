 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Bristol N2 and 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 were supplied by 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> Genetic Center (CGC) USA. Synchronised populations of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was used for this investigation as recommended by 
 <xref rid="b5-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Baugh (2013)</xref>. The synchronised population of the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was obtained by adding 5 mL of fresh alkaline bleaching solution (a mixture of 1N NaOH and hypochlorite in the ratio of 1:2) to 1 mL of a mixture of gravid adults and eggs from old culture plates in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. The content was mixed by shaking for about 5 min until most of the bacteria and the adult worms were dissolved. The bleaching process was stopped by the addition of 8 mL of M9 solution (3 g KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO, 6 g Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>2</sub>, 6 g NaCl and 1 M Mg SO
 <sub>4</sub> in 1 L of distilled water) to the content. Centrifugation of the content was carried out at 1500 rpm and the clear supernatant was aspirated. The pelleted content was re-suspended in M9 solution shaken and the centrifugation was repeated. The eggs obtained were transferred to a fresh Nematodes Growth Medium (NGM) plate (mixtures of 3 g NaCl 17 g agar and 2.5 g of Bacto peptone in 1000 mL of distilled water autoclaved and 1 m IM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mL 5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> cholesterol, 1 mL 1 M MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 25 mL 1M KPO
 <sub>4</sub> buffer, all autoclaved except for cholesterol were added). The plate was incubated in an incubator shaker at 20°C overnight before the L1 larvae were observed after 24 h (

 <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and incubated over night at 2°C and the L4 larvae observed after about 30 h (
