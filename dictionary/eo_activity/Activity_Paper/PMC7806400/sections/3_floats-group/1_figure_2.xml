  <p>ZSD inhibited inflammation mediated by MSU in rats. ((a)–(d)) The levels of TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
   <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 in rat serum were determined via ELISA. (e) The activity of articular elastase in the rat ankle joint was evaluated with the neutrophil elastase (ELA2) detection kit. Results were presented as means ± SD. ((f)–(i)) The mRNA levels of TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
   <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 in the rat ankle joint were assessed by qRT-PCR. 
   <italic>β</italic>-Actin was used as an internal reference. (j) The expressions of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, cleaved caspase-1, pro-IL-1
   <italic>β</italic>, and IL-1
   <italic>β</italic> were detected by western blotting. 
   <italic>β</italic>-Actin was used as an internal reference. Results were presented as means ± SD.
