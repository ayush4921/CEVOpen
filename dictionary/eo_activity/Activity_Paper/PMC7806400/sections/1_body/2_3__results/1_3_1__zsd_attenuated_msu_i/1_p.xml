<p>To evaluate the extent of swelling, the thickness of the right paw was detected in control and treated rats. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>, MSU injection strongly increased the right paw thickness at 24, 48, and 72 h. However, ZSD administration significantly decreased the thickness in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, the MSU-mediated rats developed the swelling of the right paw, whereas pretreatment with ZSD obviously attenuated this process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Furthermore, ankle joints were stained with H&amp;E and visualized via using a microscope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). It was found that administration of MSU induced GA, while ZSD treatment widened the joint space and reduced the infiltration of the inflammatory cell and cartilage erosion. The scores for joint space, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage erosion were also remarkably lowered by ZSD in the ankle joint of MSU-treated rats (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(f)</xref>). These results suggested that ZSD inhibited MSU-induced GA.
