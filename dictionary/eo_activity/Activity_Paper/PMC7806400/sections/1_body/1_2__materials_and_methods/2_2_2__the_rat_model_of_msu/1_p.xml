<p>The preparation of MSU crystals was according to the previous method [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ZSD preparation and dose selection referenced the previous article [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The rats were randomly assigned into five groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). First, ZSD (10 or 20 or 40 mg/kg/day; identified as MSU + ZSD-L, MSU + ZSD-M, and MSU + ZSD-H, respectively) was infused to the stomach of rats for 7 consecutive days. One hour after the 7th day of administration, rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, and then MSU (10 mg/mL) was injected into the right ankle joint of rats. Next, the thickness of the right paw in rats was measured by using a vernier caliper for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after MSU injection, respectively. Then, after the injection of MSU for 72 h, the swelling of the right paw in each group was observed and photographed. Finally, rats were anesthetized and sacrificed. Blood was sampled from the caudal vein of rats, and serum was separated and stored at −80°C until biochemical detection. The ankle synovial tissues were fixed and frozen used for subsequent experiments.
