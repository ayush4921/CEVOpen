<p>Total RNA was isolated from ankle joint tissue utilizing the TRIpure reagent (RP1001, BioTeke, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA, and subsequently, qRT-PCR was performed by ExicyclerTM 96 Real-Time PCR System (BIONEER, Korea) with SYBR Green (SY1020, Solarbio Science and Technology, China). Reaction conditions were as follows: step 1: 94°C for 5 min, step 2: 94°C for 10 s, step 3: 60°C for 20 s, and step 4: 72°C for 30 s and 40 cycles of 72°C for 2.5 min, 40°C for 1.5 min, melting 60°C to 94°C (1°C/s), and 25°C for 1-2 min. 
 <italic>β</italic>-Actin was used as the internal control. The PCR results were quantified via the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. The primer sequences used in this study were purchased from Genscript Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Nanjing, China) and are listed in
