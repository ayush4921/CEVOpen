<p>In this study, our pathological results showed that ZSD markedly reduced the thickness and swelling degree of the right paw and inflammatory cell infiltration. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of ZSD on MSU-mediated GA in rats were validated with reference to proinflammatory factors, articular elastase, and some indicators related to OS. Noticeably, the role of ZSD in MSU-induced autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway was investigated.</p>
