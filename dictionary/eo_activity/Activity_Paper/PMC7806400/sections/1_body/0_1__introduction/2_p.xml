<p>Zisheng Shenqi Decoction (ZSD) has been developed from Liuwei Dihuang (LWDH), a classic traditional Chinese herbal formula that includes six common herbs: 
 <italic>Radix Rehmanniae</italic> (Dihuang; prepared root of 
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic>), 
 <italic>Rhizoma dioscoreae</italic> (Shanyao; rhizome of 
 <italic>Dioscorea opposita</italic>), 
 <italic>Fructus corni</italic> (Shanzhuyu; fruit of 
 <italic>Cornus officinalis</italic>), 
 <italic>Cortex moutan radicis</italic> (Mudanpi; root bark of 
 <italic>Paeonia suffruticosa</italic>), 
 <italic>Rhizoma Alismatis</italic> (Zexie; rhizome of 
 <italic>Alisma plantago-aquatica</italic>), and 
 <italic>Poria</italic> (Fuling; sclerotia of 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, ZSD mainly consists of five medicinal herbs such as 
 <italic>Amomum villosum</italic> (Fructus Amomi, Sha Ren), 
 <italic>Achyranthes bidentata</italic> (Radix Cyathulae, Huai Niu Xi), 
 <italic>Semen Plantaginis</italic> (plantain seed, Che Qian Zi), 
 <italic>Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae</italic> (Glabrous Greenbrier Rhizome, Tu Fu Ling), and 
 <italic>Dioscorea septemloba</italic> (Sevenlobed Yam Rhizome, Bi Xie). ZSD was found to improve the kidney, remove dampness, contribute to blood circulation, and mitigate pain [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It was discovered that ZSD could effectively attenuate MSU crystal-mediated GA in rats via lowered production of IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and NOD-like receptor proteins (NLRP1 and NLRP6) and elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanism that ZSD relieved MSU-induced GA has not been fully illuminated.
