<p>Excessive alcohol intake, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and the use of medications are capable of increasing the risk of gout [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Gout is a metabolic disease involved in joint pain, fatigue, and high fever, second only to diabetes in China [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The previous report indicated that the gout incidence was 1.14% in the coastal cities of Shandong province [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Gout prevalence was closely related to age, especially in men more than 40 years old, concomitant with metabolic syndrome [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Gouty arthritis (GA) is an acute inflammatory response caused by formation and precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the articular and surrounding joints with high disability rate, which is the most common first clinical manifestation in gout [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Varieties of proinflammatory indicators such as tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), interleukin-1
 <italic>β</italic> (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>), IL-6, and IL-18 release are exacerbated through the deposition of MSU crystals, thereby resulting in intense pain and swelling, as well as articular inflammation [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, mast cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils take part in gouty inflammatory response. Among them, mast cells are associated with the early phase of MSU-induced inflammation [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Macrophages have a crucial role in the recognition of MSU [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Neutrophil influx in the synovium is the most important character of GA. Accumulation of neutrophils and synovial cells induces lysis of the membrane, which in turn generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and facilitates lysosome release [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Until now, although colchicine, corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely utilized for the treatment of GA, they still have some side effects containing renal toxicity, gastritis, and gastrointestinal bleeding [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is vital to seek for novel and curative drugs to prevent and treat GA.
