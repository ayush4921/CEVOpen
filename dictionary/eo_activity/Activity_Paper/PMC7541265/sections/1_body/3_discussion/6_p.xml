<p id="Par65">In therapeutic applications, secondary metabolites are significant as they often demonstrate among others, efficacy against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Thus, secondary metabolites from Isolate 1-
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CP043328.1 were extracted and antibacterial potency of the extract was evaluated against the selected bacteria. The extract showed a broad-spectrum activity against all tested bacterial strains (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). It was more pronounced against Gram positive bacterial strains. Gram-negative bacteria, in addition to a thin peptidoglycan layer (2 to 7 nm), do possess approximately 7 to 8 nm of the outer membrane. This outer membrane consists of an additional protective lipopolysaccharide layer that exhibits toxicity and antigenicity against antibacterial agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It was therefore concluded that the resistance shown by the Gram-negative bacteria as compared to Gram-positive bacteria to the extract was as the result of the mechanism of action of this layer. Gram positive bacteria do not possess this layer and therefore they were highly sensitive to the extract. Gram positive bacteria allowed the direct contact of the extract constituents with the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, enabling the extract to inhibit bacterial growth easily. Microbial and plant extracts that have noteworthy antibacterial activities are those with MIC values less than 1 mg/ml [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Thus, the profound activity of the extract suggests the potential use as a therapeutic agent since it demonstrated MIC values in a range of 0.098–0.391 mg/ml against the selected pathogens. Moreover, it is interesting to note that ciprofloxacin had higher MIC value (25 mg/ml) against the tested strains when compared to the extract. This implied that that the bacterial strains had developed ciprofloxacin resistance and affirms the need for novel antibacterial agents. Furthermore, the extract exhibited bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 25925) with the MBC of 25 mg/ml.
