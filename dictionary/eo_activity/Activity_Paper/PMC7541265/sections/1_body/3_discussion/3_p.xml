<p id="Par62">Currently, microorganisms are attracting an increasing attention as source of for new enzymes because enzymes derived from microbes are relatively stable and active than corresponding enzymes derived from plants or animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the study, the qualitative analysis of enzyme production namely; protease, cellulase, esterase and amylase was done. Most of the isolate tested positive for enzyme production. Our observations are in agreement with previous reports that illustrated endophytes such as 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. as producers of extracellular amylase, esterase, cellulose and proteinase [
