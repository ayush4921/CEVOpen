<p id="Par56">Microdilution method was used to investigate the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of the extract. MIC of the secondary metabolites ranged from 0.098 mg/ml to 0.39 mg/ml. The profound antibacterial activity of the extract was against the Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (ATCC 10102) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 25925) with MIC value of 0.098 mg/ml (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Although the extract was more pronounced against Gram positive bacterial strains, it also did demonstrate remarkable antibacterial activity against Gram negative bacteria 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) and 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> (ATCC 25933) with the MIC of 0.39 mg/ml. Moreover, ciprofloxacin showed higher MIC value (25 mg/ml) against the tested strains when compared to the extract. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extract was evaluated against the selected bacterial strains. The extract showed only bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 25925) with the MBC of 25 mg/ml (Table
