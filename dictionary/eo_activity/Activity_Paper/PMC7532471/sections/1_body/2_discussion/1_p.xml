<p id="Par20">In the present study, the investigation of ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from leaves and methanol extract from rhizomes of 
 <italic>Amomum nilgiricum</italic> revealed the presence of various phytoconstituents, including flavonoids, carbohydrates, anthocyanin, cardiac glycosides, tannins, phenols, amino acids, alkaloids, anthroquinone, steroids, proteins, terpenoids, leucoanthocyanin, phytosterols, saponins and diterpenes. These bioactive phytoconstituents could be responsible for the therapeutic ability of various extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic>. The analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), one of the most widely used techniques for separation of phytoconstituents. The GC–MS investigation of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> leaves and rhizome extracts revealed the presence of 25 phytochemical compounds, which could contribute to the medicinal properties of this plant species
