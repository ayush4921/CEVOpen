<p id="Par23">From the above evidences, it can be elucidated that 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> plant consists of enormous potential of pharmacological constituents, therapeutic phytocompounds responsible for various pharmacological actions like antimicrobial, antioxidant anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, analgesic, antiaging, anticancer, hepatoprotective, hypercholesterolemic, antihistaminic, antiandrogenic, antifibrinolytic, diuretic, antiasthma activities, preservative etc. These major chemical compounds identified from different crude extracts are considered to be a part of plantsâ€™ defense systems and they may be grouped as protective compounds found in this plant referring to them as 'phytoanticipins' and 'phytoprotectants'

 </sup>. Thus, the identification of a various phytochemical compounds from ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from leaves and rhizomes of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> display significant medicinal properties of the plant 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic>. Further studies like bio-prospecting are essential to support its biological properties and biological importance of these innovative bio-molecules will be interesting to be studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on GC and MS investigation of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> leaf and rhizome extracts.
