<p id="Par26">The fresh leaves and rhizomes of 
 <italic>Amomum nilgiricum</italic> (V.P. Thomas &amp; M. Sabu) were collected from Western Ghats region of Palakkad district Kerala, India (11° 03′ 15.46" N, 076° 32′ 23.58" E) at altitude of 1150 m above mean sea level during 2017. The freshly collected leaves were thoroughly washed in running tap water and rinsed in distilled water before they were cut into small bits, then shade-dried at room temperature for 10 days, powdered using laboratory blender and preserved in 1000 ml air tight bottle. The dry leaf powder samples (100 g/each) were individually extracted with ethyl acetate and methanol solvents (500 mL) in a Soxhlet apparatus for 8 h respectively at a temperature not beyond the boiling point of the solvents. The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and the filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator, freeze-dried in a lyophilizer, and then kept at 4 °C. Similarly, the freshly collected rhizomes were thoroughly washed in running tap water and rinsed in distilled water. Subsequently, the samples were cut into small pieces, shade-dried at room temperature for 10 days, powered and extracted with methanol in a Soxhlet unit for 8 h. The extracted samples were filtered by Whatman filter paper, and the filtrates were concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator, dried using a lyophilizer and kept at 4 °C until further use.
