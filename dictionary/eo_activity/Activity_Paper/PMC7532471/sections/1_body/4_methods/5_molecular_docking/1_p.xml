The three-dimensional (3D) structures of phytocompounds were optimized for docking conformation study. The structure-based molecular docking was performed to study the protein ligand interactions of the phytocompounds with bacterial (PDB code:5iwm), fungal (PDB code:4i9p), viral (PDB code:1rev), antioxidant (PDB code:2he3) and diabetic [α-glucosidase (PDB code:5nn3), α-amylase (PDB code:i-tasser) and aldose reductase (PDB code:4ys1)] target proteins obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (
