<p id="Par25">The present investigation was focused on identification of various bioactive compounds from the leaf and the rhizome extracts of 
 <italic>Amomum nilgiricum</italic> for the first time by GC–MS analysis. These compounds are responsible for the different therapeutic and pharmacological properties. We have also provided the evidence of leaves and rhizome extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> for its antimicrobial (phytopathogens), antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. The serverogenin acetate ([3,12-diacetyloxy-10,14-dimethyl-13-oxo-15-(5-oxo-2H-furan-3-yl)-2-oxapentacyclo[9.7.0.01,3.05,10.014,18]octadecan-7-yl] acetate) compound showed promising binding affinity toward different proteins in molecular docking experiments, and their drug-like features were demonstrated through the iGEMDOCK docking analysis. Using the serverogenin acetate compound may enable us to develop an effective drug against pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses, as well as diabetic diseases. Further investigations to determine its bioactivity, toxicity profile and clinical studies are necessary for broad-spectrum drug discovery.
