<p id="p0380">In this stage, we calculate the binding affinity (ΔG
 <sub>bind</sub>) of protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes, then compare the differences of binding free energy change (ΔΔG) between protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes.

   <p id="p0385">The binding affinity ΔG
    <sub>bind</sub> can be decomposed into three main energy terms, including the molecular mechanical gas-phase interaction energy (ΔE
    <sub>MM</sub>), desolvation energy (ΔG
    <sub>sol</sub>) and the change of conformational entropy (–TΔS). ΔE
    <sub>MM</sub> and ΔG
    <sub>sol</sub> are calculated by the MMPBSA module in Amber program. –TΔS is calculated using our in-house scripts. The entropy contribution is temperature-dependent and can be divided to two contributions: solvation entropy (
    <italic>ΔS</italic>
    <sub>
     <italic>solv</italic>
    </sub>) and conformational entropy (
    <italic>ΔS</italic>
    <sub>
     <italic>conf</italic>
    </sub>). The solvation entropy consists of the apolar and polar solvation entropy, which is typically given by an empirical formula that is proportional to the apolar and polar solvent accessible surface area differences. We use the 
    <italic>molsurf</italic> and 
    <italic>surf</italic> modules in Amber program to calculate the solvent accessible surface area. The conformational entropy is related to the change of the number of rotatable bonds during the binding process. The change of the conformational entropy is proportional to the number of the lost rotatable bonds during the binding process. The 
    <italic>conf</italic> module in Amber is used to calculate the number of the rotatable bonds. More details can be found in the previous work (
    <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). The binding affinity ΔG
    <sub>bind</sub> for a complex is the average value of 50 structural snapshots.
