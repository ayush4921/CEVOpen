<p id="p0400">We obtain a series of hit analogs from the initial hit molecule. The binding affinity of each analog compound interacting with the protein has been evaluated. Then the binding affinity changes between the protein-analogs and protein-hit complexes are calculated. A negative change of binding free energy indicates an increase in the binding affinity, while a positive change of binding free energy indicates a decrease in the binding affinity. Potential lead compounds are identified based on the rank of the changes of binding free energy. 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A shows the results of the binding affinity changes, which contain the information about the analog compound structures, fragment molecules, substituent positions, and binding affinity changes. In addition, a heatmap is plotted to graphically display the relationship between the generated analog compounds and their binding affinity changes (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). The horizontal axis represents fragment molecules, and the vertical axis represents hydrogen atoms where the fragment molecules are linked. The darker the red, the more active the compound is. The darker the blue, the less active the compound is. AILDE not only generates the analog compounds, also predict their binding poses in the protein. The binding modes of the compounds interacting with the protein are explored by analyze the complex structures (
