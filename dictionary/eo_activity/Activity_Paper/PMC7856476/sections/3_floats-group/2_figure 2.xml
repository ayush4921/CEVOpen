  <p>The complex structure file preparation</p>
  <p>(A) Illustration of selecting and deleting the irrelative atoms from the complex by Chimera software.</p>
  <p>(B) Example of renaming amino acids according to their protonated states and adding a “TER” record. The positions of proton in different protonated states are highlighted in red: HID represents histidine with hydrogen on the delta nitrogen, HIE on the epsilon nitrogen, and HIP on both nitrogens.</p>
  <p>(C) Illustration of the structure preparation by the Dock Prep module in Chimera. This module can perform some complex operations, such as deleting solvent and isolated ions, keeping only the conformation with highest occupancy, repairing missing atoms, and adding hydrogen atoms.</p>
