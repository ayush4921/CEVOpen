<p>In the past few years, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which selectively induce targeted protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, represent a new drug discovery strategy and have attracted extensive attention from medicinal chemists and pharmaceutical industry (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>). PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules, which contain a small molecule targeting the protein of interest (warhead), a small molecule capable of recruiting an E3 ligase (E3 ligand), and a linker connecting the above two moieties. In contrast to traditional occupancy-based inhibitors that have sufficient binding affinities to druggable active sites, PROTACs require only transient binding to target proteins to catalytically induce ubiquitination and degradation (
