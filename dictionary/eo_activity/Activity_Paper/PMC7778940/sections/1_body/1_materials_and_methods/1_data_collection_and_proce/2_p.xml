<p>Degradation capacity: In general, DC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration that results in a 50% targeted protein degradation) and D
 <sub>max</sub> (the maximal level of protein degradation) are utilized to quantify the power of targeted protein degradation of PROTACs. However, since a large number of PROTACs lacked the above data, the percentage degradation was also integrated into the database if it was assessed at least at two concentrations and at least two independent experiments were conducted for each concentration. Furthermore, the Western blotting (WB) figures were also collected to show the degradation capacities of PROTACs. But it should be noted that the WB figures are only displayed on the detailed information pages of PROTACs, not on the searching result pages.
