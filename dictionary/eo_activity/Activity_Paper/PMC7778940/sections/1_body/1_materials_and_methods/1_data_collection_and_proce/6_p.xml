<p>Based on the collected information of PROTACs, the structures of PROTACs were further separated into warheads, E3 ligands and linkers according to the literature and the initial structures of warheads and E3 ligands (structures before being modified and integrated into PROTACs). The biological activities of the initial structures of warheads and E3 ligands were collected from the literature and other databases, such as PubChem (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), ChEMBL (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and BindingDB (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The important physicochemical properties of linkers and the initial structures of warheads and E3 ligands were also calculated in the same way. All in all, 1662 PROTACs, 202 warheads, 65 E3 ligands and 806 linkers were collected into PROTAC-DB.
