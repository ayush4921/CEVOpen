<p>The basic data collection and processing stages of PROTAC-DB are illustrated in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The information of PROTACs was searched in PubMed using the keywords of ‘degrader* OR protac OR proteolysis targeting chimera’. The literature about small-molecule PROTACs was collected and that about peptide-based and HaloTag PROTACs was ruled out. Subsequently, the chemical structures and biological activities of PROTACs were manually extracted from the literature. The biological activities here contain the degradation capacities, binding affinities, and cellular activities. The detailed information is as follows.
