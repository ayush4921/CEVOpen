<p>Additionally, ten important physicochemical properties related to drug-likeness calculated by using the RDKit toolkit (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rdkit.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rdkit.org</ext-link>) and ALOGPS (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) were provided on the detailed information pages, including molecular weight, exact mass, partition coefficient (log 
 <italic>P</italic>), aqueous solubility (logS), heavy atom count, ring count, hydrogen bond acceptor count, hydrogen bond donor count, rotatable bond count and topological polar surface area. Furthermore, the PDB codes of the ternary crystal structures of PROTACs were also incorporated to the database.
