<p>In order to facilitate the retrieval of the data in PROTAC-DB, we provide the searching and browsing tools. As to the searching tools, PROTAC-DB can be queried with text-based and structure-based search. Text-based search serves as a simple way to search throughout PROTAC-DB by entering a single term, such as target name, compound name or ID. For structure-based search, users can input a SMILES string, upload a MOL/SDF file or sketch a molecule within the ChemDoodle editor. After the self-edited molecule has been imported, one of the three searching options (e.g.Â similarity, substructure or exact) can be chosen. In the similarity search, the bit vector Morgan fingerprint, an FCFP-like fingerprint, is utilized to compute the Tanimoto similarity between two molecules. A dataset (PROTACs, warheads, E3 ligands or linkers) can be selected for searching.</p>
