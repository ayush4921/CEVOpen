<p>The query or browsing results are displayed as a datasheet that contains the 2D structures and other information, such as compound IDs, targeted proteins and biological activities (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Clicking on the image of the structure can get an enlarged one. Besides, in order to help users to refine the search, the filtering tool based on the physicochemical properties (e.g.Â molecular weight, log 
 <italic>P</italic>, log 
 <italic>S</italic>, topological polar surface area) is provided by PROTAC-DB. The minimum and maximum values of each property in the searching results will also be displayed in the filtering tool.
