<p>Diabetes is a metabolic disease with typical hyperglycemia manifestations, such as polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, impaired vision and body weight [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With the increase of high-caloric dietary intake and sedentary lifestyle, the number of diabetic patients has increased dramatically. In light of statistics from the World Health Organization in 2016, 422 million people had diabetes in 2014, and the incidence has risen substantially since 1980 [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is no longer particularly and commonly seen in affluent areas, as the prevalence in relatively backward areas is rising even faster [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Diabetes is generally divided into four categories: type 1 diabetes (T1DM) (autoimmune 
 <italic>β</italic>-cell destruction usually accompanied by absolute insulin deficiency), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (a gradual decrease in 
 <italic>β</italic>-cell insulin secretion), gestational diabetes, and specific types of diabetes [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is a chronic disease which can damage the heart, blood vessels [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], ocular surface [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], nerves [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and musculoskeletal system [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] gradually and has become the leading cause of kidney failure [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and blindness [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Insulin injection and oral hypoglycemic agents are always used to reduce blood glucose levels. Besides, lifestyle management is also recommended fundamentally. However, because of the poor medication compliance [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and limited access of large populations to conventional antidiabetic drugs, together with the inevitable side effects and resistance of western medicine [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], patients have always been trying to find some effective natural plants, for instance, Indian Ayurvedic medicine, African traditional medicine, Japanese Kampo medicine, and Chinese herbs [
