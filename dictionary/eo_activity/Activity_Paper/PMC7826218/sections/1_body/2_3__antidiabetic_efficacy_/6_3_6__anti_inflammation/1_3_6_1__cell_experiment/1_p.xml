<p>Type 2 diabetes is considered to have a chronic low-grade inflammation state, and the increase of inflammatory factors may affect insulin signal transduction, which is related to the formation of insulin resistance [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Many reports have shown that gentisic acid 5-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-d-xyloside [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], cucurbit type triterpenes [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] identified from MC, and butanol fraction of bitter gourd extract have obvious effects on inhibiting the expression of tumor necrosis factor–
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), IL-1
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, G1p2 (gene symbol of interferon,  
 <italic>α</italic>-inducible protein), chemokine  (C−C  motif)  ligand 5 (CCL5), and other inflammatory genes in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cell [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], with a significant decrease of nitric oxide (NO) in hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of cucurbit type triterpenes is also confirmed in HepG2 cells. Seventeen cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides (1–17) isolated from MC evidently inhibit the activity of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B mediated by TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and some also suppress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expressions and stimulate PPAR-
 <italic>γ</italic> significantly [
