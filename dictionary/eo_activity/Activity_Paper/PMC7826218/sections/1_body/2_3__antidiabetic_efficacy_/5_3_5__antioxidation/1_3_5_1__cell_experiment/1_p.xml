<p>It is shown that aqueous extracts of MC pulp as well as flesh extracts are capable of preventing the accumulation of crosslinked advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and carboxymethyl lysine (CML), which is probably owing to the antioxidant characteristic, especially the total phenolic content of the extracts [

 <sub>2</sub> extraction method have great ability to clear 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, which reached up to 96.14 ± 1.02%, corresponding to the clearance rate of ascorbic acid at 1.2 mg/mL [

 <sup>2−</sup>) scavenging. On the other hand, phosphorylated MCP shows higher antioxidant activity on both ability to scavenge hydroxyl radical (HO·), O
 <sup>2−</sup>, and DPPH radical and the antilipid peroxidation and reduction ability [
