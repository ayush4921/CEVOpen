  <p>Mechanisms of MC in inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. MC agents can activate AMPK directly and indirectly to reduce glycogenolysis and PEPCK together with G-6-Pase, both of which are key enzymes of gluconeogenesis. At the same time, MC has the ability to suppress 11
   <italic>Î²</italic>-HSD1, leading to the reduction of glucocorticoids and further reducing PEPCK to inhibit gluconeogenesis.
