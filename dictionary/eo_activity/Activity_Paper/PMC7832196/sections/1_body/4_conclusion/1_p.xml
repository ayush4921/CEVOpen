<p>The results of this study indicate improved antibacterial efficacy against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 of ampicillin when supplemented with myticaganal C. The supplementation could reduce 128-fold the effective dose of ampicillin, while the supplement alone had no activity against these bacteria. Further studies are needed to evaluate the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects, as well as possible additional mechanisms underlying the antibacterial activities.
