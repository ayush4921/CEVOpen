<p>Plant secondary metabolites could enhance antibacterial activity when combined with antibiotics.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Some secondary metabolites, namely dihydrobenzofuran-type neolignans, have been associated with various activities.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These compounds have been reported as antibacterial agents against pathogens.[
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt. is an important plant source of neolignans used for preventing cancer and leishmaniasis.[

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The activity-guided fractionation of crude extract from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> seeds has led to the isolation of myticaganal C.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The effects of this compound on pathogenic bacteria have not been reported. There is no information regarding synergy of the compound extracted from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> seeds, with antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria. Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria are most commonly commensal and can also be pathogenic in humans.[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Resistant 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains to antibiotics are risky as they are the most common Gram-negative bacteria infecting humans, and there are strains with extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases.[
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This study was aimed at determining the antibacterial activities of ampicillin and myticaganal C alone and as combinations against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>.
