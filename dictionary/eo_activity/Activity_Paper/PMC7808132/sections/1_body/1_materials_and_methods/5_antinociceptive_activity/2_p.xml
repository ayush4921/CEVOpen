 </sup> Animals were categorized into different groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), that is, the positive control, negative control, and test groups. A pretest was performed for the experimental animals on a hot plate (Harvard apparatus) maintained at 55 ± 1 °C. All animals that demonstrated a latency time greater than 15 s were excluded from the study. The positive group was treated with tramadol (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and the negative control group was injected with normal saline (10 mL/kg, i.p.). The tested groups (four) were administered peshawaraquinone 1 (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, PO). Thirty minutes after the abovementioned administration, the animals were placed on the hot plate maintained at 55 ± 1 °C, and the latency time (time for which the mouse remained on the hot plate (55 ± 0.1 °C) without licking or flicking of the hind limb or jumping) was recorded in seconds. To prevent tissue harm, a cut-off time of 30 s was used for each animal. The latency time was noted for all groups at regular intervals, that is, after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.
