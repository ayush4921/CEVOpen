<p>The collected root heartwood (5 kg) of 
 <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> was kept in the shade until dried. The dried plant sample was ground and then subjected to cold extraction with methanol (20 L) for 2 weeks. The obtained methanolic extract (112.89 g) was subjected to successive fractionation using polar and nonpolar organic solvents in the order of increasing polarity as per standard procedures.

 </sup> Upon fractionation and then successive concentration on a rotary evaporator, different fractions, including hexane (9.76 g), chloroform (27.32 g), ethyl acetate (21.11 g), and methanolic fractions (25.98 g), were obtained. Based on comparative TLC, the methanolic fraction (25.98 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatographic analysis using chloroform and methanol in various proportions, which afforded 114 fractions. These collected subfractions were compiled through TLC, which yielded seven subfractions. The subfractions were subjected to a normal-phase, repeated chromatographic technique using chloroform and methanol as a solvent system (7:3), which yielded crystalline compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (90 mg; 99.87% pure). The purity of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was confirmed by TLC. The chemical structure of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (
