<p>In Pakistan, alternative medicines from 
 <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> are locally used for topical muscle relaxation and pain killer formulations. The local community uses topical oil with 
 <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> extract as one of the ingredients to relieve muscular tension and pain. This folkloric practice encouraged us to test the currently isolated molecule such as peshawaraquinone 
 <bold>1</bold>, for pain reliving, muscle coordination, and sedative effects. The testing of chemical constituents against the folklore of medicinal plants is a good push toward novel drug discovery. Even these biological experiments provide a sound background to the extract.
