<p>Pain is considered as a classic sign of the inflammation. A number of chemical mediators are released during the inflammatory process. These mediators cause nociceptive sensitization. Medicinal plants are the main source of active phytochemicals that can be utilized for the production of modern medicines.

 </sup> Natural product-derived drugs and phytomedicine are becoming popular compared to synthetic drugs because of their low cost and fewer side effects. de Oliveira 
 <italic>et al.</italic> studied the antinociceptive properties of Bergenin, a C-glucoside of 4-O-methylgallic acid that occurs naturally in several plant genera. The study showed that bergenin has consistent antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties.

 </sup> Martins 
 <italic>et al.</italic> isolated (−)-4′-methylepigallocattechin from Maytenus rigida Mart. which demonstrated the antinociceptive activity in mice.

 </sup> Rodrigues 
 <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the antinociceptive effect of three alkaloids (dihydro-piplartine, piplartine, and 3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid) and crude extracts from the fruits of 
 <italic>Piper tuberculatum</italic> J
 <sub>ACQ</sub> (Piperaceae).

 </sup> Similarly, essential oils and their monoterpenes/sesquiterpenes possess analgesic properties. Lenardão 
 <italic>et al.</italic> compiled antinociceptive of about 63 essential oils and their constituents.
