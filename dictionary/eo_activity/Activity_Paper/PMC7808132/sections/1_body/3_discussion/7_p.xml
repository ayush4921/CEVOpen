<p>It is interesting to note that SAR studies revealed that a slight change in the structure of compound can convert an agonist to antagonist. We performed docking analysis by comparing the binding poses of the compound under study with an antagonist- and agonist-binding pattern. The detailed binding-pose analysis and binding-energy calculations of our isolated compound 
 <bold>1</bold> allowed us to gain further insights into its mode of action. Structurally, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> is a structurally diverse compound with fused rings. The binding energies for agonist, tramadol, antagonist, and compound 
 <bold>1</bold> are −7.7408, 6.6084, −8.6277, and −8.8430 kcal/mol, respectively. This shows that our compound binds more tightly than the other studied compounds. As far as the binding interaction is concerned, it forms two hydrogen-bond interactions with Asp147 and Tyr326. Hydrophobic interactions were also observed with Tyr148 and Met 151. However, detailed experimental data related to the mechanism of action of structurally diverse ligands are required.
