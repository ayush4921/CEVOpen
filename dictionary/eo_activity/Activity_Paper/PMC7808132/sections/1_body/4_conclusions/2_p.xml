<p>In the current study, peshawaraquinone 1 isolated from 
 <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> demonstrated significant analgesic, sedative, and muscle relaxant effects. The traditional use of 
 <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> is mainly in massage oils, which are supposed to comfort muscular tension and pain. The traditional usage of this plant was strongly augmented by peshawaraquinone 1. Thus, our findings provide scientific rationale for the folkloric usage of 
 <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> for the treatment of various diseases. Thus, peshawaraquinone 1 is a novel candidate for additional detailed study to ascertain its clinical use. A detailed comparison of the binding orientations and binding energy values computed through docking was carried out among agonists, antagonists, and the isolated compound. The interactions of peshawaraquinone 1 with pharmacological targets suggest that the compound may act as a novel nociceptive and inflammatory pain alleviator, as supported by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.
