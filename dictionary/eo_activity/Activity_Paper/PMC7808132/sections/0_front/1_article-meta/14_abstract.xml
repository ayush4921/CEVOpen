  <italic>Fernandoa adenophylla</italic> (Wall. ex G. Don) Steenis is traditionally used to cure various diseases and can be included as an ingredient in massage oils, which are supposed to comfort muscular tension and pain. This study was designed to assess the antinociceptive, muscle relaxant, and molecular docking properties of a novel compound, namely, (5a

  <italic>H</italic>)- tetraone (peshawaraquinone), isolated from the methanolic extract of 
  <italic>F. adenophylla</italic> in an animal model. The chemical structure of the isolated compound was elucidated using advanced spectroscopic techniques and further confirmed by XRD analysis. Compound 
  <bold>1</bold> was tested against hot plate-induced noxious stimuli at various doses (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg i.p.). The muscle relaxation potency of compound 
  <bold>1</bold> was evaluated in the inclined and traction test, while the open-field test was used for the determination of sedative potential. The isolated compound was also subjected to acute toxicity analysis. The compound was then subjected to molecular docking analysis to determine the exact mechanism of action. Compound 
  <bold>1</bold> demonstrated significant (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) analgesic effect in a dose-dependent manner. A noticeable muscle relaxant effect was observed with the passage of time in both experimental models. The compound 
  <bold>1</bold> showed a significant (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) sedative effect, and in an acute toxicity study, the compound 
  <bold>1</bold> was devoid of any noxious effects. The docking studies showed preferential affinity for Î¼-opioid and GABAA receptors. Hence, the prospective antinociceptive and muscle relaxant and sedative properties are probably mediated through these two target interactions.
