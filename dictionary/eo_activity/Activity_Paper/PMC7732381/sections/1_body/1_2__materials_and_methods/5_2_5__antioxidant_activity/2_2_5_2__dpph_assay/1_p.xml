<p>The measurement of the antiradical effect of extracts from the studied lichen species was carried out by the DPPH test as described by Kosanić et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, 1 mL of extract (50–1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) was mixed with 2 mL of DPPH aliquot (0.12 mM). The reaction mixture was incubated for 25 min in the dark at ambient temperature. The absorbance of the mixture was recorded at 517 nm. The percentage of inhibition of the DPPH radical was performed using the equation given below.
