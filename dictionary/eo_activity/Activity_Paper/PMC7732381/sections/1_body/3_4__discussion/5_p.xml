<p>The high sensibility of Gram-positive bacteria might be interpreted by the fact that the structures of the cell envelope are different between both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The former has an outer membrane formed by an inner phospholipid layer surmounted by LPS (lipopolysaccharide) macromolecules which prevent the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds. Without an outer membrane, the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria can be easily permeable [
