<p>The DPPH test of lichen extracts was performed, and the obtained results are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. All lichen extracts exhibited strong scavenging ability which varied from 6.63% to 72.12% for concentrations ranged from 50 to 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, with a significant correlation with TPC (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.69). Among the tested extracts, 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> extract showed the best scavenging effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 498.40 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL), which was significantly different than 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> and 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The results also showed that the standards (ascorbic acid and Trolox) demonstrated stronger DPPH radical-scavenging activity than the tested extracts (
