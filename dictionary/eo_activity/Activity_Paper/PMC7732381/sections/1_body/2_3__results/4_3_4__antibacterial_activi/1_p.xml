<p>The antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic>, 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> extracts was evaluated by the microdilution method with resazurin vs. eleven bacterial strains including 5 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The MIC and the MBC of extracts were determined, and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. These findings revealed that all extracts exhibited a higher antibacterial effect vs. Gram-positive bacteria. However, no effect was recorded for Gram-negative bacteria. 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> exhibited an antibacterial effect with MIC values of 0.039–0.15 mg/mL and MBC 0.625 mg/mL for all strains. The extract from 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> presented a MIC ranged from 0.039 to 0.15 mg/mL and MBC from 0.625 to 2.5 mg/mL; also, the extract of 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> possessed MIC in the range of 0.078–0.625 mg/mL, while its MBC was at 0.625–1.25 mg/mL.
