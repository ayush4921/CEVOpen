 <p>
  <bold>Context:</bold>
  <italic>Satureja khuzistanica</italic> Jamzad. (Lamiaceae), is known for its antifungal and antioxidant compounds, especially rosmarinic acid (RA).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Objective:</bold> The study examines the effect of elicitors on RA production and phytochemical properties of 
  <italic>S. khuzistanica.</italic>
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Materials and methods:</bold>
  <italic>In vitro</italic> plants were treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). 
  <italic>In vivo</italic> plants were treated with MWCNTs and salicylic acid (SA). RA was measured by HPLC. Catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were quantified. DPPH and β-carotene were assayed in 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> extracts. The antifungal effects of extracts were evaluated against 
  <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> K 
  <bold>(</bold>FsK).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> The highest RA contents of 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> plants were 50 mg/L MeJA (140.99 mg/g DW) and 250 mg/L MWCNTs (140.49 mg/g DW). The highest 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> were 24 h MWCNTs (7.13 mg/g DW) and 72 h SA (9.12 mg/g DW). The maximum POD and APX activities were at 100 mg/L MeJA (5 and 4 mg protein, respectively). CAT had the highest activities at 50 mg/L MeJA (2 mg protein). DPPH and β-carotene showed 50% and 80% inhibition, respectively. The FsK aggregation was the lowest for 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> extract in number of conidia [1.82 × 10
  <sup>10</sup>], fresh weight (6.51 g) and dry weight (0.21 g) that proved RA inhibitory effects. The callus reduces FsK growth diameter to 2.75 on the 5th day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Discussion and conclusions:</bold> Application of MeJA, SA, and MWCNTSs could increase RA in 
  <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> and highlighted potential characteristics in pharmaceutical and antifungal effects.
