 <italic>In vitro</italic> techniques can accelerate biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In some cases, such as 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic>, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> culture could not be easily developed due to the seed dormancy and very low germination rate (Gupta et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the present study, we found that nodal segments culture of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> in liquid medium could dramatically enhance the RA content in this plant species and was considered as a new source of RA. Therefore, these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures concomitant with green house derived plants of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> were used as plant materials for this study. In the first part of this study, we found that the RA contents were positively influenced by different concentrations of MeJA and MWCNTs in a nodal segment culture of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic>. In accordance with these results, MeJA and MWCNTs treatments significantly increased the amount of RA in cell suspension cultures of 
 <italic>Coleus blumei</italic> Benth. (Lamiaceae) (Szabo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and callus cultures of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> (Ghorbanpour and Hadian 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), respectively. It was supposed that the high amount of RA observed 48 h after treatments, as optimum time for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of Lamiaceae plants (Krzyzanowska et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Park et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
