<p>The extracts and callus treatments demonstrated successful inhibitory impacts on the growth rate of FsK in comparison to the control. We hypothesised that reduction in FsK growth may be related to the RA inhibitory effect which was produced in plants and activated resistance mechanisms in natural condition. The same results observed in tomato plants (Garantonakis et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) confirmed our understanding. It is clear that all the extracts and callus showed an inhibitory effect on FsK aggregation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>) and diameter growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>). The lowest FsK aggregation for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> extract in number of conidia (1.82 × 1010), fresh weight (6.51 g) and dry weight (0.21 g) and on the other hand, the reduction in FsK growth diameter to 2.75 mm on 5th in callus treatments demonstrated the inhibitory effects of RA on FsK growth. These results suggested that the growth diameter and aggregation of FsK was inhibited by the callus and RA induction compared to the control. Bais et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) showed that fungal elicitors induced a rapid increase in RA production and RA was over-produced to inhibit fungal growth due to its polyphenolic properties.
