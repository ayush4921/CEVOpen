<p>Relative to the control of this experiment, the MWCNTs at the time point of 72 h suppressed the CAT activity in 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic>, which were related to the high ROS content and intense oxidative damage. Previous reports have also confirmed that the application of carbon nanomaterials caused an increase in ROS generation, which subsequently induced different detrimental effects (Dapkevicius et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Ghorbanpour and Hadian 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). According to Khodakovskaya et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) carbon nanomaterials could up-regulate the genes which were involved in stress signalling and molecular response as biotic elicitors do. The highest CAT activity ratio in plants exposed to the MWCNTs and SA treatments at the 24 h time point indicated the maximum activity of CAT enzyme and oxidative defence. Here, up-regulation of RA biosynthesis following exposure to 100 mg/L MWCNTs at the time point of 24 h was linked to the highest CAT, POD and APX activities. In contrast, a greater elevation in amount of RA was found in plants treated with SA at spraying time point of 72 h, which a rise in POD activity has been shown, might refer to the crucial role of POD in RA biosynthesis and oxidative defence. No significant differences were recorded in POD activities between 24 h and 48 h treated plants. The sudden decrease in CAT activity from 24 h to 72 h and reduction of APX activity at 72 h could be pointed to the phytotoxicity of plant at both treatments.
