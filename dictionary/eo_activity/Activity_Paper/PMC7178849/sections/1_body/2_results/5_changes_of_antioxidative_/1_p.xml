<p>In this experiment, significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were observed in CAT, POD and APX enzyme activities in 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> plants treated with 100 mg/L MWCNTs and 200 mg/L SA at different time points after treatment. CAT activity was significantly increased under both MWCNTSs and SA treatments 24 h after eliciting, while it was gradually decreased 48 and 72 h after initial elicitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A,B)</xref>). POD activity was significantly enhanced in plant extracts treated with either 100 mg/L MWCNTs or 200 mg/L SA, 24 h after initial treatment, but the activity of this enzyme was gradually decreased 48 and 72 h after MWCNTs treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>) while it was increased 72 h after SA treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(D)</xref>). The APX activity does not follow a specific pattern, was raised after 24 h under both MWCNTs and SA treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(E,F)</xref>), whereas 48 h after initial elicitation, its activity was reduced under MWCNTs treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(E)</xref>) and enhanced by SA treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(F)</xref>). The APX activity showed a significant increase, 72 h after MWCNTs treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(E)</xref>) while its activity was reduced 72 h after SA treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(F)</xref>).
