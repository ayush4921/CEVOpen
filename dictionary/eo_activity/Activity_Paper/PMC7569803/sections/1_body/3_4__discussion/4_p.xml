<p>Furthermore, polyphenolic compounds are pharmacological precursors and have been reported to be responsible for antioxidant activities in plants [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. When interacting with legume proteins, these polyphenolic compounds exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects, higher solubility, and better emulsifying capacity [

 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> in this study might be responsible for the antioxidant activities demonstrated. Although the ABTS and DPPH radical assays share a similar mechanism of action, both were excellent tools for assessing the capacity of the crude extracts to donate labile hydrogen atoms to inhibit oxidation [

 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Compared with rutin and gallic acid, the stronger radical scavenging capacities of 
 <italic>M. pruriens</italic>, especially at the low concentrations used in this study, agrees with early reports that the plant exhibits dose-dependent scavenging ability of hydroxyl radicals [
