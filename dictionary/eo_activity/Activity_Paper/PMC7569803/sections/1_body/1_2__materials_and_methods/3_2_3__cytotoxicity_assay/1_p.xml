<p>HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 5 mM of L-glutamine (Lonza) and then fortified with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 96-well plate at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well for 24 h in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified chamber. The cytotoxicity of the extract was assessed by subsequently exposing the HeLa cells to 50 µg/mL of crude extracts at a fixed concentration in the 96-well microplate for 48 h. The number of cells that survived the drug treatment was determined using the resazurin-based reagent and by reading resorufin fluorescence in a Spectramax M3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, CA, USA) The results were expressed as percentage viability in resorufin fluorescence-treated extracts per well, using the untreated wells as controls. The cytotoxic effect of the plant extracts was measured in duplicates, and emetine was used as the positive control for reference purposes.
