<p>The antimalaria experiment was performed as described [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01249" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this assay, malaria parasites (
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> strain 3D7) were preserved in RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mM Hepes and 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza). About 5% Albumax II, 20 mM glucose, 0.65 mM hypoxanthine, 60 µg/mL gentamycin, and 2–4% hematocrit human red blood cells were added to the medium. Thereafter, the parasites were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 90% N
 <sub>2,</sub> 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a closed T75 culture flask. Then, 25 µg/mL of crude extracts of 
 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> was combined with the parasite cultures prepared in a 96-well microplate and incubated in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator maintained at 37 °C for 48 h. Thereafter, 20 µL of the incubated mixture was taken from each well and added to 125 µL of Malstat and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)/ phenazine ethosulfate (PES) solutions mixed in a new microplate. The activity of the parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) enzyme component of the cultures was measured in Malstat and NBT/PES solutions. The formation of a purple product revealed by a Spectramax M3 microplate reader at 620 nm indicated the presence of pLDH and, thus, the number of parasites present.
