<p>Ethanol of standard analytical grade and distilled water were used for extraction. The two solvents were selected due to the well-known pharmacological effects of ethanol and food value of water. More so, water and ethanol are reported to be common extractants of

 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pruriens</italic> was transferred in conical flasks filled with 500 mL each of water and ethanol. The conical flasks and their contents were shaken in an orbital incubator shaker (Gallenkamp &amp; Co. Ltd., London, England) for 48 h. Thereafter, the crude extracts were filtered through a Whatman No. 1 filter paper placed in a Buchner funnel connected to an electric vacuum pump. The aqueous filtrate obtained was chilled in a refrigerant set at −40 °C (Poly-Science AD15R-40-A12E-USA; Serial No: 1C1490106) and concentrated to dryness with a freeze dryer (Savant vapour trap, RV-T41404, San Diego, CA, USA) for 24 h. A rotary evaporator (LABOROTA 4000 Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany; Serial No: 090409460) set at 78 °C was also used to concentrate the ethanolic filtrate to dryness. The prepared extracts were then stowed in sterile bottles kept at 4 °C in a refrigerator until further use.
