<p>The plant extract showed high scavenging activity in the DPPH free radical assay, comparable to those of the standard drugs used. At all concentrations, gallic acid showed the highest activity, while the scavenging activity of the extracts was higher than that of rutin at lower concentrations (0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 mg/mL) of crude extracts but lower than that of rutin at the highest concentration of crude extracts, corresponding to 0.04 mg/mL (
