<p id="Par63">Phytochemical investigations of the root barks of 
 <italic>Entandrophragma congoense</italic> (Meliaceae) harvested from Kenya, led Happi et al. to the isolation of the novel apotirucallane triterpenoids with antiplasmodial activities; prototiamins A–F (
 <bold>134</bold>–
 <bold>139</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref>), as well as the known lupeone (
 <bold>140</bold>), prototiamin G (
 <bold>141</bold>) and seco-tiaminic acid A (
 <bold>142</bold>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The obtained compounds (
 <bold>134</bold>–
 <bold>142</bold>) were also evaluated against the CQ-sensitive strain NF54. Compound 
 <bold>134</bold> displayed strong selectivity for the NF54 strain against rat skeletal myoblast L6 cells (with a selectivity index of 104.7), while 
 <bold>136</bold> and 
 <bold>138</bold> had selective indices of 12 and 13, respectively. Compounds 
 <bold>135</bold>, 
 <bold>137</bold>, 
 <bold>139</bold>, and 
 <bold>140</bold> were active against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 μM, and were less selective, while compound 
 <bold>142</bold> inhibited the strain with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 19.3 μM.
