<p id="Par71">Irungu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] also examined the stem bark of 
 <italic>Turraea nilotica</italic> (Meliaceae) growing in Kenya. Three known potent anti-malarial protolimonoids; niloticin (
 <bold>168</bold>), hispidol B (
 <bold>169</bold>) and piscidinol A (
 <bold>170</bold>) were isolated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig35" ref-type="fig">35</xref>). These compounds exhibited activities against the D6 strain with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 36.8 to 48.2 µM and against the W2 strain, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 37.2 to 77.0 µM [
