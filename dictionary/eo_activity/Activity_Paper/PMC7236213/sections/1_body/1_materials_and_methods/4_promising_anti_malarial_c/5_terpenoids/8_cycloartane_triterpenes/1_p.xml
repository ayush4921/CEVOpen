<p id="Par64">The plant species 
 <italic>Neoboutonia macrocalyx</italic> (Euphorbiaceae) is traditionally used to treat malaria in Southwestern Uganda around Kibale National Park, where the stem bark is widely used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The investigation of the stem bark of this plant by Namukobe et al. led to the isolation nine new cycloartane triterpenes, among which eight; neomacrolactone (
 <bold>143</bold>), 22α-acetoxyneomacrolactone (
 <bold>144</bold>), 6-hydroxyneomacolactone (
 <bold>145</bold>), 22α-acetoxy-6-hydroxyneomacrolactone (
 <bold>146</bold>), 6,7-epoxyneomacrolactone (
 <bold>147</bold>), 22α-acetoxy-6,7-epoxyneomacrolactone (
 <bold>148</bold>), 4-methylen-neomacrolactone (
 <bold>149</bold>), and neomacroin (
 <bold>150</bold>), Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig30" ref-type="fig">30</xref>, displayed anti-malarial properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The obtained compounds were also evaluated for antiplasmodial activity against the FcB1/Colombia strain and for cytotoxicity against the KB (nasopharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma) and MRC-5 (human diploid embryonic lung) cells. Compounds (
 <bold>143</bold>–
 <bold>147</bold>, 
 <bold>149</bold>,
 <bold>150</bold>) exhibited antiplasmodial activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of &lt; 11 μM [
