<p id="Par69">Bero et al. also isolated the known ursolic acid (
 <bold>162</bold>) and oleanolic acid (
 <bold>160</bold>) from the twigs of 
 <italic>Keetia leucantha</italic> (Rubiaceae). The authors re-tested the compounds, showing them to have in vitro activities on the 3D7 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 32.4 and 59.4 µM, respectively [

 <italic>Mimusops caffra</italic> (Sapotaceae) growing in South Africa, ursolic acid acetate (
 <bold>163</bold>) and 3-oxo-ursolic acid (
 <bold>164</bold>), as well as the known compound 
 <bold>162</bold> were isolated by Simelane et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. These three compounds showed promising in vitro activities against the D10 strain with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.81 to 15.54 μM [
