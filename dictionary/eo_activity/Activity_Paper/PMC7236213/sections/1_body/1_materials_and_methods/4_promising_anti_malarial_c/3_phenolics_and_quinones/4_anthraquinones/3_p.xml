<p id="Par47">The medicinal plant 
 <italic>Aloe pulcherrima</italic> (Asphodelaceae) is one of the endemic 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species traditionally used for the treatment of malaria and wound healing in Central, Southern, and Northern Ethiopia, although the detailed mode of usage is not properly described in the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Three compounds, chrysophanol (
 <bold>94</bold>), aloesaponarin I (
 <bold>95</bold>) and aloesaponarin II (
 <bold>96</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>), were isolated from the acetone root extracts by Abdissa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The evaluation of their in vitro anti-malarial activities revealed moderate activity against D6 and W2 strains with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 19.66 to 82.80 μM and from 64.46 to 141.95 μM, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Knipholone (
 <bold>86</bold>) was also tested again from the leaves of 
 <italic>Kniphofia foliosa</italic> (Asphodelaceae) by Feilcke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], showing significant antiplasmodial activity against the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.9 μM.
