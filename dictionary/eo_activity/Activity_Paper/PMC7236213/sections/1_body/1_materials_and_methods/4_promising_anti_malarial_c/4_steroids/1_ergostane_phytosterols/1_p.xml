 <italic>S</italic>-dihydroxyergosta-4,24(28)-dien-3-one (
 <bold>111</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref>), were isolated from the stem bark of 
 <italic>Antrocaryon klaineanum</italic> (Anacardiaceae) by Douanla et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The crude extracts and the isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro against the 3D7 and W2 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. While the crude extract showed moderate activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.7 µg/mL) against 3D7, the three steroids exhibited potent activity against both strains with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 22.0, 11.2 and 21.3 µM, respectively, against the same strain.
