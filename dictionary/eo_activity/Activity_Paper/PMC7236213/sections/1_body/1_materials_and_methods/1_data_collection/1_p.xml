<p id="Par16">In this review, an attempt has been made to document the anti-malarial activities of NPs derived from African medicinal plants. The data was based on the current version of the African compound libraries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which are constantly being updated based on inputs from journal articles and student theses (M.Sc/Ph.D.) available in African University libraries. Emphasis was laid on data published after 2012. The original data collection, now being included in the African Compounds Database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.african-compounds.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.african-compounds.org</ext-link>), was conducted from querying individual journal websites using the country names in Africa and search terms. The list of journals visited have been included in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The “hit” articles were retrieved, i.e. those for which plant materials were collected from Africa were then hand-picked by reading through the “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>“ section to ensure that the plant materials were from Africa. Student theses were also randomly collected as made available from university libraries, constituting a small portion of the data. The folder containing the retained articles/theses was further queried with the search terms “malaria”, “malarial”, “plasmodium”, “plasmodial” and a combination of them. Those for which compounds further showed anti-malarial activities published between 2013 and 2019 and for which the measured activities fell within the established cut-off values were selected and included as relevant references. The compounds displaying anti-malarial properties were classified according to their NP classes and source species of origin. This represented 187 compounds from 45 species belonging to 23 plant families.
