<p>Many studies documented that EO of sweet basil have antifungal, insecticidal (Hossain et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), antibacterial, and antioxidant (Karag√∂zl et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) properties. The chemical composition of sweet basil EO depends on genetic, season, environmental factors, and the plant growth stage (Bilal et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Padalia et al. (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) has reported linalool, methyl chavicol, methyl eugenol, eugenol, and geraniol as dominant components in the basil EO. Since there is limited information about the suitability of medicinal plants especially sweet basil as intercrops in maize in Iran, therefore this study was conducted to evaluate biological yield, yield and chemical composition of sweet basil EO treated with nitrogen fertilizers (N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria, chemical and integrated) in additive intercropping with forage maize.
