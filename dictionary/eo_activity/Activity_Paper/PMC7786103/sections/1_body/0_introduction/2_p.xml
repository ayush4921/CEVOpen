<p>The utilization of bio-fertilizers (e.g., free-living N-fixing bacteria) is of particular importance in the agriculture sector due to their potential role in healthy food, improving crop yield, and decreasing greenhouse emissions (Ghilavizadeh et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Raei et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Raei et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) showed that the seeds of sweet basil inoculated with

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) showed that inoculating the seeds of fennel with
