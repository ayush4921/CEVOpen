<p>In industrial agriculture, one of the major ways to increment livestock production is to utilization a diet having some cereal grains such as maize and barley, or silage plants and many types of concentrates containing dietary supplements and chemical content designed to stimulate animal growth and prevent diseases. The improper application of these compounds is associated with outbreaks of many metabolic diseases such as liver abscesses and acidosis in ruminants, and finally causes many problems (Kordi et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Nowadays, these problems have led to organic crops production is considered as an option to decrement the negative effects of chemical fertilizers (Aguilera et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Aires et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In some countries where organic agriculture is practiced, emphasis has been placed on availability of some medicinal plants such as chicory (
 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic> L.) and caraway (
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L.) in pasture that is grazed by livestock for naturally meeting their medicinal needs (Kordi et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In this regard, “medicinal forage” idea was introduced. From the standpoint of forage value, although some medicinal plants fed solitarily to livestock have resulted in forage unpalatability or with high amounts of anti-nutritional compounds (such as coumarin, phenolic compounds, and prussic acid), intercropping with ordinary forage plants gives them high value as medicinal forage through efficient, scientific management (Kordi et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Intercropping fodder plants with medicinal plants, in addition to enhancing productivity, can remarkably reduce the population of weeds, pests, and diseases and increase plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. By intercropping sweet basil with maize, Kordi (
