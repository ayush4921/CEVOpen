<p>The data presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> showed that among the different intercropping systems the highest fresh and dry yields of maize were obtained from sole cropping pattern. Among the different intercropping systems, sole cropping pattern in terms of dry yield of maize had no significant difference with maize + 25% basil treatment. Due to high plant density of basil intercropped with maize and competition for water and nutrients, the fresh and dry yields of maize in maize + 100% basil pattern was apparently decreased as compared to maize's monoculture. Best utilization of nutrients, moisture, space, and solar energy can be derived through mono cropping system (Aiyer, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>). Bagheri et al. (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reported that fresh and dry weight of leaves, stem, and ear in sole culture of maize were more than intercrops. Increasing the proportions of sweet basil and/or borage decreased the weight of leaves, stem, and ear of maize. Higher yield of sole culture compared to intercrop may be due to minimal disruption of the plants habitat (Banik et al.,
