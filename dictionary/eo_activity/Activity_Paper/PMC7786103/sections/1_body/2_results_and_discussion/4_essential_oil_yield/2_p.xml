In other words, the contribution of EO content to increased yield of EO per area was lower than that of in biological yield of crops. This experiment confirmed the hypothesis that application of nitrogen chemical fertilizer and integrated 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer could increase yield of EO of sweet basil, mainly due to increase in biological yield. The availability of nitrogen enhances the rate of photosynthesis and enables the plant to grow rapidly and produced significant biomass, which may increase accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as EO (Sifola and Barbieri,
