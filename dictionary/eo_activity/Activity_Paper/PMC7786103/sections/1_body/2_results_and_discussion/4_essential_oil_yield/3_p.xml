<p>As the EO content and biological yield in second harvest were higher than those at the other two harvests, it was expected that the EO yield in second harvest to be higher than that of the others. Among three harvests of sweet basil, Jahan et al. (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) demonstrated that the highest and lowest EO yield was found in second and first harvests, respectively. It was also shown that intercropping soybean with peppermint promoted the production of peppermint's EO as compared to their sole cropping and the maximum and minimum EO content were obtained in intercropping ratio of 3:2 (1.74%) and sole cropping of peppermint (1.26%), respectively. Furthermore, the first harvest produced more EO compared to the second harvest (Amani-Machiani et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Since there is a positive correlation between EO yield and biological yield, the EO yield increased with rising density level of sweet basil plants intercropped with maize. In this respect, the maximum EO yield was attained by applying forage maize + 75% basil as well as application of
