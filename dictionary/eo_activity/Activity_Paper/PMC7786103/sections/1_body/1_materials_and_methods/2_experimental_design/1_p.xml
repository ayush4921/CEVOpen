<p>The main experimental design of this study was a factorial experiment based on Randomized Complete Blocks Design with three replications. However, due to three harvest times in each season for basil plants, the basil traits except for fresh and dry yields (which were total yield of three harvests) were statistically analyzed based on factorial split-plot-in time experiment. Fertilization factor consisted of F
 <sub>1</sub>: control (without nitrogen fertilization); F
 <sub>2</sub>: 100% chemical fertilizer (N); F
 <sub>3</sub>: nitrogen-fixing bacteria (
 <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum</italic>) and F
 <sub>4</sub>: integration of nitrogen-fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer. Cropping pattern factor included sole cropping of basil (I
 <sub>1</sub>) and the additive intercropping of maize + 25% basil (I
 <sub>2</sub>), maize + 50% basil (I
 <sub>3</sub>), maize + 75% basil (I
 <sub>4</sub>), and maize + 100% basil (I
 <sub>5</sub>) (Kordi et al.,
