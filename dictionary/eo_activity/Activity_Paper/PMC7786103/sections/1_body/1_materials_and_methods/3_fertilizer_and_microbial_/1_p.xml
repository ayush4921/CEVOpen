<p>According to soil test, 150 kg triple superphosphate ha
 <sup>−1</sup> and 50 kg potassium sulfate ha
 <sup>−1</sup> were applied before cultivation. In application of 100% chemical fertilizer (F
 <sub>2</sub>), 375 kg N ha
 <sup>−1</sup> was used as urea. The half of the nitrogen amount was added to F
 <sub>2</sub> and F
 <sub>4</sub> treatments (187.5 and 93.7 kg N ha
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively) with the last plow before sowing. The rest of the nitrogen was used in two stages: the eight-leaf stage of maize and before the start of tassel formation in the plots. The N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria were 
 <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum</italic> strains. Both strains of bacteria consisted of 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU ml
 <sup>−1</sup> inoculant which were provided from Mehr Asia Biotechnology Company, Tehran, Iran. Following cultivation, the seeds were completely soaked with the N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria and kept in the shade for half an hour in to dry and be ready for planting. The liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria (
