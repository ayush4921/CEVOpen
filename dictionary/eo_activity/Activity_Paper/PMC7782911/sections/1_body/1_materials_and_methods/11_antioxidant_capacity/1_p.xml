<p>To assess the antioxidant capacity, the wound granulation tissue was homogenized in ice-cold KCl (150 mM) and the mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was used to evaluate the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total tissue thiol molecules (TTM) content. The Lowry method was employed for evaluating the protein content of the samples (Daemi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>) and MDA content was used for assessing the lipid peroxidation rate. To assess the TTM, the collected granulation tissue sample was homogenized and the supernatant was added to Tris-EDTA as reported by Daemi et al. (
