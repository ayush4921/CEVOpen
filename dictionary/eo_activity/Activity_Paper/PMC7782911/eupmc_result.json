    "<h4>Context</h4><i>Zataria multiflora</i> Boiss (Lamiaceae) essential oil (ZME) is believed to be a bactericide herbal medicine and might alleviate negative effects of infection.<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluates the effects of an ointment prepared from ZME (ZMEO) on infected wounds.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A full-thickness excisional skin wound was surgically created in each mouse and inoculated with 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> suspension containing <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The BALB/c mice (<i>n</i> = 72) were divided into four groups: (1) negative control that received base ointment (NCG), (2) positive control that daily received Mupirocin<sup>®</sup> (MG), (3) therapeutic ointment containing 2% ZMEO and (4) therapeutic ointment containing 4% ZMEO, for 21 days. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, antioxidant activity, qRT-PCR analysis for expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, VEGF, IGF-1, TGF-β, IL-10, and FGF-2 mRNA levels were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following the wounding.<h4>Results</h4>Topical administration of ZMEO significantly decreased the total bacterial count and wound area and also expression of IL-1β and TNF-α compared to the control groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in all days. This could also increase significantly the expression of TGF-β, IL-10 IGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF, and also angiogenesis, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, epithelialization ratio, and collagen deposition and improve antioxidant status compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05).<h4>Discussion and conclusion</h4>ZMEO accelerated the healing process of infected wounds by shortening the inflammatory factors and increasing proliferative phase. Applying ZMEO only and/or in combination with chemical agents for the treatment of wound healing could be suggested."
