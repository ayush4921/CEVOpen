<p>The medicinal property of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> plant has led to exploitation of its populations in nature [
 <xref rid="B104-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Owing to the dwindling populations and inability of the seeds to germinate without mycorrhizal association [
 <xref rid="B105-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], its efficient conservation is a challenging task to accomplish. However, the successful introduction of the plant by symbiotic seed germination under in vitro conditions was achieved by Aggarwal and Zettler [
 <xref rid="B106-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Novotna et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] established seedling development of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> using 10 g dm-3 sucrose and glucose treatment. Further, treatment with N6-benzyladenine or cytokinins N6-(2-isopentenyl) adenine and their amalgamation amid auxin (IBA) helped in significant development of shoots. Several researchers carried out in vitro culturing of immature seeds for large-scale production of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> [

 <xref rid="B105-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The protocorms so formed were then cultured on rejuvenation medium with MS and BM-2 media enriched with various plant growth hormones (KN-3mg/l IBA-3 mg). For adaptation, seedlings were transferred to a blend of cocopeat, perlite, and vermiculite in the ratio of 1:1:1. The saplings formed were finally moved to a greenhouse. Plant multiplication and conservation of the plant by spliced tuber plantation were performed by Shrestha and Shrestha [
 <xref rid="B108-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Green pod culture of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> was performed by Giri and Tamta [
 <xref rid="B109-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] in different growing media such as Vejsadova (VJ), Vacin and Went (VW), Murashige and Skoog (MS), and Knudson C (KC). Better results for seed germination were obtained in MS medium enriched with activated charcoal, morpholino ethane sulphonic acid, and peptone. Due to the threat of extinction, 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> is protected in different countries, including Luxembourg, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Nepal [
 <xref rid="B110-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. As per the Forest Act 1993, Forest Regulation Act 1995, and its amendment in 2005, the collection and trade of tubers of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> is banned in Nepal. However, collection must follow the regulations for the trade of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> as per Forest Regulation 1995 and its amendment in 2005 [
