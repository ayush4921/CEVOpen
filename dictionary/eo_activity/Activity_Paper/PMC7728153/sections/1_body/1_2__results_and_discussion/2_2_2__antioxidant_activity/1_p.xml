<p>The tested extracts were evaluated for the total content of phenolics and antioxidant capacity (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05517-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The highest content of polyphenols, 50.99 mg gallic acid equivalents per dry weight (GAE/g DW), was recorded for the extract of goldenrod leaves, followed by the tansy leaves and goldenrod flowers, while yarrow leaves were the poorest in terms of these compounds (

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Results obtained for yarrow leaves widely vary, values between 2.74 and 7.92 mg GAE/g DW have been reported by Georgieva et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and between 78 and 128 μg quercetin equivalents per gram by Keser et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. There are no data available for late goldenrod (
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>) but the data available for other goldenrod species indicate a diverse species-dependent polyphenol content, ranging from 3.8 mg GAE/g for 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] up to 192 mg GAE/g for 
 <italic>S. graminifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The diversity of results is most likely due to the use of different solvents and extraction techniques. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts highly correlated with the content of phenols (r = 0.990 for total phenolic content (TPC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and r = 0.981 for TPC and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)). This proves that polyphenolic compounds are by far the main antioxidants in this case. In addition, both methods used for determining antioxidant activity were closely correlated (r = 0.997). However, the correlation between antioxidant activity and results of MTS assay (after 48 h) and RTCA results (CI in 48 h) were insignificant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The obtained results are in line with the literature data. Many authors describe the antioxidant properties of tansy, yarrow and goldenrod extracts. However, different methods are used and the results are expressed in different units, hence direct comparison of the results is often impossible. However, the high antioxidant potential of these plants was frequently emphasised [
