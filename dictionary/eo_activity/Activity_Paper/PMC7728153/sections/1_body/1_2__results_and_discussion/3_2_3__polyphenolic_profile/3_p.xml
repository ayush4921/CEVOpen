<p>Flavonols derivatives hyperoside and rutin were identified based on retention times (comparison with analytical standards) and characteristic absorption maxima at 254 and 354 nm. Two clear bands, the first near λ = 250 nm and second 350 nm, are characteristic for flavone and/or flavonol-3-derivative, respectively. Generally, if the first band is more intensive than the second, it indicates the presence of a derivative of flavanol, but if the second band is more intensive, this indicates the presence of flavone [

Two main flavone compounds were also identified: apigenin and luteolin. Apigenin has characteristic bands at 266 and 337 nm, whereas luteolin has characteristic bands at 253, 267 and 350 nm. The compound at 7.59 was considered to be glycoside derivative apigenin based on characteristic UV–VIS spectra at λ
 <sub>max</sub> = 264 and 332 nm [

The identification of flavonol and flavone aglycones was much simpler than the identification of their glycosides. An important point to take into account is that tested yarrow extract was not found to contain any flavonol derivatives and only contained a small number of flavone derivatives (below 1 mg/g). On the other hand, high amounts of flavonol derivatives were determined in goldenrod leaves (46.17 mg/g) and flowers (26.68 mg/g). Rutin and one of the quercetin glycosides were only observed in the goldenrod extracts. The group of compounds that positively correlated with antioxidant activity were flavonol derivatives (r = 0.660 for DPPH and r = 0.717 for FRAP). Goldenrod leaf extract, which contained the highest content of these compounds, showed the highest antioxidant activity, while yarrow leaf extract in which flavonols were not identified showed the lowest. This may suggest that this group of polyphenols is mainly responsible for the antioxidant activity of the analysed extracts. The antioxidant activity of individual phenolic compounds depends on the number and positions of hydroxyl groups as well as the glycosylation of molecules [
