 <xref rid="molecules-25-05517-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Identified compounds were assigned to two main groups in order to determine which one predominated and which one played the greatest role in the biological activity of the herbs. The identification of individual compounds has been conducted by the analysis of UVâ€“VIS spectra in comparison to the spectra of chemical standards and the literature data [
