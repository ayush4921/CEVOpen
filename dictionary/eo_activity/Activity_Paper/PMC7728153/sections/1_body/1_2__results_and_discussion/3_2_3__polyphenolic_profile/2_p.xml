<p>Chlorogenic acid, its isomers and derivatives were characterised by very similar spectra with λ
 <sub>max</sub> at 326 nm, and shoulder at 296 nm. This group was the main fraction of phenolic compounds in tansy leaves as well as in yarrow, and chlorogenic acid was at an especially high amount in the former (37.64 mg/g—tansy). The level of these compounds in goldenrod flowers and leaves was twofold lower. Although caffeic acid and ferulic acid belong to hydroxycinnamic acids and have similar UV–VIS spectra to chlorogenic acid, they were analysed as a separate group. Caffeic acid was identified in all herbs, with obtained values ranging between 1.27 mg/g (goldenrod flowers) and 2.79 mg/g (goldenrod leaves), whereas ferulic acid occurred only in tansy and yarrow, at 14.22 and 0.27 mg/g content, respectively. Yarrow leaves contained both derivatives, ferulic and caffeic acid, but in a low amount.
