<p>The results of the MTS test show cytotoxic effect of the tested samples. Interestingly, it was observed that for the highest concentrations of extracts, the metabolic activity of cells was higher. However, it is important to note that a typical dose-dependent effect was not observed in all samples. The dependency of cytotoxicity on the concentration of the plant extracts has been tested by and proven via other studies [
