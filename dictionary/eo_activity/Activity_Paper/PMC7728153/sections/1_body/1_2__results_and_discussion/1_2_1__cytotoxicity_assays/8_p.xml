<p>In our research, we analysed the chemical composition of the extracts that were prepared as required for testing with cell lines, so we did not identify thujone and other volatile compounds using HPLC-DAD method. Probably, these compounds can be crucial for further understanding the mechanisms of action at the cellular level.</p>
