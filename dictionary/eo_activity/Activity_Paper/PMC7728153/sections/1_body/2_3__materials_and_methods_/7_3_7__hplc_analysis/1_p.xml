<p>Analyses were performed on a Gilson (Gilson’s Analytical-to-Semipreparative HPLC System, Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI, USA) system equipped with a binary gradient pump (Gilson 322), a column thermostat (Knauer, Berlin, Germany), autosampler with fraction collector (Liquid Handler GX-271) and a photodiode array detector (PDA, Gilson 172). The analytical column Nucleosil C-18 100-5 (250 × 4.6 mm) (Knauer, Berlin, Germany), thermostatted at 40 °C, was used for chromatographic separations. The mobile phase (1 mL/min) consisted of 0.1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) formic acid in water (phase A) and acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (phase B). The samples were eluted by the following gradient: 10% B (1.5 min), 10–100% B (1.5–20 min), 100% B (20–25 min) and again 10% B to equilibrate column. The injected volume was 20 μL. The chromatograms were recorded at 254, 280, 320 and 360 nm. The phenolic compounds were identified and classified into the specific groups by their UV–VIS spectra, literature data and by comparison of their retention time values with values of standards. External standards were used for calibration, including: caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, rutin, hyperoside, apigenin, luteolin and quercetin. The identified peaks were quantified as equivalents of the following standards: chlorogenic acid isomers as chlorogenic acid, other hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives as cinnamic acid, flavonols derivatives as hyperoside equivalents, and flavone derivatives as apigenin equivalents, which were then expressed using calibration curves at concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.1 mg/mL (R
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.9998). The results were expressed as mg/g of dry weight of the extract (mg/g DW). Before the chromatographic analysis, extracts were filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe nylon filter (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).
