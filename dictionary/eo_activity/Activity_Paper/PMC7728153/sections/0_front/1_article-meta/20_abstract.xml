 <p>Plants from Asteraceae family are widely used for their therapeutic effects in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, but the consequences of excessive intake still need to be studied. The aims of this study were the evaluation of cytotoxicity, measurement of antioxidant properties and determination of polyphenolic profile of 
  <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L. (tansy), 
  <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L. (yarrow) and 
  <italic>Solidago gigantea</italic> Ait. (goldenrod) ethanolic extracts. The cytotoxicity of extracts was monitored by xCELLigence system in real time by using porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-1) and by measurement of changes in metabolic activity ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay). The antioxidant properties were measured by spectrophotometric methods and polyphenolic profiles were determined by HPLC-DAD for 50% ethanol extracts (10% 
  <italic>w/v</italic>). Strong cytotoxic effect was recorded for tansy and yarrow extracts (125–1000 µg/mL) by xCELLigence system and MTS assay. Conversely, a supportive effect on cell proliferation was recorded for goldenrod extracts (125 µg/mL) by the same methods (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The antioxidant activity was in good correlation with total polyphenolic content, and the highest value was recorded for goldenrod leaves, followed by tansy leaves, goldenrod flowers and yarrow leaf extracts. The goldenrod extracts were abundant with flavonoids, whereas phenolic acid derivatives predominated in the polyphenolic profile of tansy and yarrow.
