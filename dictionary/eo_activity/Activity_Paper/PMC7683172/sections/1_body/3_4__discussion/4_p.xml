<p>One of the main indicators used to evaluate the antimalarial activity of plant extract is the mean survival time [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. No mouse died in the extract-treated group (500 mg/kg) and Chloroquine (5 mg/kg). Our results show that the extract enhances the survival time of mice at all doses levels which are directly linked to parasitemia suppression. Akuodor 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] made similar observations when studying 
 <italic>Bombax buonopozense</italic> against 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei.</italic> The survival of these animals treated may be due to the active compounds. According to Noumedem 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the crude extract of 
 <italic>Entandrophragma cylindricum</italic> can stimulate some enzymes involved in the fight against oxidative stress hence causing less damage to the host.
