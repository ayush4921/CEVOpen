 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], expenditure on traditional medicine is not only significant, but growing rapidly. The traditional medicinal knowledge and practices in many developing countries have not been adequately studied, exploited, or documented [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These traditional knowledge systems, transmitted orally from one generation to the next among traditional health practitioners, are in danger of disappearing due to poor relations between older and younger generations [
