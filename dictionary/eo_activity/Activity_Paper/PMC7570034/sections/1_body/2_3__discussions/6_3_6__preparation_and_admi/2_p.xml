<p>Bathing with boiled water containing the plant extract was used by the healers in this study to treat asthmatic fevers and swelling, and elsewhere it was used to drive away fatigue [

Once the water containing the medicinal extract was warm, they would use it for a bath once or twice a day. The residue was boiled with water again for a second time and used repeatedly until its color and odor had diminished [

 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], but since this study was focused on healers, such daily use of medicinal plants was not systematically observed. However, the constraints of medicinal plants, such as mistaken medicinal plant species and mistaken preparation, must be taken into consideration. Adverse reactions from the misuse of medicinal plants are partly due to misunderstandings about the species, because some species of medicinal plants are similar or have the same common name, and some are poisonous. This is why traditional healers are so important for the rural community. If there is a lack of expertise in classifying medicinal plants, it can lead to bodily harm from their misuse.
