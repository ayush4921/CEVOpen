<p>Over the last decade, the official attitude in Thailand towards traditional medicine has changed, and the policy is now to integrate traditional medicine into the public health system. However, many doctors trained in western medicine in Thailand remain skeptical towards traditional medicine, although the Thai public is showing an increasing interest in its healing powers. The present study shows that traditional healers possess rich ethnopharmacological knowledge. They have important local knowledge of many species used to treat a variety of ailments. There is an urgent need to document this valuable knowledge of medicinal plants in northeastern Thailand. Raising awareness, more education on protection, conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources are all needed for training the villagers. Ethnobotanical studies should be considered as a way to collect and support communities in their efforts to maintain and conserve their traditional knowledge. As a result, this study helps to identify many highly valuable medicinal plant species with high potential for economic development through the sustainable collection. The medicinal plants found to have high use values should be subjected to pharmacological studies to validate their use and to isolate their bioactive compounds for further study. Antibacterial and antioxidant activities will be examined in some medicinal plants identified from this research as the next step.</p>
