<p>Here, we define “use-report” as the mention of a particular plant being used for one particular purpose by one particular informant in a particular place at a given time. The use value is a quantitative measure that demonstrates the relative importance of the species. The use value index (
 <italic>UV</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] is defined as:
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>UV</italic> = 
  <italic>Ui</italic>/
  <italic>N</italic>
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>Ui</italic> is the number of use-reports cited by each informant for a given species and 
 <italic>N</italic> is the total number of informants. 
 <italic>UVs</italic> are low (approaching 0) when there are few use-reports related to the use of a species. 
 <italic>UVs</italic> are high (approaching 1) when there are many use-reports for a species, implying that the plant is commonly known by the informants.
