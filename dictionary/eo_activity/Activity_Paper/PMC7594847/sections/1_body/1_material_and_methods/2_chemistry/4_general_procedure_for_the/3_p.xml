<p>A stirred solution of epoxide 
 <bold>39</bold> (611 mg, 2.6 mmol) in dry EtOH (8 ml) was treated with an excess of iPrNH
 <sub>2</sub> (0.43 ml, 5 mmol) or t-BuNH
 <sub>2</sub> (0.52 ml, 5 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 4 h, and then the solvent was evaporated. The crude was constituted principally by the amino alcohol 
 <bold>40</bold> (iPr) or 
 <bold>41</bold>(tBu) and it was used in the next reaction step without further purification.
