<p>A solution of 
 <italic>p</italic>-, 
 <italic>m</italic>-, or 
 <italic>o</italic>- hydroxybenzaldehyde (6.75 mmol) in EtOH (11.4 ml) and the proper oxyamine 
 <bold>42</bold> or 
 <bold>43</bold> (6.75 mmol) was refluxed for 12 h. After cooling, the mixture was evaporated. The crude was dissolved in a mixture of MeOH/EtOH 3:7 (20 ml) and treated with 1.2 equivalent of the proper organic acid (oxalic, malic or fumaric acids) affording the amino alcohols (
 <bold>14</bold>–
 <bold>16</bold>, 70–80% yields) as white solids after crystallisation from MeOH/Et
 <sub>2</sub>O.
