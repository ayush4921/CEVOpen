<p>A solution of the proper oxime (
 <bold>17</bold>–
 <bold>27</bold>) (10 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (10 ml) was added portionwise to a solution of MeONa in MeOH (30 ml), prepared from anhydrous MeOH (30 ml) and Na (11 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h and then cooled at rt. Epichlorohydrin (0.86 ml, 11 mmol) dissolved in anhydrous DMF (10 ml) was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at rt, poured into water (100 ml) and extracted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (2 × 100mL). The organic phases were combined, washed with water (2 × 200 ml), dried (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude was distilled 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> affording an oil corresponding to the proper epoxide (
 <bold>28</bold>–
 <bold>38</bold>, yield 75–85%). NMR data of 
 <bold>28</bold>–
