<p>Among these main targets, N protein is a major structural protein divided into three domains, namely an N-terminal RNA binding domain (NTD), a poorly structured central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker, and a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This protein has been recognized as an important drug target against CoVs since it plays several crucial functions in the viral cycle, such as packaging the RNA genome into ribonucleoproteins (RNP), modulating host cell metabolism and regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication and trascription (Chang et al.,
