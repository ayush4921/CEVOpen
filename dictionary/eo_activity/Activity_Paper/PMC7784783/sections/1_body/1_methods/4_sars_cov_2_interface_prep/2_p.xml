<p>In order to obtain inducible homodimer interfaces between NTD N protein monomers, a crystal tetramer was selected (PDB ID 6VYO). This structure consists of four monomers stabilized with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> cations. The selected interfaces were covered by the union of chains A/B (
 <bold>IF-1</bold>) and chains B/C (
 <bold>IF-2</bold>), which are equivalent to the interface generated by chains C/D and D/A, respectively. Because there are missing residues (UniProt ID P0DTC9), some of them close to the interface, the dimers were rebuilt by superimposing a monomeric experimental structure obtained by solution NMR (PDB ID 6YI3). This structure include hydrogen atoms, which were conserved.
