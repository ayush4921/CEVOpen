<p>Compounds from DrugBank 5.1.6 database (Wishart et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) were screened against the selected dimer interfaces. The protonation state of each ligand at pH 7.4 was based on analysis using FixpKa, included in QUACPAC 2.0.2.2 (OpenEye Scientific Software) and its conformers were generated using Omega (Hawkins &amp; Nicholls, 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A docking region in each interface was selected using Make Receptor tool, included in the OEDocking 3.4.0.2 suite, OpenEye (McGann, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Parameters were kept to their default values. Molecular docking was performed to find and score binding poses by means of FRED software, included also in the OEDocking suite. Parameters were kept to their default value. Based on the results, the Phenol-Explorer database (Neveu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) was included to be treated with this same docking protocol.
