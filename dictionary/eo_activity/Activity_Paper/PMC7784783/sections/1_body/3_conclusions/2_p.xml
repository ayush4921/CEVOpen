<p>A computational analysis of the stabilization of non-native PPIs of SARS-CoV-2 N protein as a potential mechanism of action against COVID-19 is provided. A first comparison with MERS-CoV enabled us to explore its applicability towards SARS-CoV-2, where three inducible interfaces were built based on experimental data. Consequently, a drug discovery protocol was developed and applied with a drug repurposing approach, which allowed us to identify the main residues that build each interface. In addition, potential candidates that might take advantage of this mechanism were found, many of them with a common catechin skeleton that might be useful for further drug design. Even though further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> testing is needed to confirm these findings, we believe they provide valuable insights into this mechanism of action that may promote future research in the fields of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry.
