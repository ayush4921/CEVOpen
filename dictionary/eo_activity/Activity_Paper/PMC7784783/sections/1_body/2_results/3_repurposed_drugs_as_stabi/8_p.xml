<p>Meanwhile, during the course of our research several approved drugs where tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against SARS-CoV-2, and 100 compounds were identified as inhibitors of viral replication (Riva et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Comparing this list with our docking results, we noticed that Sorivudine had one of the top 20 lowest docking scores in 
 <bold>IF-1</bold>, and therefore it was considered to run molecular dynamics simulations. These calculations showed that this compound is able to stabilize all three interfaces, but with a lower TIE than the one obtained for P3/
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold> in all cases (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that even though this mechanism of action is unlikely to be the main reason for Sorivudineâ€™s effectiveness, its potency may also be affected by these type of stabilization.
