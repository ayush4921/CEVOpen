<p>Focusing on these residues in 
 <bold>IF-1</bold>, it can be seen that His59, Arg92, Ile94, Ser105 and Tyr172 from chain A, and Arg149 from chain B, are part of this binding site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). Even though few patterns can be observed, (-)EGCG, (-)CG, (-)EC and (-)C showed strong interactions with many of these key residues, whereas the other ligands did not. Finally, most compounds showed a remarkable interaction with Glu174 (chain B), which proved to be an important residue for this dimer stabilization.
