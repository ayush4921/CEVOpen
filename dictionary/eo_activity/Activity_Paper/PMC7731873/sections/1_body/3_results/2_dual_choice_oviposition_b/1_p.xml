<p>Within the range of tested concentrations (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/ml), only eucarvone and methyleugenol showed oviposition deterrent effects. Methyleugenol had the strongest effect, and the oviposition deterrent effect decreased with the decrease in methyleugenol concentrations. Both high- (5 mg/ml) and moderate (1 mg/ml)-concentration methyleugenol treatments showed an oviposition different effect with the ODIs of −0.97 and −0.51, respectively. The ODI of the low-concentration (0.2 mg/ml) methyleugenol treatment had an ODI of −0.12. The ODI of high-concentration (5 mg/ml) eucarvone treatment was −0.49, and the ODIs of the moderate- (1 mg/ml) and low-concentration (0.2 mg/ml) eucarvone treatments were 0.15 and 0.01, respectively (
