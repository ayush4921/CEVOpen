<p>Different development stages of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> had different tolerances to fumigation. Overall, eggs (4 d old) were more sensitive to fumigation than adults. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the δ-3-carene treatment on adults and eggs were 7.64 and 3.46 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the γ-terpinene treatment on adults and eggs were 5.98 and 2.75 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the terpinolene treatment on adults and eggs were 4.14 and 2.63 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3,5-dimethoxytoluene treatment on adults and eggs were 1.78 and 0.55 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of methyleugenol treatment on adults and eggs were 1.52 and 0.30 mg/liter air, respectively. Fumigation toxicity of eucarvone treatment on adults and eggs was similar (LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 1.01 and 1.09, respectively) (
