<p>A warehouse situation was simulated as described by 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Anfore et al. (2014)</xref> with some modifications. The experiment was carried out in a room with the dimensions of (height × width × height = 2.1 × 1.7 × 2.1 m = 7.5 m
 <sup>3</sup> and conditions of 26 ± 1°C, 50–70% RH, and a 14:10 (L:D) h photoperiod. Before the experiment, the entire room was cleaned and ventilated for 7 d, and it contained three wooden boxes (32 × 32 × 32 cm) with the top opened. The three wooden boxes were placed approximately 1 m apart in a triangular arrangement. A wire mesh was placed 5 cm away from the bottom of the box. A piece of filter paper was hung in the center and filter papers were placed at the four corners of the wire mesh. Eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, or methyleugenol (1 g) was dropped evenly on the filter papers, and 3 kg of healthy potatoes (90 ± 10 g each potato) were placed on the wire mesh. In another room, three wooden boxes were placed under similar conditions, containing 3 kg healthy potatoes as a control. Twenty-five pairs of mated adult 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> (1-d-old) were released into the room before sealing the room. The infestation of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> on the potatoes was checked 15 d later to calculate the rate of damage in the potatoes.
