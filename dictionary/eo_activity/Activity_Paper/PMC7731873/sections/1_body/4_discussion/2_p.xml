<p>Aromatic plants with insecticidal effects are sources of screening potential active compounds as plant-derived fumigants. Such as 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, which is the main ingredient of rose aroma and is safe for humans and the environment. The 3,5-dimethoxytoluene is commonly used in the perfume industry and in aromatherapy (
