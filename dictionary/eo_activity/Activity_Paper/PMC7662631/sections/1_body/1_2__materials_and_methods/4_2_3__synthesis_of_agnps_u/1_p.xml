<p>In relation to the dried methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> fruit, distilled water (5 mL) was added to get a concentration of 50 µg/mL. The above solution was transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask containing 0.1 mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> (prepared using 25 mL deionised water) and the mixture was heated at 70 °C with constant stirring till the color change appears to brown. Moreover, similar results were observed upon repeating the experiments using aforementioned synthetic protocol. The solution was then cooled and allowed to halt at room temperature for 24 h followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant obtained was discarded, and the pellet so formed was dispersed in 1 mL ethyl alcohol, followed by drying to get powdered AgNPs.
