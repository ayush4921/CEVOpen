<p>In summary, we have synthesized AgNPs using a medicinally important plant, 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> (fruit extract). The spherical morphology and the size of as-obtained AgNPs was determined by HRTEM analysis. Further, we have studied the preliminary potency of the as-obtained AgNPs as antibacterial and tumoricidal agents. It is noteworthy that the bio-conjugation of AgNPs using TCE was found to significantly enhance the bioactivities. Furthermore, it may be concluded that the bio-conjugation of AgNPs provide an ample scope for therapeutic usage of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic>, provided adequate mechanistic evaluations are carried out.
