 <p>The increasing interest in developing potent non-toxic drugs in medicine is widening the opportunities for studying the usage of nanostructures in the treatment of various diseases. The present work reports a method for a facile and an eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using 
  <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> fruit extract (TCE). The obtained AgNPs was characterized by using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The analysis of the results revealed that the as-obtained AgNPs have spherical morphology with an average diameter of 22 nm. Furthermore, the preliminary bioactivity evaluations revealed that the bio-conjugation of AgNPs, using TCE, significantly enhanced the antibacterial and anti-breast cancer potentials of the latter. The antibacterial activity of the as-prepared AgNPs showed that 
  <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was more sensitive towards the AgNPs, followed by 
  <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>; while, 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
  <italic>S. mutans</italic> showed comparatively minimal sensitivity toward the AgNPs. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of TCE, AgNPs and TCE + AgNPs treatment of MCF-7 were found to be 17.53, 14.25 and 6.484 Âµg/mL, respectively. Therefore, it can be ascertained that the bio-conjugation may provide a headway with regard to the therapeutic employment of 
  <italic>T. chebula</italic>, upon mechanistically understanding the basis of observed antibacterial and anticancer activities.
