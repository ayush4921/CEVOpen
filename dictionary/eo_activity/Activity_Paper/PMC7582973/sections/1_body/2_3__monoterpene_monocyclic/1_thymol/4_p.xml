<p>Mathela and co-workers determined the antibacterial activity of thymol and thymol-derived esters 
 <bold>23</bold> against Gram-positive 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and one Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thymol ester derivatives show the most enhanced activity against Gram-positives. 2-Isopropyl-5-methylphenyl acetate 
 <bold>23a</bold> and 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenyl isobutyrate 
 <bold>23c</bold> were found to be more effective than thymol and all other esters against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (MIC = 11.7 and 93.7 μM), 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (MIC = 11.7 and 46.8 μM), and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC = 11.7 and 46.8 μM), whereas 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenyl propionate 
 <bold>23b</bold> was found to be more active than thymol only against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (MIC = 46.8 μM) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC = 46.8 μM) (

 <italic>R. solani</italic>. Thymol acetate 
 <bold>23a</bold> was found to be a highly effective plant-based fungicide [
