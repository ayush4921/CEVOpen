<p>Latacz et al. performed an exploration into the group of 1,3,5-triazine-methylpiperazines and screened them for pro-cognitive action and anxiolytic-like effect in the behavioral in vivo and in vitro tests. The best results were observed for the thymol triazine derivative. Compound 4-((2-isopropyl-5-methylphenoxy)methyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine
