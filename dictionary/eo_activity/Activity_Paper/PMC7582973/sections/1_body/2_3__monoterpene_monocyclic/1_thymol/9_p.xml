<p>El-Miligy et al. focused their attention on the preparation of various thymol hybrid molecules with dual antimicrobial and insecticidal activities free of the irritation side effect from the blocked phenolic hydroxyl group. The targeted compounds were designed to link the biologically active thymol scaffold with different five-membered heterocyclic moieties like 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 1,2,4-triazole, thiazole, and 4-thiazolidinone through different spacers. All newly synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antibacterial activity against
