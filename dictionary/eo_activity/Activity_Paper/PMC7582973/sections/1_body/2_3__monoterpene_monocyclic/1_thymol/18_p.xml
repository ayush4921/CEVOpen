 <bold>50</bold>â€“
 <bold>52</bold> by the condensation of thymol with substituted 2-acetohydrazide of carvacrol and thymol. All compounds were screened for their antioxidant activity with DPPH assay and anticancer activity with SRB assay for the pancreas and colon. The molecular docking studies of all the synthesized derivatives were performed on the COX-2 protein enzyme. In the anticancer and antioxidant tests, thymol hydrazones indicate moderate activities. The molecular docking studies demonstrated excellent binding affinity towards the enzyme (
