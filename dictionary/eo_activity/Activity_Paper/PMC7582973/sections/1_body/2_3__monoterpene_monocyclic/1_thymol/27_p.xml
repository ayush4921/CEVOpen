 <italic>Anaphalis triplinervis</italic> (Sims) Sims ex C.B.Clarke EO and its major compound THQ against ZIKV. Virological assays were performed on human lung epithelial A549 cells infected with either GFP reporter ZIKV or epidemic viral strain. To evaluate the acute toxicity of THQ in vivo the zebrafish assay was used. The results demonstrated that both EO and THQ inhibit ZIKV infection in human cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 38 and 45 Î¼M. It was noted that the inoculation of THQ at the antiviral effective concentration does not lead to any stress and does not impact fish survival [
