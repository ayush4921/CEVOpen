 <italic>Cis</italic>- and

 <bold>9–12</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f005">Figure 5</xref>) to obtain monoterpene derivatives with antifungal activity. The in vivo bioassay results showed that chiral acid (

 <bold>10</bold> demonstrated promising results as an antifungal agent. The tests confirmed 80–100% inhibitory rates of (

 <italic>S</italic>)-6,7-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-enoic acid against 
 <italic>Pseudoperonospora cubensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Erysiphe graminis</italic>, 
 <italic>Puccinia sorghi,</italic> and 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> at a concentration of 400 µM.
