<p>This concept is confirmed by the other work done by the Wang group [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], who presented (–)-borneol grafting onto cellulose employing chloroacetyl chloride as a covalent linking agent in a two-step reaction. The obtained borneol-grafted cellulose (BGC) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f043">Figure 43</xref>, compound 
 <bold>147</bold>) material exhibits remarkable performance in antifungal adhesion and fungal growth inhibition, which suggests that grafted borneol moieties crucially influence the tactile sensing of fungal cells and, subsequently, their selectivity in adhesion. The simple modification consisting of adding small borneol molecules onto cellulose resulted in a significant conversion of the interfacial antifungal property and also opened a new opportunity for developing a new generation of antimicrobial celluloses. More crucially, both borneol and cellulose are natural products, therefore it should be concluded that it is possible to develop an advanced natural strategy for exploiting cellulose’s potential use in antifungal adhesion and colonization. This environmentally friendly material might be applied in biomedicine and for sanitary purposes.
