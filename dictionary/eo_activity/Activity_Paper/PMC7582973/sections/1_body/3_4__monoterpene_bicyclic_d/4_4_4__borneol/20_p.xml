 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>. BMC exhibits good antibacterial adhesion properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The BMC materials also demonstrate excellent antifungal adhesion performance (even for up to 29 days). Hence, modified chitosan with monoterpene moiety should be considered a broad-spectrum antimicrobial material. It enhances the protective effects of CF concerning the potential attachment of pathogens and maintains the skin flora. Therefore, BMC could have applications as a novel biomaterial-based on the stereochemical antimicrobial strategy and be useful in many biomedical and sanitary applications.
