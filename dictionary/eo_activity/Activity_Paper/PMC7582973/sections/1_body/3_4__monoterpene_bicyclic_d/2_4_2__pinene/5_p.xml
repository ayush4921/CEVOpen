<p>Ye et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] designed and synthesized novel 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene derivatives as a potential antitumor agent. It was found that compound 
 <bold>86</bold> (6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-en-2-yl)methyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f020">Figure 20</xref>) exhibits the strongest inhibition on hepatoma carcinoma cell BEL-7402. The results showed that 
 <bold>86</bold> demonstrates good antiliver cancer activity with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 84.7 μM in vitro, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo with dose-dependent. The authors suggested that compounds 
 <bold>86</bold>, apart from arresting the growth of hepatoma cells in the S phase, induce apoptosis in hepatoma cells, down-regulate the expression of C-myc, CDK2 and CyclinE, and up-regulate the level of p53.
