<p>Thio derivatives of pinane series exhibit high antioxidant, antifungal, antiaggregation, anticoagulant, and pronounced antimycotic activity. Nikitina et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] obtained pinane sulfide 
 <bold>85</bold> by the addition of methyl hydrosulfanylacetate to the double bond of 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-pinene and investigated this compound for hemocoagulation activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f020">Figure 20</xref>). The results indicated that pinane sulfide 
 <bold>85</bold> (methyl [(1
 <italic>R</italic>,2
 <italic>R</italic>,5
 <italic>R</italic>)-(6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-yl)-methylthio]ethanoate) inhibits platelet receptor activity. It inhibits completely platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline, ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid, and also reduces the effect of ristomycin. This compound inhibits both platelet and coagulation hemostasis, which allows one to use it for the creation of promising antiaggregation drugs and the stabilization of blood products.
