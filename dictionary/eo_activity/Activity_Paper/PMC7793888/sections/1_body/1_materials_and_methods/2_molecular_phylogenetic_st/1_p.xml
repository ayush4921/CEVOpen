<p>Total genomic DNA was extracted from dried specimens using a CTAB rapid plant genome extraction kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies Company, Limited, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate PCR amplicons, the following primer pairs were used: ITS4 and ITS5 (White et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and 983F and 1567R (Rehner and Buckley, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) for a region of the translation elongation factor alpha-1 (
 <italic>tef1</italic>), LR0R and LR7 (Vilgalys and Hester, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) for the 28S gene region (LSU) and bRPB2-6F and bRPB2-7.1R (Matheny, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) for partial RNA polymerase II, second largest submit (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). PCR products were purified and sequenced at the Beijing Genomics Institute with the same primers. The sequences generated during this study are deposited in NCBI GenBank under the accession numbers
