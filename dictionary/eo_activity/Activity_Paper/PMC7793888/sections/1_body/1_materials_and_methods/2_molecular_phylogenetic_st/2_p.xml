<p>Two datasets were used in the phylogenetic analyses. The multigene dataset was used to gain information about the phylogenetic position of the genus. The second ITS dataset represented sequences of only 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cocos</italic>-related specimens. In the multigene phylogenetic analyses, the highly divergent ITS regions of the 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> s. str. (syn. 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>) specimens were removed. Sequences were aligned with the online version of MAFFT v. 7 using the E-INS-i algorithm (Katoh and Standley, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), under default settings. Each alignment was checked separately and edited with SeaView 4 (Gouy et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Subsequently, the concatenated ITS + LSU + 
 <italic>tef1</italic> + 
 <italic>rpb2</italic> dataset alignment was subjected to Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) phylogenetic analyses, which were performed in RaxmlGUI (Silvestro and Michalak, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), respectively. ML analysis was done using 1,000 rapid ML bootstrap searches. Four partitions (ITS, LSU, 
 <italic>tef1, rpb2</italic>) were set and the GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model was selected for each partition. Rapid bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates was applied for testing branch support. BI was performed with the GTR + Î“ model of evolution. The same partition scheme was used as for the ML analysis (see above). The BI settings were: four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) over 5 million generations, sampling every 1000th generation, two independent runs, and burn-in of 20% (the first 1,000 trees were discarded). Post burn-in trees were used to compute a 50% majority rule consensus phylogram. Phylogenetic trees from both ML and BI analyses resulted in largely congruent topologies. The best scoring ML tree from the RAxML analysis was edited with MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). ML bootstrap values (BS) &gt; 70% and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) &gt; 0.9 were considered evidence for statistical branch support.
