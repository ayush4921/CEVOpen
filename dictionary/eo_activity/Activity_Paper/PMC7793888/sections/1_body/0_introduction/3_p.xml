<p>In recent years, molecular studies have shown that several traditionally used and widely cultivated East Asian medicinal mushrooms (e.g., 
 <italic>Auricularia heimuer</italic> F. Wu, B.K. Cui &amp; Y.C. Dai, 
 <italic>Flammulina filiformis</italic> (Z.W. Ge, X.B. Liu &amp; Zhu L. Yang) P.M. Wang, Y.C. Dai, E. Horak &amp; Zhu L. Yang, 
 <italic>Ganoderma lingzhi</italic> Sheng H. Wu, Y. Cao &amp; Y.C. Dai) are different at the species level from their European or North American relatives (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dai et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Currently, “Fuling” is widely identified with 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cocos</italic>, syn. 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic>), a species originally described from North America, and no comprehensive taxonomical studies have been carried out on the East Asian 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> since it was described by Fries almost 200 years ago. Therefore, in this study we aim to typify the forgotten species 
 <italic>P. hoelen</italic> and clarify the taxonomy of the “Fuling” mushroom, based on morphological features and phylogenetic evidence.
