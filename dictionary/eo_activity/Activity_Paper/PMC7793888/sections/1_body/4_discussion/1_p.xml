<p>Before the introduction of the One Fungus-One Name (1F1N) concept, the correct name was the earliest legitimate name typified by the perfect state (= teleomorph). However, based on the changes in Art. 59 of the ICN (Turland et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the legitimate generic names typified by anamorphic fungal stages are treated equally for the purposes of establishing priority. The generic names 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> and 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> have types that represent the same species and are thus synonyms. Since 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> is the earliest name and sanctioned by the ICN (Art. F.3.1), and has priority, we recommend 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> rather than 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic>.
