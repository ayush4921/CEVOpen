<p id="Par88">Allowing 20% for attrition, and with improvement of ≥ 6 for arm 1 compared to placebo, it is anticipated that 150 participants (75 per arm) should be randomised to achieve a sample size of 60 participants per arm, assuming 80% power, a 1:1 randomisation scheme and a type 1 error of 5% (two-tailed), and a standard deviation of 11.6. The sample size is based on previous work by Hui et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] who determined the minimal clinically important difference in the TSDS to be 5.7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As such, we have elected to use an improvement of the TSDS of ≥ 6 as a clinically significant change. Stata software (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp) was used to estimate the sample size.
