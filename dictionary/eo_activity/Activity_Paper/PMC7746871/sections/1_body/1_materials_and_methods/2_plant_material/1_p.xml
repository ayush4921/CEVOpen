<p>Thirty-one batches of RA samples were collected from 16 habitats across Inner Mongolia. A few samples from Shanxi and Gansu Provinces were used as a control. Firstly, samples purchased in medicinal markets were separated, as their information was thought to be confusing and their origins were uncertain. Secondly, the collected samples were numbered using digital information related to the time and serial number of the collection location. Meanwhile, voucher specimens of the plants were collected and deposited at Baotou Medical College, University of Inner Mongolia. Retaining their plant morphological characteristics allowed them to be examined by personnel with extensive expertise in plant knowledge so as to yield the best possible botanical identification of the samples. Finally, we analyzed 31 samples with complete information after identification.</p>
