<p>The organochlorine residues including total BHC (α-BHC, β-BHC, γ-BHC, δ-BHC), DDT (pp'-DDE, pp'-DDD, op'-DDT, pp'-DDT), and pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) were determined in accordance with the following gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (GC-MS) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">CPC, 2015</xref>). A Thermo TRACE 1300 gas chromatograph was used. Nitrogen with a purity of 99.99% was used as the carrier gas. A DB-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m × 0.25 µm) was used. A full auto-tune of the mass spectrometer was performed before the analysis of each set of samples. The transfer-line temperature was 300°C, the manifold temperature was 50°C, and the ion-trap temperature was 250°C. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the sample injection volume was 1 µl.
