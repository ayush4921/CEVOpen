<p>VC 8 is based on contract farming which involves vertical coordination within the chain. The planting company is involved in all the nodes of the VC, from production, through processing, to wholesale. This involves the formation of verbal or written agreements by the planting company, which bridges the gaps between farmers and trading companies or other production enterprises. Owing to fewer intermediate links existing between suppliers with retailers, the costs have been reduced and the economic efficiency is improved. All stages are all traceable, including the production chains and planting techniques, the application of fertilizers and pesticides, and quality inspection. In this model, the company can provide farmers with production targets and standards before the annual production process begins, as well as fixing the current purchase price. However, there are signs that farmers are starting to form alliances with local planting or processing companies (thus to change the traditional route of selling products locally) for the purpose of getting better quality products and entering more profitable markets. Studies have also shown that some procurement agencies (planting or processing companies) prefer to work with large-scale farmers rather than smallholder farmers because of the higher transaction costs associated with dealing with the latter. Commercial markets are highly competitive, with high quality standards and requirements of consistent, timely deliveries, which smallholders struggle to achieve (
