<p>VCs 3–6 begin with agricultural cooperatives that have relatively large fields (∼30 ha). These are gatherings of several farmers who took over large fields and invested in more machinery than independent farmers. Cooperatives purchase equipment and facilities to cultivate and process for the common good. Farmers involved in this stage would produce RA material individually or cooperatively and make it wholesale. The farmers can easily benefit from financial and technical supports from local government, and gain financial resources in the form of bank credits. In addition, after a few years, many cooperatives that participate in RA planting become inclined to sell their fresh roots to middlemen or processing companies, thereby achieving rapid capital gains for the following year’s planting.</p>
