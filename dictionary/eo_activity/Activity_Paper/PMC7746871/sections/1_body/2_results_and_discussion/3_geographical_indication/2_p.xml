<p>During our study, samples were analyzed to see if there are any differences between the RA from 
 <italic>daodi</italic> and other areas. Quality of RA from different origins and quality standards are commonly adjudged by the index composition of astragaloside or calycosin-7-glucoside (

Therefore, we analyzed 31 batches of RA and classified them using a classification scheme based on three variables including the yield of medicinal material, and the contents of astragaloside and calycosin-7-glucoside (Supplementary Material show the chromatography).
