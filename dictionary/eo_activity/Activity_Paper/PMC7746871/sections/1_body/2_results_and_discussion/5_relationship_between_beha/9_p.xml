<p>According to our survey, the price of RA in traditional markets (50–150 CNY/kg) is lower than that in high-quality or export markets (about 300 CNY/kg). The price of the RA sold ranges from 50 to 550 CNY/kg and it may consist of a mixture of cultivated and wild materials. Moreover, with the improvements made with regard to professional membership of organizations pertinent to traditional Chinese medicine, better guidance is becoming available in different markets. Thus, higher requirements are being placed on the quality of medicinal materials, and the input costs will also be higher. As a result, the price of RA in city hospitals is much greater than that in the Chinese counties. In addition, the price of the RA sold in hospitals is generally greater than that in drug stores, as the products sold in hospitals tend to have a complete chain of quality-inspection links.</p>
