<p>At the cultivation stage, stakeholders are attracted to RA agriculture due to the greater monetary value attached to medicinal plants (12,000–22,500 CNY/ha) compared to crop production (7,500–12,000 CNY/ha). However, prices in the medicinal-materials market are subject to intense fluctuations. The difference has a strong influence on the acreage devoted to such raw materials (both positive and negative). All of the costs are relatively high during the cultivation stage. Non-labor costs at this stage consist of land, seed, equipment, tools, irrigation pipes, herbicides, fertilizers, and pesticides, etc. There is an enormous demand for labor as the seeding, weeding, and harvesting machinery is semi-automatic, especially for the green production practices. Labor is required to care for the field management, transplant, harvest, dry, process, and transport the materials, and required for manual grading, etc. Collectively, local farmers need to pay 130–200 CNY to each person per day for such labor services.</p>
