<p>The medicinal and culinary properties of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil are well-known. However, its potential applications in the agri-food industry are still under investigation. Therefore, the attempt of the present review is to present detailed literature dealing with the extraction, chemical composition and biological activity of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil in order to highlight the potential application in the agri-food industry as natural, safer and more sustainable antimicrobial, herbicidal and antioxidant agents. Specifically, the different possible extraction methods of the essential oil from the rhizomes 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and their characteristics will be discussed first. Then, the qualitative and quantitative chemical compositions of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil and the factors that influence it, as well as the difference with other parts of the plant and other 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> spp. will be described. Finally, the antimicrobial, herbicidal and food preservative properties of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil will also be discussed to assess a prospective application in the emergent “bio” agri-food industry.
