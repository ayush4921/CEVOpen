 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil has exhibited also promising results. The mycotoxin production, particularly of thrichothecenes and fumonisins, with serious health impacts in humans and livestock by their potentially carcinogenic and inhibition of the protein synthesis, respectively [
 <xref rid="B214-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>], is another problem to solve. The essential oil obtained from the fresh rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (42.6% α-turmerone, 16.0% β-turmerone and 12.9% ar-turmerone) significantly affected the development of 
 <italic>F. vericillioides</italic> by decreasing the thickness and length of the microconidia, as well as the fungal biomass. The fumonisin production was also significantly inhibited [
