<p>Furthermore, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil constitutes a potential candidate for biological control of the emerging invasive alien plant species. Specifically, it is outstanding in the inhibitory effect in the development of pampas grass (
 <italic>Cortaderia selloana</italic> (Schult. &amp; Schult. f.) Asch. &amp; Graebn.) and tree tobacco (
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> Graham.) from the lowest dose (0.125 µL/mL) assayed. Among them, 
 <italic>C. selloana</italic> exhibited a special sensitivity to 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> essential oil. The seed germination was drastically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, achieving 81.71% of reduction at the highest dose (1 µL/mL) applied [

It is interesting to note that the management of invasive species with sustainable alternatives is another important step in global agriculture, because these species are becoming naturalized in a wide number of areas with serious consequences: they influence the environment, change soil properties, affect diversity, etc. and, finally, are reverberating in socioeconomic factors, as well as human health [
