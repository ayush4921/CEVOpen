<p id="Par73">Obesity is highly correlated with incidence of type 2 diabetes and a primary risk factor for various metabolic diseases. It is a factor contributing to the condition known as metabolic syndrome; this condition is exacerbated by environmental factors, including a fat-enriched diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and potentially by aging [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have explored the protective effects of PA when used to treat HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in rats; these studies demonstrated that PA was effective in ameliorating hepatic steatosis resulting from a HFD. PA mediated this effect by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress signals and by regulating the uptake, assembly, and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins. Among the underlying mechanisms considered, the administration of PA is also associated with the regulation of the very low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B100, as well as microsomal triglyceride-transfer protein expression.
