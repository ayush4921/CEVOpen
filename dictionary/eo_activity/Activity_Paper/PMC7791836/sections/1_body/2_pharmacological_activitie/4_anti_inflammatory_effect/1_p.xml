<p id="Par68">Inflammation is characterized by redness, swelling, heat, and pain at one or more affected locations; this process represents a primary protective response against invading pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. These responses are mediated by circulating pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, nitric oxide (NO), and PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, among others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. As such, agents capable of regulating inflammation by the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators are great significance as a means to control this response. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of Gram-negative bacteria that mediates inflammation initiated by macrophage responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. β-PAE exhibits significant anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by its capacity to maintain the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Pretreatment with β-PAE results in significantly diminished levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β biosynthesis, accompanied by an increased expression of IL-10. β-PAE also suppressed inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and COX-2 signaling pathways, resulting in decreased levels of NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub>. NF-κB signaling is central to the development and progression of acute inflammation; its activation and translocation is required to promote the transcription of many pro-inflammatory mediators. NF-κB is a hetero-tetramer comprised of two proteins known as p65 and p50. In the latent state, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol in association with its inhibitor, IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB); the induction of an inflammatory response destroys this balance, which results in proteasomal degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. β-PAE inhibits the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and stabilizes the cytoplasmic nuclear factor-κBα (IκBα) complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The actions of β-PAE also promote a decrease in the levels of both MDA and MPO activity in association with edema, and suppress the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, and NO in a dose-dependent manner in mouse models. Given its high degree of structural similarity to β-PAE, it was not surprising to find that aged preparations enriched in PAO also exhibit anti-inflammatory effect. The administration of PAO resulted in decreased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2, and NO, and concomitant increased levels of IL-4 and IL-10. PAO also promoted the downregulation of both protein and mRNA encoding COX-2 and iNOS, and limited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways by its capacity to inhibit the translocation of p50 and p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Interestingly, recent studies revealed that PAO was superior to β-PAE with respect to their capacities to limit inflammation. As the oxidative product of β-PAE, PAO exerted potent anti-inflammatory activities in vivo, which included the decreased expression of both protein and mRNA encoding TNF-α, IL-12, IL-1β, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of PAO were superior to those of β-PAE in experiments that examined production of NO and PGE2 via their corresponding iNOS and COX-2 signaling pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of PO were also examined; this agent served to limit leukocyte recruitment by its capacity to interfere with the production and activation of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. The pharmacological activities of patchouli with respect to anti-inflammatory responses are presented in Table
