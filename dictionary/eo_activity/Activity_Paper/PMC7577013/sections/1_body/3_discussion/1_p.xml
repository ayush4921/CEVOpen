<p>The draft guideline for ER analysis has been finalized based on views exchanged in the workshop that was held just after the completion of public consultation on “Guideline for drug exposure‐response analysis (draft)” conducted by the MHLW. The guideline describes basic concepts applied to drug development using ER analysis, which covers practices such as planning clinical studies, handling related data, performing these analyses, reporting analysis results to the regulatory authorities, and providing information on the analysis results after marketing. The finalized guideline has been issued by the MHLW on June 2020.
