<p>The objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of essential oil from common caraway and of L-carvone, which is a compound extracted from it, on the numbers of emigrating insects, mortality and emigration (repellence) for 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. It was assessed whether caraway essential oil and L-carvone affected 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> as insecticides and/or repellents. After confirmation of effectiveness, the required concentrations and times of application were assessed. These studies augment the search that is currently being conducted in many countries with the aim of finding natural chemical components that show repellent effects towards this species of pest, without a concurrent negative effect on either human health or the environment.
