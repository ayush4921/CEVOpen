<p>Over 20 thousand species of field and storage pests are responsible for destroying approx. one-third of the world food production [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most of these species spread everywhere where food and favourable conditions for development can be found. One such dangerous pest of stored cereal grain, e.g., wheat, maize, and rice, is 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Srivastava et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also list 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> alongside 
 <italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> as a dangerous and one of the most frequent pests of stored rice grain. These insects bring about a reduction in germination capacity, reduction in nutritive value and changes in the chemical composition of grains, etc.
