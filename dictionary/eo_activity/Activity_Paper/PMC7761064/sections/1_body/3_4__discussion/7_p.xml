<p>Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] assessed the insecticide activity and the inhibiting effect exerted on 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from essential oils and compounds extracted from 10 species of plants of the family of Apiaceae. Among the plants included in the study, the essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> and 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> showed a strong fumigant toxicity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. The plants that were concerned also included 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic>. Among the compounds, (+)-carvone, (−)-carvone, cuminaldehyde, dihydrocarvone, linalool oxide, carveol, trans-anethole and neral also displayed higher toxicities against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> as fumigants. The strongest inhibitions towards acetylocholinoesterase were displayed by α-pinen, followed by β-pinen and limonene.
