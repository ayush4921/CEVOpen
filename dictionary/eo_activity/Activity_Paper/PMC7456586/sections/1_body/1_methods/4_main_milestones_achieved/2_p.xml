<p id="para0023">In this first year, the Andalusian Transplant Coordination has prepared many materials of a technical and informative nature, including publishing an article in a national scientific journal 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, because the target audience is from within Spain and the regulations governing these therapies have specificities depending on the country. The main materials have been reviewed by AEMPS. As a result of the close collaboration established with the health services inspectorate, the transplant coordination has participated in the development of inspection protocols for clinics offering cell-based treatments. In addition, work has been done with the main sponsor of clinical trials of advanced therapies in Andalusia—an institution called the Andalusian Network for the Design and Translation of Advanced Therapies (formerly the Andalusian Initiative for Advanced Therapies)—and its network of medicine manufacturing laboratories to facilitate the implementation of the regulations on cell and tissue donation that apply to ATMPs. This work has consisted of preparing a technical document to facilitate compliance with the requirements for donor evaluation and coding as well as traceability and notification of serious adverse reactions and events, among others.
