<p>Anthraquinone and flavonoid glycosides detected in 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> extracts significantly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with ZOI between 9.7 and 14.8 mm [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The crude extracts and isolates obtained from purified fractions of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> flower extract (anthraquinone glycosides, steroids, tannins, and volatile oils) were assessed on selected bacteria isolates. Strong inhibitory activities were displayed at MIC of 500 mg/ml against the clinical isolates of 
 <italic>S. faecalis, B. subtilis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas putida</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. Luteus.</italic> At 500 mg/ml, ZOI of 10 to 25 mm was observed, with close proximity to the inhibitory activities displayed by streptomycin, penicillin, and methicillin [

 <italic>Eugenia uniflora</italic> and 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaves was examined on clinical isolates of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> The dried leaves were processed into a local antiseptic herbal soap and the antibacterial potential was assessed via hole-in-plate agar diffusion assay. The herbal soap significantly inhibited the growth of the tested organisms [
