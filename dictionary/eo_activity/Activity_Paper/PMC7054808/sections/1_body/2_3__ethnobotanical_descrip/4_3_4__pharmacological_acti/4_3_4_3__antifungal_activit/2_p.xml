<p>Volatile oils extracted from 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> flowers were assessed against standard strains and clinical isolates of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species. The oils significantly inhibited the growth of the tested microbes [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The methanolic extract and purified n-hexane and ethanolic fractions of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> flower displayed strong inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>A. Niger, C. utilis, G. candidum, A. brevipes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> species with an MIC of 0.312 to 5 mg/ml. However, at different concentrations, the purified fractions exhibited prominent inhibitory activities than the methanolic extracts. Likewise, mycelia growth was significantly inhibited by the purified fractions, with a total suppression of sporulation for 96 h at 2 mg/ml, compared to less sporulation after 48 h for methanolic extracts [
