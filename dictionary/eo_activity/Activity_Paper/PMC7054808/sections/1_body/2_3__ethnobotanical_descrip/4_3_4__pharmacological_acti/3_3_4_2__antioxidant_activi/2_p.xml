 <italic>in vitro</italic> DPPH assay of ethyl acetate-DCM, methanol-DCM, and oil fractions of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaves was assessed using L-ascorbic acid as control. The radical scavenging activities measured at 517 nm significantly inhibited the free radicals at 500 g/ml. The concentration at 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the fractions revealed activities of methanol-DCM (65.03%), ethyl acetate-DCM (62.33%), and oil fraction (64.10%). The strong scavenging activities could be due to polyphenol and flavonoid analysed [
