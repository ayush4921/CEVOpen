<p>Documented toxicological appraisals of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> present positive information regarding its safety; however, there is need to authenticate these reports through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assessments on clinical isolate. Fresh and dried plant parts, low-dosage concentrations, test organisms of different age groups and effect on other vital organs such as brain, intestine, and bladder should be considered during toxicological appraisals of medicinal plant or products. Ethnobiological appraisals described that ulcer patients, pregnant women, and children under the age of two should avoid 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> decoction. Also, studies should be focused on appraisals of recommended dosage, safest mode of administration, and reaction mechanisms of the metabolites in living organisms.
