<p>The assay components included potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH = 6.8), tyrosinase (500 units/mL in buffer), L-tyrosine substrate (2 mM in distilled water) solutions. Samples/or controls were prepared in DMSO. At the beginning, 20 µL of sample/or control and 20 µL of enzyme solution were homogenized in 120 µL of buffer. The combination was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. After that, the enzymatic reaction was inaugurated by supplying 50 µL of L-tyrosine solution. After 10 min of incubation at the same condition, the final solution’s absorbance was recorded at 470 nm [

 <disp-formula>% inhibition = (C − S)/C × 100

 </disp-formula>C: Absorbance of reaction with DMSO after subtracting control’s blank (without enzymatic reaction on substrate), S: Absorbance of reaction with sample/or inhibitor after subtracting sample’s blank (without enzymatic reaction on substrate).
