<p>The phytochemical components of the hexane extract (H-Anvi) were analyzed by GC-MS system (JMS-T100 GCV, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The column (DB-5MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 µm film thickness) (Agilent Technologies, J&amp;W Scientific Products, Folsom, United States) was connected to the system. The injection was performed by the system equipped with an autosampler. Sample (2 mg/mL) was prepared for measurement. The split ratio of 5:1 was applied for the carrier gas helium. The GC oven’s temperature was scheduled as follows:
