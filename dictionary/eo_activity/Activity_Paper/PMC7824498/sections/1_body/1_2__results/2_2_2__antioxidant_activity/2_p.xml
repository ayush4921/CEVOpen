<p>In the ABTS assay, the results in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that almost samples reveal strong inhibition on ABTS cations, except for H-Anvi and W-Anvi with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 323.88 and 586.31 µg/mL, respectively. The samples including T-Anvi and B-Anvi show IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 77.71 and 86.73 µg/mL, respectively, which are close to the positive control, BHT, a well-known antioxidant agent. Remarkably, E-Anvi (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.59 µg/mL) shows stronger scavenging ability against ABTS cations than BHT.
