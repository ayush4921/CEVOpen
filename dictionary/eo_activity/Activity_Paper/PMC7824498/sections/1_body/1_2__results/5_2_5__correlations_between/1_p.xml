<p>The Pearson’s correlation coefficients between TPC and TFC show that they have a strong association. Additionally, phenolics and flavonoids might be the main contributors to antioxidant activity via ABTS, DPPH, and reducing power assays. However, these compounds might not be involved in lipid peroxidation and α-amylase inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>A. virginnicus</italic> extracts. In contrast, flavonoids might be a vital factor determining the anti-tyrosinase ability. Significantly, the cytotoxicity on K562 and Meg-01 cell lines might be mainly based on the presence of phenolics, especially flavonoid compounds in extracts from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic>. The results show that the extract inhibiting K562 cell viability can feasibly suppress Meg-01 as well. Moreover, via all tested assays, the synergic suppression of extracts from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> against various factors involving in human diseases is confirmed through the strong expressed correlation in value of antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase, and K562, Meg-01 cytotoxic activities. The detailed information is presented in
