<p>In recent years, the influence of oxidative stress on numerous chronic diseases has been proposed though rarely established [

Thus, a vast number of studies were globally conducted to examine the role of antioxidant agents in several chronic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease. However, the clinical tests on the human patient have shown failure [
