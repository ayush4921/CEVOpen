<p>In antioxidants, the potent activities of phenolics and flavonoids such as radical scavenging and metal ion chelation have been widely reported. It can be explained via their specific structure of aromatic ring, and especially the number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups [

Accordingly, the ethyl acetate extract is found rich in flavonoid content, which may determine the potent antioxidant ability of this extract (
