<p>Overall, there is evidence that

 <italic>regia</italic> extracts have strong growth inhibitory and antibiofilm activity against many species of bacteria. Juglone, and an active compound from

 <italic>regia</italic>, has strong inhibitory activity against

 <italic>gingivalis</italic> and other oral pathogens, and extracts of the leaves and septa have low toxicity
