<p>While the resin has been tested against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic>, there were no results in the literature for testing extracts of the fruits. Moreover, the studies focusing on 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>lentiscus</italic> resin did not evaluate the MIC, so no direct comparison can be made [

 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Although the chemistry of the fruits has been explored and many compounds identified (e.g., gallic acid, catechin, 3,4-dihydroxyhydro-cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, and luteolin), it is unknown which compounds in the fruits are responsible for the antibacterial activity observed in this study [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; given the potent effect of the crude extract, future study should attempt to identify the active constituents of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>lentiscus</italic> fruit.
