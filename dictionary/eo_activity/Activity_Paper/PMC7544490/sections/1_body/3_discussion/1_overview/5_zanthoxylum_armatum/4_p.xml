<p>Overall, very little rigorous research has been done to determine the antibacterial activity of

 <italic>armatum</italic> extracts. Studies must be undertaken to determine the active compounds against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> and other oral pathogens; 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests are needed to further understand the toxicity and the potential to reduce oral pathogens in the healthy population and in patients with gingivitis and periodontitis.
