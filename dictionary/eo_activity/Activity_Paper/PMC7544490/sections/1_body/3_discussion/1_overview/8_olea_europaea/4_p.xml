<p>Overall, evidence from the literature suggests that compounds from 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>europea</italic>, namely olaecein and maslinic acid, have strong growth inhibitory properties against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> and a range of other oral pathogens. The plant extract has anti-inflammatory properties and low toxicity. Further studies are needed to determine whether the plant has any other antibacterial properties against oral pathogens (i.e. biofilm inhibition/eradication), and clinical trials are needed to determine the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antibacterial properties in periodontitis.
