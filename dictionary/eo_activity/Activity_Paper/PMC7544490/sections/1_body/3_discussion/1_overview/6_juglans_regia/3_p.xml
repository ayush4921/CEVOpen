<p>A methanol extract of the bark of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>regia</italic> against 360 strains of 10 multidrug resistant bacterial species [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The extract had an MIC of 310 μg/mL against MRSA (methicillin resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) strains and was selectively active against gram-positive species. In the same study, significant synergy was observed against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> when 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>regia</italic> extract was combined with oxacillin. Chaieb et al. tested an ethanol extract of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>regia</italic> bark against 11 bacterial species for growth inhibition, biofilm inhibition, and biofilm eradication [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. They found that 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>regia</italic> extract had good antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> with MIC values ranging from 32 to 64 μg/mL.
