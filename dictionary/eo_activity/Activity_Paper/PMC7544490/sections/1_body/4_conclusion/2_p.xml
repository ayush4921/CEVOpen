<p>Besides the interesting results found in this work, we also present a method useful for assessing the antibacterial activities of plants against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic>. Indeed, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> is an obligate anaerobe which requires specific equipment and skills to cultivate in a lab setting. This partly explains the lack of ethnopharmacological publications focusing on this species. In this work, we developed a rigorous and repeatable methodology for the antibacterial assessment of plant extracts against this pathogen that can be used by scientists for further research.
