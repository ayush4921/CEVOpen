<p>Future directions based on this research include biofilm testing and bioactivity guided fractionation. When the extracts are fractioned into less complex mixtures, we expect to see even lower MIC values. The extracts should also be tested for growth inhibitory effects on oral commensal species, since some facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity have important roles in health; for example, they play a role in chemically reducing dietary nitrate [
