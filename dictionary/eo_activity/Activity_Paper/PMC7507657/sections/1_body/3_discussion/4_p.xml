<p id="Par43">Taken together, the data show that 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold>, identified as Î²-penta-O-galloyl glucose, could induce rapid and selective cytotoxicity in cancer cells, which at high concentrations could be linked to oxidative stress. Further studies will identify the molecular mechanisms and players responsible for the anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant effects of pentagalloylglucose in normal and cancer cells.
