 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The results from the current study demonstrate the cancer cell-selective cytotoxicity of pentagalloylglucose obtained from the leaf extract. At high concentrations, the observed cytotoxicity of pentagalloylglucose is partly as a result of, or causal to, the induction of oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in DNA mutations, aging, and cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While low-to-moderate ROS levels can be beneficial to normal cells by promoting proliferation pathways, high ROS levels can be detrimental to normal and tumour cells and induce cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Some antineoplastic drugs that are currently used for cancer chemotherapy (e.g., doxorubicin, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and antimetabolites) induce high levels of oxidative stress [
