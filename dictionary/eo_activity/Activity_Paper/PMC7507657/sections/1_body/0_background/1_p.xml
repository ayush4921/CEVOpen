<p id="Par22">Anacardiaceae is a family of plants well known for its tannin-rich constituents. The taxa and the vegetative parts being investigated determine the type of constituent tannin(s). Most members of Anacardiaceae are trees or shrubs located mainly in tropical but also in subtropical and temperate regions of the world, while the family is subdivided into 5 tribes, based on morphological characteristics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], namely: Anacardiaceae, Rhoeae, Spondiadeae, Semecarparpaceae, and Dobineeae. The plants in these tribes have been widely explored as sources of many biologically useful polyphenols. Therefore, the presence of polyphenols in a member tribe is of chemotaxonomic significance. Chemotaxonomy seeks to utilize chemical information to improve the classification of plants [

However, beyond this, the presence of certain chemical constituents in a particular plant species could have a significant influence on the array of biological activities that could be obtained from such plant and, therefore, the medicinal uses for which it could be harnessed.
