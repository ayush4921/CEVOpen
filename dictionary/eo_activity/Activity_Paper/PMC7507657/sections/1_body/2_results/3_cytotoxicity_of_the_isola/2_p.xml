<p id="Par36">The concentration-dependent toxicity of 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> and that of the positive control doxorubicin were correlated with morphological damage that worsened as the concentration of each compound increased. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for the HeLa, MRC5-SV2 and MRC5 cells, a higher concentration of 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> or doxorubicin caused loss of cells and rounding up of several or nearly all remaining cells, while control cells not exposed to either compound were confluent and their connections were intact.
