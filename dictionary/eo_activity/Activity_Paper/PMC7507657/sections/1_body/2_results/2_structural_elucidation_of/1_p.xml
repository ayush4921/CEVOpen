 <bold>Compound 1</bold> was isolated as a brown amorphous powder. The compound gave a strong blue-black colour on the thin layer chromatography when sprayed with ferric chloride, indicating the presence of phenolic moiety. IR spectrum displayed absorption at 3324, 1698, 1608, 1536 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. Positive Time-of-Flight High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (TOF HRMS) gave a signal at

 <sup>+</sup> (calculated 963.1080) for a molecular mass C

 <sub>26</sub>. The proton NMR spectrum displayed five singlets at δH 7.14, 7.09, 7.01, 6.98, and 6.94, characteristic of multiply substituted gallotannins. The appearance of a doublet at 6.26 ppm with a large coupling constant (
 <italic>J=</italic> 8.4 Hz) indicates the presence of a β-anomeric proton. The sugar protons were assigned based on the COSY and HMBC spectra. In the COSY spectrum, these pairs of correlating protons were observed between the signals at δH 6.26 / 5.61; 5.61 /6.26, 4.42, 5.90 /5.65, while in the HMBC spectrum long range correlations were observed between the protons at δH 6.26 and δc 72.9, 164.7; δH 4.42 and δc 69.5, 166; δH 5.90 and δc 62.1, 73.0, 92.6 and 166. Each galloyl group was placed based on the correlation between the sugar protons as well as the aryl singlet protons with the galloyl carbonyl carbons. 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> was identified as β-penta-
 <italic>O-</italic>galloyl glucose (PGG) (molecular weight: 940.68) (Figure
