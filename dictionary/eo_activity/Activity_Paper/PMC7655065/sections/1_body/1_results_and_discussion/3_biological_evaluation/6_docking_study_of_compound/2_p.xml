<p>Compound 
 <bold>17</bold> possesses the most HDAC6 selectivity over other isoforms; therefore, we docked 
 <bold>17</bold> into the published crystal structure of HDAC6 (PDBID: 6CGP, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>) in an attempt to understand the interaction of compound 
 <bold>17</bold> with HDAC6, which was conducted using 
 <italic>Discovery Studio2017R2</italic>. The hydroxamic acid of 
 <bold>17</bold> interacts with a zinc ion (gray dotted line) and forms a hydrogen bond with His573 (red dotted line) in the bottom of the pocket, which is the typical interaction of hydroxamic acid-containing histone deacetylase inhibitors with HDACs. The central phenyl ring has π–π interactions with Phe583 and Phe643 (violet dotted lines) and the quinoline moiety is able to interact with the surrounding amino acids (His463, Pro464, and Phe583), including π-π (violet dotted lines), π-alkyl (green dotted line), and π-sigma interactions (yellow dotted line). Notably, the C3-methoxy group has an additional carbon hydrogen bond interaction with Asp460 (blue dotted line) in the open area, which probably contributes the higher HDAC6 selectivity.
