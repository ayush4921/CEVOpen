<p>Over last two decades 
 <italic>Epigenetics</italic> have emerged as a potential target for the treatment of cancer and various other physiological disorders. Gene expression regulation by epigenetic modifications play pivotal role and thus have drawn a lot interest for the development of therapeutics capable of altering gene expressions by modulating post-translational changes in histone e.g. acetylation, methylation etc. Histone post-translational modifications act as regulatory marks which are important for the control of transcription and chromatin architecture. Chromatin is a compact structure of nucleosomes and is formed from DNA-wrapped histone proteins. Two enzymes, histone acetylase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) together control the acetylation level of lysine residues in the chromatin 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal region. The acetylation level is correlated with the structure of chromatin. HAT acetylates lysine residues of histone and the resultant neutralised histones loose chromatin, which subsequently results in activation of gene expression. In contrast, HDAC removes acetyl groups and the resulting positively ionised proteins lead to the condensation of chromatin, which represses gene expression. Therefore it can be stated that histone acetylation is carried away by histone transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) reverse the action of HATs. Epigenetic modification regulates the genetic expression of chromatin without changing its DNA sequence, and the aberrance of this process is highly correlated with the occurrence of disease

Since 2006, four HDAC inhibitors have been approved by FDA viz. Vorinostat (SAHA), Romidepsin (FK228), Belinostat (PXD101), and Panobinostat (LBH589). SAHA is the first HDI that received FDA approval in 2006 for the treatment of Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL). Many new HDAC inhibitors, including dual/multitarget inhibitors
