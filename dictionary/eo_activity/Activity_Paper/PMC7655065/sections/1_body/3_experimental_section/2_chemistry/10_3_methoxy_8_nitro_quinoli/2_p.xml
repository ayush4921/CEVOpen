 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (0.16 g, 0.50 mmol), MeOH (1 ml), and toluene (0.5 ml) was placed in a 10 ml reaction vessel with a magnetic stirring bar. The vessel was sealed and placed in the microwave cavity. The reaction condition was held at 70 °C for 30 min. After it was cooled to RT, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated
