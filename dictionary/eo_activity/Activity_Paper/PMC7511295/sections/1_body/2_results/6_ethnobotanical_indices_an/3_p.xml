<p id="Par35">Under scenario 1, by changing the probability of CV index, the effect of increasing this variable on probability of relative loss index was investigated. The results showed that the probability of relative loss was increased to 97.86 and 88.45 for sedentary pastoralism and nomadism respectively, indicating a direct relationship between the relative loss and CV indices. Therefore, harvesting plant organs is one of the main causes of plant loss in both pastoralism types (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). By changing the probability of seed, aerial part, and RI index, the effects of these variables increase on probability of relative loss index was investigated under the scenarios 2 to 4. The probabilities of relative loss index were respectively increased 95.23%, 90.04% and 89.03% in sedentary pastoralism and 83.03%, 78.12% and 75.82% in nomadism under scenarios 2 to 4 (Table
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), indicating a direct relationship between the relative loss index and seed, aerial part, and IR index.
