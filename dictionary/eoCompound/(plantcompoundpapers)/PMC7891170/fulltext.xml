HS plays a multifunctional role in the environment by controlling the biogeochemical carbon cycle, providing nutrients and bio-stimulants for plant growth, and interacting with inorganic and organic pollutants. The rate of formation of HS in soils determines its productivity and carbon sequestration capacity.

Soil productivity is determined by soil organic matter. Humic substances (HS) form the largest proportion among all the constituents of soil organic matter. Enhancing the rate of formation of HS is essential to increase soil productivity as well as to model the soil carbon flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In recent years, soil carbon flow modeling has played a vital role in predicting future carbon emission patterns in soil, assisted in the development of mitigation strategies to restrict soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission, and offered ways to increase soil carbon sequestration for improved soil productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One of the most promising ways to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission from the soil and enhance soil productivity is to improve the HS synthesis in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HS are formed by the oxidative polymerization of phenols in soil. Phenols are small aromatic molecules produced by the depolymerization of lignin in plant litter. Soil enzymes, Fe(III)&#x02013;Fe(II), Mn(IV)&#x02013;Mn(III)&#x02013;Mn(II) catalysts, and soil microorganisms play a significant role in the formation of HS in soil. Oxidoreductases, including tyrosinases and fungal laccases, are enzymes capable of polymerizing small phenolic compounds released during the depolymerization of lignin. Such polymerization of phenols enables them to cross-link with amino acids, sugars, and other aromatic molecules. Then, a supramolecular structure of HS is formed. HS are bound by hydrophobic and ionic bonds and serve as a stable part of the soil organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">HS assist in increasing the soil organic matter, increasing the nutrient and water holding capacity of the soil, and improving soil health by binding to soil pollutants. The resident time of HS in the soil is 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;years, and thus, the HS formation in soil (humification) is considered one of the critical processes in the atmospheric carbon dioxide sink. The global soil carbon (C) pool is estimated to be 2500&#x000a0;gigatons (Gt), which includes about 1550&#x000a0;Gt of soil organic carbon (SOC) and 950&#x000a0;Gt of soil inorganic carbon (SIC). The soil C pool is 3.3 times the size of the atmospheric pool (760&#x000a0;Gt) and 4.5 times the size of the biotic pool (560&#x000a0;Gt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, increasing the rate of HS formation is vital for the long-term storage of carbon in the soil, besides its indirect role in reducing global warming.</p><p id="Par19">Since HS form the largest pool of recalcitrant organic carbon in the soil, their formation, oxidative biotransformation, and mineralization are predominantly due to the presence of oxidative enzymes, mainly of fungal origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The peroxidases, mainly lignin peroxidase (LiP), Mn-dependent peroxidase (MnP), versatile peroxidase (VP), laccase, and tyrosinase, are the major oxidative enzymes involved in the formation of HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among these enzymes, tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of the phenolic and non-phenolic portions of the substrate into quinones and aryl radicals, respectively. HS formation catalyzed by fungal tyrosinase in wood and soil has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Bacterial tyrosinases with industrial applications are also reported. For example, solvent-tolerant tyrosinase for enhanced activity under solvents and tyrosinases for water decontaminantion, phenol removal from wastewater, and detoxification of plant host defenses have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, the literature related to bacterial tyrosinase and its involvement in HS formation is scarce. It is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of HS formation catalyzed by bacterial tyrosinase. Hence, in this study, we aimed to understand the role of bacterial isolate <italic>Bacillus aryabhattai</italic> TFG5 in tyrosinase production and its involvement in HS production using coir pith wastes. In addition, the bacterial enzyme was evaluated for the oxidation of phenols from coir pith wash water (CWW).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Time course of tyrosinase and laccase production</title><p id="Par20">In this study, a potential tyrosinase and laccase-producing <italic>B. aryabhattai</italic> TFG5 was evaluated for HS formation.

Moreover, the maximum absorbance of coir pith wash water (CWW) at 280&#x000a0;nm and 340&#x000a0;nm was related to the presence of aromatic compounds, probably due to the depolymerization of the phenols of CWW. Similarly, higher absorbance at 360&#x000a0;nm until 472&#x000a0;nm indicated the presence of abundant aromatic compounds such as HS. Decreasing absorbance at 436&#x000a0;nm over the three days indicated the presence of molecules with more aliphatic, carbohydrates, and nitrile compounds (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Higher values of this coefficient indicated the presence of more aliphatic structures and less aromatic structures.

The term &#x02018;soil organic carbon&#x02019; was conveniently used interchangeably with humus for several years. However, the recent debate on HS suggests that HS and non-HS are not parts of humus. Scientists believe that the concept of HS should be set aside as it did not contain the compounds of alkali-extracted soil organic carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, the traditional humification pathway was questioned, and a new continuum model of soil organic matter was established, in which the formation of soil organic matter is a result of the mineralization of preferential organic molecules rather than the progressive decomposition of the plant and animal macromolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">However, increasing evidence in support of the traditional view of humic substance synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] has also been reported. The traditional concept of the humification hypothesis is that the soil added plant residues undergo decomposition by the extracellular enzyme secreted by soil microorganisms. The macromolecules such as starch, protein, lipids, carbohydrates including cellulose and hemicellulose, and lignin undergo enzymatic breakdown, and the respective degradation products such as simpler sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, and phenols are released. The phenols are polymerized by several phenol oxidases, namely, tyrosinases and laccases, which give rise to phenol radicals that help in polymerization. During the polymerization, new products are formed, which are termed as humic substances (HS). The present study explored the role of bacterial tyrosinase in the formation of HS from coir pith wastes. In the present study, UV&#x02013;Vis and FT-IR spectra of the coir pith biomass after treatment with TyrB showed the presence of aldehydes and acids initially at higher intensities on day 3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This signifies the products of lignin breakdown by the enzyme. Further, the absence of aldehydes and acids on day 4 suggested that these might have undergone polymerization, as evidenced by an increase in the absorbance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The enzymatic fractionation of the biomass undergoing humification was also rich in aryl and alkyl carbon. Similar results were observed in the chemical fractionation of soil humus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, the results of the present investigation are in line with the concepts and views propounded by traditional humification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More particularly, TyrB enhances HS synthesis in coir pith biomass. However, a more detailed humeomic approach involving the enzymatic fractionation of humus is warranted for more insights.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>UV&#x02013;Vis absorbance of the liquid phase of coir pith biomass treated with extracellular enzyme of <italic>B. aryabhattai</italic> TFG5</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Absorbance analyzed (nm)</th><th align="left">Day 1</th><th align="left">Day 2</th><th align="left">Day 3</th><th align="left">Day 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">280</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.90&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left">340</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">360</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">400</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">436</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">2.91&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">465</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.35&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">2.55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">472</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.37&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.07&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">2.39&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">600</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">1.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">664</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.88&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.77&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.36&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">It is concluded that tyrosinase from <italic>B. aryabhattai</italic> TFG5 improves the synthesis of HS from coir pith biomass.
