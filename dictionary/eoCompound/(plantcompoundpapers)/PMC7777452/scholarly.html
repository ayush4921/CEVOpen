Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p id="Par1">Galls or the neoplastic growth on plants result from a complex type of interaction between the inducers (Acari, Insects, Microbes and Nematodes) and plants. The present study sheds light on the gall inducing habit of a highly host specific eriophyid mite, <i>Aceria pongamiae,</i> on the leaves of <i>Pongamia pinnata</i> leading to the production of abnormal pouch like outgrowths on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the foliage. Each leaf gall is a highly complex, irregular massive structure, and the formation of which often leads to complete destruction of leaves, especially during heavy mite infestation, and thereby adversely affecting the physiology and growth of the host plant.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="Par2">The study was carried out by making comparative observations on FE-SEM histological sections of galls representing four different growth stages categorized on the basis of difference in age groups. Apart from variations in cell metaplasia, a dramatic change was observed in the abaxial-adaxial polarity of the laminar surfaces also throughout the developmental sequence of galls, in all the four growth stages. Significant variations could be observed in the anti-oxidative potency as well as elemental composition in the all the four age groups of galls, and also revealed ATR-FTIR pattern of gall formation.</p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par13">Insect-plant interactions are designated to be either direct or indirect, with a history dating back to the evolution of animals [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. Plant galls or the cecidia are unique products of interspecific association between plants and organisms, like insects, mites, nematodes, microbes etc. and in a general perspective, resemble abnormal growths. These are the excellent examples to reflect highly host specific co-evolution patterns of phytoparasitic ability to reprogramme the normal development of plant tissues [<a href="#CR2">2</a>] to create comfortable microenvironmental niches within the host plant tissue [<a href="#CR3">3</a>]. These abnormal vegetative tumors develop through the feeding/ovipositional or other mechanical stimuli, exerted by the inducer(s) on the plant tissues to manipulate the tissue programming pattern leading to hyperplasia and hypertrophy [<a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR4">4</a>, <a href="#CR5">5</a>]. Most of the eriophyid mites are highly host specific, showing extreme preference to feed on the meristematic and young soft tissues of plant organs which grow above the ground level, being highly rich in nutritional resources. This type of astonishing selectivity of these mites very often results in inducing a wide range of symptomless to toxemic effects on their host plants as well as the development of varied symptoms ranging from simple to highly complex types such as russeting, curling, blistering, silvering, bronzing, distortions, necrotic lesions, bud deformations, erineal patches and pouched galls, witches broom effect, stunted growth and so on [<a href="#CR5">5</a>â€"<a href="#CR10">10</a>].</p> <p id="Par14">During the development of galls, a series of anatomical and structural variations takes place, which would affect the plant organs [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. During their developmental process, galls pass through three major phases viz. the initiation (induction), growth and development, maturation (differentiation) and senescence and the gall design (morphological architectural appearance) is based on the arrangements of tissues [<a href="#CR11">11</a>]. Most of the researchers focused on the cecidogenesis mechanisms and explained the interaction between phyto-parasites and host plants. The pouch/finger like galls represent one of the commonest leaf galls induced by eriophyid mites by injecting saliva into the abaxial epidermis when they suck sap from the plant cells [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a>]. The free-radical scavenging assay addressed basic questions in gallogenesis, such as why cell damage was observed only in the initial stages and was not observed in senescent stages. The ROS (reactive oxygen species) cascade system is activated while the initial feeding time, it will alter the normal physiological activity of the cells or tissue systems. In classical concepts that, after initial herbivore attacks, the plant immune system is activated and produces several secondary metabolites (especially phenolic compounds), these metabolites play a vital role in inhibiting ROS cascade mechanisms and also reduce the cellular damages [<a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR12">12</a>, <a href="#CR13">13</a>].</p> <p id="Par15">The cecidogenic behavior of a highly host specific, phytoparasitic eriophyid mite, <i>Aceria pongamiae</i> which induces pouch/finger like epiphyllous or rarely hypophyllous leaf galls on its host plant, <i>Pongamia pinnata</i> (L.) Pierre (Fabaceae) has been illustrated in the present study, as a model system for mechanism of gall formation. So, far, the FE-SEM method has not been applied in the developmental process, and most of the study focused on the characterization of a specialized structure in a tissue system, as well as EDAX or EDA (Energy dispersive X-ray analyzer) X-ray spectroscopic method widely used to analyze the elemental composition of a physical material. In recent years, ATR-FTIR (Attenuated total reflectance- Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) spectrum analyzes have been popular in plant taxonomy because they are highly sensitive for functional group characterization of plants under abiotic or biotic stress. In the case of gallogenesis study, shifts in the frequency of absorption bands and changes in relative band intensities indicate changes in chemical structure or changes in the environment around the gall region [<a href="#CR14">14</a>â€"<a href="#CR16">16</a>]. In this study, we conducted research on ultrastructural histological modification during gall formation using FE-SEM. The selected tools, such as ATR-FTIR and EDAX, are very effective in characterizing minute variation during gall formation. The aim was to identify source-sink nutrient profiling (using EDAX method) and functional group disparities (using ATR-FTIR) in gall formations, while also enlightening the cellular response of the host plant using the DPPH free radical scavenging assay and histochemical profiling. The DPPH assay was used to understand the relationship between cellular necrosis and the degree of free radical scavenging activity of each gall stage. In classical concepts, the free-radical scavenging molecule inhibit the ROS cascade and eventually reduce cellular necrosis. The outcome of each data is used very effectively to define the basic properties of different gall stages and to provide new insights into gall formations.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="Par16">The present research was carried out between late February to July, which was the most favourable time for <i>A. pongamiae</i> for induction of gall on its host. The healthy ungalled leaves of the plant were characteristically dark green on the adaxial surface as compared to the abaxial surface. Both the surfaces had a mosaic pattern of green patches and were devoid of trichomes (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig1">1</a>a). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <p><b>a</b> Abaxial surface of normal leaf with the eriophyid mite (red arrow), <b>b</b> initial stage of gall formation (within 24â€‰h.) showing the erineal growth (red arrow), <b>c</b> Abaxial surface of galled leaf showing the ostiole region of the gall, <b>d</b> Abaxial surface showing a mature finger like gall, <b>e</b> Cross section of gall showing eriophyid mite population, <b>f</b> Cross section of a mature gall showing inner gall cavity with massive growth of hairs</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par17">Initiation of mite infestation was identified mainly based on the formation of erinea and distortion of photosynthetic mosaic pattern at the abaxial surface of leaves. Subsequent to mite infestation, the abaxial surface developed several longitudinal wrinkled lines (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>b), as a result of progressive feeding activity of the mite. These lines were found to originate from different places and joined together at a central axis of pre-determined gall ostiolar region, and which later formed the gall ostiole region (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>c), during the course of development of the gall. Two days after gall induction by the mite, the adaxial leaf surface developed small tubercle like structures. Initially, the upper surface of galls appeared smooth, and a transition stage was recognized between the first (1â€"3â€‰day) and second stage (10â€"13â€‰days) of development of the gall. A thick waxy cuticular covering was developed at the transition stage/zone and up on which, large and stout trichome hairs were found to develop (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>f). The erineal hairs were transparent and light greenish in color at the initial stage of development as the chloroplast got shifted to the erineal hairs from the lower epidermis. With progressive aging of the gall, the amount of chloroplast got reduced in the erineal hairs and the latter assumed a reddish-brown tinge owing to the deposition of coloured pigments (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>f). A direct correlation could be recorded between the age of the gall and the structural complexity, both morphologically and histologically. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span></a></div>   <p>FE-SEM images of (<b>a</b>) Abaxial surface of normal leaf showing stomata (arrow), <b>b</b> Normal Stomata, <b>c</b> Undifferentiated stomata in galled area, <b>d</b> Adaxial surface of normal leaf, <b>e</b> Upper surface of galled leaf showing longitudinal wrinkled lines, <b>f</b> Epiphyllous galls at initial stage of development.

During the second stage of development (after 10â€‰days of gall development), the mite population density showed a progressive increase (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>e), displaying diverse feeding trends in an irregular direction, thereby culminating in varied forms of alterations in the internal tissue organization of the gall. Accordingly, the gall morphology also was changed from the finger like (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>d) form to highly complex and often irregular structures (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>f).</p> <div class="controlleaf" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Control leaf</div> <p id="Par19">In the ungalled leaf, a single layer of compactly arranged epidermal cells was visible both on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces. The abaxial epidermis was found to possess paracytic type of stomata (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>b) and was devoid of trichomes. The mesophyll was found to comprise ground tissue (palisade and spongy parenchyma). The palisade parenchymatous tissue was found to comprise two layers of compactly arranged columnar cells and the spongy parenchymatous tissue was formed of loosely arranged 4â€"5 layers of large round and oval shaped cells with small intercellular space. The spongy tissue contained comparatively lesser number of chloroplasts than that of the palisade tissue (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>a). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 3</span></a></div>   <p>FE-SEM cross section images of (<b>a</b>) Normal leaf, <b>b</b> Initiation of gall formation - dedifferentiation of well differentiated tissues, <b>c</b> Gall cavity formation initiated, <b>d</b> 2nd stage, uncontrolled cell division, <b>e</b> 3rd stage, limited cell division at gall pedicel region, <b>f</b> 3rd stage â€" gall cavity enlargement.

Histology</div> <p id="Par20">Within 40â€"45â€‰days, the gall attained complete maturity, and after the maturation phase, no further histological organization was observed, and hence this gall was categorized as limited neoplastic growth. In response to the mechanical and chemical stimuli perceived from the inducer, the lower epidermal cells initiated the triggering mechanism for gall formation. Subsequently, the well differentiated mesophyll tissue was found transformed into undifferentiated meristematic tissue. In the first stage of development (1â€"3â€‰days old), the mesophyll tissue got dedifferentiated into actively dividing meristematic tissue (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>b).</p> <p id="Par21">The mesophyll tissue of the abaxial surface became hyperplastic and underwent repeated anticlinal divisions before getting hypertrophied. The highest rates of mitotic divisions were evident, with formation of uniformly distributed mass of parenchyma cells in different shape and size. As a result of the numerous anticlinal and periclinal divisions which occurred at the parenchymatous tissue, an initial uplifting of tissues occurred on the adaxial leaf surface, which assumed the form of a small tubercle (the gall being an actual extension of upper epidermal cells). Due to the uncontrolled cell multiplication occurred at the abaxial surface, the chloroplast got reduced and simultaneously, an upward pushing of abaxial epidermis was observed (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>b-c). Formation of gall cavity was initiated through cell necrosis which occurred at the hypersensitive region (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>d). Subsequent to this, an increase in the growth of uniseriated erineal hairs was observed, thereby covering the abaxial epidermis.</p> <p id="Par22">In the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of development (about 10â€"13â€‰days old galls) which represented the gall primordium stage, the actual growth and development of the gall started. At the lower part of the gall, the cells became continuously proliferated, and the length of gall got increased through periclinal cell divisions and thickening of gall occurred through anticlinal cell division of dedifferentiated parenchyma cells. The vascular elements were developed from the compactly arranged meristematic parenchyma. These vascular elements were arranged as broken rings and were encircled with compactly arranged parenchyma cells (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>e). Formation of multicellular erineal hairs occurred from the inner layer of compactly arranged parenchyma cells, and which protruded into the gall cavity (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig4">4</a>b). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 4</span></a></div>   <p>FE-SEM cross section images of (<b>a</b>) Enlarged view of gall epidermis, <b>b</b> Multicellular erineum, <b>c</b> Enlarged view of multicellular erineum, <b>d</b> Enlarged view of cells with intercellular connection pit (blue arrow), <b>e</b> Abaxial surface showing gall ostiolar opening with erinea, <b>f</b> Abaxial surface of gall with stomata and erinea.

At this stage, the gall was found to possess a basal stalk (pedicel) attached to the leaf adaxial surface (epiphyllous condition) and an upper thick cell mass of globular structure (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>d). The gall chamber was formed through necrosis and programmed cell death and which could lead to formation of young pouch like/finger like gall. Formation of vascular strands and sclerenchyma cells occurred by redifferentiation of proliferated parenchyma cells. The cells of the lower epidermis and sub-epidermis were found transformed into interior tissue of gall cavity with less chloroplast content. Around the gall chamber, 5â€"7 layers of parenchymatous cells were observed, serving the function as nutritive tissue. During this stage, initiation of schizogenous secretory cavity formation also became evident (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5</a>b). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 5</span></a></div>   <p>FE-SEM cross section images of (<b>a</b>) Gall in mature stage of development, <b>b</b> Schizogenous secretory cavity formation initiated, <b>c</b> Developed schizogenous secretory cavity, <b>d</b> Enlarged view of schizogenous cavity, <b>e</b> Initiation of gall cavity separation, <b>f</b> Enlarged view of matured gall tissue.

The cells at the lower region of the gall were found continuously proliferated through periclinal division and the differently sized and structured new daughter cells pushed the nearby cells in to the outer epidermis of the gall. During this stage, the periclinal division at the basal and pedicel regions of the gall was reduced and the anticlinal division increased. Alterations in this type of cell division, would affect the gall opening (narrow ostiolar opening) and gall cavity formation (voluminous internal cavity). Formation of vascular strands and vascular elements was found increased, and about 10â€"15 vascular elements were arranged in the homogenous meristematic parenchyma cells. The proliferated parenchyma cells were found redifferentiated into sclerenchyma cells of different size and distributed infrequently in the outermost layer of dividing parenchyma cells (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5</a>a and f). With the formation of a schizogenous secretory cavity in the dedifferentiated parenchyma region and the anticlinal and periclinal division of the terminal parenchyma cells, the gall morphology got altered. In this stage, not much histological changes were observed, though a few cells underwent limited periclinal division. The major changes at this stage of gall development were the thickening of the erineal hairs at the ostiolar region (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>e) and rarely the secondary outgrowths which developed for separating the gall cavity into chambers (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5</a>e). The striking feature at this stage was the thickening of vascular strands and elements, and the reduction in chlorophyll of the outer epidermal cells of the gall.</p> <p id="Par25">The 4<sup>th</sup> stage, which constituted the initiation of senescent stage (about 40â€"43â€‰days old stage), in this stage histogenesis was completely stopped. In some rare conditions, limited secondary interior outgrowth of cells occurred through periclinal cell divisions. However, formation of thick vascular elements was evident through limited anticlinal division. The compact arrangement of parenchyma cells was found reduced in between the gall interior endodermis and the outer epidermis along with the formation of more than one schizogenous secretory cavity and thickening of outer and inner gall tissues. The polarity behind the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) surfaces of the leaf got completely changed at this stage, and programmed cell death and necrosis also started. Progressively, the gall became dead and dried off (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>f).</p> </div> <div class="histochemicalprofile" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Histochemical profile</div> <p id="Par26">Gall tissue gradients and source-sink alterations were studied based on the various primary and secondary metabolites. The primary metabolites studied were the reducing sugar, starch and protein while the secondary metabolite studied was the phenolic compounds. Accumulation of phenolic compounds could be noticed from the 2<sup>nd</sup> phase of gall development onwards, and the major site of phenolics accumulation was identified mainly in the outer 2â€"3 layers of the hypodermis region. Phenolic compounds were found irregularly distributed in the inner 1â€"2 layers of the gall nutritive zone. Galls in the initial maturation phase (25â€"27â€‰days old galls) showed high level of phenolic accumulation in the outer and inner parenchyma tissue regions. The 4â€"6 layers of hypodermis showed the highest phenolic accumulation when compared to the inner tissue zone. Irregular patch like phenolic distribution was observed in 2â€"3 layers of the nutritive zone. Phenolic accumulation could be observed in the endodermis region of the schizogenesis secretory cavity and also along the lateral side of multicellular erineal hairs (Fig.Â <a href="#Fig6">6</a>a). Primary metabolite gradients also could be traced in the maturation phase of gall tissues. Presence of starch granules was evident in the mesophyll regions and inner gall tissue layers. The major sites of starch accumulation observed during the study were the 2â€"6 layers of hypodermis region and the 2â€"3 layers of inner nutritive zone. Starch was found absent in the actively dividing dedifferentiated parenchyma cells. Deposition of amyloplasts was noticed in the vascular elements and in the surrounded parenchyma cells. Uniform distribution of starch was observed at the basal region of erineal hairs (Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6</a>c). Presence of reducing sugar was observed mainly in the actively dividing tissues of parenchyma cells. Very low amount of reducing sugars could be noted in the outer and inner compactly arranged cellular regions. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of gall development, the reducing sugar was found accumulated in the 4â€"6 layers of hypodermis and inner nutritive zones. During the transition period from the 2nd stage to the growth phase (25â€"27â€‰days old), the middle-dedifferentiated parenchyma cells underwent several mitotic divisions, and the reducing sugars moved from the hypodermis and nutritive zone to highly active proliferated regions. The major site of reducing sugar accumulation was observed to be the multicellular erineal hairs inside the gall (Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6</a>b). Protein accumulation was observed in the middle-aged gall (25â€"27â€‰days old gall) in which the protein was found precipitated and accumulated throughout the gall tissues. High level of protein precipitation was recorded in the middle zone followed by inner nutritive zone (Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6</a>d). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6</span></a></div>   <p>Histochemical analysis of matured gall based on light microscopic images (<b>a</b>) Phenolic accumulation (arrow), <b>b</b> Reducing sugar in erinea (arrow), <b>c</b> Starch accumulation in the nutritive zone of gall (arrow), <b>d</b> Protein accumulation.

Discussion</div> <p id="Par36">Galls, like other regular plant organs, have their own characteristic features like histology and physiology [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR17">17</a>]. A high degree of specificity is maintained between the host and the inducer [<a href="#CR18">18</a>], and hence the gall morphogenesis is highly conserved and thus would be useful in the study of gall lineages and cell fate [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. The actual nature of first stimulus of gall induction in eriophyid mites is currently unknown, but the cell proliferation has been evaluated by several authors in different ways [<a href="#CR12">12</a>, <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR19">19</a>]. Results of hormonal and metabolite analysis have clearly revealed the presence of phenolic accumulation in gall tissues during the initial stage of gall development [<a href="#CR20">20</a>]. The phenol rich cells would inhibit/block the action of IAA oxidases and thereby leading to increase in local concentration of auxin. The IAA accumulation would result in cell hypertrophy. The initial stimulation from the inducer would initiate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascade events and the ROS signaling leads to phenolic accumulation and sequential molecular events, which are believed to induce gall morphogenesis [<a href="#CR21">21</a>].</p> <p id="Par37">Unlike the earlier studies which were mainly focused on the anatomical analysis of mature middle-aged galls alone, in the present study, attention was focused to analyze the different developmental stages of galls. It was observed that the galls completed development within 40â€"45â€‰days, and in the present study, the selection and categorization of different developmental stages of gall were done based on variations in morphology, anatomy and also on the erineal color pattern. In the initial developmental stage of the gall (1â€"3â€‰days old), the abaxial epidermis received chemical messengers from the mite saliva and these chemical messengers distorted the normal histological organization of the leaf. The chemical messengers acted on the ground mesophyll tissues, and subsequently well differentiated palisade and spongy parenchyma underwent redifferentiation, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of dedifferentiated parenchyma cells [<a href="#CR12">12</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>â€"<a href="#CR22">22</a>]. Initially, the hypertrophy and hyperplasia conditions were observed. These findings were in agreement with the previously recorded findings on the leaf gall induced by <i>Fragariocoptes setiger</i> on <i>Fragaria viridis</i> [<a href="#CR5">5</a>]. Results of histochemical studies enabled to record highly active histological reorganization during the growth phase (25â€"27-day old galls). The major gall tissue was found to consist of proliferated dedifferentiated parenchymatous cells [<a href="#CR21">21</a>]. The hypertrophied and hyperplasic tissues were found to contain several nutrients and metabolites. Abnormal cellular organization could be noticed without any perfect tissue organization [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a>].</p> <p id="Par38">Results of histological reprogramming assessment of leaf galls carried out during the present study clearly revealed the anatomical and morphological characterization of different developmental stages of galls and also the patterns of gall organogenesis. The morphogenesis pattern of gall development presented various levels of manipulation induced by <i>A.pongamiae</i>, indicating that the gall actually represents a limited neoplastic growth. Anatomical characterization of galled and ungalled leaves revealed distinct variations from that of the control leaves [<a href="#CR7">7</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a>, <a href="#CR23">23</a>]. The galled leaves did not show any differentiation between ground tissues, and only a homogenous mass of dedifferentiated mesophyll tissues could be observed in the galled leaves. But, a perfect distribution pattern of ground tissues and vascular bundles was observed in the non-galled leaves. The anatomical alterations induced initially by <i>A.pongamiae</i> were well studied [<a href="#CR24">24</a>]. The salivary phytotoxins secreted by eriophyid mites while sucking up the cell sap induces anatomical and morphological differences, leading to the gall formation [<a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>, <a href="#CR10">10</a>, <a href="#CR11">11</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a>].</p> <p id="Par39">In the present study, the antioxidant capacity of the galls in different developmental stages was evaluated and compared with that of control leaves. In the initial stage (1â€"3â€‰days old) of development of the gall, the antioxidant capacity was high when compared to that of the control leaf, and it indicated the presence of antioxidant groups like phenolic compounds. The accumulation of phenolic compounds and the initial ROS signaling mechanisms regulate the IAA oxidase activity. Blocking of IAA oxidase activity would help to increase local accumulation of auxin in target tissues that would enhance the dedifferentiation of tissues [<a href="#CR20">20</a>, <a href="#CR26">26</a>]. The dedifferentiated tissues undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia conditions. In the initial stage only, continuous proliferation of tissue occurred, but in the 2nd stage of development, high-level cascade expression of ROS signaling mechanisms was evident as clearly proved through the evaluation of the antioxidants. The methanolic extracts of the 1st and 2nd gall stages presented slight variations in their antioxidant activity. Cellular necrosis was found to start in the 2nd stage (10â€"13â€‰days old galls) onwards, because the high-level activity of ROS cascade and the antioxidant capacity of 2<sup>ndÂ </sup>stage gall being an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 15.21â€‰Î¼g/ml and that of the control leaf showed significant variation (16.69â€‰Î¼g/ml). The continuous cascade action of ROS could lead to hypersensitive responses (because low level of free-radical scavenging activity) and subsequently to cellular necrosis [<a href="#CR10">10</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>, <a href="#CR26">26</a>â€"<a href="#CR29">29</a>].</p> <p id="Par40">Subsequent to the 2<sup>ndÂ </sup>stage development, the antioxidant capacity of the gall appeared high, indicating the high concentration of phenolic accumulation, to prevent the ROS stress and it inhibited the cellular necrosis rates. In the 3rd stage of development, the gall showed highest antioxidant capacity by recording a value of 12.81â€‰Î¼g/ml and this IC<sub>50</sub> rate was almost similar to that of the positive control ascorbic acid (11.05â€‰Î¼g/ml). In the final stage of development (4<sup>thÂ </sup>stage: 40â€"43â€‰days old gall), highest ROS inhibition capacity (10.89â€‰Î¼g/ml) was recorded and the IC<sub>50</sub> rate was higher than that of the positive control ascorbic acid. The final stage gall was clearly proved as the senescent stage with secondary metabolite accumulations, and inhibition of ROS cascade system, the latter could be in direct response to the IAA oxidation. The IAA oxidation limits the cellular proliferation rates and dedifferentiation of cells. The phenolic contents infact are secondary metabolites produced by plants as defensive compounds against herbivory. The redox properties of phenolic compounds would play vital roles in inhibition of lipoxygenase, chelating transitional metals and free radical scavenging [<a href="#CR28">28</a>, <a href="#CR30">30</a>]. The phenolic compounds would act as effective hydrogen donors, thereby possessing good antioxidant capacity. The total phenolic concentration in the leaf gall of <i>P. pinnata</i> induced by <i>A. pongamiae</i> showed statistically significant variations between the control and middle-aged mature leaf galls [<a href="#CR24">24</a>, <a href="#CR30">30</a>]. We have concluded that, during the feeding time (mite infestation), initially the free-radical production is high and the phenolic content is low, so there is a risk of cell damage in the tissue system, while after some time (Gall 3<sup>rd</sup> stage), the host is recognized as having herbivore attacks and the plant generates secondary metabolites (phenolics compound is the main one), these metabolic compounds scaveng the free radicals and directly inhibit the ROS cascade mechanisms. Therefore, in the final stage, the phenolics accumulation beingÂ high in infested areas, it will avoid the further feeding and cellular damages caused by herbivores and also by ROS cascade mechanisms [<a href="#CR30">30</a>]. The results obtained during the present investigation on the antioxidant capacity of galls in different developmental stages showed that the phenolic and flavonoid contents were higher in the polar extracts (methanol) and subsequently, the extract possessed higher antioxidant potential also. Hence it is a clear evidence that the polar phenolics are fundamental for free radical scavenging activity as suggested earlier [<a href="#CR14">14</a>] and the present observation on the antioxidant activity could be used for promoting ethnobotanical approaches.</p> <p id="Par41">During the present study, 21 elements were considered for detailed analysis, and which were found distributed in the inner and outer regions of the gall tissues as well as in vascular bundle and non-vascular bundle regions of the control leaves. Of these, C, N, O, P, Hg, I, Cl, K, Ca and Mn showed positive correlation up to the 3rd stage of development of the gall. Some metals like Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Na, Mg, Se and Al showed irregular distribution patterns. These data helped to understand the nutritional status of the inner region of the gall and their functions. In the initial stage, the concentrations of N, O, K and Mn were found higher in the outer gall region. The initial stage of development, being the time of active proliferation, necessitated the requirement for more nutrients to support normal cell cycle and hence this could be the reason for the high concentration of mobile nutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Cl, Zn and Mo) in the initial stage of development of the gall as observed during the study in the outer gall region. However, when the gall reached the second stage of development, the mobile nutrients were found moved from the outer region to the inner region, up to the 3rd stage of development of the gall. The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> stages of gall were recognized as highly active stages, as these stages revealed the presence of more nutrients in the inner regions and their mobile nutrient concentration was found reduced when compared to those of the initial stages of the gall. Results of elemental complex analysis enabled to record clear changes in the source-sink status of the gall [<a href="#CR19">19</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>, <a href="#CR31">31</a>]. Significant variation was observed in the macro and micronutrient composition of the normal and galled leaf tissues [<a href="#CR19">19</a>]. No previous study has measured the cecidogenic nutrient profile, and determined its importance. Similar to insect galls, the mite gall often serves as a sink only in the initial stages of growth and nutrient flow has reduced reaching the senescent stage. The Hg (mercury) concentration is high at the senescent stage, typically with a high accumulation of Hg harmful to plants and herbivores. After the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage, the mite feeding was reduced and the mite moved in to the new leaf field. The mercury deposition changes cell permeability, removes essential oils and also affects the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis [<a href="#CR32">32</a>]. Improper distribution of photosynthetic pigments has been reported in histochemical analysis (Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6</a>d), with Hg accumulation being the main factor behind the reduction of photosynthetic activity of gall [<a href="#CR10">10</a>, <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR30">30</a>, <a href="#CR32">32</a>]. Not only Hg, Iodine (I) also increased in the senescent stage of gall, iodine is usually not necessary for land plants, iodine actually plays a vital role in growth, antioxidant activity and the stress tolerance response of host plants, and iodine interacts with mineral elements can be either synergistic or antagonistic [<a href="#CR33">33</a>]. Further analysis is required to answer the exact reason behind the accumulation of selected elements in the senescent stage of the gall.</p> <p id="Par42">Uninfested and mite infested leaf surfaces showed the presence of many organic compounds which produced complex spectra showing many absorption bands with varying intensity ranges. At the present level, understanding of all spectral peaks and their corresponding specific class of compounds was not possible. However, studies on the major spectral peak variations and corresponding functional group analysis were done and the IR spectrum analysis of control and various developmental stages of the gall showed some unique spectrum absorption peaks. Formation of low intensity absorption peaks also was observed in the uninfested samples and the galls in different developmental stages of development. Because the absorption range between 1650 and 1500â€‰cm<sup>âˆ’â€‰1</sup> is an indicator of physiological stress [<a href="#CR16">16</a>], it will help to understand the alterations that occurred in the functional groups of the marker regions and could be used for molecular tagging. Each stage of development has specific IR spectral profiling, indicated as their cell signaling mechanisms and often correlated with the physiological responses of cells or tissue. This is the first attempt to use the ATR-FTIR technique to characterize the minute cellular impacts of biotic and abiotic stress during the development of a gall, and further studies will be needed to address the functional properties of the functional groups identified at each developmental stage. The bio- spectroscopy techniques are the important tools for non-invasive optical tissue diagnosis and it is used for detecting a wide variety of pathological states [<a href="#CR16">16</a>]. The ATR analysis of galled and non-galled leaves represents a novel tool, as far as the galls are concerned. Nowadays the ATR techniques are widely used for tracking the molecular changes, and hence in the present study it was used to help in understanding the level and variation of functional groups at different stages of gall development. These results can be used for further molecular genomic level of gall expressions.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par43">Considering the economic utility of the plant and the highly complex and intricate host-plant mite interaction between the gall mite, <i>A. pongamiae</i> and its host <i>P. pinnata</i> (L.) the present study was selected to analyze the sequences and processes involved in gall formation, through extensive studies on gall morphology, histology, histochemistry, antioxidant properties, elemental analysis and Vibrational Bio-spectrum analysis. The study was conducted during the period of March to June, 2018, considering the ease of availability of the mite in sufficient numbers from field condition, being the most favorable period for gall induction and peak population build up by the mite. During the unfavorable season, the mites hide under the bark and internodal regions, and with the onset of favorable condition they would migrate from the crevices/underneath of barks/intermodal regions of shoots to reach the young leaves for sucking up the plant sap/making the isolated niche/cecidia. Subsequently, these mites would find a suitable site on the leaf lamina for gall induction, and while sucking up the plant sap from the abaxial surface of leaf lamina, they inject saliva into the abaxial epidermis of leaves and the injected saliva would play a very vital role in triggering development of galls [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a>]. Thus, the mites would trigger the cellular/molecular/genomic mechanism for gallogenesis. The gall development was found to include three major phases namely, initiation, growth and maturation [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>]. Each and every phase of gall development was unique in having particular characteristic structural organization.</p> <p id="Par44">The gall development was found completed within 40â€"45â€‰days, and hence the gall should be considered as limited neoplastic growth. Data gained through ultra-structural histological studies revealed the cellular transformation in every stage of cecidogenesis, confirming the first 24â€"48â€‰h of gall development as the crucial step of cecidogenesis, based on the sudden histological, vibration variation occurred in the initial stage. The significant variation showed in source-sink elemental analysis; which formed the first attempt to reveal the presence of 21 elements, following source-sink pattern of distribution in cecidia. After the 45th day, the mites completely stopped their feeding activity, and came out from the matured galls in search of new leaves of the host plant for making new gall/isolated niche on the host. Upon detection of a suitable area for development of new galls, the process of cecidogenesis would be initiated again. This study dealt with the classical aspects of gall formations, and the sequential comparative study will contribute to the development of cecidiology branch, as well as to understanding the ecology and evolution of galls.</p> <div class="limitationsoftheworks" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Limitations of the works</div> <p id="Par45"><i>P. pinnata</i> leaf gall is a limited neoplastic growth type, because abnormal neoplastic cells were found in the gall tissue and their growth has been completed within 40â€"45â€‰days. In this study, we selected four different growth stages of leaf gall, such as the first stage (1â€"3â€‰days old gall), the second stage (10â€"13â€‰days old gall), the third stage (25â€"27 old days), and the fourth stage (40â€"43 old stage). If the group selection is wrong, all results would be wrong, because the histology, histochemical profile, nutrient profile, source-sink status, antioxidant activity etc. are all correlated with the age of the gall and also age of the leaf. Grouping of these galls only using the morphology method (shape and size of the gall) is very difficult, because the gall size and shape areÂ directly correlated with the population density of the mites and their feeding activity as well as the age of the leaf (young / middle aged / matured leaf). In the study, the gall age selection is based on the shape (structural complexity), outer waxy cuticular thickening with epidermal hair structure, internal histological arrangements and the presence and amount of pigment deposition in the inner gall tissue and possession of erineal hairs. Most of the gall selection criteria are dependentÂ on a personâ€™s experience; it is very difficult to identify the age of the gall without proper experience in gall morphology, histology, pigment characters. ToÂ overcomeÂ these problems (selection or grouping of different gall stages), we suggested a new method i.e. ATR-FTIR analysis, IR analysis is a highly sensitive method and inexpensive, based on this method we can determine the age of the galls. The genomic expression profile and their variations can be used as prominent tool for assessing the age of the gall in future studies. Another important problem is the antioxidant activity analysis of each stages of the galls, in this study we only reported the DPPH free radical scavenging efficacy of each stage of the gall. This analysis only provides a rough overview of the antioxidative efficacy of each stages of the gall. Based on this analysis, one thing we can confirm is that each stage has a specific antioxidative profile which is directly correlated with the metabolites present at each stage of the gall. More antioxidant activity assays (such as FRAP, ABTS, etc.) needed to understand the actual antioxidant activity of each stage of the gall. Because each stage of the gall contained a wide variety of antioxidant compounds, each of the antioxidant molecule displayed a different degree of free-radical scavenging activity. Use of different antioxidant assay would help to understand the antioxidant efficacy of each stage of the gall, which will help to explain the hypersensitive and oxidative response of the gall.</p> </div> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
