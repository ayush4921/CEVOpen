Plant galls or the cecidia are unique products of interspecific association between plants and organisms, like insects, mites, nematodes, microbes etc. and in a general perspective, resemble abnormal growths. These are the excellent examples to reflect highly host specific co-evolution patterns of phytoparasitic ability to reprogramme the normal development of plant tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] to create comfortable microenvironmental niches within the host plant tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These abnormal vegetative tumors develop through the feeding/ovipositional or other mechanical stimuli, exerted by the inducer(s) on the plant tissues to manipulate the tissue programming pattern leading to hyperplasia and hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Most of the eriophyid mites are highly host specific, showing extreme preference to feed on the meristematic and young soft tissues of plant organs which grow above the ground level, being highly rich in nutritional resources. This type of astonishing selectivity of these mites very often results in inducing a wide range of symptomless to toxemic effects on their host plants as well as the development of varied symptoms ranging from simple to highly complex types such as russeting, curling, blistering, silvering, bronzing, distortions, necrotic lesions, bud deformations, erineal patches and pouched galls, witches broom effect, stunted growth and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">During the development of galls, a series of anatomical and structural variations takes place, which would affect the plant organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During their developmental process, galls pass through three major phases viz. the initiation (induction), growth and development, maturation (differentiation) and senescence and the gall design (morphological architectural appearance) is based on the arrangements of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most of the researchers focused on the cecidogenesis mechanisms and explained the interaction between phyto-parasites and host plants. The pouch/finger like galls represent one of the commonest leaf galls induced by eriophyid mites by injecting saliva into the abaxial epidermis when they suck sap from the plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The free-radical scavenging assay addressed basic questions in gallogenesis, such as why cell damage was observed only in the initial stages and was not observed in senescent stages. The ROS (reactive oxygen species) cascade system is activated while the initial feeding time, it will alter the normal physiological activity of the cells or tissue systems. In classical concepts that, after initial herbivore attacks, the plant immune system is activated and produces several secondary metabolites (especially phenolic compounds), these metabolites play a vital role in inhibiting ROS cascade mechanisms and also reduce the cellular damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The cecidogenic behavior of a highly host specific, phytoparasitic eriophyid mite, <italic>Aceria pongamiae</italic> which induces pouch/finger like epiphyllous or rarely hypophyllous leaf galls on its host plant, <italic>Pongamia pinnata</italic> (L.) Pierre (Fabaceae) has been illustrated in the present study, as a model system for mechanism of gall formation. So, far, the FE-SEM method has not been applied in the developmental process, and most of the study focused on the characterization of a specialized structure in a tissue system, as well as EDAX or EDA (Energy dispersive X-ray analyzer) X-ray spectroscopic method widely used to analyze the elemental composition of a physical material. In recent years, ATR-FTIR (Attenuated total reflectance- Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) spectrum analyzes have been popular in plant taxonomy because they are highly sensitive for functional group characterization of plants under abiotic or biotic stress. In the case of gallogenesis study, shifts in the frequency of absorption bands and changes in relative band intensities indicate changes in chemical structure or changes in the environment around the gall region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, we conducted research on ultrastructural histological modification during gall formation using FE-SEM. The selected tools, such as ATR-FTIR and EDAX, are very effective in characterizing minute variation during gall formation. The aim was to identify source-sink nutrient profiling (using EDAX method) and functional group disparities (using ATR-FTIR) in gall formations, while also enlightening the cellular response of the host plant using the DPPH free radical scavenging assay and histochemical profiling. The DPPH assay was used to understand the relationship between cellular necrosis and the degree of free radical scavenging activity of each gall stage. In classical concepts, the free-radical scavenging molecule inhibit the ROS cascade and eventually reduce cellular necrosis. The outcome of each data is used very effectively to define the basic properties of different gall stages and to provide new insights into gall formations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par16">The present research was carried out between late February to July, which was the most favourable time for <italic>A. pongamiae</italic> for induction of gall on its host. The healthy ungalled leaves of the plant were characteristically dark green on the adaxial surface as compared to the abaxial surface. Both the surfaces had a mosaic pattern of green patches and were devoid of trichomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

Subsequent to mite infestation, the abaxial surface developed several longitudinal wrinkled lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), as a result of progressive feeding activity of the mite. These lines were found to originate from different places and joined together at a central axis of pre-determined gall ostiolar region, and which later formed the gall ostiole region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), during the course of development of the gall. Two days after gall induction by the mite, the adaxial leaf surface developed small tubercle like structures. Initially, the upper surface of galls appeared smooth, and a transition stage was recognized between the first (1&#x02013;3&#x02009;day) and second stage (10&#x02013;13&#x02009;days) of development of the gall. A thick waxy cuticular covering was developed at the transition stage/zone and up on which, large and stout trichome hairs were found to develop (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). The erineal hairs were transparent and light greenish in color at the initial stage of development as the chloroplast got shifted to the erineal hairs from the lower epidermis. With progressive aging of the gall, the amount of chloroplast got reduced in the erineal hairs and the latter assumed a reddish-brown tinge owing to the deposition of coloured pigments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). A direct correlation could be recorded between the age of the gall and the structural complexity, both morphologically and histologically.

During the second stage of development (after 10&#x02009;days of gall development), the mite population density showed a progressive increase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e), displaying diverse feeding trends in an irregular direction, thereby culminating in varied forms of alterations in the internal tissue organization of the gall. Accordingly, the gall morphology also was changed from the finger like (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) form to highly complex and often irregular structures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Control leaf</title><p id="Par19">In the ungalled leaf, a single layer of compactly arranged epidermal cells was visible both on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces. The abaxial epidermis was found to possess paracytic type of stomata (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and was devoid of trichomes. The mesophyll was found to comprise ground tissue (palisade and spongy parenchyma). The palisade parenchymatous tissue was found to comprise two layers of compactly arranged columnar cells and the spongy parenchymatous tissue was formed of loosely arranged 4&#x02013;5 layers of large round and oval shaped cells with small intercellular space. The spongy tissue contained comparatively lesser number of chloroplasts than that of the palisade tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

In response to the mechanical and chemical stimuli perceived from the inducer, the lower epidermal cells initiated the triggering mechanism for gall formation. Subsequently, the well differentiated mesophyll tissue was found transformed into undifferentiated meristematic tissue. In the first stage of development (1&#x02013;3&#x02009;days old), the mesophyll tissue got dedifferentiated into actively dividing meristematic tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).</p><p id="Par21">The mesophyll tissue of the abaxial surface became hyperplastic and underwent repeated anticlinal divisions before getting hypertrophied. The highest rates of mitotic divisions were evident, with formation of uniformly distributed mass of parenchyma cells in different shape and size. As a result of the numerous anticlinal and periclinal divisions which occurred at the parenchymatous tissue, an initial uplifting of tissues occurred on the adaxial leaf surface, which assumed the form of a small tubercle (the gall being an actual extension of upper epidermal cells). Due to the uncontrolled cell multiplication occurred at the abaxial surface, the chloroplast got reduced and simultaneously, an upward pushing of abaxial epidermis was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b-c). Formation of gall cavity was initiated through cell necrosis which occurred at the hypersensitive region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Subsequent to this, an increase in the growth of uniseriated erineal hairs was observed, thereby covering the abaxial epidermis.</p><p id="Par22">In the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of development (about 10&#x02013;13&#x02009;days old galls) which represented the gall primordium stage, the actual growth and development of the gall started. At the lower part of the gall, the cells became continuously proliferated, and the length of gall got increased through periclinal cell divisions and thickening of gall occurred through anticlinal cell division of dedifferentiated parenchyma cells. The vascular elements were developed from the compactly arranged meristematic parenchyma. These vascular elements were arranged as broken rings and were encircled with compactly arranged parenchyma cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). Formation of multicellular erineal hairs occurred from the inner layer of compactly arranged parenchyma cells, and which protruded into the gall cavity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).

At this stage, the gall was found to possess a basal stalk (pedicel) attached to the leaf adaxial surface (epiphyllous condition) and an upper thick cell mass of globular structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The gall chamber was formed through necrosis and programmed cell death and which could lead to formation of young pouch like/finger like gall. Formation of vascular strands and sclerenchyma cells occurred by redifferentiation of proliferated parenchyma cells. The cells of the lower epidermis and sub-epidermis were found transformed into interior tissue of gall cavity with less chloroplast content. Around the gall chamber, 5&#x02013;7 layers of parenchymatous cells were observed, serving the function as nutritive tissue.

The cells at the lower region of the gall were found continuously proliferated through periclinal division and the differently sized and structured new daughter cells pushed the nearby cells in to the outer epidermis of the gall. During this stage, the periclinal division at the basal and pedicel regions of the gall was reduced and the anticlinal division increased. Alterations in this type of cell division, would affect the gall opening (narrow ostiolar opening) and gall cavity formation (voluminous internal cavity). Formation of vascular strands and vascular elements was found increased, and about 10&#x02013;15 vascular elements were arranged in the homogenous meristematic parenchyma cells. The proliferated parenchyma cells were found redifferentiated into sclerenchyma cells of different size and distributed infrequently in the outermost layer of dividing parenchyma cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a and f). With the formation of a schizogenous secretory cavity in the dedifferentiated parenchyma region and the anticlinal and periclinal division of the terminal parenchyma cells, the gall morphology got altered. In this stage, not much histological changes were observed, though a few cells underwent limited periclinal division. The major changes at this stage of gall development were the thickening of the erineal hairs at the ostiolar region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) and rarely the secondary outgrowths which developed for separating the gall cavity into chambers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e).

However, formation of thick vascular elements was evident through limited anticlinal division. The compact arrangement of parenchyma cells was found reduced in between the gall interior endodermis and the outer epidermis along with the formation of more than one schizogenous secretory cavity and thickening of outer and inner gall tissues. The polarity behind the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) surfaces of the leaf got completely changed at this stage, and programmed cell death and necrosis also started. Progressively, the gall became dead and dried off (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Histochemical profile</title><p id="Par26">Gall tissue gradients and source-sink alterations were studied based on the various primary and secondary metabolites. The primary metabolites studied were the reducing sugar, starch and protein while the secondary metabolite studied was the phenolic compounds. Accumulation of phenolic compounds could be noticed from the 2<sup>nd</sup> phase of gall development onwards, and the major site of phenolics accumulation was identified mainly in the outer 2&#x02013;3 layers of the hypodermis region. Phenolic compounds were found irregularly distributed in the inner 1&#x02013;2 layers of the gall nutritive zone. Galls in the initial maturation phase (25&#x02013;27&#x02009;days old galls) showed high level of phenolic accumulation in the outer and inner parenchyma tissue regions. The 4&#x02013;6 layers of hypodermis showed the highest phenolic accumulation when compared to the inner tissue zone. Irregular patch like phenolic distribution was observed in 2&#x02013;3 layers of the nutritive zone. Phenolic accumulation could be observed in the endodermis region of the schizogenesis secretory cavity and also along the lateral side of multicellular erineal hairs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Primary metabolite gradients also could be traced in the maturation phase of gall tissues. Presence of starch granules was evident in the mesophyll regions and inner gall tissue layers. The major sites of starch accumulation observed during the study were the 2&#x02013;6 layers of hypodermis region and the 2&#x02013;3 layers of inner nutritive zone. Starch was found absent in the actively dividing dedifferentiated parenchyma cells. Deposition of amyloplasts was noticed in the vascular elements and in the surrounded parenchyma cells. Uniform distribution of starch was observed at the basal region of erineal hairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). Presence of reducing sugar was observed mainly in the actively dividing tissues of parenchyma cells. Very low amount of reducing sugars could be noted in the outer and inner compactly arranged cellular regions. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of gall development, the reducing sugar was found accumulated in the 4&#x02013;6 layers of hypodermis and inner nutritive zones. During the transition period from the 2nd stage to the growth phase (25&#x02013;27&#x02009;days old), the middle-dedifferentiated parenchyma cells underwent several mitotic divisions, and the reducing sugars moved from the hypodermis and nutritive zone to highly active proliferated regions. The major site of reducing sugar accumulation was observed to be the multicellular erineal hairs inside the gall (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Protein accumulation was observed in the middle-aged gall (25&#x02013;27&#x02009;days old gall) in which the protein was found precipitated and accumulated throughout the gall tissues.

The accumulation of phenolic compounds and the initial ROS signaling mechanisms regulate the IAA oxidase activity. Blocking of IAA oxidase activity would help to increase local accumulation of auxin in target tissues that would enhance the dedifferentiation of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The final stage gall was clearly proved as the senescent stage with secondary metabolite accumulations, and inhibition of ROS cascade system, the latter could be in direct response to the IAA oxidation. The IAA oxidation limits the cellular proliferation rates and dedifferentiation of cells. The phenolic contents infact are secondary metabolites produced by plants as defensive compounds against herbivory. The redox properties of phenolic compounds would play vital roles in inhibition of lipoxygenase, chelating transitional metals and free radical scavenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The phenolic compounds would act as effective hydrogen donors, thereby possessing good antioxidant capacity.

We have concluded that, during the feeding time (mite infestation), initially the free-radical production is high and the phenolic content is low, so there is a risk of cell damage in the tissue system, while after some time (Gall 3<sup>rd</sup> stage), the host is recognized as having herbivore attacks and the plant generates secondary metabolites (phenolics compound is the main one), these metabolic compounds scaveng the free radicals and directly inhibit the ROS cascade mechanisms.

The results obtained during the present investigation on the antioxidant capacity of galls in different developmental stages showed that the phenolic and flavonoid contents were higher in the polar extracts (methanol) and subsequently, the extract possessed higher antioxidant potential also. Hence it is a clear evidence that the polar phenolics are fundamental for free radical scavenging activity as suggested earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the present observation on the antioxidant activity could be used for promoting ethnobotanical approaches.</p><p id="Par41">During the present study, 21 elements were considered for detailed analysis, and which were found distributed in the inner and outer regions of the gall tissues as well as in vascular bundle and non-vascular bundle regions of the control leaves. Of these, C, N, O, P, Hg, I, Cl, K, Ca and Mn showed positive correlation up to the 3rd stage of development of the gall. Some metals like Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Na, Mg, Se and Al showed irregular distribution patterns. These data helped to understand the nutritional status of the inner region of the gall and their functions. In the initial stage, the concentrations of N, O, K and Mn were found higher in the outer gall region. The initial stage of development, being the time of active proliferation, necessitated the requirement for more nutrients to support normal cell cycle and hence this could be the reason for the high concentration of mobile nutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Cl, Zn and Mo) in the initial stage of development of the gall as observed during the study in the outer gall region. However, when the gall reached the second stage of development, the mobile nutrients were found moved from the outer region to the inner region, up to the 3rd stage of development of the gall. The 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> stages of gall were recognized as highly active stages, as these stages revealed the presence of more nutrients in the inner regions and their mobile nutrient concentration was found reduced when compared to those of the initial stages of the gall.

No previous study has measured the cecidogenic nutrient profile, and determined its importance. Similar to insect galls, the mite gall often serves as a sink only in the initial stages of growth and nutrient flow has reduced reaching the senescent stage. The Hg (mercury) concentration is high at the senescent stage, typically with a high accumulation of Hg harmful to plants and herbivores. After the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage, the mite feeding was reduced and the mite moved in to the new leaf field. The mercury deposition changes cell permeability, removes essential oils and also affects the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

This is the first attempt to use the ATR-FTIR technique to characterize the minute cellular impacts of biotic and abiotic stress during the development of a gall, and further studies will be needed to address the functional properties of the functional groups identified at each developmental stage. The bio- spectroscopy techniques are the important tools for non-invasive optical tissue diagnosis and it is used for detecting a wide variety of pathological states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The ATR analysis of galled and non-galled leaves represents a novel tool, as far as the galls are concerned. Nowadays the ATR techniques are widely used for tracking the molecular changes, and hence in the present study it was used to help in understanding the level and variation of functional groups at different stages of gall development. These results can be used for further molecular genomic level of gall expressions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">Considering the economic utility of the plant and the highly complex and intricate host-plant mite interaction between the gall mite, <italic>A. pongamiae</italic> and its host <italic>P. pinnata</italic> (L.) the present study was selected to analyze the sequences and processes involved in gall formation, through extensive studies on gall morphology, histology, histochemistry, antioxidant properties, elemental analysis and Vibrational Bio-spectrum analysis. The study was conducted during the period of March to June, 2018, considering the ease of availability of the mite in sufficient numbers from field condition, being the most favorable period for gall induction and peak population build up by the mite. During the unfavorable season, the mites hide under the bark and internodal regions, and with the onset of favorable condition they would migrate from the crevices/underneath of barks/intermodal regions of shoots to reach the young leaves for sucking up the plant sap/making the isolated niche/cecidia. Subsequently, these mites would find a suitable site on the leaf lamina for gall induction, and while sucking up the plant sap from the abaxial surface of leaf lamina, they inject saliva into the abaxial epidermis of leaves and the injected saliva would play a very vital role in triggering development of galls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, the mites would trigger the cellular/molecular/genomic mechanism for gallogenesis. The gall development was found to include three major phases namely, initiation, growth and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Each and every phase of gall development was unique in having particular characteristic structural organization.</p><p id="Par44">The gall development was found completed within 40&#x02013;45&#x02009;days, and hence the gall should be considered as limited neoplastic growth. Data gained through ultra-structural histological studies revealed the cellular transformation in every stage of cecidogenesis, confirming the first 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;h of gall development as the crucial step of cecidogenesis, based on the sudden histological, vibration variation occurred in the initial stage. The significant variation showed in source-sink elemental analysis; which formed the first attempt to reveal the presence of 21 elements, following source-sink pattern of distribution in cecidia. After the 45th day, the mites completely stopped their feeding activity, and came out from the matured galls in search of new leaves of the host plant for making new gall/isolated niche on the host. Upon detection of a suitable area for development of new galls, the process of cecidogenesis would be initiated again. This study dealt with the classical aspects of gall formations, and the sequential comparative study will contribute to the development of cecidiology branch, as well as to understanding the ecology and evolution of galls.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Limitations of the works</title><p id="Par45"><italic>P. pinnata</italic> leaf gall is a limited neoplastic growth type, because abnormal neoplastic cells were found in the gall tissue and their growth has been completed within 40&#x02013;45&#x02009;days. In this study, we selected four different growth stages of leaf gall, such as the first stage (1&#x02013;3&#x02009;days old gall), the second stage (10&#x02013;13&#x02009;days old gall), the third stage (25&#x02013;27 old days), and the fourth stage (40&#x02013;43 old stage). If the group selection is wrong, all results would be wrong, because the histology, histochemical profile, nutrient profile, source-sink status, antioxidant activity etc. are all correlated with the age of the gall and also age of the leaf. Grouping of these galls only using the morphology method (shape and size of the gall) is very difficult, because the gall size and shape are&#x000a0;directly correlated with the population density of the mites and their feeding activity as well as the age of the leaf (young / middle aged / matured leaf). In the study, the gall age selection is based on the shape (structural complexity), outer waxy cuticular thickening with epidermal hair structure, internal histological arrangements and the presence and amount of pigment deposition in the inner gall tissue and possession of erineal hairs. Most of the gall selection criteria are dependent&#x000a0;on a person&#x02019;s experience; it is very difficult to identify the age of the gall without proper experience in gall morphology, histology, pigment characters. To&#x000a0;overcome&#x000a0;these problems (selection or grouping of different gall stages), we suggested a new method i.e. ATR-FTIR analysis, IR analysis is a highly sensitive method and inexpensive, based on this method we can determine the age of the galls. The genomic expression profile and their variations can be used as prominent tool for assessing the age of the gall in future studies. Another important problem is the antioxidant activity analysis of each stages of the galls, in this study we only reported the DPPH free radical scavenging efficacy of each stage of the gall. This analysis only provides a rough overview of the antioxidative efficacy of each stages of the gall. Based on this analysis, one thing we can confirm is that each stage has a specific antioxidative profile which is directly correlated with the metabolites present at each stage of the gall. More antioxidant activity assays (such as FRAP, ABTS, etc.) needed to understand the actual antioxidant activity of each stage of the gall. Because each stage of the gall contained a wide variety of antioxidant compounds, each of the antioxidant molecule displayed a different degree of free-radical scavenging activity. Use of different antioxidant assay would help to understand the antioxidant efficacy of each stage of the gall, which will help to explain the hypersensitive and oxidative response of the gall.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Collection and preparation of gall samples</title><p id="Par46">During the course of the present study, galled and ungalled leaves (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) were collected randomly from different branches of <italic>P. pinnata</italic> L. trees growing in the Calicut University Campus, Malappuram (Dt.) of Kerala, India (identification of plant specimen by Dr. A.
