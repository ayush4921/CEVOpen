    "<h4>Background</h4>Galls or the neoplastic growth on plants result from a complex type of interaction between the inducers (Acari, Insects, Microbes and Nematodes) and plants. The present study sheds light on the gall inducing habit of a highly host specific eriophyid mite, Aceria pongamiae, on the leaves of Pongamia pinnata leading to the production of abnormal pouch like outgrowths on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the foliage. Each leaf gall is a highly complex, irregular massive structure, and the formation of which often leads to complete destruction of leaves, especially during heavy mite infestation, and thereby adversely affecting the physiology and growth of the host plant.<h4>Results</h4>The study was carried out by making comparative observations on FE-SEM histological sections of galls representing four different growth stages categorized on the basis of difference in age groups. Apart from variations in cell metaplasia, a dramatic change was observed in the abaxial-adaxial polarity of the laminar surfaces also throughout the developmental sequence of galls, in all the four growth stages. Significant variations could be observed in the anti-oxidative potency as well as elemental composition in the all the four age groups of galls, and also revealed ATR-FTIR pattern of gall formation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Being the first attempt to unravel the mystery of gall induction by eriophyids in general and by A. pongamiae in particular, on its host plant P.pinnata, by shedding light on the structural and histological alterations taking place during leaf gall formation under the influence of the mite, the current study is to be treated as the model of plant-animal interactive system."
