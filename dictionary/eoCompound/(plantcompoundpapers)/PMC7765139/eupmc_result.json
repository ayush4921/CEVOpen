    "Specialized metabolites constitute a major antioxidant system involved in plant defence against environmental constraints, such as tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). The objective of this experiment was to give a thorough description of the effects of an O<sub>3</sub> pulse (120 ppb, 5 h) on the phenylpropanoid metabolism of sage, at both biochemical and molecular levels. Variable O<sub>3</sub>-induced changes were observed over time among the detected phenylpropanoid compounds (mostly identified as phenolic acids and flavonoids), likely because of their extraordinary functional diversity. Furthermore, decreases in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), phenol oxidase (PPO), and rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS) activities were reported during the first hours of treatment, probably due to an O<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative damage to proteins. Both PAL and PPO activities were also suppressed at 24 h from the beginning of exposure, whereas enhanced RAS activity occurred at the end of treatment and at the recovery time, suggesting that specific branches of the phenolic pathways were activated. The increased RAS activity was accompanied by the up-regulation of the transcript levels of genes like <i>RAS</i>, tyrosine aminotransferase, and cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase. In conclusion, sage faced the O<sub>3</sub> pulse by regulating the activation of the phenolic biosynthetic route as an integrated defence mechanism."
