    "Tea, a widely consumed beverage, has long been utilized for promoting human health with a close correlation to hyperglycemia. The Tea Metabolome Database (TMDB), the most complete and comprehensive curated collection of tea compounds data containing 1271 identified small molecule compounds from the tea plant (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>), was established previously by our research team. More recently, our studies have found that various tea types possess an antihyperglycemic effect in mice. However, the bioactive ingredients from tea have potential antihyperglycemic activity and their underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used a molecular docking approach to investigate the potential interactions between a selected 747 constituents contained in tea and 11 key protein targets of clinical antihyperglycemic drugs. According to our results, the main antihyperglycemic targets of tea composition were consistent with those of the drug rosiglitazone. The screening results showed that GCG, ECG3'Me, TMDB-01443, and CG had great target binding capacity. The results indicated that these chemicals of tea might affect hyperglycemia by acting on protein targets of rosiglitazone."
