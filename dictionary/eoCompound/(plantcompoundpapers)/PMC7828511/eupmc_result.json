    "As life expectancy increases, dementia affects a growing number of people worldwide. Besides current treatments, phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9) represents an alternative target for developing innovative small molecules to contrast neurodegeneration. PDE inhibition promotes neurotransmitter release, amelioration of microvascular dysfunction, and neuronal plasticity. This review will provide an update on natural and nature-inspired PDE9 inhibitors, with a focus on the structural features of PDE9 that encourage the development of isoform-selective ligands. The expression in the brain, the presence within its structure of a peculiar accessory pocket, the asymmetry between the two subunits composing the protein dimer, and the selectivity towards chiral species make PDE9 a suitable target to develop specific inhibitors. Additionally, the world of natural compounds is an ideal source for identifying novel, possibly asymmetric, scaffolds, and xanthines, flavonoids, neolignans, and their derivatives are currently being studied. In this review, the available literature data were interpreted and clarified, from a structural point of view, taking advantage of molecular modeling: 3D structures of ligand-target complexes were retrieved, or built, and discussed."
