To overcome this issue, researchers are focused on plant material and their essential oils to fight against multi drug resistant bacteria. In this context, the current study was concentrated in medicinal plant of guva leaves and their essential oils to combat multi drug resistant bacterial infections. The essential oils were successfully screened and confirmed by HRLC-MS analysis. The anti-bacterial ability of the compounds were loaded into the chitosan nanoparticles and proved by FT-IR analysis. In addition, the chitosan loaded essential oils morphology was compared with chitosan alone in SEM analysis and suggested that the material was loaded successfully. Further, the anti-bacterial ability of the chitosan loaded essential oils were primarily confirmed by agar well diffusion method.

Because, natural biopolymers increased all the compound materials after encapsulation including biodegradability, biocompatibility, enhanced stability, gradual drug release capacity, increased stability, highest antimicrobial efficacy and low toxicity. Among the different biopolymers, chitosan is an excellent biopolymer which is used as an encapsulation process, it owing to its biodegradability, biocompatibility and toxicity level <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Hadidi et al., 2020</xref>. It also delivered as a variety forms like beads, fibers, films and membranes. In addition, the most rich polysaccharide content of highest biodegradable ability containing biopolymer is chitosan (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Hasheminej et al., 2019</xref>). It is a very well-known biopolymer with increased properties of biodegradable, biocompatible and biomedical. It is an excellent natural polymer that synthesized from chitin through cationic process. It is an important biopolymer driven by alkaline deacetylation process, which is used in the entire field including agriculture, food, environmental, pharmaceutical, biomedical and clinical (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Badawy et al., 2020</xref>). Chitosan is a second most biopolymer available in naturally with high content. The marine crustaceans are the important source to synthesize the natural chitosan (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Naturally, biopolymers of chitosan have high biodegradability, biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, anti-biofilm activity, film forming ability with decreased toxicity level (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, more researchers are reported chitosan as carrier a molecule, which is used and increase the drug nature. The increased natures of the drugs are working 80% against various infections after successful delivery of chitosan. Also, chitosan is a functionalized biopolymer, highly used in all the applications including food for packaging, biomedical for anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity. In clinical, it is acted as successful carrier molecules for various drugs (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly, chitosan is used as a important biological material in food packaging and biomedical applications due to the decreased toxicity nature. Sometimes, chitosan is used to improve the drug nature for improving the anti-microbial and anti-biofilm and anti-oxidant nature that it could expand its applications in food active packaging.</p><p id="p0010">Chemically, when the process of deacetylation process, the weaker hydrogen bonds of chitin are linked with N-acetyl glucosamine chins and formed as a chitosan, which possesses positively charged amino groups when it diluted in acidic solvent (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rajivgandhi et al., 2019b</xref>). Chitosan is formed with the help of negatively charged crosslinking agents in the natural polymers moieties of itself through intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Karimirad et al., 2019</xref>). When the synthesis process, chitosan beads is acted as a stable loading system, but it depends on the size and types of the crosslinking agents (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Topuz and Uyar, 2020</xref>). The universal crosslinking agent is sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), which is used in nanoencapsulation, even formed capsules are labile in the aqueous system based on the pH and ionic strength (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Rajkumar et al., 2020</xref>). Basically, it shows on rod-like, crystal structures with larger surface area and hold the negatively charged sulphate groups on the cellulose backbone due to the process of hydrolysis. It can be formed as polymeric matrix with the mechanical behavior. Previously, this process is increased the rigid film matrix without stable condition for improved antimicrobial and mechanical properties (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Tatiana et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Recent years, the plant derived essential oil has got increased attention to use as active biomedical agents that can be incorporated into biodegradable active films (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Meneses et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Meneses et al., 2018b</xref>). The well-known effects of potential biological activities against various infections are received from various aromatic plant and spices in liquid form. Plant essential oils have more phenolic and flavonoid content, which have the excellent anti-oxidant properties. Also, terpenoid content of essential oils has increased anti-oxidant activity (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2020</xref>). Essential oils have excellent anti-oxidant activity with increased biological activity such as antimicrobial, anti-cancer, antiviral and larvicidal. Previously more bioactive compounds with different biological activity such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and wound healing properties were screened from essential oil contents (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Jahed et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Jahed et al., 2017b</xref>). Some of the essential oil compounds have anti-diabetics activity. The purification of essential oils from degradation affected by extreme processing conditions is their encapsulation (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Jahed et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Jahed et al., 2017b</xref>). To increase the essential oil properties, recent studies are concentrated encapsulation methods. Among the various encapsulations, the biopolymers mediated encapsulation was applied more in biomedical research. Among the biopolymer mediated encapsulation, chitosan is a naturally derived biopolymer, which has the ability to decrease the water vapor due to the increased permeability in essential oils (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi et al., 2015</xref>). Chitosan mediated encapsulation of essential oils not only protects the environment, thereby extending the shelf life of the product but also enables a controlled release of active compounds. Nanoencapsulation of essential oil into the chitosan is an emerging route of encapsulation. In this route of encapsulation, the nanomaterial is loaded to envelop or reservoirs where nanomaterial are trapped and released from large surface area. Based on the above facts, the present study was focused on chitosan loaded Guava leaves essential oil against multi drug resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Needed materials</title><p id="p0020">The natural polymer of low molecular Chitosan (50,000&#x000a0;Da) with 75% degree of deacetylation was purchased from Hi-media laboratories, Mumbai, India.

In the present study, we have formulated the Guva leaves mediated essential oils with chitosan and form a cage like structure due to the self-association of hydrophobic segment of Guva essential oil inside and outside of chitosan with hydrophilic segment (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Meneses et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Meneses et al., 2018b</xref>). In our study, we have used sonicator for chitosan plus essential oil mixer. The maximum encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity have been detected for 1: 1 ratio of chitosan and guva essential oils.
