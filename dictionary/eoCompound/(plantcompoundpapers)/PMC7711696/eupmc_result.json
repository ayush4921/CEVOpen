    "Six new polyketides named paraverrucsins A-F (<b>1</b>-<b>6</b>) with oxabicyclic and dioxatricyclic skeletons, together with eight known metabolites (<b>7</b>-<b>14</b>), were discovered and isolated from the fermentation medium of <i>Paraphaeosphaeria verruculosa</i>. Paraverrucsin A-C possessed a novel decarboxylated skeleton compared with that of trichocladinols. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectral analysis and DP4+ calculations. Paraverrucsins B/C and D/E were isolated as a mixture for the mutarotation occurred at C-2. Paraverrucsins B/C, D/E, F/trichocladinol B, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b> displayed antifeedant activities against silkworm larvae, with antifeedant index percentages ranging from 62.5 to 93.0%, at a concentration of 50 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Among them, Paraverrucsins B/C and <b>9</b> had EC<sub>50</sub> values at 13.9 and 18.2 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Most compounds showed antifungal activities against phytopathogenic fungi with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 16-64 μg/mL. Coculture of <i>P. verruculosa</i> and host plant <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> leads to the enhancement of antifeedant and antiphytopathogenic activities<i>.</i> Compounds <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>/<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>/<b>5</b>, <b>6</b>/<b>14</b> were tested for cytotoxicity against five human carcinoma cell lines, HL-60, A549, MCF-7, SW480, and SMMC-7721, while they exhibited selected cytotoxicity against SW480 with inhibition ratios of 32-38% at a concentration of 40 μM."
