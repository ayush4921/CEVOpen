    "In recent years, researchers have discovered plant miRNA (plant xenomiR) in mammalian samples, but it is unclear whether it exists stably and participates in regulation. In this paper, a cross-border regulation model of plant miRNAs based on biological big data is constructed to study the possible cross-border regulation of plant miRNAs. Firstly, a variety of human edible plants were selected, and based on the miRNA data detected in human experimental studies, screening was performed to obtain the plant xenomiR that may stably exist in the human body. Then, we use plant and animal target gene prediction methods to obtain the mRNAs of animals and plants that may be regulated, respectively. Finally, we use GO (Gene Ontology) and the Multiple Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm to analyze the biological processes regulated by plants and animals. We obtain the relationship between different biological processes and explore the regulatory commonality and individuality of plant xenomiR in plants and humans. Studies have shown that the development and metabolic functions of the human body are affected by daily eating habits. Soybeans, corn, and rice can not only affect the daily development and metabolism of the human body but also regulate biological processes such as protein modification and mitosis. This conclusion explains the reasons for the different physiological functions of the human body. This research is an important meaning for the design of small RNA drugs in Chinese herbal medicine and the treatment of human nutritional diseases."
