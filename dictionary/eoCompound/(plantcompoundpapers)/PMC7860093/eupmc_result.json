    "A series of novel α-furfuryl-2-alkylaminophosphonates have been efficiently synthesized from the one-pot three-component classical Kabachnik-Fields reaction in a green chemical approach by addition of an <i>in situ</i> generated dialkylphosphite to Schiff's base of aldehydes and amines by using environmental and eco-friendly silica gel supported iodine as a catalyst by microwave irradiation. The advantage of this protocol is simplicity in experimental procedures and products were resulted in high isolated yields. The synthesized α-furfuryl-2-alkylaminophosphonates were screened to <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant and plant growth regulatory activities and some are found to be potent with antioxidant and plant growth regulatory activities. These <i>in vitro</i> studies have been further supported by ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), quantitative structure-activity relationship, molecular docking, and bioactivity studies and identified that they were potentially bound to the GLN340 amino acid residue in chain C of 1DNU protein and TYR597 amino acid residue in chain A of 4M7E protein, causing potential exhibition of antioxidant and plant growth regulatory activities. Eventually, title compounds are identified as good blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrable compounds and are considered as proficient central nervous system active and neuroprotective antioxidant agents as the neuroprotective property is determined with BBB penetration thresholds."
