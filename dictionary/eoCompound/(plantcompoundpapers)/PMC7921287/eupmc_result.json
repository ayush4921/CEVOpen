    "The novel human coronavirus was firstly emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly around the world. There is no known specific effective treatment of COVID-19. The most commonly used agents against this disease both in Turkey and around the world include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and remdesivir. In the study, we investigated the drug potential of molecules that the components of an important medicinal plant <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> by using molecular docking and drug possibility properties of these molecules. The molecular docking results showed that the most stable complex was obtained with COVID-19 main protease and hypericin/isohypericin ligands with - 11 kcal/mol binding energy. Furthermore, ADMET, drug-likeness features of compounds of <i>H. perforatum</i> were investigated using the rules of Lipinski, Veber, and Ghose. According to the results obtained, it has been shown that <i>H. perforatum</i> has the potential to be an effective drug in the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next stage, it is necessary to carry out the clinically necessary reliability studies of these components. It is thought that it can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 if our molecular docking results are found to be in high correlation with clinical studies.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40495-021-00254-9."
