    "Vaccinum myrtillus L., Ribes nigrum L., Rubus fruticosus L., Fragaria vesca L. leaves are considered an agro-waste of the berry industry. Although numerous studies indicate fruit is a rich source of bioactive compounds, the authors prove leaves can also be a valuable source of compounds used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The study attempts to assess and compare the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of berry leaves extracts. The total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins and procyanidins content were determined. Antioxidant potential was evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging method. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of the extracts on the metabolism and proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. The effect on the migration capacity of these cells was also assessed. The obtained results show that the examined extracts are a source of valuable bioactive agents. All tested extracts show significant ability to remove free radicals in higher concentrations. Cytotoxicity assessments have shown that leaf extracts of the analyzed plants differ in cytotoxicity, both for keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The results of the assessment of cell migration capacity correlate with cytotoxicity tests, because the concentration of extracts showing cytotoxic activity towards the tested cells also inhibited their migration."
