Although numerous studies indicate fruit is a rich source of bioactive compounds, the authors prove leaves can also be a valuable source of compounds used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The study attempts to assess and compare the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of berry leaves extracts. The total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins and procyanidins content were determined. Antioxidant potential was evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging method. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of the extracts on the metabolism and proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. The effect on the migration capacity of these cells was also assessed. The obtained results show that the examined extracts are a source of valuable bioactive agents. All tested extracts show significant ability to remove free radicals in higher concentrations. Cytotoxicity assessments have shown that leaf extracts of the analyzed plants differ in cytotoxicity, both for keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The results of the assessment of cell migration capacity correlate with cytotoxicity tests, because the concentration of extracts showing cytotoxic activity towards the tested cells also inhibited their migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Plant sciences</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014413</institution-id><institution>Wy&#x0017c;sza Szko&#x00142;a Informatyki i Zarzadzania z siedziba w Rzeszowie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The skin is constantly exposed to adverse external factors that contribute to the increased formation of free radicals. The right line of defense is using substances that show strong antioxidant activity. Their activity is most often determined by the presence of polyphenolic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, which have a positive effect on a number of enzyme systems and functional proteins, cell signaling or maintaining or restoring the redox balance, which can be disturbed as a result of oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Due to the multidirectional impact of antioxidants on the human body, the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry has been looking for substances exhibiting strong antioxidant activity for many years. These substances may include raw materials of plant origin, which in addition to antioxidant activity, contain a number of active substances that have a soothing, regenerating or anti-inflammatory effect and can play the role of auxiliary substances contributing to the stability or bioavailability of cosmetic preparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Antioxidants of natural origin can be found in many plants in their different parts. A particular attention should be paid to those parts of the plant used as a plant raw material, which are not often perceived as pro-health raw materials having functional properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is particularly important from the industry perspective, as the content of plant material as a substance of potential industrial significance is important not only because of its multifunctionality and exhibiting a positive effect on the body, but also because of the economic factors. Therefore, it is important that rational management should span not only over raw materials and products but also over by-products and waste generated at various stages of the production process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Currently, the demand for this type of multifunctional plant-based raw materials with a broad spectrum of activity is increasing. While the fruits of such plants as <italic>Ribes nigrum L., Vaccinium myrtillus L., Rubus fruticosus L., Fragaria vesca L.</italic> are valued and willingly used, the leaves of these plants are not widely used, interest in their use is on an initial stage at the moment. Due to the high content of various phenolic compounds, extracts from the leaves of these plants and essential oils have strong antioxidant properties. Studies conducted with currant leaf extract have shown that it has stronger antioxidant properties compared to the extract of buds or currant fruit. It is characterized by the presence of compounds such as quercetin, myricetin, rutin and phenolic acids such as salicylic, p-coumaric, gallic, chlorogenic or ferulic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In contrast, blueberry leaves contain a significant amount of phenolic glycosides such as arbutin, anthocyanins, catechins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid. Their content increases when the leaves are exposed to direct sunlight. It has also been shown that anthocyanins present in the leaves significantly affect the mitigation of the negative impact of solar radiation on human fibroblasts, which may contribute to reducing the photoaging process of the skin and inhibiting collagen degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Leaves of blackberry and wild strawberries analyzed in this paper are also characterized by a high content of bioactive compounds. They contain phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic, ellagic, coffee, epicatechin, quercetin, kaempferol but also proanthocyanidins, triterpenes. Blackberry leaf extract has been shown to slow down skin aging due to inhibition of metalloproteinases that catalyze the degradation of intercellular matrix proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">At present, from the &#x0201c;circular economy&#x0201d; perspective, there is an increased interest to use agricultural waste resources to produce high-value compounds. <italic>Vaccinum myrtillus L., Ribes nigrum L., Rubus fruticosus L., Fragaria vesca L.</italic> leaves are considered essentially an agro-waste of the berry industry. Many research shows that the fruits of these plants are a rich source of bioactive compounds and have beneficial health properties, therefore from an economic and ecological point of view, it is worth looking at by-products as compounds that might be widely used in the pharmacy and cosmetics industry.</p><p id="Par7">During the research, the biochemical and cytotoxic properties of the obtained extracts were assessed. The antioxidative potential of the tested products and the content of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins and procyanidins were determined.

Leaves <italic>of R. nigrum L., V. myrtillus L., R. fruticosus L., F. vesca L.</italic> were collected on controlled and ecological plantations. No chemical fertilizers nor plant protection products were used for the cultivation. In addition, after obtaining the plant material, a preliminary selection of plant material was carried out, paying particular attention to chemotaxonomic factors. Plant leaves were collected in August 2019. Then extracts were made separately for analyzed plants. Each sample was extracted using an 80:20 mixture of water and glycerin as a solvent. Extracts from plants of those plants were obtained using an ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). UAE was performed according to the method described by Yang et al. in ultrasonic bath (Digital Ultrasonic Cleaner) equipped with time controller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The mixtures were homogenized at room temperature for 50&#x000a0;min (5 cycles for 10&#x000a0;min).

Initially, the test extracts were mixed with 2&#x000a0;N HCl and ammonia in a ratio of 1: 1 (v/v). The procedure is based on the structural alteration of the anthocyanin chemical forms, which is assessed by measuring absorbance at pH 1.0 and 4.5. These pigments undergo reversible structural changes and the change in pH manifests itself in strikingly different absorbance spectra. The berry extracts tested in this study were diluted with 0.025&#x000a0;M hydrochloric acid&#x02014;potassium chloride buffer (pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and 0.4&#x000a0;M sodium acetate buffer (pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.5).

ROS include free radicals such as hydroxyl (OH), superoxide (O2<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) and non-free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). RNS include free radicals such as nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide as well as peroxynitrite (OONO<sup>&#x02013;</sup>).

In order to prevent any oxidative changes, plant antioxidants in the form of polyphenols are used, which normalize the concentration of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Plant polyphenols are classified as secondary plant metabolites. Many studies indicate their beneficial health properties.

Due to the fact that keratinocytes are cells that are directly exposed to various external factors as well as cosmetic preparations applied directly to the skin, it is reasonable to perform cytotoxicity tests against these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Especially if new cosmetic raw materials of natural origin, including the fruit plant leaves we examine, are analyzed for their potential use in cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations. Our analyzes have shown that extracts from the leaves of <italic>Ribes nigrum L., Vaccinium myrtillus L, Rubus fruticosus L.</italic> and <italic>Fragaria vesca L.</italic> differ in cytotoxicity, both for keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The conducted analyzes clearly indicate that the effect exerted by the tested extracts is strictly dependent on the concentration used. Analyzes have shown that higher concentrations of leaf extracts inhibit the viability and metabolism of the cell lines tested. Cytotoxicity tests performed on keratinocytes (HaCaT) showed that the most beneficial effect on these cells is obtained by the leaves of <italic>Rubus fruticosus L.</italic> and <italic>Fragaria vesca L</italic>. The extract of <italic>R. fruticosus L</italic>. has a beneficial effect at a concentration of up to 1.0%, while in the case of <italic>Fragaria vesca L</italic>. the extract has a positive effect up to a concentration of 2.5%. Exposure of HaCaT cells to <italic>R. nigrum L.</italic> extracts shows beneficial effects only at a concentration of 0.5%, while <italic>V. myrtillus L</italic>. extract has no beneficial effect at any of the concentrations used. It is noticeable, however, that concentrations of all tested extracts equal to or greater than 5.0% reduce the proliferation and viability of keratinocytes, which indicates their cytotoxic effect associated with the reduction of cellular metabolism. The greatest inhibition of keratinocyte viability was observed for leaf extracts of <italic>R. nigrum L.</italic> and <italic>R. fruticosus L</italic>. at a concentration of 10.0%, where the inhibition reached almost 30% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It should be noted here that the cytotoxic effect caused by the analyzed extracts in higher concentrations need not be associated with inhibition of only mitochondrial reductase. There are also other mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes such as diaphoresis, NAD (P) H: quinone oxidoreductase, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and flavin reductase, which are also able to reduce Alamar Blue. Therefore, the effect of inhibiting the viability of the cells studied is not necessarily associated with direct disruption of electron transport or causing mitochondrial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cytotoxicity assessment of water-glycerin extracts from leaves of <italic>Ribes nigrum L., Vaccinium myrtillus L, Rubus fruticosus L.</italic> and <italic>Fragaria vesca L</italic>. on fibroblasts (BJ) (<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) and keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells (<bold>C</bold>,<bold>D</bold>) after 24-h exposure assessed by the Alamar Blue assay (<bold>A</bold>,<bold>C</bold>) and Neutral Red assay (<bold>B</bold>,<bold>D</bold>). Data are the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD of three independent experiments in which each concentration tested was performed in four replications.

The principle of this test is based on the determination of viable cells by assessing the amount of dye taken into the lysosomes. These organelles in live cells can uptake this dye through active transport. In the case of the cytotoxic effect of the compounds tested, the cells are not able to incorporate this chromophore into the lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. The analyzes carried out confirmed the results obtained using the previous test. Analyzes aimed at determining the amount of neutral red incorporated in the lysosomal structures of HaCaT cells also indicated that these extracts at lower concentrations stimulate cell viability which was manifested by a greater amount of dye binded into lysosomes, while higher concentrations have a negative effect. The extracts from <italic>R. nigrum L., R. fruticosus L.</italic> and <italic>F. vesca L.</italic> at the lower concentrations used stimulate the viability of keratinocytes, whereas the extracts from <italic>V. myrtillus L.</italic> show no beneficial effect on these cells at any concentration. The most favorable concentration of studied extracts showing a positive effect seems to be a concentration of 1.0%, which in the case of the <italic>R. fruticosus</italic> L. extract can increase the viability of HaCaT cells by up to 35% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A decrease in the amount of dye released from lysosomes treated with higher concentrations of extracts indicates a decrease in their viability, since during cell death the pH gradient decreases, which leads to the inability to retain the dye inside the lysosomes. Accordingly, it is assumed that the amount of dye retained is proportional to the number of viable cells. Moreover, changes in the amount of captured neutral red can also be the result of a change in the surface of cells and lysosomal membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">As part of this work, the effect of the extracts obtained on other skin cells&#x02014;fibroblasts&#x02014;was also analyzed. These cells are located in the deeper layers of the skin compared to keratinocytes, however, due to the possibility of penetration of the ingredients of cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations through the layers of the skin during their topical application, it is reasonable to examine the cytotoxic effect on these cells of natural compounds with potential application in these preparations. The analyzes carried out using the fibroblast cell line demonstrated similar results as in the case of keratinocytes. After performing the Alamar Blue test, a concentration-dependent effect was observed which differed depending on the plant being analyzed. Fibroblasts were found to be more sensitive to the action of the extracts obtained in the highest concentrations compared to keratinocytes. In <italic>V. myrtillus L.</italic> and <italic>F. vesca L.,</italic> 10.0% concentration resulted in almost 50% inhibition of cell viability. In contrast, lower concentrations of analyzed plants, mainly 0.5 and 1.0%, had a positive effect on the activity of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes involved in the reduction of resazurin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In contrast, the Neutral Red test showed only a slight beneficial effect on fibroblasts caused by <italic>V. myrtillus L.</italic> and <italic>R. fruticosus L.</italic> at the lowest concentrations. Higher concentrations of all of the extracts used showed a negative effect on these cells, as indicated by less absorbance of neutral red after applying the decolorizing solution. A smaller amount of dye accumulated in lysosomes indicates a decrease in viability, because in intact cells this dye binds and accumulates in these organelles. This is because it becomes charged and cannot pass freely into the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. The cytotoxic effect of the higher concentrations of extracts observed during the experiments probably caused cell damage that resulted in the inability to accumulate dye inside the lysosomes. Hence, lower absorbance of the dye after its release with a decolorizing solution was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Analyzes evaluating the effect of extracts from various types of berries were carried out on both cell and normal lines. Although numerous studies in vitro<italic>, </italic>in vivo, and clinical studies indicate that fruit is a rich source of bioactive compounds, various authors try to prove that leaves can also be a valuable source of extremely valuable and therapeutic compounds. The research carried out as part of this work and the cited literature data show that extracts obtained from the leaves of these plants, which are mainly seen as waste material, show even better properties than extracts from fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. This was demonstrated by studies using gastric cancer cells (AGS line), where leaf extracts were more able to inhibit their proliferation. These studies also indicated that blueberry leaf extracts significantly limit the migration capacity of these cancer cells, which is caused to a large extent by the high content of anthocyanins in these extracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. The significant antioxidant properties of these extracts play a significant role in this anti-cancer effect. Research conducted by Debnath-Canning et al. also pointed to the remarkable properties of blueberry extracts, demonstrating that they show a protective effect on microglia cells by protecting them against death and the ability to reduce the signs and morphological changes associated with neurological inflammation. These authors also indicated that leaf extracts are characterized by better activity than fruit extracts, which probably results from a greater number of biologically active compounds in the leaves, which was confirmed by HPLC&#x02013;MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. These studies indicate that the intake of blueberry leaves in the form of dried herbs, extracts, teas or as additives to medicinal products can have a neuroprotective function and play a large role in the chemoprevention of many different diseases, including inflammatory ones. Studies to assess the viability of two colon cell lines (HT29 and SW948) also showed the cytotoxicity of blackberry leaf extracts in a concentration-dependent manner. In these studies, the extract obtained from <italic>R. caesius</italic> leaves reduced the growth of cancer cells, affecting both their morphology and metabolism. LC&#x02013;MS studies of the analyzed extracts additionally showed that the leaves of these plants contain a wide range of polyphenols, which due to the well-known antioxidant activity may play an important role here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Research also indicates the extremely valuable properties and chemopreventive role of various berries in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. A very important aspect that should be taken into account when using berry extracts is the dose, because although they contain many substances with valuable properties, their excess may have a negative impact on our health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. The results obtained as part of this work on skin cells in vitro also confirmed the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of leaf extracts of the studied plants. Numerous studies indicate that berries, being a rich source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties, can be helpful in preventing inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and play a significant role in chemoprevention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Literature data also indicate that berry extracts can have a positive effect on fibroblasts, protecting them from oxidative damage. This action is closely related to the content of compounds present in these plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Other authors also confirm the positive effect of berries on keratinocyte damage caused by UV-B irradiation by reducing the level of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">The different effects of individual plants on the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts observed in this work are probably caused by the different composition of biologically active compounds contained in individual extracts. Articles describing bioactive compounds in berry leaves indicate that they contain primarily various phenolic acids, flavonols, esters, anthocyanins and procyanidins. These parts of berry plants are also a rich source of chlorogenic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This compound has a proven positive effect on the skin by increasing cell proliferation, affecting inflammatory processes, accelerating wound healing and collagen IV synthesis. It also has antioxidant properties, which is associated with an increase in superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione activity as well as a decrease in the degree of lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Literature data indicate that various compounds of plant origin have a different effect on cell proliferation, hence the content of individual compounds and interactions between them will strictly affect the final effect of the extracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Also, the concentration of individual compounds in the obtained extracts is of great importance for the effect of their action on cells, as numerous studies indicate a dose-dependent effect of compounds of plant origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. The anthocyanins and anthocyanidins contained in the tested plants can also affect cell viability, because, as shown by studies by Wang et al., in low concentrations these compounds can cause arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, while at higher concentrations the cycle is inhibited in phase G2/M. Higher concentrations may also result in cell death&#x02014;both necrotic and apoptotic. The induction of apoptosis by polyphenolic compounds is associated with the caspase family and the effect on p53, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-X1 levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Moreover, anthocyanins can also cause loss of mitochondrial membrane potential of apoptotic cells and typical PARP-1 degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Literature data also indicate that compounds of plant origin may affect cell proliferation by acting as bioactive mediators and by participating in the regulation of cell division and differentiation. This effect is associated with the impact on complex signal paths such as, for example, BMP2, Runx2 and Wnt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Thus, the different effect of individual extracts will probably be based on different proportions of individual groups of biologically active compounds in the extracts we have obtained. Due to the fact that there are only a few studies pointing to the fact that the leaves are equally valuable material that can show beneficial effects on various types of cells, including skin, this paper may increase interest in this plant material and expand its use, also in preparations intended for the care and treatment of skin diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Scratch wound assay</title><p id="Par32">The next stage of the research was to assess the possibility of using the obtained leaf extracts as potential components of preparations that may find application in the treatment of wounds occurring in various skin diseases and resulting from the use of various methods of their treatment. The wound healing test used for this purpose is a test enabling evaluation of both migration and cell morphology in real time. This method is widely used in research on the process of wound healing, angiogenesis as well as the processes of metastasis of various types of cancer. This test is used by all to analyze the migration of cells, such as fibroblasts or keratinocytes, which are characterized by the ability to collective migration, also known as "sheet migration"<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. The ability to stimulate migration by substances of natural origin is extremely desirable, because this property, in addition to well-known antioxidant properties, can have a positive effect on the condition and renewal of the skin after various dermatological and cosmetological treatments. The scratch test procedure involves performing a linear scratch in the monolayer of the tested cell line with appropriate confluence, and estimating cell migration resulting in gap clogging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. The assessment of the migration capacity of the cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts tested was carried out after 24&#x000a0;h of incubation with the obtained water-glycerin extracts. This time was used to minimize the role of cell proliferation and be limited to assessing the ability of cells to migrate. As recommended, for this purpose, a lower FBS concentration (1%) in the culture medium (serum starvation) was used compared to the concentration used during normal keratinocyte and fibroblast culture (10%) (Vang Mouritzen and Jenssen, 2018). The results of the experiments carried out as part of this work showed that the analyzed extracts obtained from the leaves <italic>of Ribes nigrum L., Vaccinium myrtillus L., Rubus fruticosus L.,</italic> and <italic>Fragaria vesca L.</italic> affect the migration process of the tested cells to varying degrees. These results correlate with cytotoxicity tests, as it has been observed that the concentration of extracts that caused cytotoxic activity on keratinocytes or fibroblasts also inhibited the migration of these cells. The greatest ability to stimulate keratinocyte migration was demonstrated by the extract obtained from <italic>R. fruticosus L.</italic> leaves, which, when the concentration of 1.0% was used, resulted in almost complete closure of the gap. However, it was observed that higher concentration (5.0%) stimulates migration to a lesser extent and the number of cells in a break is smaller. Another plant showing the ability to induce HaCaT cell migration was <italic>V. myrtillus L.</italic>, which also showed the best activity at a concentration of 1%. For the other two extracts, no induction of migration was observed. Only at the lowest concentrations in the scratch made few cells were observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At higher concentrations (5.0% and 10.0%), morphological changes of cells and cell detachment from the surface of culture plates were observed, which confirms the above-demonstrated cytotoxic effect of higher extract concentrations (data not shown).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The effect of water-glycerin leaf extracts from <italic>Ribes nigrum L., Vaccinium myrtillus L, Rubus fruticosus L.</italic> and <italic>Fragaria vesca L.</italic> (at a concentration of 0.5&#x02013;2.5%) on the migration of HaCaT cells after a 24-h incubation in a scratch test.

This ability is characterized primarily by the extract of <italic>R. fruticosus L.</italic> leaves, which in both 0.5% and 1.0% concentration caused the migration of cells to the entire surface of the crack. Good results have also been observed after treatment of fibroblasts with 0.5% concentration of <italic>F. vesca L</italic>. In the case of <italic>V. myrtillus L.</italic> no increase in fibroblast migration was observed, whereas after using <italic>R. nigrum L.</italic> the increase was negligible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Due to the large amount of biologically active compounds that occur in both the leaves and fruits of the plants studied, it seems reasonable to carry out research aimed at assessing the possibility of using leaf extracts in preparations used to accelerate the process of wound healing. Esposito et al. in their research on the effects of <italic>Vaccinium uliginosum</italic> extracts, they demonstrated that the compounds they contain promote wound closure and can affect early stages of healing by stimulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, as well as increasing the expression of important extracellular matrix proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Our analyzes have shown that the best activity to stimulate the migration of cells, both fibroblasts and keratinocytes, has blackberry leaf extract. Other authors also pointed to the positive effect of these fruits on skin fibroblast migration processes, which, as they explain, was closely related to the high content of polyphenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. The positive effect on the in vivo wound healing process caused by extracts from <italic>R. nigrum</italic> leaf has been shown by Kendir et al. Who associated this effect with well-known anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, which plays an important role in wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">Cell migration is an important step in creating and repairing tissues. The proper migration of cells is an extremely important aspect necessary for the proper course of various processes in the human body. It is not only associated with wound repair, but also plays an important role in the immune response and maintaining tissue homeostasis. On the other hand, disorders in migration processes result in various pathological conditions, including tumor metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Thus, the scratch test is a technique used by many researchers conducting research on understanding the mechanisms of action of various compounds of medical importance on the process of wound healing in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. Research is being conducted around the world to find the answer to what most impacts these processes. Undoubtedly, they depend on many factors, among which biochemical communication via paracrine signaling as well as gap connections are important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. The mobility and migration capacity of cells treated with various compounds or extracts also depend on their adhesive strength, mechanical flexibility as well as external migration signals and cues. Equal dimensions and organization of the cell cytoskeleton are important here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>. Migration processes, which are a very important stage enabling the proper course of wound healing, are also closely dependent on the selective activation of cells at the edge of the wound and also by the cohesion forces occurring between the migrating cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. The ways in which cells can move during the migration process can be different and depend on the type of cell being analyzed. Some of them can travel in groups consisting of cell chains and other forms of sheet-like layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. However, it is worth noting here that some authors suggest that coherence and biochemical communication between migrating cells is not a prerequisite for observing this phenomenon.

The innovation in this work was mainly based on the choice as the raw material of the leaves of the analyzed berry plants, which, unfortunately, are underestimated in various industries, including the cosmetics industry. This choice also allowed to minimize the use of natural resources, since those plant parts that were usually seen as waste material were used to produce these extracts. Of course, the analyzed raw materials were widely used in traditional medicine, but they are still niche products in the cosmetics industry. The research additionally showed that the extracts are multifunctional, have a wide spectrum of health-promoting properties, and are also safe to use, which significantly expands their range of applications. Our results revealed that all investigated extracts from leaves of <italic>R. nigrum L., V. myrtillus L., R. fruticosus L., F. vesca L.</italic> were rich in phenolic compounds and demonstrated good antioxidant activity. The substances contained in the leaves of analyzed plants, particularly polyphenolic compounds, have beneficial properties for health. These substances could have potential use in the prevention of lifestyle diseases. The results have shown that lower concentrations of analyzed plants, mainly 0.5 and 1.0%, had a positive effect on fibroblasts and keratinocytes.
