On the other way round, it has been well documented that the plants take two paths of immune defense responses to react against the virulent infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The first defense mechanism is pathogen-associated molecular patterns/microbe-associated molecular pattern (PAMP/MAMP)-triggered downstream genes that cause asymptomatic or non-small H responses, which are PAMP pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) or non-host resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The second defense mechanism is the pathogenic effector protein triggered downstream genes, which result in a race-specific H response and it is effector-triggered immunity (ETI) or vertical resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the understanding of underlying biochemical mechanisms and genetic backgrounds of plant resistance remains elusive. Also, the biochemical mechanism-based strategies to precisely prevent and control plant disease have not been reported.</p><p id="Par35">Metabolic signaling in plants is crucial in both physiological as well as biochemical infection resistance system, making it a promising direction of enhancing plant disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Metabolites produced by plants are the most direct products responding to external stresses. And these direct products are subsequently reflected by symptomatic phenotypes of plants under stress state. Carbohydrates and amino acids are the primary metabolites responsible to combat the stress in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. When pathogenic fungi infect plants, sugar levels in plant tissues elevate to activate plant defense responses, which participate in regulating hormonal signaling network of plant immune system and induce plants to present stronger resistance to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Diverse organic oxygen compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], benzenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and organic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] play an important role in plant defense responses. Critical metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, galactose metabolism, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, ABC transporters, etc., are activated when plants are infected by pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the understanding of certain related pathways in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and ABC transporters could provide a provoking insight for a more specific genetic modification platform to strengthen plant resistance systems.</p><p id="Par36">The application of metabolomics in studying interactions between plants and pathogens has achieved significant progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. By performing metabolomic analysis, certain metabolites could be identified and employed as the potential biomarkers during infection responses by <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By applying synthetic precursors for some important secondary defense metabolites, such as phenylalanine, allantoin, glutamate, thiamine, glycine, serine, asparagine, trehalose, etc., plants not only achieve growth but also boost resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Based on the metabolomic data, the selection of crucial metabolites as exogenous treatment of plants is conducive to the growth and resistance of plants, which is beneficial to environmental protection of farmland and low/zero pesticides as well. Hence, exogenous metabolites have great potential for application in environmental control of plant diseases. It has been reported that transgenic plants with heterologous expression of effector gene can be used as an ideal model for identifying effective plant resistance resources. The mechanism of plant resistance enhancement at the molecular level has already been standardized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but there are no reports available that deciphers the biochemical mechanism for improving the resistance. In a previous report, it was found that the growth of MoSDT1-transgenic rice was approximately comparable with that of wild-type rice; however, the resistance against <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was significantly improved in MoSDT1-transgenic rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. UHPLC-Q-TOF MS was utilized to identify the metabolites and metabolic pathway alterations in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infected MoSDT1-transgenic rice at different time points, characterize key metabolites that were released in response to the infection, and analyzed leading metabolite expressions of synthetic genes along with defense-related genes in MoSDT1-transgenic rice. We employed standard products as alternatives of defensive metabolites to treat wild-type rice (it is to pre-inoculate rice with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and then implement spray treatment with atomized compounds after 72&#x02009;h), then recorded the symptoms of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-infected rice and determined the role of these key defense metabolites in elevating resistance in rice. The present study reveals the mechanism at the biochemical level for improving the resistance of MoSDT1-transgenic rice infected with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and provides fundamental data for the prevention of plant diseases in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Differential metabolites identified from MoSDT1-transgenic line inoculated with blast strain</title><p id="Par37">Primary metabolites of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-infected MoSDT1<italic>-</italic>transgenic rice at 0&#x02009;h, 72&#x02009;h, and 120&#x02009;h were identified by UHPLC-Q-TOF MS.

Our prior study confirmed that the heterologous expression of MoSDT1 in rice increases tiller numbers without affecting its nuclear morphology. Most importantly, it also resulted in a significant increase in resistance to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> in rice, mainly presented with early induction of massive callose deposition, ROS accumulation, cell death, and regulation of defense-related gene expression in infected MoSDT1-transgenic rice. Moreover, specific primary metabolites that participate in defense response accumulated in MoSDT1-transgenic rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To further investigate the biochemical mechanism of the enhanced resistance in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-infected MoSDT1-transgenic rice, the metabolomics was analyzed to better explore the core metabolites and critical metabolic pathways of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-infected MoSDT1-transgenic rice.</p><p id="Par44">Organic oxygen compounds, organic acids, enzymes, and glycoside are the first category of metabolites produced by infected plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The accumulation of organic oxygen compounds such as sucrose, raffinose, galactinol, D-mannose, and maltotriose was identified at 0&#x02009;h, 72&#x02009;h, and 120&#x02009;h in this study. D-mannose is mainly involved in synthesizing ascorbic acid, which is an antioxidant and cell reductant, and the improvement of antioxidant capacity is one of the characteristics of plant resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Galactinol is also involved in inducing resistance in plant systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Glyceric acid is up-regulated in <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>-infected resistant rice and participates in photorespiration and plant defense response regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, this indicates that the above illustrated organic oxygen compounds are unique metabolites accumulated in infected transgenic rice, and their biochemical and structural defense state with high antioxidant capacity were at the activation stage. The amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways to which these accumulated metabolites belong were also activated. Therefore, the resistance in infected transgenic rice was strengthened.</p><p id="Par45">Linoleic acid and linolenic acid are lipids that were found to accumulate at 72&#x02009;h. Linolenic acid is a precursor of jasmonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that plays a vital role in plant defense response. Thus up-regulated linolenic acid is a unique metabolite of infected transgenic rice. Subsequently, a further experiment validated an increase in jasmonic acid concentration at 120&#x02009;h. Consistently, linoleic acid involved linoleic acid metabolism at 72&#x02009;h.</p><p id="Par46">L-glutamine is involved in stress response in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Kan et al. found that glutamine can be used in the act of a signal molecule to modify expression patterns of plants. The prompt evocation of transcription factors indicates that glutamine can effectively intensify its signaling and engage with diverse signaling communication pathways to determine the growth of plant and its stress responses. Therefore, glutamine is an underlying effective amino acid that takes a critical role in nutrition and signaling transductions of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. L-tryptophan was found to accumulate at 72&#x02009;h, indicating that the infected transgenic rice continues to grow. Oxalate has a dual role by inhibiting plant defense responses at the early stages of infection while also inducing reactive oxygen species and cell death at later stages of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In our study, the concentration of oxalate decreased at 72&#x02009;h, which was beneficial as it enhanced the ability of ROS clearance in infected transgenic rice and inhibited cell death. Most of these unique metabolites are involved in the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), thus indicating the activation of this pathway.</p><p id="Par47">Benzenoids accumulated at different time-points in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-infected transgenic rice, in which salicylic acid and anthranilic acid (Vitamin L1) accumulated at three-time points. Anthranilic acid (AA) is a vital precursor in the synthesis of major auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], essential for maintaining the growth of infected transgenic rice. While salicylic acid plays a vital role in defense response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], suggesting that MoSDT1 may play a role in balancing rice growth and defenses. Dopamine has an anti-aging effect that regulates the absorption and transport of nutrients by plants, which ultimately affects the overall growth of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Tyramine accumulation, which is beneficial to increase resistance, was induced when barley was infected by <italic>Bipolaris sorokiniana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, the accumulation of dopamine and tyramine in transgenic rice is beneficial to improve resistance.

L-tyrosine, an aromatic amino acid, is a precursor of lignin in plants of the grass family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. D-biotin plays an essential role in combating <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection and promoting rice growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Meanwhile, D-biotin could also inhibit ROS accumulation and the appearance of lesion-mimic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Diosmetin, a flavonoid compound with antioxidant activity, protects plant tissues from oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Myo-inositol also plays a crucial role in the tolerance of abiotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These results indicate that these metabolites play an essential role in maintaining the growth of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>-infected transgenic rice, keeping a dynamic balance of ROS accumulation and clearance, initiating structural defense response, and the restriction of spotted-lesion expansion and enhanced resistance of MoSDT1-transgenic rice.</p><p id="Par49">Collectively, during the infection of MoSDT1-transgenic rice with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> at three-time points, organic oxygen compounds, lipids, and lipid-like molecules, benzenoids, organic acids, and derivatives, together with many unclassified primary defensive metabolites accumulated. Metabolic pathways involved with these metabolites are attributed to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways, which play a key role in stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, these activated pathways participated in rice defense responses. This study found that at 72&#x02009;h, the accumulation of defensive metabolites reached a peak, indicating that 72&#x02009;h was the time for most active defense response, which was also the time point at which brown spotted lesions began to appear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

In brief, 95234I-1b strain exhibited with strong virulence and could infect rice variety ilimi which further result with severe symptoms of rice blast disease. However, overexpression of <italic>MoSDT1</italic> in ilimi significantly increased the resistance of rice to this strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In order to further study the metabolic mechanism of interactions between MoSDT1-transgenic rice and 95234I-1b, we proceed by using 95234I-1b to infect MoSDT1-transgenic rice as research materials.</p><p id="Par62">Rice seeds of #10 and WT were sterilized in 75% alcohol for 1&#x02009;min, washed three times in sterile water, followed by sterilizing in 1.5% hypochlorite solution for 5&#x02009;min, and finally washed three times in sterile water.
