    "Many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria rely on a functional type III secretion system (T3SS), which injects multiple effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells, for their pathogenicity. Genetic studies conducted in different host-microbe pathosystems often revealed a sophisticated regulatory mechanism of their T3SSs, suggesting that the expression of T3SS is tightly controlled and constantly monitored by bacteria in response to the ever-changing host environment. Therefore, it is critical to understand the regulation of T3SS in pathogenic bacteria for successful disease management. This review focuses on a model plant pathogen, <i>Dickeya</i><i>dadantii</i>, and summarizes the current knowledge of its T3SS regulation. We highlight the roles of several T3SS regulators that were recently discovered, including the transcriptional regulators: FlhDC, RpoS, and SlyA; the post-transcriptional regulators: PNPase, Hfq with its dependent sRNA ArcZ, and the RsmA/B system; and the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). Homologs of these regulatory components have also been characterized in almost all major bacterial plant pathogens like <i>Erwinia</i><i>amylovora</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i><i>syringae</i>, <i>Pectobacterium</i> spp., <i>Xanthomonas</i> spp., and <i>Ralstonia</i> spp. The second half of this review shifts focus to an in-depth discussion of the innovation and development of T3SS inhibitors, small molecules that inhibit T3SSs, in the field of plant pathology. This includes T3SS inhibitors that are derived from plant phenolic compounds, plant coumarins, and salicylidene acylhydrazides. We also discuss their modes of action in bacteria and application for controlling plant diseases."
