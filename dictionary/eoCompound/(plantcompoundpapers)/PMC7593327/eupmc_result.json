    "Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are an ancient form of tissue-derived danger or alarm signals that initiate cellular signaling cascades, which often initiate defined defense responses. A DAMP can be any molecule that is usually not exposed to cells such as cell wall components, peptides, nucleic acid fragments, eATP and other compounds. DAMPs might be revealed upon tissue damage or during attack. Typically, DAMPs are derived from the injured organism. Almost all eukaryotes can generate and respond to DAMPs, including plants. Besides the molecules mentioned, certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be considered as DAMPs. Due to their chemical nature, VOCs are supposed to act not only locally and systemically in the same plant but also between plants. Here, we focus on damage-induced volatiles (DIVs) that might be regarded as DAMPs; we will review their origin, chemical nature, physiochemical properties, biological relevance and putative function in plant-plant communications. Moreover, we discuss the possibility to use such airborne DAMPs as eco-friendly compounds to stimulate natural defenses in agriculture in order to avoid pesticides."
