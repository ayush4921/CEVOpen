    "The thermal degradation of linalool-chemotype <i>Cinnamomum osmophloeum</i> leaf essential oil and the stability effect of microencapsulation of leaf essential oil with β-cyclodextrin were studied. After thermal degradation of linalool-chemotype leaf essential oil, degraded compounds including β-myrcene, <i>cis</i>-ocimene and <i>trans</i>-ocimene, were formed through the dehydroxylation of linalool; and ene cyclization also occurs to linalool and its dehydroxylated products to form the compounds such as limonene, terpinolene and α-terpinene. The optimal microencapsulation conditions of leaf essential oil microcapsules were at a leaf essential oil to the β-cyclodextrin ratio of 15:85 and with a solvent ratio (ethanol to water) of 1:5. The maximum yield of leaf essential oil microencapsulated with β-cyclodextrin was 96.5%. According to results from the accelerated dry-heat aging test, β-cyclodextrin was fairly stable at 105 °C, and microencapsulation with β-cyclodextrin can efficiently slow down the emission of linalool-chemotype <i>C. osmophloeum</i> leaf essential oil."
