    "<h4>Background</h4> There have been several studies carried out to irradiate Helminthiasis however very little research have been carried out where in the enzymatic activity of plants are exploited to antagonize infections. Here we are analyzing the anthelmintic activity of Cinnamomum cappara leaf extract against Pheretima posthuma complimented by proteolytic action. <h4>Results</h4> The fresh leaves of Cinnamomum cappara was collected from local areas of Thrissur during December 2019. Plants were identified and authenticated by morphological and molecular characterization. The enzymatic action was analyzed by plotting Lineweaver–Burk plot which suggested that the extract possess the Km 185.77 μM for casein as substrate and obeyed Michaelis–Menten kinetics with typical hyperbolic relation with enzyme and increasing concentration of substrate. The effect of extract upon study subject was in directly proportional with concentration of antagonist where higher activities were obtained in high concentrations. The anatomical and histological studies suggested that the activity of extract was due to the degradation of muscular bundle of subject that resulted in the leakage of ceolomic fluid. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Cinnamomum cappara leaf extract possessed high degree of protease intervened anthelmintic activity against Pheretima posthuma. As the study subject show immense morphological and physiological resemblance with all other helminthic parasites, this results shall be adopted to further clinical and pharmacological applications."
