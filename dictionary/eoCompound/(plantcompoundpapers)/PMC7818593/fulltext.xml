(TAG) gets absorbed and accumulated
in the body through the monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway, which plays
a major role in obesity and related disorders. The main enzyme of
this pathway, monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (MGAT2), is considered
as a potential target for developing antiobesity compounds. Hence,
there is a need for <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based assays for
screening the potential leads for MGAT2 inhibitors. Because of synthetic
inhibitor&#x02019;s side effects, there is an increased interest in
natural extracts as potential leads. Hence, we have optimized a 2-MAG-induced
TAG accumulation inhibitory cell-based assay to screen natural extracts
using the HIEC-6 cell line. A concentration-dependent TAG accumulation
was observed when the HIEC-6 cells were fed with exogenous 2-MAG.
The TAG accumulation was confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> BODIPY
staining and was quantified. However, no TAG accumulation was seen
when the cells were fed with exogenous DAG or TAG, suggesting MGAT2-mediated
MAG uptake and its conversion to TAG. We demonstrated the utility
of this assay by screening five different plant-based aqueous extracts.
These extracts showed various inhibition levels (25% to 30%) of 2-MAG-induced
TAG accumulation in the HIEC-6. The MGAT2 inhibitory potential of
these extracts was confirmed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> MGAT2
assay. This cell-based assay adds a new methodology for screening,
developing, and evaluating MGAT2 inhibitors for addressing obesity
and related disorders.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c05950</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c05950</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity
is defined as excess storage of fat in the body due to
the variation between energy intake and energy expenditure. The modern
diet and sedentary lifestyle are important factors that have a link
with obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The dietary lipids are digested
by pancreatic lipase and are hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol (MAG)
and free fatty acids. The MAG gets absorbed in the intestine and re-esterified
back to triacylglycerol (TAG) by the MAG pathway.</p><p>This re-esterification
is significant and is carried out by two
major enzymes: monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) and diacylglycerol
acyltransferase (DGAT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The esterified
TAG gets into circulation and is accumulated in the body, which under
certain conditions leads to obesity. Three isoforms of MGAT, namely,
MGAT1, MGAT2, and MGAT3, have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> In
both mice and humans, MGAT2 is highly expressed in the small intestine,
and the inhibition of MGAT2 can be a potential target to develop anti-obesity
drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Hence, in recent
years, MGAT2 is studied as a critical target for addressing morbid
obesity and its associated comorbidities such as type-2 diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, and osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Many synthetic inhibitors for MGAT2 have been reported, but
detailed
pharmacological inhibition characteristics have not been performed
in most of these studies. However, Okuma et al. studied a novel MGAT2
inhibitor&#x02014;JTP103237 and evaluated its pharmacological profiling.
The MGAT2 inhibitor would be useful in obesity by restricting excessive
fat intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Synthetic MGAT2 inhibitors
that block fat absorption are mostly patented but not commercialized
because of low gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability and safety considerations.
MGAT2 inhibition with natural plant extracts alleviates commercial
synthetic drugs&#x02019; side effects to control obesity and is considered
to be the safest approach. This therapeutic approach for MGAT2 inhibition
provides superior efficacy concerning GI tolerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Thus, MGAT2 is a suitable target, and plant-based extracts
are appropriate for treating obesity and other metabolic disorders.</p><p>Several attempts have been made, such as overexpression of the
enzyme, inhibition by synthetic inhibitors, and isotope-labeled substrate
with high-resolution LC/MS, to devise assays to screen for MGAT2 inhibitors.
However, these assays are unwieldy, sophisticated, and time-consuming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Hence, there is a need for an effective, economic, and efficient
assay strategy based on a simple substrate and efficient screening
system. The presence of MGAT2 enzyme activity in the intestine justifies
a suitable cell line system, preferably with enterocytes such as Caco-2
or HIEC-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Moreover, according to various
studies, for MGAT2 enzyme activity, the application of HIEC-6 cell
line models is the most suitable than conventional cell lines such
as Caco-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Thus, the present study
aimed to develop an effective cell-based
assay to screen various plant extracts for MGAT2 inhibition. The HIEC-6
cell line-based assay was optimized to assess inhibition of 2-MAG-induced
TAG accumulation in the cells. Finally, this assay&#x02019;s utility
was demonstrated by screening five different plant-based aqueous extracts
in this cell-based assay. The MGAT2 inhibitory potential of these
extracts was confirmed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> MGAT2 assay
using mouse intestinal microsomes. Moreover, the extracts were characterized
for the constituents and the antioxidant properties to correlate with
the MGAT2 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Feeding

in the HIEC-6 Cell Line</title><p>The HIEC-6 cells were fed with exogenous
2-MAG, diacylglycerol (DAG), and TAG, each at four different increasing
concentrations. The concentration of accumulated TAG in the cells
was estimated, and the results are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. The media control and vehicle control showed
a basal level of TAG present in the cells. However, the cells fed

dose-dependent manner. The 2-MAG-induced TAG formation was also visualized
by BODIPY staining of HIEC-6 cells. The BODIPY stains neutral lipid
droplets that consist mostly of TAG and show them as distinctive green
fluorescent spots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). As can be seen, the TAG formation was at the basal levels
in the cells incubated with media and with the vehicle alone. The
presence of 2-MAG at 100, 200, and 400 &#x003bc;M concentration in media
facilitated TAG formation in HIEC-cells in a concentration-dependent
manner as observed from the increase in fluorescence vis-&#x000e0;-vis

of Plant Extracts on MGAT2 Activity
in the Intestinal Microsome</title><p>In the HIEC-6 based assay, the
plant extracts used in this study showed inhibition of 2-MAG-induced

U.S population and a significant risk factor for many disorders such
as diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases,
and a few types of cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref></sup> Because
of safety and efficacy concerns, only 3% of the obese population is
treated with orlistat, phentermine, lorcaserin, and topiramate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">101</xref></sup> Orlistat is a major drug that blocks fat absorption
by approximately 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">102</xref></sup> However, the use
of orlistat is limited because of its low GI tolerability. Hence,
there is a need to find alternative remedies for similar drug targets
with improved GI tolerability.</p><p>The ingested dietary TAG gets
digested to MAG, DAG, and free fatty
acids by pancreatic lipase. These get absorbed in the intestine and
re-esterified back to TAG by two significant enzymes, namely, MGAT2
and DGAT, through the MAG pathway in the enterocyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> These enzymes play a crucial role in TAG biosynthesis.
Upregulation of these enzymes leads to triglyceride accumulation in
adipose tissues leading to metabolic disorders such as obesity and
diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p><p>The obstruction of dietary
TAG absorption and its resynthesis in
the enterocyte has been explored as a potent pathway in targeting
obesity. The MGAT and DGAT inhibitors have been shown to control and
treat these metabolic diseases and currently few DGAT inhibitors are
in clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> The mgat2 gene manipulation
and pharmacological treatment with MGAT2 inhibitors in mice delay
fat absorption and suppress plasma TAG. This leads to decreased food
intake and weight loss, which supports targeting the MAG pathway as
a potent and viable therapeutic target for intestinal TAG resynthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> By inhibiting MGAT2 in the intestine, vital changes in TAG and cholesterol
absorption lead to the release of gut incretin and changes in systemic
energy homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Few such compounds/formulations
are in various stages of preclinical and clinical trials. These remedies
are now gaining significant importance in treating metabolic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Most of the MGAT2 inhibitors have been patented
by pharmaceutical companies, such as bicyclic pyrimidine derivatives
by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma in Japan, isoindoline-2-carboxamide and
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo,
morpholinyl derivatives by Eli Lilly and Co., USA, tetrahydropyridopyrimidinone
derivatives by Ajinomoto Co., Japan, sulfonamide derivatives by Takeda
Pharma Co., Osaka, Japan, pyridinone derivatives by Bristol Myers
Squibb Co., USA, and dihydropyridinone analogues by Merck Sharp and
Dohme Corp., Canada. The known MGAT2 inhibitors are pure chemical
compounds or their derivatives and are associated with various side
effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup></p><p>A simple, robust, throughput
assay method is warranted to accelerate
the discovery of safe drugs/compounds with fewer side effects. For
profiling such MGAT2 inhibitors, a cell-based assay of MGAT2-driven
DAG with murine secretin tumor cells-1 was developed by Bristol Myers
Squibb Co., USA. However, the utilization of isotope labeling and
high-resolution LC/MS limited scope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Park
et al. optimized the enzyme activity assay for screening MGAT2 inhibitors
with MGAT2 expression in hMGAT2-Hep3B cells. The sophisticated expression
studies limited the assay utility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> In
another study, a chemical probe method with enzyme inhibitory kinetics
by binding of MGAT2 inhibitors to MGAT2 was developed but limited
the scope, as a cell-based assay is preferred over the <italic>ex
situ</italic> enzyme binding method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Hence,
the present assay based on HIEC-6 cells with 2-MAG helps overcome
the shortcomings and can be a simple, substrate-driven robust technique
to screen MGAT2 inhibitors.</p><p>In our study, the 2-MAG was fed
to HIEC-6 cells, and we had evaluated
the TAG accumulation to standardize the MGAT2 inhibition assay. The
exogenous 2-MAG at various concentrations were provided to cells to
assess triglycerides in the cells. With the increase in the concentration
of 2-MAG, there was an increase in TAG formation in the cells. To
analyze the effect of other MAG pathway intermediates on TAG accumulation,
cells were fed with exogenous DAG and TAG at different concentrations.
It was observed that neither DAG nor TAG had any effect on TAG accumulation
in the cells. This demonstrates that only 2-MAG was able to enter
the cells. The MGAT and DGAT utilized the endogenous acyl-CoAs for
sequential esterification, resulting in TAG formation by the MAG pathway.
The BODIPY was used to stain the neutral lipids and showed distinctive
green fluorescent spots. The presence of 2-MAG at 100, 200, and 400
&#x003bc;M concentration in media facilitated TAG formation in HIEC-cells
in a concentration-dependent manner as observed from the increase
in fluorescence vis-&#x000e0;-vis the accumulation of TAG. The MGAT2
inhibition prevents the TAG accumulation by minimizing the conversion
of MAG to DAG and finally to TAG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Hence,
this HIEC-6 cells-based assay can be used to screen for inhibitors
that prevent TAG formation in the presence of 2-MAG via MGAT2 inhibition.</p><p>There are no known proven MGAT2 inhibitors in the market. Besides,
most pharma companies patented such inhibitors and are at different
clinical/preclinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> We could
not obtain any known MGAT2 inhibitor to validate the present assay
method. Because of the scope of safe and potent anti-obese leads from
plant sources, we have chosen the natural extracts with potent bioactive
substances/compounds to validate the present assay. Incidentally,
the cell-based assay developed with HIEC-6 cells could be validated
with plant extracts with proven anti-obesity properties.</p><p>After
standardization of the MGAT inhibition assay, five plant
extracts on 2-MAG-induced TAG accumulation in HIEC-6 were studied.
Unuofin et al. reported the anti-obesity activity of <italic>Vernoniam espilifolia</italic> extracts <italic>in vitro</italic> using HeLa cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Shen et al. investigated
the effect of chia oil on TAG accumulation in the HepG2 cell line
model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> wherein the Mexican chia oil lowered
TAG accumulation by 25.8% in the cells. In the current study, the <italic>Z. officinale</italic> extract showed the maximum inhibition
(29.25%) of TAG accumulation. Our results showed that the HIEC-6 cell-based
assay could be used to screen the plant extracts that can inhibit
2-MAG-induced TAG accumulation.</p><p>All the extracts were used to
study the effect on 2-MAG-induced
TAG accumulation in the HIEC-6 cells, and the <italic>V. vinifera</italic> extract and <italic>Z. officinale</italic> extracts
showed the least TAG accumulation. Further, the plant extracts were
assayed for MGAT2 activity with intestinal microsomes. The absorption
of dietary fat in the enterocytes involves the re-esterification of
digested TAG by MGAT2. The <italic>Z. officinale</italic> and <italic>V. vinifera</italic> extracts revealed
better DAG formation control and showed promising inhibition of MGAT2
activity.</p><p>The antioxidant activity of extracts was evaluated
by three different
methods and was compared. All the aqueous extracts showed good antioxidant
activities. The HPLC profiling of the various plant extracts revealed
that they were rich in few polyphenols with good antioxidant activity.
The major polyphenols present in these plant extracts were curcumin,
epicatechin, cinnamic acid, myricetin, rosmarinic acid, piperine,
and quercetin. The polyphenols were identified by HPLC and matched
with those reported in earlier literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup></p><p>The MGAT2
inhibition activities of the extracts studied using mouse
intestinal microsomes align with the cell-based assay results. Therefore,
the HIEC-6 based assay can be used to screen for potential MGAT2 inhibitors.
It has also given an insight into potent bioactive MGAT2 inhibitors
present in natural sources. This assay avoids radio-labeling, gene
expression, and sophisticated equipment; instead, it uses simple cells,
substrate, and methodology. Hence, this can be used as a simple and
robust assay for screening MGAT2 inhibitors. It will be interesting
to screen synthetic or chemical inhibitors using the described assay.
Besides, this assay can be automated, and high throughput screening
can be performed with the help of robotics to screen compound libraries.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>To accelerate the drug discovery process
for metabolic disorders
such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, there is a need for simple, robust assays. In our present
study, we developed a simple assay to screen lead molecules for MGAT2
inhibition through the MAG pathway. Even though earlier attempts were
made to evaluate MGAT2 activity by overexpression, cloning, isotope-labeled
substrate, we standardized a simple cell-based assay using the HIEC-6
cell line MGAT-2 inhibition. We found feeding of 2-MAG to cells led
to the accumulation of triglycerides mimicking the adipogenicity in
obese condition. The same was confirmed by confocal imaging of BODIPY-stained
TAG accumulated cells. The assay was validated by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay with intestinal microsomes as a source of enzyme. Further,
we evaluated the developed assay&#x02019;s efficacy by screening five
different plant-based aqueous extracts for MGAT2 inhibition. This
is the first report for the development and evaluation of cell-based
assay to screen MGAT-2 inhibitors using HIEC-6 cell line.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec5.1"><label>5.1</label><title>Chemicals</title><p>The
