    "Applying organic matters into the soil would help to improve soil quality and sustain crop production. In addition, the small molecular organic matters could be active in influencing soil nutrient cycling and crop development. Thus, this study has firstly induced a new technology of quick artificial decomposition to produce fertilizers containing small molecular organic compounds from crop residues and other biological wastes. The fertilizers were produced via the quick artificial decomposition from biological wastes. The small organic species in the fertilizers were identified by the LC-MS. Field experiments of kiwifruit were conducted to test the effects of fertilizers. In total, 341 species of small organic matters have been determined in the produced fertilizers. The results showed that the organic fertilizers could significantly increase the yields of kiwifruit by 15.2% in contrast with mineral fertilizer treatments. Whereas, the organic fertilizers could enhance the contents of nutritive components in kiwifruits. These results proved that the organic fertilizers containing more small organic matter could be more efficient in promoting crop production."
