Plants are a balanced source of natural antioxidants, but the poor solubility of plant active molecules in aqueous media can be a problem for the formulation of pharmaceutical products. The potential of PlantCrystal technology is known to improve the extraction efficacy and antioxidant capacity (AOC) of different plants. However, it is not yet proved for plant waste. Black tea (BT) infusion is consumed worldwide and thus a huge amount of waste occurs as a result. Therefore, BT waste was recycled into PlantCrystals using small-scale bead milling. Their characteristics were compared with the bulk-materials and tea infusion, including particle size and antioxidant capacity (AOC) in-vitro. Waste PlantCrystals possessed a size of about 280 nm. Their AOC increased with decreasing size according to the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) assays. The AOC of the waste increased about nine-fold upon nanonization, leading to a significantly higher AOC than the bulk-waste and showed no significant difference to the infusion and the used standard according to DPPH assay. Based on the results, it is confirmed that the PlantCrystal technology represents a natural, cost-effective plant-waste recycling method and presents an alternative source of antioxidant phenolic compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>plants</kwd><kwd>plants waste</kwd><kwd><italic>Camellia sinensis</italic></kwd><kwd>black tea</kwd><kwd>PlantCrystals</kwd><kwd>small-scale bead milling</kwd><kwd>nanonization</kwd><kwd>antioxidant capacity</kwd><kwd>ecofriendly pharmaceutics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-00592"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>All human beings are exposed to oxidative stress during their lifespan, caused by byproducts of metabolism, environment and lifestyle-related factors [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is characterized by the production of unstable and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to cellular damage [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, regulation of ROS generation can be a treatment option for oxidative stress disorders. Blocking the activated ROS-related signaling could be another option to prevent oxidative stress-related diseases. Antioxidants are a good treatment option and plants are considered a good and balanced source of natural antioxidants. However, many of their active constituents possess low aqueous solubility and thus formulating them in pharmaceutical or cosmetic products is problematic. </p><p>Recent studies showed that PlantCrystals, i.e., nanosized plant materials, are a novel formulation strategy to increase the solubility and potential of plant molecules and this has already been proved for many different plants in previous studies [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PlantCrystals are composed of plants, parts of plants or plant wastes and can be produced by different wet milling methods, i.e., bead milling or high-pressure homogenization [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The particle size of PlantCrystals is below 10 &#x000b5;m, which ensures the complete destruction of all intact plant cells leading to more efficient extraction of the plant material without the use of organic solvents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PlantCrystal technology is a promising, smart and easy method, which allows using the whole plants or even their wastes in pharmaceutics and cosmetics [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Using this ecofriendly method to improve the antioxidant capacity of plants is already proven [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The aim of this study was to go one step further and use plant waste to produce antioxidant formulations. Therefore, the waste of black tea (BT), <italic>Camelia sinensis</italic> (L.) from family <italic>Theaceae</italic>, was chosen.</p><p>Over the years, BT is used as an infusion of dried and fermented tea leaves in hot water and is considered the most consumed beverage worldwide after water [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Its extracts are also used to increase its therapeutic potential [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Black tea is usually used not only because of its taste, aroma and cultural practices but also due to its health values associated with its antioxidative properties. Tea is used for its antibacterial, hypocholesterolemic, anticarcinogenic and antiallergenic effects [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, regular consumption of tea reduces inflammatory bowel, liver disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and even triggers weight loss [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These effects are related to the rich phytochemicals in tea leaves, for example, polyphenols and flavonoids. </p><p>Tons of tea-leaves waste are produced annually, because fresh prepared black tea infusion and/or ready-made tea (packed into cans and/or bottles) are consumed all over the world [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most of the waste is burned, dumped into landfills or used as compost [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, it may be considered a valuable source of antioxidant compounds. </p><p>The aim of this study is to systematically analyze the properties of the BT waste and to introduce its antioxidative molecules using the new green PlantCrystals extraction technology. To improve the AOC of BT waste and extract the insoluble molecules with antioxidative properties without using organic solvents, BT waste was milled to sizes well below the plant cell size. Since it is demonstrated that this PlantCrystal technology is suitable to improve the extraction efficacy of active compounds upon plant nanomilling procedure, total polyphenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total carotenoid content (TCC) must be determined [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, fresh BT leaves were nano milled to compare its PlantCrystals antioxidant capacity to those of waste PlantCrystals. Both PlantCrystals formulations and their corresponding bulk-suspensions were also compared with BT infusion, which served as a control extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In brief, the study was performed in three parts. In the first part, BT infusion was prepared, its TPC, TFC, TCC and antioxidant capacity (AOC) were determined. AOC was determined by electron transfer (ET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms using DPPH<sup>&#x025cf;</sup> (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) assays, respectively. The BT infusion was used as a control extract in this study. The resulted waste was collected and dried at room temperature. In the second part, bulk suspensions of the BT leaves and dried waste were produced by suspending the dried plant powder in a surfactant solution. The surfactant solution was used to physically stabilize the produced plant particles and prevent their agglomeration. These bulk suspensions were also characterized regarding size, TPC, TFC, TCC and AOC. In the third part of the study, PlantCrystals technology was utilized to activate the plant antioxidants. To achieve this, small-scale bead milling was performed to break the plant cells and produce PlantCrystals. All produced PlantCrystal formulations were characterized and compared with the bulk materials and tea infusion regarding physico-chemical properties, TPC, TFC, TCC and AOC using the previously mentioned assays. PlantCrystals physico-chemical properties were analyzed using light microscopy, laser diffraction, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-00592"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-26-00592"><title>2.1. Black Tea (BT) Infusion</title><p>Classical aqueous BT extract (infusion) with 1% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic>) of the dried and unprocessed plant material in hot purified water (as extraction medium) was used as a control extract. This control extract was characterized regarding polyphenol, flavonoid, carotenoid contents and antioxidant capacity (AOC) and the results are shown in <xref rid="molecules-26-00592-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. TPC of the BT infusion was used to determine the amount of hot water-soluble polyphenols, e.g., gallic acid and the value indicated a high amount of extracted polyphenols from the BT infusion. In addition, total flavonoid content (TFC) and total carotenoid content (TCC) were detected with low values of 9 mg QE/g and 2 mg &#x003b2;-carotene/g, respectively (<xref rid="molecules-26-00592-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These low TFC and TCC values can be explained by hydrophobic antioxidants from plants, which are usually poorly water-soluble flavonoids and carotenoids. In other words, in the BT infusion only the water-soluble flavonoids, e.g., theaflavins and thearubigins are presented. These compounds contribute to the BT color, brightness and taste as well as its high AOC. The low TCC value of BT infusion was expected, to analyze the extraction efficacy of the PlantCrystal technology it was necessary to measure it nonetheless.</p><p>In the next step, AOC of the BT infusion was determined by using DPPH<sup>&#x025cf;</sup> (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ORAC assays. AOC using DPPH assay was expressed as IC 50 values, which represent the number of active constituents needed to scavenge 50% of a given amount of free radicals, i.e., low IC 50 values represent a high AOC. This IC 50 value of the BT infusion was similar to the used standard (ascorbic acid (0.008 mg/ml)) as there is no significant difference between their IC 50 values. ORAC assay results also confirmed the high AOC of the tea infusion and showed the highest ORAC value of 55 &#x000b5;mol TE/&#x000b5;g (<xref rid="molecules-26-00592-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The high AOC values of the tea infusion can be explained by the extraction of the hot water-soluble antioxidants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-26-00592"><title>2.2. Bulk-Suspensions from Black Tea (BT) Leaves and Waste</title><p>The bulk-suspensions were produced by mixing the plant powder with surfactant solution (Plantacare2000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1% <italic>w/w</italic>) to obtain a final concentration of 1% (<italic>w/w</italic>) plant suspension.</p><p>The obtained BT bulk suspension and waste bulk suspension were characterized regarding size using light microscopy (LM) and laser diffraction (LD). LM images showed plant parts with irregular shapes randomly distributed in the bulk materials of black tea and its waste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f003">Figure 3</xref>). LD analysis was used to compare the size distributions of the particles visualized by using microscopic images. The size profile is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f004">Figure 4</xref> and showed similar results for the two bulk suspensions as they possessed a size of about 800 &#x000b5;m (d(v)0.99 value), meaning that 99% of the measured particles were below 800 &#x000b5;m.</p><p>The determination of total polyphenol content revealed a high TPC value for the bulk material obtained from BT leaves and about 4-fold lower TPC value of the bulk suspension obtained from the waste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast to this, the TFC value of the waste bulk suspension was doubled in comparison to the bulk suspension of the BT leaves, this difference was not significant. However, the TCC value of the bulk waste was 2-fold higher than the BT leaves bulk suspension. This difference was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>According to the DPPH assay, the BT bulk suspension showed a low IC 50 value which proves its high AOC. However, the IC 50 value of the bulk suspension from the waste indicated a very weak AOC with a decrease more than 20 times in comparison to the BT leaves bulk materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Both bulk suspensions produced in this study showed significantly lower AOCs (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) when compared to the used standard (ascorbic acid).</p><p>ORAC method is characterized by capturing endogenous radicals that act on oxidized targets and, thus, it is a meaningful tool to express the antioxidant capacity (AOC) of a formulation. The ORAC value of the bulk material of black tea was found to be 41 &#x000b5;mol Trolox equivalent per &#x000b5;g (&#x000b5;mol TE/&#x000b5;g), which proved the high antioxidant activity of black tea. In contrast, the low ORAC value of the waste bulk materials indicates the occurred washing out of the soluble phytochemicals upon tea preparation (about 11-fold less than the ORAC value of the BT bulk materials) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The explanation for the high AOC of the tea infusion lies in the soluble compounds. These high amounts of water-soluble antioxidants were released during tea preparation and without the need for diminution of the tea leaves by BM. Literature also proves that black tea contains extremely high amounts of water-soluble antioxidants [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-26-00592"><title>2.3. PlantCrystals from Black Tea (BT) Leaves and Waste</title><p>The PlantCrystal technology is a simple method to produce ecofriendly and sustainable plant extracts [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The process does not require organic solvents and can be scaled up easily. It is thus industrially feasible and can be applied to the extraction of many plant molecules. This PlantCrystals extract can be obtained by nanomilling and is especially suitable for the extraction of lipophilic and poorly water-soluble compounds. A small-scale bead milling technique was successfully applied in this study to obtain BT waste PlantCrystals which were compared to BT leaves PlantCrystals.</p><p>To view the produced PlantCrystals, they were observed using a light microscope after nanonization. Light microscopy of both PlantCrystals produced from BT and its waste by bead-milling confirmed that they did not reveal big, visible particles, which indicates the formation of finer PlantCrystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Further characterization using the LD revealed some larger sized particles with sizes of about 49 &#x003bc;m (d(v)0.99 value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f008">Figure 8</xref>), which were not minimized during the production process. However, 95% of the volume of the particles (d(v)0.95 value) possessed sizes &#x0003c; 10 &#x000b5;m, which is the approximate size of a plant cell. In other words, the number of these large particles seems to be very small, because light microscopy did not reveal such big particles or agglomerates for the PlantCrystals produced. Light microscopic images showed a great decrease in particle size in the viewed PlantCrystals compared to the bulk materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f007">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, LD analysis of the BT waste revealed that the PlantCrystals also contained some large particles with sizes of about 28 &#x003bc;m (d(v)0.99 value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Meanwhile, 90% of the volume of the particles possessed sizes below 10 &#x000b5;m. Hence, almost all cells of black tea and its wastes were nano-milled by the small-scale bead milling process to sizes well below the approximate size of the plant cell.</p><p>In brief, LD data of both PlantCrystals from BT and its waste showed that 90% of the volume of the particles possessed sizes well below 10 &#x003bc;m, but only a few particles possessed sizes in micron level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was also used to characterize the PlantCrystals. This technique was used to measure nanoscaled particles that were not revealed in the LD measurements. Black tea PlantCrystals possessed a particle size of about 340 nm and a polydispersity index (PdI) value of about 0.4 (&#x000b1;0.06) according to the DLS results (<xref rid="molecules-26-00592-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, nanonization process applied to the waste of the black tea bulk material reduced the sizes of the bulk materials to smaller and more homogenous PlantCrystals with a particle size of about 280 nm and PdI value of about 0.4 (&#x000b1;0.02) as shown in the DLS data (<xref rid="molecules-26-00592-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Zeta-potential (ZP) is considered a vital parameter in nano-formulations to predict their physical stability. Therefore, ZP was measured in water with a conductivity of 50 &#x003bc;S/cm. The measurement was carried out to detect the charges on the PlantCrystals surface. A high value indicates good physical stability of the produced PlantCrystals. The obtained ZP values are &#x02212;24 (&#x000b1;0.1) and &#x02212;27 (&#x000b1;0.8) mV in the final formulation of the black tea and its waste, respectively, indicating that the produced PlantCrystals in this study are physically stable.</p><p>The determination of total polyphenol content demonstrated the efficacy of the plant milling procedure applied on BT and its waste. A pronounced increase in TPC value was observed upon bead milling of BT and its waste as the content of those active constituents in the PlantCrystals formulations was higher compared to the corresponding bulk suspensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, the application of small-scale BM process on black tea increased the available polyphenols in black tea PlantCrystals showing the highest TPC value among the analyzed formulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f009">Figure 9</xref>) but this increase was not significant if compared with the BT bulk suspension. However, a pronounced increase in TPC (more than 3-fold) was observed after the nanonization of the dried waste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, BM could increase the extraction efficacy of these molecules of BT waste in a significant way (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) vs. the released molecules from the bulk suspension. </p><p>Furthermore, total flavonoid content (TFC) showed a 3-fold and 1.7-fold increase in the TFC value for the PlantCrystals from black tea and its waste compared to the corresponding unprocessed bulk suspension, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f009">Figure 9</xref>). BT PlantCrystals showed a value of about 30 mg QE/g, which was much higher than bulk materials of BT and tea infusion presenting similar values of about 9 mg QE/g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Despite the increase in TFC value upon nanomilling processes it was not significant in comparison to the corresponding bulk materials.</p><p>The determination of the carotenoid content demonstrated the efficacy of the plant milling procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f009">Figure 9</xref>). After BM, the carotenoid content was increased about 3-fold compared to the bulk material of black tea and about 36% for the black tea waste compared to the bulk waste. The carotenoid content after nanomilling was significantly increased. The data, therefore, support the theory that the PlantCrystal technology is especially suitable for the improved extraction of lipophilic compounds of plant materials.</p><p>A DPPH assay was performed to determine the free radical scavenging capacity of the produced formulation and the data showed that nanonization almost doubled the AOC of BT leaves, when compared to the bulk material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f010">Figure 10</xref>). However, the AOC was about 4 times higher when the leaves were brewed to yield a classic black tea infusion. In contrast, PlantCrystals obtained from the waste showed a well improved AOC in comparison to the bulk waste (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), hence the AOC increased with decreasing the size as the antioxidative potential increased about nine-fold upon nanonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The IC 50 of the waste PlantCrystals was as good as the tea infusion and the used standard (ascorbic acid) as there is no significant difference between their IC 50 values. Despite the higher AOC of the BT PlantCrystals in comparison to the waste PlantCrystals, a significant difference between the bulk and nanosized waste was observed. However, no significant difference was observed between the bulk and nanosized fresh BT leaves. In brief, according to the DPPH assay, the black tea infusion had the best AOC followed by the obtained PlantCrystals from the black tea leaves and then their waste with IC 50 values of 0.013, 0.029 and 0.127 mg/ml, respectively.</p><p>In order to provide reliable and more detailed information about the AOC of the produced plant extracts by using the PlantCrystals technique, ORAC assay was chosen with a different principle, i.e., hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The ORAC assay is considered to be most suitable to assess hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants at the same time. However, the ORAC value of BT leaves was slightly decreased (40 &#x000b5;mol TE/&#x000b5;g) after nanonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00592-f010">Figure 10</xref>). In contrast, the ORAC value of the obtained waste PlantCrystals significantly increased about 4 times compared to the bulk waste. Thus, the ORAC value of the waste increased upon the nanonization process, leading to a pronounced AOC. The analyzed PlantCrystals from the tea and its waste showed a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to the tea infusion, which showed the best ORAC value and therefore the best AOC (55 &#x000b5;mol TE/&#x000b5;g). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-26-00592"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Black tea is the most popular prepared drink worldwide. Therefore, a huge amount of black tea wastes containing a fortune of antioxidant active molecules occurs as a result.

In the bulk suspensions, the particles are composed of several cells, so that the lipophilic compounds inside the cells (before the nanonization process) are protected from oxidation. In the next step (after nanomilling), the oxidation process can also occur on the released lipophilic antioxidants. However, the surfactant used in the production of PlantCrystals solubilizes the lipophilic compounds directly upon their release from the cell compartments into the hydrophobic core of the micelles and thus protects them from oxidation [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, nanomilling of plants is considered more suitable for the lipophilic molecules.</p><p>On one hand, size characterization methods used in this study proved the presence of particles well below 10 &#x000b5;m (the approximate plant cell size). This led to the release of the molecules associated with antioxidative properties from black tea and its waste. On the other hand, zeta-potential can be used to determine the physical stability of the PlantCrystals. The measurement was carried out to detect the charge on the PlantCrystals surface. A high value indicates good stability of the suspensions [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The zeta-potential values of the produced PlantCrystals indicated decent stability showing values between &#x02212;23 mV and &#x02212;27 mV in the final formulation. This stability could be due to the steric stabilization effect of the nonionic surfactant. </p><p>The higher polyphenol, flavonoid and carotenoid contents of those active constituents in the PlantCrystals formulation might be attributed to the destruction of plant cells, which causes an exhausting release of all active constituents. In contrast to tea infusion, where mainly hot water-soluble phytochemicals are released, the poorly water-soluble active constituents in the PlantCrystals are also released. Interestingly, tea infusion showed a higher TPC value in comparison to the bulk waste but PlantCrystals from the waste showed a significant increase (more than 3-fold) after nanonization. This indicates the occurred washing out of hot water-soluble phytochemicals upon tea infusion preparation and releasing of the remaining insoluble ones upon nanonization. Nonetheless, it has to be mentioned that the Folin&#x02013;Ciocalteu method overestimates the TPC value due to the lack of selectivity of the Folin&#x02013;Ciocalteu reagent, which reacts not only with phenols but also with other reducing compounds such as carotenoids, amino acids, sugars and ascorbic acid [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The increased TPC values after nanomilling thus indicate an increased amount of reducing agents in the formulation and thus higher AOC. Without further detailed studies, it cannot be concluded that only polyphenols account for this increase.</p><p>The higher TFC value of the bulk obtained from the waste in comparison to the tea infusion can be explained by the improved effect of the surfactant solution to extract these flavonoids, i.e., the increased solubility of the waste flavonoids in the surfactant solution. However, PlantCrystals from both, the tea leaves and their waste, showed a pronounced increase in the TFC value indicating the release of the insoluble flavonoids after breaking the plant cells by using small-scale bead milling.</p><p>Based on the previous findings, the determination of the carotenoid content demonstrated the efficacy of the plant milling procedure because of their poor water-solubility. In this study, it was demonstrated that even if only low amounts of these compounds are available, a pronounced release after the nanomilling process (in comparison to the bulk materials and the aqueous extract) proofs the efficacy of the plant milling technology. When compared to the tea infusion, all suspensions produced in this study showed higher carotenoid content. This can be explained by the rupture of the plant cells which causes the increased releases and&#x02014;in addition&#x02014;the effect of the surfactant which solubilized some of the lipophilic phytochemicals in the bulk suspensions. The data, therefore, substantiate the theory that the PlantCrystal technology is especially suitable for improved extraction of lipophilic compounds.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that the produced PlantCrystals possess the highest polyphenol, flavonoid and carotenoid contents, i.e., the available content was higher due to the release that occurred upon small-scale BM process. This confirmed our hypothesis and agreed with our previous findings [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], that higher amounts of poorly water-soluble plant active constituents were released from the PlantCrystals when compared to bulk material and the used control extract (tea infusion).</p><p>Antioxidant capacity must be evaluated by a number of methods to consider the different modes of action of a particular antioxidant [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, DPPH and ORAC assays were used, which are based on electron transfer (ET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms, respectively. The results of both assays proved that the BT bulk-suspension possesses a high AOC, but show no significant difference after nanonization. In contrast, the bulk of black tea waste showed weak antioxidant activity, which was significantly improved by using the natural, ecofriendly and cost-effective PlantCrystal- technology, i.e., the obtained &#x0201c;Nano-Wastes&#x0201d; (PlantCrystals obtained from organic waste) demonstrated a better antioxidant activity compared to its bulk and this agreed with a study performed by Griffin et al. in which the authors could prove that nanonization can unlock the antioxidant potential remaining in the plants waste [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This higher AOC of the produced BT waste PlantCrystals in this study is related to the higher extraction efficacy shown in the higher TPC, TFC and TCC values after nanomilling process (<xref rid="molecules-26-00592-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, according to the DPPH assay, the tea infusion (control extract) had the best AOC followed by the obtained PlantCrystals. This can be due to the higher extraction efficacy of the soluble black tea polyphenolic catechins in boiling water, since BT contains extremely high amounts of water-soluble compounds [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Lipophilic compounds are poorly soluble in water. Therefore, it is highly likely that the surfactant used in the formulation solubilizes these compounds immediately upon their release from the plant cells into the aqueous phase. This means that the lipophilic antioxidants are localized in the hydrophobic core of the micelles and thus are more protected from oxygen than the hydrophilic antioxidants. Thus, the AOC of the final product represents the sum of all antioxidants released during the comminution reduced by the number of antioxidants that were degraded during the nanomilling process. In other words, the final AOC is the total of the native constituents and the ones produced during the milling process.</p><p>The used surfactant might have an impact on the AOC of the produced formulation. However, it has recently been reported by Stahr et al. that this impact is not significant [<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00592" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, recycling plant waste, e.g., black tea waste, was achieved by using PlantCrystal technology to improve its AOC and render it into plant medicinal products and/or cosmetics with higher amounts of plant active molecules and without the use of organic solvents. This makes PlantCrystal technology highly suitable for the production of sustainable medicinal plant products.</p><p>Hence, the antioxidant activity of phytochemicals is not limited to the free radical scavenging ability and/or oxygen radical absorbance. It also involves the inhibition of the oxidation of lipoproteins in cell membranes in addition to heavy metals chelating activity, which can be tested using lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity assay and the 2,2&#x02019;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS<sup>&#x025cf;</sup>) radical assay, respectively. It is recommended for the upcoming studies to perform more antioxidant assays in order to detect the total AOC of PlantCrystals from black tea and its waste. In addition, it has to be stated that all particles scatter light, meaning that scattered light from the particles can interfere with the UV/vis measurements to some extent. At present, the issue is addressed by using samples with extremely low particle concentration and in the future improved methods for such kind of formulations (PlantCrystals) should be developed. Nonetheless, the present methods can already provide detailed and discriminative information on the activity of the produced formulations.</p><p>In spite of this, it is worth saying that the obtained results are useful to further identify the specific polyphenolic compounds responsible for the antioxidant activities and to study their structure&#x02013;function interactions, i.e., to specify the released compounds upon nanonization and enable the development of pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical products.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-00592"><title>4.
