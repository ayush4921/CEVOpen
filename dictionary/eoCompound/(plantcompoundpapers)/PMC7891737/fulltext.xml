Their content levels vary depending on the species, and they also change in response to any external stimuli. Thus, simultaneous quantification of multiple plant hormones is required to understand plant physiology. Sensitive and quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been used in detecting plant hormones; however, quantification without stable isotopes is yet to be established. In this study, we quantified seven representative plant hormones of <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>, which is a model legume for standard addition method. Accurate masses for monoisotopic ions of seven phytohormones were determined for high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode based on accurate masses was used in detecting phytohormones in the roots, stems, and leaves. Evaluation of matrix effects showed ion suppression ranging from 10.2% to 87.3%. Both stable isotope dilution and standard addition methods were able to detect plant hormones in the roots, stems, and leaves, with no significant differences in using both approaches and thus a standard addition method can be used to quantify phytohormones in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>. The method will be effective, especially when stable isotopes are not available to correct for matrix effects.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5651-8285</contrib-id><name><surname>Akashi</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National BioResource Project (NBRP) of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).

These hormones are classified into nine groups: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acids, strigolactones, and brassinosteroids. Each class shows bioactivities alone and in combination with other hormones, which is generally known as hormonal crosstalk [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, quantifying multiple plant hormones simultaneously is required to understand plant physiology. Detecting trace amounts of phytohormones in plant tissues employs two major analytical tools, that is, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], methods which have been used over the last decade. LC-ESI-MS/MS-based quantitative analysis can elucidate plant hormonomics, taking advantage of high selectivity, sensitivity, and specificity for target compounds [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Unlike GC-MS, electrospray ionization (ESI) is utilized in LC-MS/MS for ionizing analytes of a wide range of polarities without derivatization; however, this method is limited by matrix effects, such as ion enhancement or ion suppression by co-eluting compounds that interfere with target analyte quantification [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several approaches have been taken to date [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in an attempt to mitigate effects and ensure accurate quantitation. First is by reducing the matrix via partial purification, dilution of samples, and injection of small volumes of sample [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Second is by changing the ionization mode from ESI to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Third is by calibrating the matrix effects by applying stable isotope dilution, matrix matching, or standard addition. Plant hormones are often quantified using stable isotope dilution, which involves the addition of stable isotope-labelled counterparts to target analytes [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Stable isotope-labelled hormones have substantially the same chemical properties as target compounds. Matrix effects are considered identical with and without labelling, allowing accurate calibration of matrix effects. However, stable isotope labelling is deemed expensive and sometimes unavailable for minor phytohormone metabolites. Matrix matching is also used to calibrate matrix effects; it is often applied to detect drugs and agricultural chemicals [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This technique can be used without stable isotopes, but it requires a sample matrix without target analyte and is thus not applicable to endogenous compounds in tissues. Another method is standard addition that can be applicable, in theory, to all compounds [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Standard addition uses actual samples to create individual calibration plots. An analyte is present in both the calibration standards and sample, allowing correction of the matrix effect without stable isotopes. Standard addition is laborious in terms of preparing the calibration standards by sample, but it is still promising especially when stable isotope-labelled phytohormones are unavailable. Nevertheless, there are no reports demonstrating its ability in detecting plant hormones.</p><p>In this study, we have validated the simultaneous quantification of seven major plant hormones by standard addition using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). We focused on <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>, a model legume, and quantified plant hormones in its roots, stems, and leaves.

Accordingly, actual samples were diluted (dilution factor 1.05). Calibration curves for each phytohormone were constructed for each analyte using the same matrix.

Only one report was found that measured gibberellins, including active GA<sub>1</sub>, JA, SA, IAA, and ABA, which were detected in the roots. Further, GA<sub>1</sub> and its intermediates GA<sub>8</sub>, GA<sub>19</sub>, and GA<sub>53</sub> were significantly accumulated in response to arbuscular mycorrhizal-fungal infection [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also examined the levels of the seven major plant hormones in the roots, stems, and leaves and found, for the first time, that plant hormones in stems and leaves contain high concentrations of salicylic and jasmonic acids. ABA and IAA were considerably higher in leaves and stems than in roots, and SA was higher in the root than the other parts, suggesting the existence of tissue-specific plant hormone regulation in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>. Plant hormones are fundamental signaling molecules that respond to biotic and abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Indeed, CV was comparatively large in this present study, implying that individual differences in hormones were evident and might fluctuate in response to external stimuli. Further studies would connect plant hormone profiles with plant hormone synthesis/transport network, and it will identify underlying mechanisms of hormonal crosstalk in host-bacterium mutualism. Unveiling plant hormone profiles in model legume, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>, might allow the enhancement of yields of legume crops, such as soybean since plant hormones have been implicated in plant growth and seed yield in legume [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Matrix effects, including ion enhancement or suppression, can often hamper accurate quantification of target analytes by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Mitigation efforts, such as purification of samples and applying proper calibration methods, are currently in use. Typically, plant hormones are purified along with spiked stable isotopes to correct for matrix effects [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, stable isotope-labelled compounds for specific plant hormones are expensive and sometimes not commercially available, which limits their use. Although standard addition method is relatively more complex from a methodological point of view compared to stable isotope dilution, it is an effective method since it requires no stable isotope-labelled targets; this method is employed to detect drugs and hormones in plasma and sewage sludge [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and pesticides in crop and feedstock [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We validated the standard addition method to quantify seven major plant hormones and measured their levels in the tissues of <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>.

The standard addition method requires a sample matrix with several concentrations of standard solution. This method is thought to be inappropriate for low concentration samples. However, recent developments in detecting the sensitivity of mass spectrometry have largely solved this problem, and a small quantity of sample (20&#x02013;50 mg fresh weight per standard level) can now be enough to quantify phytohormones at attomole levels [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our data using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) detected femtomolar concentrations of plant hormones, a sensitivity lower than previous study using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) column (particle size of 1.7 &#x003bc;m). Sensitivity might be improved if a UHPLC column is used. Selective reaction monitoring (SRM) has been widely used [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but selected ion monitoring using HR-MS [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has never been applied to simultaneous quantification of plant hormones. Stable isotope labelling has been considered to be ideal for matrix correction, and our data show that this method displays lower LOD, LOQ, and CV than standard addition. However, standard addition would be beneficial when corresponding stable isotopes are unavailable. Further, standard addition would also be applicable to other parts of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>, such as nodule, flower, and pods, and likely other plant species.</p><p>Gibberellin A<sub>3</sub> is a well-known active plant hormone, but a stable isotope-labelled form is not commercially available. Stable isotope labelling often involves culturing cells or organisms in a medium that contains stable isotope (<sup>2</sup>H-, <sup>13</sup>C-, or <sup>15</sup>N-)-labelled molecule building blocks [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another method is to synthesize a precursor of the target compound and then use stable isotope-labelled substrate for the final reaction step [<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0247276.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In either case, stable isotope labelling often requires time, expense, and multiple purification steps. These issues hinder synthesis in many laboratories. Purification of plant hormones requires large amounts of organism grown in medium containing stable isotopes, since plant hormones exist in plants in trace amounts. Organic chemical synthesis for plant hormones also requires multiple reaction and purification steps in order to obtain a final product. We then validated and quantified plant hormone content in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic> using a standard addition method without stable isotopes.

The authors have utilized leaves, roots and stems of Lotus japonica to test if the standard addition method could be a robust and accurate method to quantify plant hormones in plant tissues. The work was conducted utilizing a rigorous methodology and furnish a validated method to quantify plant hormones, in particular when it is difficult to find the appropriate internal standard. However, I have two main comments:</p><p>- the method is more complex, from a methodological point of view respect to the method of internal standard. I think this should be mentioned in the discussion (in addition to highlight the strong points of this method);</p><p>- the discussion should be revised in a more logical way, starting from the role of hormones and their importance in AMF- and bacterium-plant interaction (line 314-329) and then moving to the discussion of the results presented in the paper (validation of the standard addition method and comparison with the internal standard method) (line 295-313 and 330-345).</p><p>I suggest to revise also some minor points:</p><p>-line 26 &#x0201c;THEIR content levels vary depending on the species, and THEY also change...&#x0201d; I think this sentence is referred to plant hormones.</p><p>-line 55 &#x0201c;ionizing hydrophobic analytes&#x0201d;..not all plant hormones are hydrophobic substances (ex. salicylic acid, abscisic acid)..I suggest to revise this point</p><p>-line 107 &#x0201c;Extraction for plant hormones has BEEN CONDUCTED UTILIZING...&#x0201d;</p><p>-line 136: the authors have already described that extracts were purified using SPE. Here it can be said &#x0201c;Purified extracts were separated ....&#x0201d;</p><p>- line 328-329: the last sentence of the paragraph is very speculative. I suggest to revise this sentence.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Response to Reviewer 1</p><p>We express our sincere gratitude to this reviewer for the questions, comments, and suggestions provided to us about our manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have taken into account the suggestions of the reviewer and made the necessary revisions accordingly. Our answers to your questions, comments, and suggestions are listed below following each specific question/comment.</p><p>Comment 1: In this work, Hashiguchi and colleagues present a methodological manuscript in which they describe the quantitative analysis of seven plant hormones in Lotus japonicus roots, shoots and stems, with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). They showed an important technical analysis about the impact of matrix effect in the purification and quantification of hormones that can vary between 10 and 87%, therefore ion suppression can largely decrease the peak area of phytohormones. And among the main results, they demonstrated that there were no significant differences between standard addition and stable isotope addition methods, therefore allowing to quantify hormones without any treatment with stable isotopes. Altogether the work is technically sound and the approaches are of wide interest for the community. A further validation of the methods on a perturbed system would add some extra value to the work. For example the Authors could challenge the plants with one relevant hormone-inducing stress (just as an example drought stress to induce ABA) and further compare ABA concentration with a physiological condition. Another option would be to test a Lotus japonicus known mutant for any hormonal biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>Our response: We have added the importance of the works you suggested in lines 351-354 in the discussion. </p><p>Comment 2: Figure 3: Please do not use bar graphs but show all the measurements (refer to Weissgerber et al., 2015, Plos Biology, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128</ext-link>): this would</p><p>Our response: We have replaced the bar graphs in Figure 3 with the scatter plots as you suggested.</p><p>Comment 3: Finally to better validate the method, a calculation of repeatability (accuracy and precision) obtained during the validation of the method could constitute an added value. By repeating the same measurements on the same starting material how much variance are you observing? Such as done in the cited work by Trapp et al., Frontiers in Plant Science 2014. I think this is particularly important if the Authors are not adding any experiments on Lotus mutants and/or stress conditions that are inducing different hormonal changes.</p><p>Our response: We have added the data on repeatability (accuracy and precision) by standard addition method in supplemental Table 2 and in lines 284-287. Accordingly, we have added the sentences in lines 464-465 and 467-470 in the table legend. </p><p>Comment 4: As a suggestion, to improve the readability, consider to change the paragraph title by stating the key results obtained in that paragraph. For example instead of: &#x0201c;Quantification of plant hormones by standard addition and comparison of the two quantification methods&#x0201d; you could state that there is no significant difference between the two methods.</p><p>Our response: We have changed the paragraph title to &#x0201c;No significant difference of plant hormone content in L. japonicus between the two methods&#x0201d; in lines 255-256 and &#x0201c;Non-negligible matrix effects of root, stem, and leaf from Lotus japonicus in plant hormone determination&#x0201d; in lines 193-194.</p><p>Comment 5: line 45-46: There are more than 8 groups of hormones: please, at least, also consider strigolactones</p><p>Our response: We have included &#x0201c;strigolactones&#x0201d; in line 46 and changed from &#x0201c;eight&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;nine&#x0201d; in line 45. </p><p>Comment 6: line 340-343: repetition of a full sentence, please correct it.</p><p>Our response: We have deleted the repetitive sentence &#x0201c;Thus, the standard addition method was comparable to the method using stable isotope labelling.&#x0201d; in this revised manuscript.</p><p>Response to reviewer 2</p><p>We express our sincere gratitude to this reviewer for the questions, comments, and suggestions provided to us about our manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have taken into account the suggestions of the reviewer and made the necessary revisions accordingly. Our answers to your questions, comments, and suggestions are listed below following each specific question/comment.</p><p>Comment 1: The paper &#x0201c;Quantitative analysis of the seven plant hormones in Lotus japonicus using standard addition method&#x0201d; is an interesting methodological manuscript which aims to compare standard addition and stable isotope dilution method to quantify plant hormones in different plant tissues. The authors have utilized leaves, roots and stems of Lotus japonica to test if the standard addition method could be a robust and accurate method to quantify plant hormones in plant tissues. The work was conducted utilizing a rigorous methodology and furnish a validated method to quantify plant hormones, in particular when it is difficult to find the appropriate internal standard. However, I have two main comments:</p><p>- the method is more complex, from a methodological point of view respect to the method of internal standard. I think this should be mentioned in the discussion (in addition to highlight the strong points of this method);</p><p>Our response: We have added &#x0201c;Although standard addition method is relatively more complex from a methodological point of view compared to stable isotope dilution,&#x0201d; in lines 315-316 in the discussion. </p><p>Comment 2: - the discussion should be revised in a more logical way, starting from the role of hormones and their importance in AMF- and bacterium-plant interaction (line 314-329) and then moving to the discussion of the results presented in the paper (validation of the standard addition method and comparison with the internal standard method) (line 295-313 and 330-345).</p><p>Our response: As you suggested, we have started from the role of hormones in lines 291-293 and replaced the second paragraph (lines 295-313) with the first paragraph (lines 314-329) to discuss the results more logically.</p><p>Comment 3: -line 26 &#x0201c;THEIR content levels vary depending on the species, and THEY also change...&#x0201d; I think this sentence is referred to plant hormones.</p><p>Our response: We have changed the words as you pointed out in line 26 and 27.</p><p>Comment 4: -line 55 &#x0201c;ionizing hydrophobic analytes&#x0201d;..not all plant hormones are hydrophobic substances (ex. salicylic acid, abscisic acid)..I suggest to revise this point</p><p>Our response: We have revised as you suggested in line 55.</p><p>Comment 5: -line 107 &#x0201c;Extraction for plant hormones has BEEN CONDUCTED UTILIZING...&#x0201d;</p><p>Our response: We have revised as you suggested in line 109.</p><p>Comment 6: -line 136: the authors have already described that extracts were purified using SPE. Here it can be said &#x0201c;Purified extracts were separated ....&#x0201d;</p><p>Our response: We have revised as you suggested in line 139.</p><p>Comment 7: - line 328-329: the last sentence of the paragraph is very speculative. I suggest to revise this sentence.</p><p>Our response: We have changed the sentence to &#x0201c;Unveiling plant hormone profiles in model legume, L. japonicus, might allow the enhancement of yields of legume crops, such as soybean since plant hormones have been implicated in plant growth and seed yield in legume [24].&#x0201d; in lines 307-309. We also added a new reference &#x0201c;Wilkinson S, Kudoyarova GR, Veselov DS, Arkhipova TN, Davies WJ. Plant hormone interactions: innovative targets for crop breeding and management. J Exp Bot. 2012;63: 3499-3509.&#x0201d; in line 309. Accordingly, the references 25-31 have been reordered.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0247276.s006"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0247276.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0247276.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0247276.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Balestrini</surname><given-names>Raffaella</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2021 Raffaella Balestrini</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2021</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Raffaella Balestrini</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0247276" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
