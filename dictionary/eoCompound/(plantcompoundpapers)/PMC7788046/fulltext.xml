In 7 days of exposure, despite the phytotoxicity of each compound that reduced elongation and biomass, the seedlings were able to remove between 67 and 94% of metalaxyl-M and between 86 and 95% of BPA. The amounts of metalaxyl-M and BPA extracted from plant dry biomass were in the range of 106&#x02013;3861 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 16&#x02013;101 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, and resulted positively correlated to both the dose of compound added (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) and the amount removed by the plants (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01). Plant uptake and transformation were the main mechanisms involved in the removal of the compounds. In another set of experiments, hemp was used to remove a mixture of two pesticides, metalaxyl-M and metribuzin, and three EDCs, BPA, 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2), and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), at concentrations of 10, 10, 10, 10, and 1 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, from soil column not added and added with 2.5% (w/w) of a green compost (CM) or a wood biochar (BC). In 25 days, plants did not alter considerably the distribution of the compounds along the soil profile and were capable of removing, on average, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 14% of metalaxyl-M, metribuzin, BPA, E2, and OP, respectively. During growth, hemp transformed the compounds and accumulated part of them (except OP) mainly in the shoots. CM and, especially, BC significantly protected the plants from the toxicity of the compounds and enhanced the retention of the latter in soil, contrasting leaching. Thus, the single or synergistic use of hemp and amendments deserves attention being a very low-cost and eco-sustainable strategy to remediate water and soil.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hemp</kwd><kwd>Phytoremediation</kwd><kwd>Biochar</kwd><kwd>Compost</kwd><kwd>Endocrine disruptor</kwd><kwd>Water Decontamination</kwd><kwd>Plant uptake</kwd><kwd>Organic contaminant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005362</institution-id><institution>Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A primary concern of the last years is the increasing presence in the environment of the so-called emerging pollutants (EPs). EPs are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals that are not commonly monitored in the environment, but that have the potential to enter into it causing known or suspected adverse ecological and human health effects (Geissena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). Pesticides, pharmaceuticals, wood preservatives, industrial product and by-products, and dyes are examples of EPs.</p><p id="Par3">A major risk related to these compounds is their high leaching potential, especially for those with low hydrophobicity like some pesticides, thus contaminating groundwater (Arias-Est&#x000e9;vez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>). Metalaxyl-M (methyl <italic>N</italic>-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-<italic>N</italic>-(methoxyacetyl)-<sc>d</sc>-alaninate)) is the biologically active R-enantiomer of the racemic compound metalaxyl. It is one of the most used fungicide worldwide and is highly persistent, mobile, and leachy in soil (Fernandes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>). Metribuzin (4-amino-6-tert-butyl-3-methylsulfanyl-1,2,4-triazin-5-one) is a selective triazinone herbicide. Because of the high water solubility, it has been included by the United States Environmental Protection Agency into the group of pesticides that have the greatest potential for leaching into groundwater (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Among EPs, the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have drawn increasingly extensive attention. These compounds are currently ubiquitous in the environment, food, and consumer products and can have severe impact on the endocrine functions of animals, especially aquatic, and humans (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). EDCs may enter surface water, groundwater, and soil through agricultural practices and the application, discharge, and disposal of urban and industrial effluents, sludges, and other wastes. The environmental fate of some endocrine disruptors has been extensively investigated (Baronti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>; Ying et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2002</xref>; Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The xenoestrogen bisphenol A (2,2-(4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl) propane, BPA) is one of the chemicals produced in the highest quantities worldwide, with almost 3 million tons produced each year (Vandenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). BPA is the building block of epoxy resins and polycarbonates and is adopted as stabilizer for polyvinyl chloride. The 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (17&#x003b2;-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol, E2) is the major endogenous estrogen in humans, and it is present in several hormonal therapy products. The 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) originates by microbial breakdown from the surfactants octylphenol polyethoxylates. This molecule possesses estrogenic activity and is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation (Ying et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The coexistence in cultivated soil of different classes of contaminants, such as pesticides and EDCs, is very likely to occur due to the current agricultural practices that makes extensive use of waste biomass and wastewaters which are rarely thoroughly decontaminated and plant-protective chemicals.</p><p id="Par7">The necessity to provide sustainable solutions to water and soil pollution has led to develop alternative, cost-effective, and eco-friendly technologies for remediating water and soil from contaminants (Morillo and Villaverde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>; Wu and Wu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>). Among the numerous remediation methodologies explored and tested in recent years, bio-based technologies seem to be an interesting economical alternative (Gerhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Phytoremediation is a process that exploits plant physiological processes, such as transpiration, root exudation, absorption, translocation, and metabolization, and rhizosphere microorganisms to remove mineral and organic pollutants from water, soil, sludge and sediments, both in situ and ex situ. There are various phytoremediation strategies whose choice depends on the type of pollutants and their concentrations, the matrix, and the plant species adopted (McCutcheon and Schnoor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>; Gerhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Phytoextraction or phytoaccumulation consists in absorbing pollutants by the root system and eventually translocate them to the aerial organs, ensuring the permanent decontamination of the site. This technique has been extensively applied to remove metals but also pesticides (Gasco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Tarla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). Rhizofiltration is typical not only of aquatic plant species which uptake pollutants from aquatic environments but also of terrestrial plants, such as sunflower or hemp, that have an extended root system and large root surface area (Gerhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Phytostabilization or phytoimmobilization relies on the ability of plants to decrease the mobility or bioavailability of pollutants, avoiding their leaching and possible entrance into groundwater or food chain. However, the latter mechanism that concern especially heavy metals does not allow the elimination of pollutants from the contaminated matrix. A relevant role for organic pollutants has played by phytodegradation or phytotransformation. This process regards the capacity of some plants to degrade or transform partially or completely organic contaminants by means of their enzymes. Rhizodegradation concerns an indirect action of plants which produce root exudates containing an easily degradable C-source that stimulate the degradative metabolism of microorganisms in the rhizosphere, acting also on recalcitrant pollutants.</p><p id="Par8">An added value of phytoremediation is that plants give a relevant contribution to soil fertility both directly, through root expansion and exudation, and indirectly promoting the growth and activity of microorganisms (Paz-Ferreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Hemp (<italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L.) is an annual herb used in many types of non-food industries. Its high biomass, deep-root and short life cycle, and ease of adaptation to different climatic conditions make it very suitable for phytoremediation. Moreover, hemp has a very high capacity to absorb and accumulate organic and inorganic pollutants (Linger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Despite its great potential, phytoremediation could have some application limits, especially in heavily contaminated areas, due to the phytotoxicity of pollutants, often present in combination, that could seriously compromise plants survival and growth (McCutcheon and Schnoor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>). Trying to overcome this problem, increasing attention has been given to the so-called assisted or enhanced phytoremediation that exploits the synergistic combination of plants and C-rich materials (Paz-Ferreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>; Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Chirakkara and Reddy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>; Gasco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). This combined strategy has been applied to depollute soil from heavy metals (Paz-Ferreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>; Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Gasco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>) or mixtures of organic and inorganic contaminants (Chirakkara and Reddy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">The addition to the soil of C-rich materials during the phytoremediation could slow down the decontamination process because of the high sorption efficiency of these materials that may attenuate the availability of contaminants to soil-resident degrading microorganisms. However, there are some aspects that make this double approach worthy to be explored. One aspect concerns the plant-protective activity of these materials, including a pathogen-suppressive activity, that sustains plant mass production and is very important when plants have to face stressful situations in heavily polluted soils, especially in their early growth stage (Gasco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). The precarious conditions of remediating plants make them much more fragile, compromising plant survival and consequently the success of phytoremediation. Furthermore, plant candidates for phytoremediation, like hemp, have excellent capacity to uptake pollutants with the water flow and are supposed to be able to effectively compete with the amendments for the retention of contaminants (McCutcheon and Schnoor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>; Gasco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">The importance of these aspects is the rationale for choosing C-rich materials, including compost (CM) and biochar (BC) to sustain plant remediation. Green CM produced from the wastes of the maintenance of public and private greenery, residues of crops or wood processing, has a remarkable ability to reduce the mobility of organic contaminants in soil (Mar&#x000ed;n-Benito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>). BC is the stable carbonaceous by-product obtained from thermochemical conversion, at temperatures ranging from 200 to 800 &#x000b0;C, of biomass in limited oxygen conditions (pyrolysis) to produce bio-oil and syngas (IBI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>). BC, originally designed for carbon sequestration and soil amendment, has proven to be a very efficient low-cost adsorbent of organic and inorganic contaminants and has been increasingly used for soil and water remediation (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>; Loffredo and Taskin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>; Gasco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Parlavecchia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>; Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">The objectives of this work were to evaluate (i) the potential of hemp to remove metalaxyl-M and BPA from water during germination and early growth and (ii) the effectiveness of hemp, a green CM and a wood BC, individually or in combination, to remediate a soil multi-contaminated with two pesticides and three EDCs and to influence the leaching of these compounds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals, plant, soil, and materials</title><p id="Par14">Metalaxyl-M and metribuzin, both at a purity &#x02265; 98.0%, bisphenol A (BPA) at 99% purity, 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) at 99.9% purity, and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) at 99.5% purity were provided by Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milano, Italy.

Karanasios et al.

In soil column tests, Lopez-Pineiro et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>) reported that CM amendment of soil noticeably increased the capacity of soil to retain metribuzin, reducing its leaching and also favoring degradation. It has been recently demonstrated that CM and, especially, BC have a remarkable capacity to sorb metribuzin, allowing to speculate that the addition of composted and carbonaceous materials to the soil may greatly enhance the adsorption of this compound (Loffredo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">The presence of plants did not modify the trend of metribuzin along the soil profile but significantly reduced its quantities at various depths of all treatments, especially in the upper 5 cm of soil where most of the roots were present (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

This is in contrast with what reported by Mehdizadeh et al.

Also for this compound, the retention and transport in soil is strictly affected by the level of soil organic matter (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>).

At the end of experiments, residual E2 in the 10&#x02013;15 cm layer of soil only and soil + CM was lower or much lower than that found for BPA and the two pesticides (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Tong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) showed that adsorption of E2 in soil was highly depended on mineral-organic complexes of soil. Hemp did not alter substantially the distribution of E2 along the soil profile; however, it significantly reduced its residue in the upper 0&#x02013;5 cm layer of amended soil (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). On average, for the treatments, the disappearance of E2, after 25 days, in the whole soil column, although not affected by the amendment, was much greater in planted soil (21.4%) than in bare soil (12.8%) (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), indicating a marked contribution of hemp in the loss of this compound. It is reasonable that both plant uptake and enhanced microbiological degradation played a role in E2 disappearance.</p><p id="Par39">Almost all residual OP accumulated in the upper 10 cm of soil only and soil + CM or even in the upper 5 cm of soil + BC, evidencing the very low potential of OP to leach (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Compared with bare soil, planted soil showed a similar vertical distribution of OP, reducing significantly the residual compound only in the upper 5 cm of the unamended soil but excluding OP presence below 10 cm in the treatment soil + BC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). At the end of experiments, the lowest quantity of OP in the whole soil column was measured in the treatment soil + plants (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Although neither CM nor BC affected OP disappearance in bare soil, both materials significantly decreased OP removal by hemp (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Possible explanations for this could be both the strong retention of OP by the materials that reduced OP bioavailability and competed with the possible root uptake and the lesser availability of root exudates for the rhizodegradation process. In fact, even some plant metabolites, such as phenolic acids, might have been adsorbed by the materials and be therefore less available for soil microorganisms. Zhou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2006</xref>) evidenced the importance of organic colloids in controlling the environmental fate of OP. The strong sorption of OP on a red spruce BC was demonstrated (Loffredo and Taskin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par40">Results obtained in these soil column experiments evidenced the crucial role of the upper 5-cm layer of soil, where most of the rhizosphere is located and most of the aerobic processes occur. Therefore, we tried to relate the residual compounds in this layer, at the end of the experiments. with important properties of the molecules. Plotting residual compounds in the upper 5 cm of soil versus the corresponding log <italic>K</italic><sub>ow</sub>, significant positive correlations (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) were found only for unamended soil, both bare and planted. This indicated that the leaching of the five compounds in soil was inversely related to their hydrophobicity and that the addition of CM or BC could alter this law, possibly because it acted simultaneously on more processes, like retention, movement, plant uptake, and degradation, which are not strictly related to hydrophobicity. Correlations between the residual compound in the upper 5 cm of soil, soil + CM and soil + BC (bare soil), and the corresponding organic matter (OM) content were significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) for metribuzin, BPA and E2. In this case, let us assume that, for the latter compounds, retention was the prominent process to contrast leaching or that both leaching and degradation were influenced with similar extent and trend. Differently, in the cases of the very soluble metalaxyl-M and the highly hydrophobic OP, the OM content might have influenced differently leaching and biodegradation or it was not the foremost property.</p><p id="Par41">Finally, the plant removal of each compound from the whole column, calculated as the difference between the amount which disappeared on average in planted soil and bare soil (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and excluding OP, was inversely related to the hydrophobicity of the molecule, being the least hydrophobic the most removed. In the case of OP, it is possible that its overall surface localization, which coincided with the zone of the greatest root expansion, favored plant removal beyond what was expected. Based on the hydrophobicity of OP and the absence of OP residues in plant tissues (see the &#x0201c;Plant response and compound accumulation&#x0201d; section), it is plausible that OP removal occurred mainly or exclusively through rhizodegradation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant response and compound accumulation</title><p id="Par42">Hemp plants grown for 25 days in multi-contaminated soil not amended or amended with CM or BC did not show visual alterations, except a delayed growth, compared with plants grown in uncontaminated soil (control). Biometric data showed lower root and shoot elongation and fresh and dry biomass, denoting an unquestionable toxicity of the chemical mixture on plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Phytotoxicity of these compounds, individually applied, was already observed in previous studies. Teixeira et al.

These results clearly indicated the occurrence of plant-protective effects by both materials.</p><p id="Par44">As already observed in germination experiments, hemp showed a great ability to absorb metalaxyl-M from the soil and accumulate it, especially in the aerial part (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The maximum compound accumulation was measured in the shoots of the plants grown in unamended soil, being 72 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Similar to what reported by Teixeira et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2011</xref>), a much lower accumulation of metalaxyl-M occurred in hemp roots. The preferential translocation of this compound from roots to shoots can depend on the low hydrophobicity of this compound that allows high mobility into the vascular system of plants. Kubicki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>), studying the dynamic of metalaxyl in tomato, reported that the compound was readily taken up by the roots with the normal water absorption and translocated uniformly to the aerial organs through the xylematic vessels. Very recently, Gong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>) found that metalaxyl-M translocated rapidly in chrysanthemum plants where it accumulated mainly in the leaves and ascribed that to the relatively low log <italic>K</italic><sub>ow</sub>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Compound accumulation in root and shoot dry mass of hemp grown for 25 days in columns filled with soil only and soil added with CM or BC.

These results confirmed the evidence of a straight relationship between the quantity of compound removed and that of compound accumulated. Anyway, if on the one hand CM or BC hindered the removal of metalaxyl-M by plants, on the other hand, they clearly exerted an antitoxic activity that was crucial for allowing plants to tolerate heavily polluted soil. The percentage of metalaxyl-M accumulated in plants, compared with that removed from the soil, was very low and minimum in soil + BC treatment (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This suggested that BC, in addition to influencing absorption and accumulation, could also affect the plant transformation of this molecule. Further studies could elucidate this aspect.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Percentage of compound accumulated in plant mass compared with the quantity removed by plants from the soil</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Compound</th><th>Soil</th><th>Soil + CM</th><th>Soil + BC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Metalaxyl-M</td><td>2.34 &#x000b1; 0.12 b</td><td>3.14 &#x000b1; 0.21 a</td><td>1.04 &#x000b1; 0.10 c</td></tr><tr><td>Metribuzin</td><td>1.55 &#x000b1; 0.10 a</td><td>1.22 &#x000b1; 0.18 ab</td><td>1.13 &#x000b1; 0.03 b</td></tr><tr><td>BPA</td><td>2.52 &#x000b1; 0.09 a</td><td>1.66 &#x000b1; 0.09 b</td><td>1.32 &#x000b1; 0.09 c</td></tr><tr><td>E2</td><td>0.41 &#x000b1; 0.12</td><td>0.41 &#x000b1; 0.12</td><td>n.d.</td></tr><tr><td>OP</td><td>n.d.</td><td>n.d.</td><td>n.d.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data were analyzed by ANOVA and means were separated by LSD test at <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 (<italic>n</italic> = 3)</p><p><italic>n.d.</italic> not detected</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par46">The herbicide metribuzin accumulated in plants to a lesser extent than metalaxyl-M and once more especially in shoots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Moreover, the extent of accumulation depended on the soil treatment. Preferential accumulation of metribuzin into the aerial plant organs might depend on the relatively low hydrophobicity of this compound and the high mobility into the plant vascular system. The lowest amounts of metribuzin (12.5 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were found in the roots and shoots of plants grown in the presence of BC and that might be ascribed to the lower removal by plants of this treatments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The percentage of metribuzin accumulated in plants compared with that removed was generally very low and significantly lower in soil + BC, compared with soil only (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Also for this compound, it seemed that BC somehow stimulated the transformation of metribuzin into the plant tissues.</p><p id="Par47">Evidence of the capacity of hemp to absorb BPA from soil was confirmed by the significant product accumulation found in the shoots and roots of hemp (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). A lower amount of BPA was extracted from hemp roots than from shoots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Compared with metalaxyl and metribuzin, the ratio between the compound accumulated in roots and that accumulated in shoots was higher for BPA. That might depend on the higher hydrophobicity of this molecule that made translocation more difficult. Also for BPA, plant metabolization seemed to be influenced by the addition of the materials, in which accumulation is lower in the presence of CM and, especially, BC (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">The limited amount of E2 found only in the plant shoots of unamended soil and soil + CM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) can be ascribed to the preferential transport of this molecule to the upper organs. Chuang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>) demonstrated that E2 was rapidly and conspicuously absorbed by lettuce but its accumulation in roots was negligible because the compound was preferentially transported upwards to shoots with the water flow. The same authors reported a very rapid metabolization of E2 by plants, mainly in the green organs, with the mass recovery of less than 25% after only 48 h of exposure (Chuang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). Anyway, considering the quantity of E2 removed on average by plants (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and the very low percentage of contaminant accumulated in plant tissues (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), we can hypothesize that another process might have contributed to these results, namely rhizodegradation. Root exudates released by hemp, and localized especially in the upper layer where E2 was more concentrated, might have stimulated the activity of microorganisms involved in E2 degradation. Furthermore, the presence of BC in the soil might have promoted rhizodegradation and that could be the reason why E2 was not extracted from plants grown in soil + BC. A recent study demonstrated that <italic>Bjerkandera adusta</italic>, a common soil-resident fungus, has a relevant capacity to degrade E2 and that this activity is even higher in the presence of BC (Loffredo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">The OP was the only molecule that was not found in the plants, either in roots or in shoots, of all treatments. The hydrophobic character of this molecule must have played an important role in reducing the mobility of this compound both in soil and in plants. Comparing residual OP in bare and planted soil (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), it was evident that an appreciable disappearance of OP could be ascribed to hemp. To explain these results, we can appeal to at least two reasons. The first is that hemp absorbed OP and efficiently transformed it. In fact, although the high log <italic>K</italic><sub>ow</sub> (5.50) of OP seems to hinder plant absorption, it was demonstrated that plants like <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> can efficiently absorb and metabolize OP and other EDCs, including BPA and E2 (Imai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). The second is rhizodegradation. Similar to what possibly happened for E2, the presence of plants and their root exudates might have stimulated microbial degradation of OP in the soil. That might have been even more important for OP than E2, considering the very superficial localization of OP in the soil. Phenolic EDCs, such as OP, can be effectively degraded by soil-resident ligninolytic fungi (Loffredo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">Seedlings of <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. proved to be very effective in removing individually the fungicide metalaxyl-M and the endocrine disruptor BPA from water. Despite that both molecules showed toxicity on seedlings, their removal was relevant up to a concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of metalaxyl-M and 100 &#x003bc;g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of BPA. Residual compounds accumulated in hemp tissues in 7 days were much lower than the amounts removed from the medium, indicating an efficient metabolization of these molecules. When hemp was allowed to germinate and grow in columns filled with a soil multi-contaminated with metalaxyl-M, metribuzin, BPA, E2, and OP, despite the toxic effects, the plant once more showed a noticeable remediation capacity. The addition to the soil of materials like CM and BC relieved, at least partly, the phytotoxicity stress, albeit the plants removed less quantities of metalaxyl-M and OP. Both CM and, especially, BC were able to modify the leaching pattern of the compounds along the soil profile, favoring their localization in the upper layers, compared with unamended soil. Among the five compounds, only OP was not found in the plants, whereas the others, especially the less hydrophobic pesticides, were absorbed by hemp and accumulated mainly in the aboveground organs. A very large part of the compounds taken up by plants was transformed in plant tissues. The overall findings of this study suggest that hemp is a promising candidate for practical phytoremediation of wastewater and soil from pesticides and endocrine-disrupting chemicals.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors thank the Italian Composting and Biogas Association (CIC) for providing the green compost and Emporio Canapuglia S.a.s., Conversano, Italy, for providing hemp seeds.
