The latter build the main barrier for transpirational water loss and protect the fruit against environmental factors e.g. pests, mechanical impacts or radiation. The integrety of the fruit surface is one important key factor for post-harvest quality and storage of fruits. Nonetheless, the developmental pattern of cuticular wax was so far only investigated for a very limited number of fruits. Therefore, we performed comparative investigations on the compositional and morphological nature of epicuticular wax crystals and underlying wax during fruit development in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>. The main compound oleanolic acid belongs to the pentacyclic triterpenoids, which occur very early in the development in high amounts inside the cuticle. The amount increases until veraison and decreases further during ripening. In general, very-long chain aliphatic (VLCA) compounds are present in much smaller amounts and alcohols and aldehydes follow the same trend during development. In contrast, the amount of fatty acids constantly increases from fruit set to ripening while wax esters only occur in significant amount at veraison and increase further. Wax crystals at the fruit surface are solely composed of VLCAs and the morphology changes during development according to the compositional changes of the VLCA wax compounds. The remarkable compositional differences between epicuticular wax crystals and the underlying wax are important to understand in terms of studying grape-pest interactions or the influence of environmental factors, since only wax crystals directly face the environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>EC</institution></funding-source><award-id>1607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8675-787X</contrib-id><name><surname>Kassemeyer</surname><given-names>Hanns-Heinz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was partly supported by the European Union program to support crossborder cooperation INTERREG V Upper Rhine 2014-2020 (grant no. 1607) VITIFUTUR - Transnational Platform for Applied Research and Further Training in Viticulture.

During the development of the grape berry, the volume increases about 300-fold. In this growth process, the skin of the berries has an important function as a containment of the pericarp since the integrity of the surface must be maintained [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The berry skin is the outermost, complex structure of the multi-layered exocarp. It consists of a layer of epidermal cells with a thick outer cell wall coated with the cuticle. The matrix of the cuticle is built by a three-dimensional network preferentially composed of polymerized C16 and C18 hydroxy fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is impregnated with aliphatic and cyclic wax components. The aliphatic fraction of grape berry wax comprises homologous series of very-long-chain fatty acids and corresponding derivatives such as aldehydes, primary alcohols, alkyl esters and alkanes [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The cyclic fraction usually contains pentacyclic triterpenoids particularly of the oleanane and ursane type [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some of the wax crystallizes on the outer surface of the cuticle. These epicuticular wax crystals appear as a glaucous covering on the fruit, making the surface extremely water repellent [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The hydrophobic properties of the wax coating have a crucial function as a preformed barrier that protects the berry from uncontrolled water loss and other environmental factors like pathogens and herbivore attack [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There is good evidence that the cuticular transpiration barrier is preferentially associated with very-long chain aliphatic wax compounds [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while triterpenoids contribute to the mechanical strength [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], heat stability [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or biological activity [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] of the cuticle. During berry development, the cuticle has to overcome different challenges depending on the developmental stage. Due to the very rapid volume expansion, it has to resist strong mechanical stress in order to avoid surface cracking [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, the wax composition is expected to show a dynamic developmental pattern. Changes in the chemical-physical properties during berry development can cause stage-specific susceptibility to diseases and pests [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the same way, cultivar-specific differences in cuticular wax can account for different susceptibility among grapevine cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, fruit wax plays an important role in post-harvest storage processes and fruit quality [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] because the water loss is related to the physico-chemical properties of the cuticular wax [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here, we performed comparative investigations on the chemical and morphological nature of wax accumulation and the formation of epicuticular wax crystals during fruit development of two prominent <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cultivars &#x02018;M&#x000fc;ller Thurgau&#x02019; and &#x02018;Blauer Sp&#x000e4;tburgunder&#x02019; also known as &#x02018;Pinot noir&#x02019;. In a novel approach, we differentiated between the epicuticular wax crystals on the outer surface of the cuticle directly facing the atmosphere and interacting pathogens or insects and the underlying wax. To visualize the highly sensitive micro and nanostructure of the epicuticular wax, we used cryo-scanning electron microscopy. This tool enables to detect finest differences in the structure of the wax crystals which would completely disappear during the fixation process for TEM analysis. The scientific results of this work represent significant achievements for targeted breeding of grapevine cultivars with resistance to pests and pathogens and higher berry resilience to environmental changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material</title><p>Grape berries of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. cv. <italic>M&#x000fc;ller Thurgau</italic> (MTH) and cv. <italic>Blauer Sp&#x000e4;tburgunder</italic> (BSB) (also known as <italic>Pinot noir</italic>) were harvested during the growing season 2015 from directly adjacent plots in the experimental vineyards of the Staatliches Weinbauinstitut, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.

For this purpose, three intact clusters inserted between the second and third nodes of the shoot were collected early in the morning from the experimental plots. Immediately after sampling, three berries of the same size were removed from the inside of each cluster, from which a slice of the berry skin of approx. 3 mm x 3 mm was excised with a scalpel. The slices were mounted with a low temperature glue on a specimen holder by carefully avoiding touching the waxy surface. Cryofixation was performed with nitrogen slush (&#x0003c; -185&#x000b0;C). The frozen samples were sputtered with 20 nm Au in a high vacuum cryo preparation chamber and examined with a SE detector operating with acceleration voltage of 5&#x02013;10 kV at high vacuum and -150&#x000b0;C. In this way, the specimens were cryo-fixed, sputtered and ready for analysis within 90 min after sampling in the field. A total of nine samples from each variety were analyzed, the surface structure of each specimen was documented from at least three positions at 8.000x magnification.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Wax analysis</title><p>For the wax analysis, bunches were collected from the experimental plots in the same way as described above.

The berries were washed with deionized water and air-dried. The fruit surface area was determined from the average of the transverse and longitudinal diameter by assuming a spherical shape of the berries.

A comparison between treatments with and without ultra-sonic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246693.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) showed that epicuticular wax was mechanically grinded off due to the movement of the salt molecules without any chemical extraction, which ensured a separation of the epicuticular wax crystals. After the procedure, berries looked highly polished. As wax crystals became stronger during development, larger berries from category 4 on were carefully rubbed with tissue until they appeared shiny.

The detailed morphological pattern of epicuticular wax crystal formation during fruit development was investigated with Cryo-SEM. At fruit set, were fruits began to swell (BBCH 71), cuticular ridges started to spread and the surface in between was covered with a fractured crust according to Barthlott <italic>et al</italic>.

One week later (category 2), non-entire parallel stacked platelets protruded perpendicularly from the underlying wax film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g001">Fig 1B&#x02013;1I</xref>). At some sites above ridges, the underlying cuticle or wax film was still visible. During further development, the crystals grew to a dense layer completely covering the cuticle beneath. The basic structure of the wax crystals of mature berries of both varieties studied consists of platelets according to Barthlott et al.

At maturation, it reached comparable values as in the beginning of the fruit development (42.3 &#x000b1; 1.7 &#x003bc;g cm<sup>-2</sup> in MTH and 51.4 &#x000b1; 11.7 &#x003bc;g cm<sup>-2</sup> in BSB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g003">Fig 3</xref>), where aliphatics represented about 15% of the total wax (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246693.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The total amount of aliphatics increased in a similar rate than the triterpenoids, keeping the proportion nearly constant until veraison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246693.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

However, only one report compared the chemical plasticity and morphology of the entire cuticular wax (including epi- and intracuticular wax) during grape berry development [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] by using TLC analysis, that allowed only for a crude separation. Albeit the relative wax composition varies between cultivars, oleanolic acid was reported to be the dominant compound in all investigated grape berry waxes [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Furthermore, we found remarkable differences were found between the composition of the epicuticular wax bloom and the underlying wax which is partially associated with the cutin matrix. The epiculticular wax on the surface represent the interface between the berry and the environment. Therefore, the chemical and structural properties of this boundary layer are highly important for coping with abiotic and biotic external influences such as UV-radiation, dehydration, pests and pathogens.</p><p>The epicuticular wax crystals, appear early in the fruit development as a glaucous covering on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g001">Fig 1</xref>). They totally lack of triterpenoids and are exclusively composed of very-long-chain aliphatic (VLCA) compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This pattern was already shown by Possingham et al. (1967) [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for ripe grape berries of the variety sultana. They found VLCA alcohols to be the main compound beside smaller amounts of acids, esters, aldehydes and hydrocarbons. However, by looking at ripe fruits only a snapshot of the wax composition is mirrored.</p><p>The wax chemistry is adapted to the vigorous growth of the berryIndeed, not only the wax amount but also the composition was shown to be highly dynamic during development. The amount of VLCA fatty acids significantly increases during the fruit development and VLCA alkyl esters occur and increase only later during development (from BBCH 75 on). At any time, triterpenoids are solely located underneath the wax crystals together with additional VLCAs. Khanal et al. (2013) [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] supposed that the stresses and strains that occur during the fruit development as the surface expands are fixed by the current deposition of wax in the cutin, thereby converting reversible elastic into irreversible plastic strain. Additionally, triterpenoids, were shown to be of significant importance for maintaining the mechanical strength of the cuticle [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>During the later stages, when berry expansion declines, the amount of triterpenoids decrease, as was also previously shown for cherry fruits [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] while the proportion of VLCAs significantly increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246693.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). From then, substantial amounts of VLCA fatty acids and alkyl esters are deposited in the cuticular wax, leading to significant increase in the proportion of VLCAs up to about 35&#x02013;40% of the total wax load. VLCA wax compounds rather than triterpenoids are responsible for the permeation barrier in the cuticle [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. During development, triterpenoids are completely shielded against the environment by overlaying VLCAs which also build a dense bloom of wax crystals on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This became obvious during the experimental procedure. In the beginning, triterpenoids could be extracted by immersing the intact berries in methanol due to their higher polarity compared to VLCAs (personal observation). At developmental stage 3 (BBCH 75) no triterpenoids could be detected any more in methanol extracts of intact fruits since the overlaying VLCAs prevent the methanol from entering the cuticle to extract them. Contrary, in chloroform extracts, both VLCAs and triterpenoids are found. The chloroform dissolves the VLCAs shielding the outer surface of the cuticle, granting access to the intracuticular triterpenoids. Although, remarkable differences in epi- and intracuticular wax was already shown for leaves [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and fruits [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] of several plant species, dissolving fruits or leaves in chloroform is still a very common method to obtain wax from plant surfaces. With this method, the extracted wax always represents a mixture of epi- and intracuticular wax with variable proportions, depending on the extraction time. This should be considered when the function of wax is related to its chemical composition because the intracuticular wax do not face the environment.</p><p>The wax chemistry effects the crystal architecture The cutin network which is already formed before anthesis [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] might play an important role as stationary phase interacting more or less with the wax molecules, depending on their dimension or polarity. It was proposed that the asymmetric cutin matrix has an open branching/network structure with the presence of cavities, which may potentially be occupied by wax molecules [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Due to the relatively high polarity of the triterpenoids compared to VLCAs, one would expect that they are captured in the inner layer of the cuticle which is more polar due to the interaction with cell wall polysaccharides. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction and NMR analysis of persimmon fruit cuticles showed that triterpenoids construct a nanocomposite in the cuticular matrix, while VLCAs did not exhibit clear interactions with cutin [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They might be transported further via the transpiration stream or simply move by diffusion along a solubility/polarity gradient, finally accumulating as wax film on the surface. Furthermore, the self-assembly process of wax molecules leads to the growth of three-dimensional crystalline structures emerging from the underlying wax film [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thereby, the wax chemistry has a formative influence [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In most plant species, the different architectures of the crystals are associated with a single dominating constituent or compound class. While tubules are crystallized from secondary alcohols or &#x000df;-diketones, platelets are dominated by primary alcohols, aldehydes or ketones of a certain chain length. In the case of heterogeneous wax mixtures, usually glossy wax films are observed [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, in grape berries distinct crystal architecture is observed by SEM despite the fact that we found a heterogeneous mixture of numerous compound classes and chain length. Nevertheless, at berry set, were alcohols clearly dominate the epicuticular wax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g005">Fig 5</xref>) the typical platelets are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g001">Fig 1</xref>). During berry development, the wax mixture becomes progressiveley heterogeneous which also affect the crystal structure. With increasing chemical heterogeneity, the initial order yield to an irregular pattern of crenated and fissured wax lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In ripe berries, the chemical differences in the epicuticular wax of both cultivars with higher proportions of aldehydes and less alcohols in BSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g005">Fig 5</xref>) is also mirrored by the architecture of the wax crystals. In MTH a separation of the lobes into filamentous structures was strongly pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246693.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Aspects of wax crystal formation in fruit defense against pathogens</title><p>The chemical composition of VLCAs combined with the specific three-dimensional structure resulting from the self-assembly of the wax compounds, leads to a rough super-hydrophobic surface which is very hard-to-wet [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Water is repelled very easy and during run off, water droplets will clean the surface from dust and other particles including fungal spores or bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which do not adhere actively to the waxy surface. Due to its specific architecture at the beginning of development, the berry is adapted to the exponential increase in berry volume and thereby the rapid expansion of the berry surface at this stage. In this way epicuticular wax crystals arise very early in the fruit development shielding the underlying cuticle and intracuticular waxes against pathogen attack such as infections by powdery and downy mildew [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] within two to three weeks after bloom (BBCH 75). It was shown, that the resistance of diverse grape cultivars to the infestation with <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> increases with increasing amount of cuticular wax, while the susceptibility of the ripe berries drastically increased at contact sites between berries, where the epicuticular wax was altered [<xref rid="pone.0246693.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246693.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. So far it remains unclear, whether the infection success of several pathogens is initiated or suppressed by the presence or absence of specific cuticle constituents at different stages of grape berry development. By studying berry-pathogen or berry-insect interactions and mite attack, fundamental differences in the chemical composition of epicuticular wax crystals and the underlying wax have to be considered in the future, since wax crystals completely lacking of triterpenoids are the first contact site between grape berries and pests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0246693.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparison of chromatographs (GC-FID) for different extraction methods of epicuticular waxes of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cv.

The study presented in the manuscript concerns the processes which take place in cuticular waxes of grape berry (the fruit of Vinis vinifera). In many countries, grape is economically one of the most important crops plants, so this study is particularly interesting in the context of grape resistance to pathogens as well as various environmental stresses. The results illustrating the compositional differences between epicuticular wax crystals and the underlying wax are new, original and they supplement our knowledge of plant cuticle and the role of cuticular waxes.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and scientifically sound. The experiments were carefully planned and properly performed. The methods are modern and suitable for the aim of the study. I consider this manuscript as very valuable and worth publishing.</p><p>Some small comments:</p><p>Line 71 &#x0201c;pentacyclic triterpenoids particularly of the oleanane type&#x0201d;; please add also ursane (i.e., particularly of the oleanane and ursane type). Some berries contain ursolic acid as the main constituent in cuticular waxes (e,g., lingonberry, highbush blueberry etc.), besides, many fruits contain the mixture of acids of both types.</p><p>Line 157. &#x0201c;After removal of epicuticular wax crystals, berries were extracted with chloroform for 5 minutes in ultra-sonic. Extracts were washed three times with deionized water to remove hydrophilic organic compounds like sugars&#x0201d;.</p><p>The time of extraction is relatively long, this method may cause some contamination with constituents present in deeper layer (I don&#x02019;t mention sugars but triterpenoids that can be present in other tissues.) Have the Authors tried to validate this method in the context of the depth of chloroform penetration? I am not critizing this method as not suitable, I am just wondering what was the reason of choice of this time of extraction.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The study presented interesting results related to the formation and composition of the different layers of cuticle in a highly important cultivated fruit crop, winegrapes. Particularly this investigation shows for the first time in my knowledge, metabolic differences between epiculticular crystals and underlying waxes in berries, which is of great importance at the moment to undertake investigations related to biotic and abiotic cues on fruit surface protection.</p><p>The manuscript is well organized and well written with consistent results and adequate discussion. However, I would like to invite authors to mention in the material and method section, the position of selected clusters within the canopy as well as the position within the cluster of selected berries, since cuticle is highly dependent on cluster microclimate (e.g. temperature, humidity and radiation).</p><p>I also invite authors to check errors in spelling along the text due to tape mistakes, like in line 140, &#x02018;five&#x02019; instead of &#x02018;fife&#x02019;.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Dear reviewers,</p><p>First of all, thank you for reviewing our manuscript "Developmental pattern of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) berry cuticular wax: differentiation between epicuticular crystals and underlying wax" and the very helpful suggestions and corrections for improvement. We have taken into account most of the changes and amendments you suggested. Please find below comments on these revised positions.</p><p>Reviewer#1</p><p>Line 71 &#x0201c;pentacyclic triterpenoids particularly of the oleanane type&#x0201d;; please add also ursane (i.e., particularly of the oleanane and ursane type). Some berries contain ursolic acid as the main constituent in cuticular waxes (e,g., lingonberry, highbush blueberry etc.), besides, many fruits contain the mixture of acids of both types.</p><p>p4 line 71-73</p><p>I agree that ursane type needs to be added as it is also an important component of cuticular waxes in berries. I have added ursane-type so that now reads as you suggested: &#x0201c;&#x02026;particularly of the oleanane and ursane type..&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 157. &#x0201c;After removal of epicuticular wax crystals, berries were extracted with chloroform for 5 minutes in ultra-sonic. Extracts were washed three times with deionized water to remove hydrophilic organic compounds like sugars&#x0201d;.</p><p>The time of extraction is relatively long, this method may cause some contamination with constituents present in deeper layer (I don&#x02019;t mention sugars but triterpenoids that can be present in other tissues.) Have the Authors tried to validate this method in the context of the depth of chloroform penetration? I am not critizing this method as not suitable, I am just wondering what was the reason of choice of this time of extraction.</p><p>p 8 line 162</p><p>Deviating from the standard method with 30 sec extraction time, we used the optimal extraction time of 5 min for berries according to our experience. In this way, we reduced large variations in the wax content of the extracts. We have been using this extraction time, which deviates from the standard method, in our laboratory for quite some time and have successfully validated it in many experiments.</p><p>&#x02003;</p><p>Reviewer#2</p><p>Material &#x00026; Methods. I would like to invite authors to mention in the material and method section, the position of selected clusters within the canopy as well as the position within the cluster of selected berries, since cuticle is highly dependent on cluster microclimate (e.g. temperature, humidity and radiation).</p><p>I fully agree that the microclimate in the canopy and inside the cluster can lead to deviations in the wax composition. Therefore, we have taken care of this during sampling. and in the descriptions of the sampling pointed out: &#x0201c;For this purpose, three intact clusters inserted between the second and third nodes of the shoot were collected early in the morning from the experimental plots. Immediately after sampling, three berries of the same size were removed from the inside of each cluster&#x02026;.&#x0201d;</p><p>p 5, line 100-103 Please reformulate this last sentences (Introduction) because it is quite vague and intangible in a short-term; the scientific outputs of the work are per se very good achievements.</p><p>We reformulated the last sentence of the introduction to clearly articulate the outcome of the work and replaced it by: &#x0201e;The scientific results of this work represent significant achievements for targeted breeding of grapevine cultivars with resistance to pests and pathogens and higher berry resilience to environmental changes&#x0201d;.</p><p>Results Berry development. Please change this title according to the legend of the figure</p><p>The first two paragraphs have been combined and we improved the heading of the paragraph to make it more informative.</p><p>Results Berry development. Please remove figure 2 because the growth pattern of berries is well-known.</p><p>We removed Fig 2 showing the berry growth curve.</p><p>Results Berry development. Please clarify the differences between Tis Fig (Fig 3) and Fig1 1-G and 1-O, if the result is almost the same, please remove fig 3. or include the results of fig 3 in fig 1 to avoid redundancies.</p><p>We kept this Fig (now Fig 2), because it shows the structure of the wax crystals of the two cultivars in detail. In the discussion (p 18, line 396), we explain the different structure of the wax crystals of the two varieties, which can be seen very clearly in the two images.</p><p>Results Remaining wax 13. Please remove this title to make more informative</p><p>We changed the titles of all paragraphs of the results to make them more informative.</p><p>&#x02003;</p><p>Discussion p 15-18 Please include in the discussion more informative/integrative titles.</p><p>As with the results, we improved the headings of the paragraphs in the discussion to make them more infomative.</p><p>Discussion p 14 line 303-306. Please reformulate this sentence (&#x0201c;Since only the epicuticular wax crystals directly face the environment, it is of high importance to determine the chemical composition separately when dealing e.g. with plant-pest interactions or the impact of radiation.&#x0201d;); why radiation? What about dehydration, microbiota etc??</p><p>We reformulated these sentences now reading: &#x0201c;The epiculticular wax on the surface represent the interface between the berry and the environment. Therefore, the chemical and structural properties of this boundary layer are highly important for coping with abiotic and biotic external influences such as UV-radiation, dehydration, pests and pathogens.&#x0201d; </p><p>Discussion p 19 Biological aspects of wax crystal formation. Please recenter this sub-chapter specifically on the obtained results; the text should be shortened; as it is, the text is encyclopedic and speculative.</p><p>We shortened the last paragraph of the discussion and matched it to the statement in the last sentence of the introduction.</p><p>I also invite authors to check errors in spelling along the text due to tape mistakes, like in line 140, &#x02018;five&#x02019; instead of &#x02018;fife&#x02019;.</p><p>We have corrected all the spelling errors in the text that reviewer 2 has kindly noted</p><p>Please note that as a result of the revision, the line numbers of the originally submitted manuscript have changed.</p><p>Hopefully, with these corrections and amendments, we have now improved our manuscript sufficiently for publication. Again, thank you for your efforts.</p><p>With my best regards</p><p>Hanns-Heinz Kassemeyer</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0246693.s008"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to reviewer.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0246693.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0246693.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0246693.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ger&#x000f3;s</surname><given-names>Hern&#x000e2;ni</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2021 Hern&#x000e2;ni Ger&#x000f3;s</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2021</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Hern&#x000e2;ni Ger&#x000f3;s</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0246693" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
