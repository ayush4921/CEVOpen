Plants occupying wide habitats usually vary in phenotypes such as in morphology and metabolism, thereby developing into different ecotypes. Under canopy and open habitats are a pair of dissimilar habitats which possess <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants. However, few studies have focused on the effect of habitats on <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> growth, particularly combining morphological and metabolic changes. This study focused on <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants growing in under canopy and open habitats where morphology and metabolism changes were quantified using non-target metabolism methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The obtained results indicated that the two dissimilar habitats led to <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> developing into two distinct ecotypes where the morphology and metabolism were simultaneously changed. Under canopy habitats bred morphologically smaller <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants which had a higher level of metabolites (22 out of 31) which included five flavonoids, four isoflavonoids, and three anthracenes. On the other hand, the open habitats produced morphologically larger <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants having a higher level of metabolites (9 out of 31) including four flavonoids. 6 of the 31 metabolites were predicted to have effect targets, include 4 represent for under canopy habitats and 2 for open habitats. Totally, 208 targets were connected, among which 42 were communal targets for both under canopy and open habitats represent compounds, and 100 and 66 were unique targets for under canopy superior compounds and open habitats superior compounds, respectively. In addition, aloe-emodin, emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, sennoside A and sennoside B were all more accumulated in under canopy habitats, and among which aloe-emodin, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion were significantly higher in under canopy habitats.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study determined that <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> growing in under canopy and in open habitats developed into two distinct ecotypes with morphological and metabolic differences.

A previous study reported that there are many secondary metabolites of <italic>Rheum</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The dry roots of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> have been listed as herbal medicine in the official pharmacopoeias of many countries due to its strong purgative power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to the <italic>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</italic> (2015), <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic>, <italic>Rh. palmatum</italic> and <italic>Rh. officinal</italic> have been classified as &#x0201c;Dahuang&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Dahuang&#x0201d; has been shown to have several effects throughout the long herbal utilization history with the main effects including purgative, clearing heat, detoxification, breaking blood stasis, and relieving jaundice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More than 100 chemical components were reported from the three <italic>Rheum</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In China, <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> is mainly distributed in Qinghai, Sichuan, and Gansu provinces and in the region to the east of the Tibet Autonomous Region at an altitude ranging from 2000&#x02009;m to 4600&#x02009;m. Studies have shown that the quality of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> varies among different geological origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which can be attributed to environmental variations such as altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or other climate and soil factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Studies have reported that plants grown at specific habitats vary in their phenotypic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with plants occupying a wider range of habitats having more variations in their phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, a study reported variations in the leaf size of plants grown in a wide range of latitude due to temperature differences between the leaf and the air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition to morphology, the chemotype also acts as a direct indicator of plant phenotype at the metabolomic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and it reveals how the plants survive in a complex ecological environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Plant metabolomics provide a powerful tool for observing the enormous chemical diversity of plants and it helps in understanding the chemotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An example is a study which reported metabolic differences in orange fleshed and white fleshed sweet potato ecotypes where 148 and 126 metabolites respectively were identified as the characteristic chemotype metabolites for the two ecotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly, five chemotypes of <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> (L.) were identified using the metabolomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, several studies have reported that different ecotypes of plants usually respond to environmental changes in different ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Growing plants under a canopy or in the open habitat has a significant effect on the morphological and metabolic phenotypes of the plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This can be attributed to the changes in environmental factors such as light conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and soil conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Grapevines grown under canopy habitats were found to have a higher flower drop percentage and a lower level of some primary metabolites in its inflorescences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A previous study reported that the content of LMP-HPM in non-adapted <italic>Pteridium arachnoideum</italic> was significantly higher in plants grown in a sun-exposed habitat than in those grown under a canopy habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Generally, sunlight is an important factor that affects the growth and development of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The photosynthetic process varies as a result of changes in light availability and light composition with a study reporting a lowered photosynthetic capacity of soybean plants grown in reduced light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A previous study has shown that growing plants under canopy leads to light composition changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Light changes affect many of the physiological and morphological parameters in seedlings of tropical <italic>Bauhinia lianas</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and the phenology, growth, and biomass of <italic>Sacha Inchi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Another study suggested that these effects differ among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, the phenotype differences in plants grown under canopy habitats and open habitats can also be contributed by soil condition differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is because soil conditions such as soil nitrogen content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and soil humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] are also key factors that affect plant growth. Additionally, some properties such as wet and full organic compounds are beneficial to plants in adapting to growing under canopy shading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Generally, <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants have a broad habitat where they are natively distributed in a series of habitats including under canopy environments and open lands such as grasslands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], with the habitat differences urging this species to exhibit different phenotypes. In this study, two ecotypes of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> growing under-canopy-adapted and open-habitats-adapted were observed. Under-canopy-adapted plants were relative small and the roots were thinner. Currently, few studies have focused on the effects of habitats on the quality of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic>, and the metabolic changes between under canopy and open habitats <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants have not been elucidated.</p><p id="Par28">Consequently, the aim of this study was to find out the differences between two ecotypes of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> where the morphology and non-target metabolism of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> from open and under canopy habitats were explored. Two specific habitats were introduced where <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants grown in both habitats were collected from Qinghai, Sichuan, and Gansu provinces. The hypothesis for the study was that the two distinct habitats bred two ecotypes of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> with regards to the morphology and the chemotype. The results obtained from the two specific habitats can lead to researchers asking more detailed questions such as the influence of sunlight or soil conditions, thereby leading to an understanding of the potential drivers of the secondary metabolomics, and its connection with the observed morphological changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Morphological differences of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants growing in two different habitats</title><p id="Par29">Significant differences were found among plant height, root length, root diameter, leaf length and leaf lobes length, but not found in leaf lobes percentage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

These differences indicated that there were two ecotypes morphologically expressed between the two dissimilar habitats. Plant growth was higher in open habitats with the plants having significantly larger leaves and more roots than under canopy habitats. UV-B radiation was significantly higher when the high altitude on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau was considered. Therefore, the <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants might have developed protective mechanisms such as reinforced photosynthesis and water use efficiency to protect them from UV-B and light damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, the sunlight was filtered by canopy plants in the under canopy habitats and thus the UV-B light, blue light, red light and red to far red light ratio were all decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. All these changes in light quality and quantity can scale down photosynthesis. Therefore, <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> plants growing in the under canopy habitats were significantly smaller than those in open habitats. These results are consistent with results obtained from a study done on soybean where the general photosynthetic capacity was decreased despite the reduced light leading to higher light capture ability of soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">In addition, a study has reported that the soil properties are affected in native under canopy habitats which could affect the growth and development of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Under canopy habitats provide more nutritious and moist soil than open habitats, which contributes to the shade tolerance of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and, therefore, widens the niche of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Chemotypes of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> from two habitats</title><p id="Par39">The samples could be separated into two groups based on PCA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and HCA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) results, which indicated the metabolism differences between the two ecotypes. The results support our hypothesis that the two habitats breed two different chemotypes in addition to different morphology. Habitat induced chemotypes have been widely reported in plants. For example, American ginseng grown in wild and field habitats were significantly different in their metabolisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The medicinal compounds of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> have been widely studied because it is used as a medicinal herb.

However, there was little compatibility among the various studies indicating that a single factor may not be attributed to the variation in quality of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic>, and that the environmental factors causing the most habitat differences should be put forward for further studies on how rhubarbs achieved better quality. <italic>Rh. palmatum</italic> complex, including <italic>Rh. tanguticum, Rh. palmatum, and Rh. officinal</italic> together with few other species, have been found to relate with geological origins with regards to the metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which revealed different chemotypes of different geological origin in Qinghai province, Gansu province, and Sichuan province. However, although the administration region may uncover climate gradient in a relative large scale, it cannot reveal the exact habitat affection such as under canopy or open. In addition, there was no connection between the chemotype and the morphological variation. In this study, the morphology and metabolites revealed a simultaneous pattern in response to habitat change. Our previous study also revealed that the total anthraqunones content differed at under canopy and grassland habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">In this study, canopy shade was attributed to the light condition changes in the plants growing in under canopy habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The soil conditions such as soil humidity and nutrients also contributed to the changes. Canopy shade can lead to low UV-B radiation, low blue and red light, and a decreased red light to far red light ratio. The red and blue light is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments of plants growing under canopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The under canopy herbal plants have evolved shade tolerance strategies such as decreasing self-shading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], increasing leaf expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], specific leaf area, and photosystem II:I ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This is because they cannot avoid the shade habitats since they are unable to outcompete the woody plants. Soil humidity, soil total nitrogen content, and soil organic carbon content were also different where they were significantly higher at under canopy habitats with the exception of soil humidity (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

Both the under canopy and open habitats ecotypes of <italic>Rh. tanguticum</italic> were facing distinct environmental stresses. Specifically, most of the light was filtered by upper canopy in under canopy habitats which lead to lower photosynthesis rates when compared with open habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], thus it might be the most stressful factor. On the other hand, soil nutrients or soil humidity were limited for open habitats (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and thus they might be the most stressful factors.</p><p id="Par42">In total, 22 metabolites were more accumulated at under canopy habitats with most of them belonging to flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and anthracenes. In addition, nine metabolites including four flavonoids were higher at open habitats. The results indicated that flavonoids were the most changed class of metabolites. Several studies have focused on the flavonoids in leaves because they contain UV absorbing compounds which protect the leaves against the deleterious effects of UV radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, different types of flavonoids may have distinct responses to light change, which may be attributed to their different functions. Full light induced chlorotic leaves in a study done on tea plants where the flavonoids with ortho-dihydroxylated B-rings increased while total flavonoids decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Generally, leaves have usually been used as the study object due to the UV protective mechanism of flavonoids. Results obtained in this study indicate that flavonoids in the roots also vary between under canopy and open habitats suggesting that changes in light conditions also influences the flavonoids in roots. And in this study, flavonoids with relatively simple structure accumulated more in under canopy habitats, such as terniflorin, quercitrin, floribundoside, while complex flavonoids in structure accumulated more in open habitats, such as Isorhamnetin 3-O-[b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2)-a-L-rhamnopyranoside], 6&#x02033;-p-Coumaroylprunin, Epiafzelechin 3-O-gallate-(4beta-&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6)-epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate. The under canopy habitats were characterized by lower light quality and quantities, and wet soil enriched with organic compounds. Therefore, the flavonoids are also thought to be associated with other environmental stresses such as water, salt, nitrogen deficiency, and cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Among the 31 most changed metabolites, aloe-emodin was listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] as one of the main medical component used for judging the quality of &#x0201c;Dahuang&#x0201d;, and sennoside B was also an common used index to accesses quality.

In addition, the internal standard detection parameters were employed for perk RT alignment while the noise level and minimum intensity were set at 10.00 and 15% of base peak intensity respectively to eliminate noise peaks. As a result, a 3D matrix expressed with m/z, peak RT, and peak intensities was obtained. Additionally, peaks with missing values larger than 50% were excluded. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility). Metabolites were identified using the Progenesis QI automatic based on the accurate mass, MS/MS fragments, and isotope label by searching HMDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hmdb.ca/">http://www.hmdb.ca/</ext-link>), Lipidmaps (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lipidmaps.org/">http://www.lipidmaps.org/</ext-link>), and METLIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metlin.scripps.edu">http://metlin.scripps.edu</ext-link>) public databases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Targeted metabolites analysis</title><p id="Par54">Targeted metabolites analysis was conducted by an Agilent 1260 system which has been described in our former study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to reveal the overview classification of the samples while orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to determine the maximum separation of HA and HB samples. 7-fold cross validation and response permutation testing (RPT) were applied to avoid over-fitting. R<sup>2</sup> and Q<sup>2</sup> were calculated as 0.761 and&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.469 after 200 times of RPT indicating that the model was accurate. In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to further confirm the significantly different metabolites. The <italic>p</italic> value and the fold change value were obtained using student&#x02019;s t-test in combination with fold change analysis and the results were visualized using a volcano figure (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Meanwhile, the variable importance for the projection (VIP) value together with the <italic>p</italic> value were used to select the different components. The metabolites with a VIP value of &#x0003e;&#x02009;4.0 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were considered relevant for group discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with Turkey test to compare mean values for plant morphological analysis with the significant level being set as 0.05.

Swiss ADME (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.swissadme.ch/">http://www.swissadme.ch/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] was used to filter the metabolites based on their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) assessments. Metabolites with high gatrointestinal absorption index (GI absorption) and at least three &#x02018;yes&#x02019; in five druglikeness indexes (they were Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan and Muegge, respectively) were left for the target prediction. Then, Swiss Target Prediction tool was employed to predict potential gene targets of the filtered metabolites from Swiss ADME tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Targets with probability larger than 0 were used in the network contribution with their common name. At last, network files contained 6 metabolites and 208 targets were imported into the Cytoscape 3.8.2 software for network analysis.
