The genus <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> includes two botanical groups of tuberous ornamental flowers that are highly susceptible to the disease. Previous studies revealed that <italic>Z. aethiopica</italic>, a member of the section <italic>Zantedeschia</italic>, is significantly more resistant to <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> spp. than members of the same genus that belong to the section <italic>Aestivae</italic>. During early infection, we found different patterns of bacterial colonization on leaves of hosts belonging to the different sections. Similar patterns of bacterial colonization were observed on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) artificial inert replicas of leaf surfaces. The replicas confirmed the physical effect of leaf texture, in addition to a biochemical plant&#x02013;bacterium interaction. The differential patterns may be associated with the greater roughness of the abaxial leaf surfaces of <italic>Aestivae</italic> group that have evolutionarily adapted to mountainous environments, as compared to <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> group species that have adapted to warm, marshy environments. Transverse leaf sections also revealed compact aerenchyma and reduced the total volume of leaf tissue air spaces in <italic>Aestivae</italic> members. Finally, an analysis of defense marker genes revealed differential expression patterns in response to infection, with significantly higher levels of lipoxygenase 2 (<italic>lox</italic>2) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (<italic>pal</italic>) observed in the more resistant <italic>Z. aethiopica</italic>, suggesting greater activation of induced systemic resistance (ISR) mechanisms in this group. The use of <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> as a model plant sheds light on how natural ecological adaptations may underlay resistance to bacterial soft rot in cultivated agricultural environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotic</kwd><kwd>Natural variation in plants</kwd><kwd>Plant physiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (Grant No. 20-01-0193)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Zantedeschia</italic>, commonly known as calla lily, is one of the world&#x02019;s most iconic ornamental plants.

Soft rot in the genus <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> is caused mainly by <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> spp. through all phases of field production and storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that differences in the response of the two <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> groups to <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> infection may illuminate traits that are associated with higher resistance to the bacterium. Previous studies have characterized <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> accessions with relatively higher resistance to <italic>P. carotovorum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, suggesting a genetic background for soft rot resistance based on heredity patterns.

Using <italic>P. brasiliense</italic> (Pb), an emerging soft rot agent in warmer climate regions in potato and ornamentals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, our results confirmed earlier studies with <italic>P. carotovorum</italic> (formerly <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> subsp. <italic>carotovora</italic>) showing that colored <italic>Aestivae</italic> hybrids (FG, CR, and HS) are more susceptible to Pb infection than ZA, as they all developed typical soft rot disease symptoms with large necrotic areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The plant canopy is a major factor in environmental survival, establishment, and spread of bacterial diseases. Accordingly, we have focused on leaf architecture, which is the first layer for bacterial attachment, colonization, and penetration. Transverse sections of leaves and petioles allowed the characterization of the in-planta environment. Surprisingly, major differences in leaf surface textures between the two <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> groups were observed. The smoother, less complex architecture abaxial surface of ZA differed significantly from that of CR (and other colored hybrids). On the other hand, transverse sections displayed larger air spaces occupying more parenchyma space in ZA compared to the more compact tissue of CR. Even more pronounced is the difference in the air spaces in petioles, almost twofold higher in ZA than in CR. We speculate that the differences may have resulted from ecological niche adaptations of the two botanical sections. Though both originated from southern Africa (Cape province, Lesotho, Natal, Swaziland), ZA is almost exclusively confined to the southeastern coastal belt at altitudes up to 1000&#x02009;m of marshy wetlands; the colored <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> is restricted to the mountainous regions at altitudes of above 1200 and up to 2000&#x02009;m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The morphological features of smoother leaf surfaces and larger air spaces of the aerenchyma in leaves and petioles are part of habitat adaptation associated with wetlands and marshy valleys of lower altitude, inhabited by ZA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, while <italic>Aestivae</italic> species favor well-drained soil, with more condensed tissue and compact life form, typical of higher altitude. These features may also impact oxygen availability and possibly earlier development of anaerobic conditions during a bacterial attack. Anaerobiosis may affect oxygen-dependent host defenses, cell wall lignification, and suberization on the one hand, but also bacterial virulence and production of pectic enzymes on the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Larger air spaces may thus determine bacterial compatibility and contribute to higher resistance of ZA. SEM micrographs taken as soon as 3&#x02009;h post bacterial application to the leaf surfaces showed massive colonization on the colored hybrids (CR, FG, and HS) with structures typical of bacterial group behavior. In contrast, lower cell densities with infrequent colonies were observed on ZA. Since soft rot dispersal in agricultural systems is often associated with irrigation water or aerosols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, it is obvious that leaf surfaces facing the ground have a significant impact on bacterial attachment. After successful attachment, pioneering bacteria penetrate the leaf through stomatal openings, hydathodes, or wounds, colonize the intercellular spaces, and move forward to other tissues through the vascular system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To independently study the effect of leaf architecture on bacterial attachment and colonization, an artificial polymer replica of leaf surfaces was constructed by PDMS. Colonization patterns were recorded 4&#x02009;h post bacterial application to the artificial surface. The results revealed comparable patterns to those observed on true leaf surfaces. The effects of surface architecture on the formation of biofilms have been previously reported, using artificial nanostructure features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Surface topography also affected biofilm development when the mesoscale-patterned polymer was used, influencing species colonization, growth, and persistence when exposed to antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Here, leaf architecture was at least in part responsible for providing better conditions to <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> establishment on the colored <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> as observed by the formation of submicrometer-scale appendages similar to those observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> during cell adhesion and biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Other factors that influence leaf susceptibility/tolerance to soft rot have been previously shown to involve antimicrobial compounds, as well as innate or induced defense mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Defenses against <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> spp. involve both SAR and ISR signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here, limited fluorescence of GFP-labeled Pb+ cells was observed on ZA following infection, which was accompanied by the accumulation of phenolic compounds around the penetration site (observed under UV filter). The accumulation of phenolic compounds around the inoculation site could be a part of the plant defense response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The antimicrobial properties of phenolic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> could have resulted in restricted growth in ZA. Phenolic accumulation in ZA co-occurred with higher activity of PPO, the enzyme that oxidizes phenolics to quinones, which are suggested to be involved in plant defense against microbial pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Expression of defense-related genes lipoxygenase 2 (<italic>lox</italic>2), aspartate aminotransferase (<italic>ast</italic>), pathogenesis-related protein (<italic>pr1</italic>), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (<italic>pal</italic>) was studied. <italic>lox2</italic> encodes a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the defense-signaling hormone jasmonic acid and is a representative of the ISR pathway in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The largest increase in its expression was observed in ZA following Pb inoculation, which supports the induction of ISR signaling pathway in this section. <italic>ast</italic> is a regulator of carbon&#x02013;nitrogen metabolism and amino acid synthesis during plant defense response to necrotrophs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Higher expression of <italic>ast</italic> in Arabidopsis was correlated with increased sensitivity to <italic>Botrytis cinera</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Here, <italic>ast</italic> expression was upregulated in CR response to Pb infection, while in ZA, its expression was unchanged upon bacterial infection. Similarly, expression of <italic>pr1</italic>, the most recognized marker of SAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, was downregulated in both <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> cultivars in response to Pb inoculation, supporting previous reports showing that SAR is less efficient in resistance to <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> spp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Finally, <italic>pal</italic> expression is recognized as the first committed step in the phenylpropanoid pathway, leading to the synthesis of phenolic compounds. Expression levels of this gene were increased in both <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> sections, with a stronger response in ZA, confirming its involvement in resistance to <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> spp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This observation fits with the accumulation of phenolic compounds around the infection site in ZA.</p><p id="Par14">In conclusion, the involvement of less explored aspects of host&#x02013;plant interactions with the soft rot bacterium Pb was demonstrated. The emphasis on plant morphological features and environmental adaptations revealed higher resistance of <italic>Zantedeschia</italic> section to <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> spp. infection. This resistance mechanism is a multifaceted phenomenon that involves several factors of which surface area architectures and tissue compactness play a role in addition to differential induced defense responses following pathogen infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Plant material, bacterial strains, and growth conditions</title><p id="Par15">Commercially grown calla lily plants: white calla lily (<italic>Zantedeschia aetheopica</italic>) ZA and colored calla lily hybrids (&#x0201c;Captain Romance&#x0201d;, CR; &#x0201c;Florex Gold&#x0201d;, FG; &#x0201c;Hot Shot&#x0201d;, HS) were grown in a greenhouse (25/10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C maximum/minimum, natural daylight).
