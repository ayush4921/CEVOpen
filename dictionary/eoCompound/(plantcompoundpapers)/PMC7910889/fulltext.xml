Introduction</title><p>Botryosphaeria dieback, together with Esca, Eutypa dieback and Phomopsis, is the most important complex grapevine trunk disease (GTD) worldwide [<xref rid="B1-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The progression from infection to symptom onset is chronic and accumulates over time, resulting in production reduction, economic losses and even vineyard disruption. In the worst case, it leads to the need to replant the entire vineyard long before the normal useful life of the vineyard is reached [<xref rid="B1-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Botryosphaeria dieback caused by botryosphaeriaceous fungi is probably the most widespread GTD in the world [<xref rid="B5-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to colonization of the vine by pruning wounds, invasion of botryosphaeriaceous fungal agents occurs by airborne inoculum during rainfall in the vegetative growth period [<xref rid="B2-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to either protectively optimize the pruning time and technique or use pruning wound protectants; however, no efficient protective or curative measures have yet been found to control this aggressive disease [<xref rid="B2-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>The species within the Botryosphaeriaceae that infect grapevines have been proposed to be classified into three virulence levels, including highly virulent species (<italic>Lasiodiplodia</italic> spp. and <italic>Neofusicoccum</italic> spp.), moderately virulent species <italic>(Botryosphaeria dothidea</italic> and <italic>Diplodia</italic> spp.) and weakly virulent species (<italic>Dothiorella</italic> spp. and <italic>Spencermartinsia viticola</italic>) [<xref rid="B2-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the pathogens were detected in the wood but never in the leaves of infected plants, it was hypothesized that leaf symptoms might be caused by extracellular compounds of the fungi in the trunk transported by the transpiration stream [<xref rid="B7-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fungal filtrates (containing extracellular compounds) have been widely used since the 1980s as a substitute of the infective agent since the productions of host-selective toxins are involved as pathogenicity determinants [<xref rid="B9-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several toxic factors were found to be synthesized by the species of Botryosphaeriaceae, including mellein, cis, trans-4-hydroxymellein, 4,7-dihydroxymellein, naphthalene enone-related compounds and lipophilic low-molecular weight phytotoxins (exopolysaccharides, peptides or proteins) [<xref rid="B7-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that extracellular compounds produced by Botryosphaeriaceae species induced defense gene expression in grapevine cells [<xref rid="B7-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, extracellular proteins produced by <italic>N. parvum</italic> induced more intense early defense responses in <italic>Vitis rupestris</italic> cells than those produced by <italic>Diplodia seriata</italic> [<xref rid="B4-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>N. parvum</italic>, <italic>D. seriata</italic> is a less aggressive pathogen. Understanding its genetic and molecular basis and identifying key genes responsible for defense may provide valuable insights for GTD control. </p><p>Previous studies showed that a great number of genes are associated with defense responses to grapevine fungal diseases. The extracellular compounds from <italic>D. seriata</italic> induced the expression of glutathione S-transferase (<italic>GST1</italic>), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (<italic>PAL</italic>), stilbene synthase (<italic>STS</italic>), pathogenesis-related protein 6 (<italic>PR6</italic>), class IV chitinase (<italic>Chit4c</italic>) and pathogenesis-related protein 10 (<italic>PR10</italic>) in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> cv. Chardonnay at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) but not at 1 dpi [<xref rid="B12-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The expression of superoxide dismutase (<italic>SOD</italic>), hypersensitive response (<italic>HSR</italic>), <italic>STS</italic> and <italic>PR</italic> was evaluated in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> subsp. <italic>sylvestris</italic> as early as 12 hours post-inoculation (hpi) [<xref rid="B14-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These results showed that some of these genes were not only up-regulated after incubation, but also correlated with cultivar susceptibility to <italic>D. seriata</italic>. </p><p>Subcellular components are involved in defense responses. A target of toxin action by Eutypa dieback is in the plasmalemma, as found in infection of <italic>V. vinifera</italic> cv. Cabernet Sauvignon [<xref rid="B15-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent advances revealed that cellular connectivity via regulation of plasmodesmata permeability is tightly related to plant defense pathways [<xref rid="B16-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Plant microtubules (MTs) have been proposed for signaling transduction in plant defense responses [<xref rid="B18-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Several studies indicated that MTs not only play the role as the scaffold of the cell, but are also involved in the activation of downstream gene expressions in grapevine cells responding to biotic [<xref rid="B19-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and abiotic stresses [<xref rid="B20-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A <italic>V. rupestris</italic> cell suspension culture expressing GFP-<italic>At</italic>TUB6 was established and used to investigate the function of MTs in processing and decoding stress signals under very early biotic/abiotic stress conditions [<xref rid="B21-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some of the toxic extracellular proteins from <italic>D. seriata</italic> have been identified [<xref rid="B7-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], where the <italic>V. rupestris</italic> cells were used and revealed a rapid increase in extracellular pH, superoxide dismutase (ROS) production, cell death and the expression of some defense genes (<italic>VvPR1</italic>, <italic>VvPR6</italic>, <italic>VvPR10.1</italic>, <italic>VvSTS1</italic> and <italic>VvChit4c</italic>) [<xref rid="B4-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the comprehensive mechanisms at the transcriptional level of Botryosphaeria dieback resistance in <italic>V. rupestris</italic> are still elusive.</p><p>RNA-seq was applied in this study to reveal potential resistance mechanisms and genes associated with defense responses to <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1. Transcription factors (TFs), Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways related to the process of disease resistance were identified. The relationships between 53 TFs, three categories (biological process, cellular component and molecular function) of GO enrichment and 20 significantly enriched pathways and defense responses were analyzed. The data of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in subcellular components revealed the significant reaction of the anchored component of the plasma membrane, microtubule and cell wall to incubation with <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1. These results help to clarify the mechanism of responses in <italic>V. rupestris</italic> cells to Botryosphaeria dieback and will facilitate further studies to control GTD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-genes-12-00179"><title>2.

Those genes encoding tubulin &#x003b1; chain, tubulin &#x003b2;-1 chain and tubulin &#x003b2;-2 chain were enriched in microtubule of cellular component. Likewise, the down-regulation of DEGs in cell wall, e.g., <italic>expansin A4</italic>, limited the maintenance of cell rigidity, as well as regulating the growth and division of cells. The majority of DEGs enriched in the category of plasmodesma were down-regulated, which probably functioned in dispelling plasmodesmata under the fungal filtrates incubation. In terms of molecular function, the accumulations of STS and PAL in trihydroxy stilbene synthase activity and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, respectively, were enriched in biological process as well. Reduced xyloglucosyl transferase activity indicated that the processes of formation and enlargement of the cell wall were blocked partially. The down-regulation of DEGs enriched in microtubule motor activity revealed that the contributions of kinesin-like protein on microtubule-based movement were inhibited.</p><p>The innate immunity in plants is composed of two layers: the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref rid="B45-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. At the level of PTI, receptor protein kinases (RPKs) on the plasma membrane represent the main pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) perceiving diverse PAMPs [<xref rid="B46-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In <italic>V. rupestris</italic> cells incubated with <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1, three RPKs, including BAK1, FLS2 and EFR, were identified. As a central regulator of the PTI level, BAK1 is the target of several pathogen virulence effector molecules. Rather than influencing elicitor perception directly, it could rapidly form a complex with FLS2, the receptor for the bacterial flagellin, after elicitation [<xref rid="B47-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The up-regulation of these two RPKs suggests that a complex may have formed after <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1 incubation in <italic>V. rupestris</italic> cells. In addition, this complex involved in endocytotic recycling of plant PAMP receptors is often necessary for signaling from intracellular compartments [<xref rid="B48-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The EFR allows the plant cells to recognize and bind to bacterial EF-Tu and prevent genetic transformation and protein synthesis in the pathogen [<xref rid="B49-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the present study, the expression of <italic>EFR</italic> was up-regulated after incubation with culture filtrates of <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1. Involved in several cascades, these RPKs led to the activation of the WRKY transcription factors such as <italic>WRKY33, WRKY29</italic> and <italic>WRKY22,</italic> which induced the expression of defense-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00179-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the transduction of the calcium signal through the cyclic nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) affected Rboh and CaM/CML, giving rise to the hypersensitive response (HR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00179-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and cell wall reinforcement [<xref rid="B50-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Moreover, the genes encoding CDPKs [<xref rid="B51-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], WRKY [<xref rid="B37-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], ERF [<xref rid="B29-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], LRR [<xref rid="B52-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], MYB [<xref rid="B53-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and PR [<xref rid="B14-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have also been reported to play resistant roles in biotic stress responses.</p><p>At the ETI level, the avirulent (Avr) protein induced a HR via a bacterial secretion system [<xref rid="B31-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A fungal effector, AvrA10, activated the expression of <italic>WRKY2</italic> which triggered the downstream defense-related gene expression and programmed cell death in <italic>V. pseudoreticulata</italic> to powdery mildew [<xref rid="B40-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this study, five genes encoding disease resistance proteins (104881039 and 109121518 were up-regulated; 100855173, 104877588 and 104881511 were down-regulated) and one uncharacterized gene (100261821) were differentially expressed. Among them, two R-proteins (RPM1 and RPS2) were encoded. </p><p>Plant hormones such as SA, JA, GA, ABA, auxin and brassinosteroids (BR) play key roles in the complex signaling cascades of defense responses [<xref rid="B17-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B21-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B54-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our previous findings showed that JA induced bundling of microtubules and auxin can revert such JA-induced bundling in <italic>V. rupestris</italic> suspension cells [<xref rid="B21-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fung et al. (2008) [<xref rid="B54-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showed that ABA is possibly involved in the inhibition of SA in grapevine resistance to <italic>E. necator</italic>, a causal agent of powdery mildew. However, the expression patterns of ABA and BR resistance to <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1 in this study were different from the resistance to <italic>E. necator</italic>. BR-associated receptor kinase 1 was up-regulated; meanwhile, no DEG related to ABA has been found yet (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00179">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). The concentrations of ABA and the glucose esters of ABA (ABA-GE) were increased after Eutypa dieback infection, which accumulated as the symptom became more serious. This may indicate the perturbation of ABA-GE translation or the synthesis of ABA [<xref rid="B56-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. SA was required for TGA1 (a transcription factor) to interact with NPR1 (a disease resistance protein) in plant cells [<xref rid="B57-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Where some DRPs may serve as cofactors conferring redox regulation of DNA binding activity to TGA2.2 [<xref rid="B58-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] which was identified in this study as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-12-00179">Supplementary Table S9</xref>).</p><p>The reactions of subcellular components to pathogens have been reported in plant cells. Amborab&#x000e9; et al. (2001) [<xref rid="B15-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found the plasmalemma is an essential target of a toxin produced by <italic>Eutypa lata</italic>, the causal agent of Eutypa dieback. Via plasmodesmata, SA signaling components regulate cellular connectivity in plant innate immunity [<xref rid="B16-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton against fungal penetration attempts is a basic and prompt response. Not only playing important roles in penetration resistance by the polarization of defense-related reactions [<xref rid="B19-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], actin filaments and microtubules are involved in the expression of hypersensitive reactions [<xref rid="B60-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and elicitor-induced signal transduction [<xref rid="B62-genes-12-00179" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. According to the cellular components of GO enrichment in this study, the expression of DEGs enriched in anchored component of plasma membrane, microtubule and cytoskeletal were all down-regulated, and most of the DEGs in plasmodesma were as well. As both <italic>NACK2</italic> and <italic>65-kDa MAP</italic> were down-regulated, the DEGs associated with cytoskeleton suggested that the formation of microtubules and the following regulation of cell development declined after incubation with <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1. The qRT-PCR results of <italic>TUB4</italic>, <italic>KIN-4A</italic> and <italic>65kDa MAP</italic> further verify the down-regulation of genes associated with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00179-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The rearrangements of MTs were examined at 3 dpi with a relatively mild culture filtrate concentration to provide the impression on cell morphology at the same timepoint and concentration when RNA-seq was conducted. Since the MTs&#x02019; responses to biotic/abiotic stresses are prompt, the images at 20 min and 24 h post-incubation with higher concentrations are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00179-f004">Figure 4</xref>A. Our results show that <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1 induced short-wide cells in the suspension cell line at 3 dpi. This abnormal phenotype was due to the depolymerization of MTs, which affected the axial expansion of cells. The long-term impact on &#x00394;PCV at 6 dpi was caused by the individual reduced cell volume rather than the destroyed mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00179-f004">Figure 4</xref>B, C) of the cell colony.</p><p>This research provides a comprehensive analysis of DEGs that respond to <italic>D. seriata</italic> 98.1. A total of 748 up-regulated and 617 down-regulated DEGs were identified. The result of RNA-seq was verified by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, transcription factors, GO terms and pathways related to defense responses were analyzed. Our results suggest that some important DEGs and transcription factors are involved in innate immunity, plant hormones and cell subcellular components, which play key roles in disease resistance. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-genes-12-00179"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/2/179/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/2/179/s1</uri>, Table S1: Primers for qPCR, Table S2: Reads sequenced and mapped to reference genome, Table S3: The pearson correlation coefficient, Table S4: List of DEGs identified, Table S5: Differentially expressed transcription factors, Table S6: GO enrichment, Table S7: DEGs list of significantly enriched GO terms, Table S8: Pathway Enrichment Analysis, Table S9: DEGs in enriched pathways related to resistance</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="genes-12-00179-s001"><media xlink:href="genes-12-00179-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, X.G.; investigation, L.Z., S.Y. and H.Z.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, L.Z. and S.Y.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, L.Z., S.Y. and X.
