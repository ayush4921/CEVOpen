    "The plant kingdom is a source of important therapeutic agents. Therefore, in this review, we focus on natural compounds that exhibit efficient anti-inflammatory activity via modulation signaling transduction pathways in macrophage cells. Both extracts and pure chemicals from different species and parts of plants such as leaves, roots, flowers, barks, rhizomes, and seeds rich in secondary metabolites from various groups such as terpenes or polyphenols were included. Selected extracts and phytochemicals control macrophages biology via modulation signaling molecules including NF-κB, MAPKs, AP-1, STAT1, STAT6, IRF-4, IRF-5, PPARγ, KLF4 and especially PI3K/AKT. Macrophages are important immune effector cells that take part in antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and immunomodulation. The M1 and M2 phenotypes are related to the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively. The successful resolution of inflammation mediated by M2, or failed resolution mediated by M1, may lead to tissue repair or chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is strictly related to several disorders. Thus, compounds of plant origin targeting inflammatory response may constitute promising therapeutic strategies."
