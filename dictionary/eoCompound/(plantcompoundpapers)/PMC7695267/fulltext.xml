Accordingly, <italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78 (AZ78) grown on a protein-rich medium was previously found to emit volatile pyrazines with toxic activity against soilborne phypathogenic fungi and oomycetes. However, the discrepancy between the quantity of pyrazines in the gaseous phase and the minimum quantity needed to achieve inhibition of plant pathogens observed, lead us to further investigate the volatile-mediated inhibitory activity of AZ78. Here, we show that, besides VOCs, AZ78 cells produce ammonia in increased amounts when a protein-rich medium is used for bacterial growth. The production of this volatile compound caused the alkalinization of the physically separated culture medium where <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> was inoculated subsequently. Results achieved in this work clearly demonstrate that VOC, ammonia and the growth medium alkalinization contribute to the overall inhibitory activity of AZ78 against <italic>R. solani</italic>. Thus, our findings suggest that the volatile-mediated inhibitory activity of rhizobacteria in protein-rich substrates can be regarded as a result of multiple factors interaction, rather than exclusively VOCs production.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78</kwd><kwd>VOC</kwd><kwd>protein-rich medium</kwd><kwd><italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic></kwd><kwd>ammonia</kwd><kwd>substrate pH</kwd><kwd>rhizobacteria</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-microorganisms-08-01761"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In the complex environment of the rhizosphere, plant&#x02013;microbe and microbe&#x02013;microbe interactions are partly facilitated by the release of various non-volatile and volatile compounds from all parties involved [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bacteria inhabiting the rhizosphere, for instance, produce a plethora of secondary metabolites, which are involved in various processes such as intraspecies signaling, beneficial, as well as antagonistic interactions with other bacteria, fungi or plants. The latter is related to the production of soluble antibiotics and volatile compounds that can boost the defense of bacteria and assist them to compete for space and nutrients [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The production of volatile compounds by bacteria has been shown to be tightly linked to the composition of the growth medium used for cultivation [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Different types of volatile and non-volatile compounds were produced by bacteria when traditional synthetic growth media and media mimicking rhizosphere conditions were used, respectively [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], pointing to the importance of nutrient availability for the type of compounds synthesized.</p><p>Among the metabolites produced by bacteria to achieve antibiosis, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been increasingly studied in the recent years. Different types of bacterial VOCs have been shown to negatively affect the viability of various plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Pyrazines, for instance, are emitted by various rhizobacterial taxa and have been shown to contribute to their volatile-mediated inhibitory activity [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, few reports exist on the contribution of other type of volatile compounds to the inhibition of plant pathogens, like inorganic ammonia that has been shown to be fungistatic [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and is known to be produced by bacteria [<xref rid="B14-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ammonia is generally not covered during volatile analysis since this gaseous compound with low molecular weight and high polarity requires special gas chromatography (GC)-columns and instrumental conditions that are often not part of the commonly used gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS) methods [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies on the composition of the volatile blend of bacteria have been focusing on the VOCs produced, utilizing common GC&#x02013;MS methods for chemical analysis and thus possibly neglecting the contribution of ammonia to the bacterial volatile mixture. However, complementary to GC&#x02013;MS methods, colorimetric assays have been successfully applied to detect ammonia in the bacterial volatile blend [<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Soil can be enriched with ammonia by the emissions of microorganisms that either decompose dead organic matter rich in organic nitrogen (proteins, amino acids and nucleic acids) or degrade N-containing excretions of living organisms, such as urea [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Ammonia has been identified as one of the compounds associated with soil natural fungistasis [<xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, the addition of nitrogenous amendments in soil enhances natural decomposition, resulting in increased generation of ammonia that suppresses the growth of plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Soil bacteria (e.g., <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> sp., etc.) have been shown to emit ammonia [<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that in some cases suppressed the growth of their antagonistic plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes [<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In most of the cases, the use of substrates rich in proteins or amino acids was associated with the production of ammonia by bacteria in vitro [<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a phenomenon related to amino acid catabolism that involves, among others, deamination reactions which result in the subsequent release of ammonia gas [<xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Ammonia-mediated natural fungistasis has been associated with alkaline soils [<xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Indeed, soil pH is one of the most influential factors modulating the microbial community composition and dynamics [<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In forest and arable soils with natural pH gradients, the fungal growth was favored by acidic conditions, while bacterial growth was favored by pH increase to more neutral or alkaline soil [<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In vitro cultivation, most fungi prefer pH range of 5&#x02013;6.5 for optimal growth, while most bacteria preferably grow on alkaline substrates with pH above 7 [<xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The bacteria-mediated inhibition of growth and sporulation of plant pathogenic fungi in vitro has been associated in some studies with pH changes of adjacent, physically separated substrates [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The change of pH in this case was considered more like an indicator of the bacterial volatiles&#x02019; basicity or acidity, rather than a factor contributing to the volatile compound-mediated inhibition [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p><italic>Lysobacter</italic> sp. occupy a variety of ecological niches including freshwater and soil [<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Species of the genus inhabiting soil have been associated with natural fungistasis [<xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and a free living nitrogen-fixing strain that accumulates ammonia in vitro has additionally been characterized [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The genus constitutes a major source of lytic enzymes (e.g., chitinases), as well as antibacterial (e.g., WAP-8294A2) and antifungal (e.g., heat stable antifungal factor) secondary metabolites [<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Lysobacter</italic> sp. have been characterized as producers of VOCs with anti-oomycete activity [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The biocontrol agent <italic>L. capsici</italic> AZ78 (AZ78) [<xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] can successfully suppress the growth of plant pathogenic oomycetes by implementing mycophagy [<xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], secretion of secondary metabolites [<xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and lytic enzymes [<xref rid="B44-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Recently, AZ78 was shown to be able to emit VOCs with inhibitory activity against plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the abundance of these metabolites in the blend of AZ78 volatiles could not fully explain the growth inhibition of plant pathogens in vitro [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, former results on <italic>Lysobacter</italic> sp. VOCs showed a correlation between the type of volatiles produced and the type of growth media used [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Based on these observations, we tried in the present study to illustrate that further compounds and factors account for the volatile-mediated inhibitory activity of AZ78.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-microorganisms-08-01761"><title>2.

Consequently, a colorimetric NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assay was used to estimate whether ammonia and/or amines were emitted in the gas phase of the Petri dish where AZ78 was growing.

Discussion</title><p>AZ78 has been formerly reported to produce various volatile pyrazines that inhibited the growth of plant pathogenic fungi and an oomycete [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, when testing single pyrazines produced by AZ78, their limited inhibitory activity was pointing to other factors or compounds that may contribute as well to the bioactivity of AZ78 [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, a former study on the VOCs produced by four <italic>Lysobacter</italic> type strains indicated that the inhibitory activity against <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> was dependent on the type of growth medium used [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Based on these results, we aimed to investigate (1) whether the protein excess in the medium does affect the inhibitory activity of AZ78, (2) which VOCs constitute the blend emitted by AZ78 and (3) discover which compounds are differentially produced that would play a putative role in <italic>R. solani</italic> inhibition. Here we show that although it is obvious that VOCs contribute to the inhibitory activity of AZ78, other factors are as well playing a role in inhibition that will be discussed in detail below.</p><p>Confirming the results of Lazazzara et al. [<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the inhibitory effect of the emitted volatiles on the mycelium growth of <italic>R. solani</italic> was significantly enhanced when AZ78 was grown on NA medium, compared to when NA was amended with 20 g/L of <sc>d</sc>-glucose (NAG). The DHS-TD-GC-MS analysis that followed to investigate the composition of the VOC profiles revealed that pyrazines was the major group of compounds produced in both cases and that the majority of the compounds produced were similar between the two types of growth media. The compound preferentially produced by AZ78 grown on NA medium was 2,5-dimethylpyrazine but was not detected in the head space above PDA medium from Petri dishes where AZ78 was grown on NAG. These results further reinforce our previous hypothesis that pyrazines, including 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, contribute to AZ78 inhibitory activity [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. On the other hand, 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine was detected in similar amounts in the head space above PDA from split Petri dishes with AZ78 grown on NA and NAG medium, while AZ78 grown on NAG produced higher amounts of this VOC. Further, 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine was shown to inhibit the mycelial growth of <italic>R. solani</italic> when tested as synthetic compound and was found to be more efficient&#x02014;in terms of minimum dosage and maximum inhibition, than 2,5-dimethylpyrazine [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, the differences in the type and amount of VOCs produced could not entirely explain the difference in <italic>R. solani</italic> inhibition observed between AZ78 grown on NA and NAG medium. Consequently, we investigated whether other volatiles are involved in the inhibitory activity of AZ78 or/and further factors may contribute to the inhibition of <italic>R. solani</italic> growth. In the experiments that followed, it was demonstrated that AZ78 differentially produces alkaline volatiles, according to the culture medium used and that higher amounts were released during cultivation on NA medium compared to NAG. These basic volatiles were shown to contribute to the inhibitory activity of AZ78, as demonstrated by the partial alleviation of <italic>R. solani</italic> inhibition following the addition of phosphoric acid in the assay. In parallel, we observed that the pH of PDA in split Petri dishes increased from pH 5.6 to pH 8.2 when AZ78 was grown in the separated compartment on NA and up to pH 7.6 when the bacterium was grown on NAG. Based on the current literature on alkaline bacterial volatile compounds we concluded that ammonia may contribute to both PDA pH increase and antifungal activity [<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Subsequently, ammonia was confirmed to be released by AZ78 and be involved in the PDA medium alkalinization and inhibition of <italic>R. solani</italic>. Furthermore, it was investigated whether AZ78 also produced trimethylamine that has previously been shown to alkalinize the physically separated growth medium [<xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We found that under the tested conditions the emission of trimethylamine by AZ78, if any, would be too low to be considered in PDA alkalinization.</p><p>As <italic>R. solani</italic> mycelium had been reported to grow from pH 4 to pH 9 depending on the strain, while the optimum growth pH for this pathogen has been estimated to be pH 5.6 [<xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], experiments were conducted using NaOH solution to adjust the pH of PDA, in order to investigate to what extent the pH of the growth substrate was contributing to inhibition. At pH 7.6, <italic>R. solani</italic> mycelium growth was attenuated to the same degree as when AZ78 was grown on NAG in the physically separated compartment of the split Petri dish. In contrast, at pH 8.2, <italic>R. solani</italic> growth was inhibited significantly less when compared to the inhibition caused by AZ78 on NA. These observations lead us to speculate that alkalinization of PDA by the ammonia emissions of AZ78 is contributing only to some extent in <italic>R. solani</italic> growth inhibition.</p><p>Based on the semi-quantitative NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assay we estimated that the gas phase inside the split Petri dishes with AZ78 grown on the protein-rich medium NA contained 50 &#x003bc;mol of ammonia, while only 1/10, around 5 &#x003bc;mol, of ammonia were found in split Petri dishes with AZ78 grown on NAG. This tenfold increase in ammonia emission can be explained by the substrate available to the bacteria for generating energy and biomass. As all heterotrophic organisms, aerobic bacteria generate energy (ATP) by oxidizing organic nutrients of their growth substrate, such as carbohydrates (e.g., glucose) and amino acids, following a process known as respiration [<xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In contrast to glucose catabolism, during utilization of amino acids for energy generation, ammonia is formed as a by-product. When amino acids are used as energy source, they are catabolized to various intermediates of the TCA cycle, like fumarate or pyruvate [<xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with ammonia being generated as a result of oxidative or reductive deamination [<xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], hydrolysis [<xref rid="B54-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] or decarboxylation [<xref rid="B55-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] of the amino acids. Examples include L-aspartate and glycine that have been identified as major amino acid precursors for ammonia production in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> [<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], respectively. The ammonia formed can then either be recycled as a nitrogen source for amino acid and nucleic acid biosynthesis or excreted from bacterial cells as a gas [<xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, the excess of nitrogen-containing molecules in NA growth medium probably drives AZ78 to use amino acids as an energy source and this favors the formation of ammonia. Similar findings have been reported for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. [<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the rhizosphere of plants, AZ78 could potentially encounter conditions with an excess of amino acids or proteins. For bacteria, root exudates of crop plants for example are a major source of both amino acids and sugars, along with organic acids, phenolic compounds and minerals [<xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Interestingly, increased amounts of amino acids and decreased production of sugars have been observed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> root exudates, following foliar inoculation with <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> [<xref rid="B60-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, most soilborne plant pathogenic fungi, including <italic>R. solani</italic>, are necrotrophs [<xref rid="B61-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] that survive by killing and feeding on cells of host plants, commonly of the roots. Following plant cell lysis, amino acids would be released to the rhizosphere [<xref rid="B62-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Additionally, the attack strategies of AZ78 against plant pathogenic oomycetes involve the use of proteolytic and other enzymes for cell wall degradation and eventually cell lysis [<xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In all the above scenarios, a local enrichment of amino acids/peptides could occur in the rhizosphere, which might favor the formation of ammonia by AZ78 cells, resulting in high ammonia concentrations in situ that could directly antagonize the nearby plant pathogenic microorganisms. Interestingly, an enhanced production of ammonia in soil amended with the amino acid glycine, has already been observed in vitro for <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> [<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Ammonia, as a small neutral molecule, can passively diffuse through cell membranes and lipid bilayers [<xref rid="B63-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], influencing fungal or oomycete cells in various ways. High ammonia influx into fungal cells, will potentially result in increased pH of cytoplasm and organelles [<xref rid="B64-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In filamentous fungi, special plasma membrane P-ATPase transport proteins regulate the intracellular pH and maintain a proper ion balance across the cytoplasmic membrane [<xref rid="B65-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], as an increased intracellular pH can negatively influence vital cellular processes, including the enzymatic transformations, the configuration of proteins, ATP synthesis and nutrient import [<xref rid="B66-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Moreover, fungal cells possess specific membrane located ammonium/ammonia transporters (MEPs), as in the case of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> [<xref rid="B67-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] that regulate the ammonia diffusion in the cells [<xref rid="B63-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Due to these equilibrating mechanisms, in the case of a high ammonia influx, a respective high ammonium/ammonia efflux will probably follow, resulting in a high consumption rate of chemical energy, with negative effects on cell functions, as it has been demonstrated in plants [<xref rid="B70-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Additionally, evidence of direct disruption of the fungal cell membrane integrity by high gaseous ammonia concentrations has been reported that resulted in mycelium electrolyte leakage and respiration inhibition [<xref rid="B71-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Hence, ammonia can have detrimental effects on <italic>R. solani</italic> cells and although, as discussed above, probably certain regulatory mechanisms can counteract the negative consequences, it seems that there is a certain regulatory capacity limit (i.e., concentration threshold) above which the fungal cells are no longer capable of homeostasis.</p><p>This hypothesis is reflected in our findings, as little or no growth was observed when AZ78 was grown on NA medium and the PDA pH increased to 8.2 presumably by the release of ammonia. The seemingly small difference between pH 7.6 and pH 8.2 is accompanied by a tenfold increase in gaseous ammonia concentration inside the Petri dish and consequently higher accumulation in the PDA medium, suggesting a higher ammonia influx into <italic>R. solani</italic> cells that further supports the various scenarios leading to growth inhibition. Thus, the significant differences in mycelial growth observed between cultivation on alkalinized PDA with pH 7.6 and PDA with pH 8.2, can largely be attributed to the detrimental effects of high ammonia concentration. Furthermore, the significant difference between the inhibitory effect of alkalinized PDA (pH 8.2) by the addition of NaOH and of ammonia are further supporting the hypothesis that both direct exposure to ammonia as well as elevated pH contribute to the higher growth inhibition of <italic>R. solani</italic> mycelium with AZ78 growing on NA medium. Our findings are in accordance with previous studies where the germination of conidia of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>Penicillium griseofulvum</italic> was inhibited by ammonium bicarbonate at high pH values, as a result of the release of high concentrations of ammonia, while the increased extracellular pH was not considered as the sole reason for inhibition, as conidia viability was not remarkably affected by PDA with buffered respective pH values [<xref rid="B72-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Similarly, the germination of <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> microsclerotia was attenuated with increased concentrations of ammonium and pH values and likewise, less germination was observed by increasing concentrations of ammonia in the agar medium [<xref rid="B73-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>The structure of soil and of the rhizosphere that can in some cases favor the accumulation of volatile molecules in soil pores [<xref rid="B74-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and, additionally, the continuous production and release of volatiles by bacteria like AZ78, support the possibility of ammonia to accumulate to concentrations acutely toxic to plant pathogenic microorganisms. On the other hand, several factors in the soil environment could potentially reduce the amounts of ammonia accumulated, including ammonia decomposition by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or incorporation into humic acids [<xref rid="B75-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In this case, the inhibitory effect could be impeded, as it was demonstrated by the moderate inhibitory activity observed following single application of 50 &#x003bc;mol aq. ammonia in the split Petri dish and additionally by the decrease of AZ78 inhibitory activity when phosphoric acid was present in the Petri dish. Moreover, it should be considered that the soil pH and soil buffering capacity, also play a crucial role in the equilibrium between gaseous ammonia and the ammonium cation. Alkaline soils supplied with ammonia-releasing nitrogenous amendments showed an enhanced suppressiveness [<xref rid="B76-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Similarly, our experiment with the combination of 50 &#x003bc;mol of aq. ammonia and PDA with pH 8.2 adjusted by NaOH, resulted in an inhibition of <italic>R. solani</italic> growth significantly higher than the ammonia application combined with regular PDA with pH 5.6. Adding further to the complexity of the conditions found in the rhizosphere environment, soil pH is constantly influenced by root exudates [<xref rid="B77-microorganisms-08-01761" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Hence, it is probably more realistic to state that in soil, the complementary effect of ammonia and substrate pH will contribute to AZ78 inhibitory activity. Ammonia emissions, VOC emissions and substrate pH were shown here for the first time to interact and drastically inhibit the growth of <italic>R. solani</italic> in vitro. Thus, although in the closed set-up of the Petri dish the accumulation in PDA of ammonia emitted by AZ78 grown on NA medium is presumably the major inhibitory factor, our findings suggest that under real-world conditions it is likely that the volatile-mediated inhibition caused by AZ78 in protein-rich substrates can be achieved by the interaction of multiple factors, including inorganic ammonia, VOCs and substrate pH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-microorganisms-08-01761"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, when grown on a protein-rich medium in vitro, AZ78 produces ammonia high enough to alkalinize the PDA medium of the adjacent compartment and sufficiently suppress the growth of <italic>R. solani.</italic> The plant pathogenic fungus is secondarily inhibited by alkaline pH and the combination of ammonia and alkaline pH proved to be crucial for inhibition. The synergistic effects of ammonia, alkaline pH and VOC were demonstrated that under certain conditions, probably found in the rhizosphere, could lead to the inhibition of plant pathogens from a distance. Our findings point to the involvement of ammonia and substrate pH in addition to VOCs, in the volatile-mediated inhibitory activity of rhizobacteria and intensify the complexity of bacterial-fungal interactions in the rhizosphere niche, where nutrient availability and pH can be constantly variable. Based on the results found in this research study, future experiments shall be carried out using substrates and conditions closer to the natural soil environment to further develop and test this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We greatly thank the colleagues of the Institute of Biotechnology in Plant Production, IFA-Tulln for their support and providing access to the facilities needed for preparation of bacterial cultures.
