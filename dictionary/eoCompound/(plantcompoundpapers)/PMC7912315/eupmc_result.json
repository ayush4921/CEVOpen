    "Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne virus endemic to sub-Saharan African countries, and the first sporadic outbreaks outside Africa were reported in the Asia-Pacific region. There are no approved therapeutic agents available for RVFV; however, finding an effective antiviral agent against RVFV is important. This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of medicinal plant extracts. Twenty medicinal plants were screened for their anti-RVFV activity using the cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method. The cytotoxicity assessment of the extracts was done before antiviral screening using the MTT assay. Antioxidant and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species' (ROS/RNS) inhibitory activity by the extracts was investigated using non-cell-based and cell-based assays. Out of twenty plant extracts tested, eight showed significant potency against RVFV indicated by a decrease in tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) < 10<sup>5</sup>. The cytotoxicity of extracts showed inhibitory concentrations values (IC<sub>50</sub>) > 200 µg/mL for most of the extracts. The antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory results revealed that extracts scavenged free radicals exhibiting an IC<sub>50</sub> range of 4.12-20.41 µg/mL and suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by 60-80% in Vero cells. This study demonstrated the ability of the extracts to lower RVFV viral load and their potency to reduce free radicals."
