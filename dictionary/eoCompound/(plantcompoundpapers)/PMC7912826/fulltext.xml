Although the percentages of vegetarians and vegans are low compared to omnivores, their numbers have increased significantly in the last years. The use of non-animal food products other than meat alternatives is also increasing and this tendency constitutes an opportunity for the food industry. In this review, we present that plant-based meat and milk alternatives are consolidated but that there is a niche for egg, seafood alternatives, and new products which may not resemble any traditional animal food. However, not all animal food substitutes are sustainable and some of them are even ultra-processed. In addition, there are concerns on safety and labeling, and consumers demand clear information and regulation. The challenges in this field are connected with food design and technology, sensory science, nutrition, and dietetics. Moreover, adequate selection and combination of foods is important in order to achieve consumer acceptance while preventing nutritional deficiencies in those who choose this type of diet.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>meat alternatives</kwd><kwd>plant-based dairy</kwd><kwd>fish alternatives</kwd><kwd>vegan</kwd><kwd>vegetarian</kwd><kwd>flexitarian</kwd><kwd>plant-based diet</kwd><kwd>consumer perception</kwd><kwd>fortified food</kwd><kwd>nutrients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-foods-10-00293"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Vegetarianism, veganism and the adoption of a plant-based diet are growing trends across Western countries. Although plant-based diets are often equated with vegetarian diets, they consist of different eating patterns. The term, plant-based, is wider as it focuses on consumption of foods primarily from plants (fruit, vegetables, nuts, oil, whole grains, and legumes), but can include small quantities of food from animal origin such as milk, eggs, meat and fish [<xref rid="B1-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Those who follow a plant-based diet might choose to substitute animal products for vegetable options, without permanent restriction of animal foods. In addition, some authors consider that the Mediterranean Diet is mainly a plant-based diet [<xref rid="B2-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Commonly reported reasons to follow a plant-based diet include concerns for health, environment, animal welfare, rejection of meat, and religious beliefs [<xref rid="B3-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different reports present the higher environmental impact of meat from ruminants compared to grains, fruit and vegetables [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In terms of population subgroups likely to choose plant-based diets, young adults and women have been found to be less resistant to reducing or avoiding meat consumption [<xref rid="B7-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-foods-10-00293"><title>2. Consumer and Market Trends</title><p>The number of people following plant-based diets is increasing tremendously, according to different vegan societies and consulting companies. In America, vegans increased by 500%, from nearly four million in 2014 to 19.6 million in 2017 [<xref rid="B9-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A national USA survey published in 2018 found that two-thirds of participants had reduced meat consumption in the last three years [<xref rid="B10-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the UK, 21% of the population consider themselves flexitarian (vegetarian who eat occasionally food from animals) and 1 in 8 declared being vegetarian or vegan. In Germany, vegetarians increased from 1% in 2005 to 7% in 2018; in Italy the meat-free population has increased by 94.4% from 2011 to 2016, and in Spain, flexitarians increased by 25% in two years [<xref rid="B9-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, a global survey in 2019 reported that 40% of consumers are trying to reduce their consumption of animal proteins, while 10% avoided red meat completely [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The plant-based meat alternatives global market is projected to increase from USD 1.6 billion in 2019 to USD 3.5 billion by 2026 [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The top selling meat alternative products in 2019 were burger (USD 283 million), sausages and hot dogs (USD 159 million), and patties (USD 120 million) [<xref rid="B14-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other data show that meat sales have decreased by 5% from 2015 to 2019 in the US [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The plant-based milk alternatives market has also expanded considerably in recent years, more than doubling its sales worldwide from 2009 to 2015, and reaching USD 21 billion [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to Mintel, cow&#x02019;s milk sales have decreased from USD 19 billion in 2013 to less than USD 16 billion in 2018 [<xref rid="B16-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the contrary, dairy alternatives have increased their sales. According to the Plant Based Foods Association, sales of plant-based yogurts have grown by 55%, plant-based cheeses by 43%, and plant-based creamers by 131% in the US [<xref rid="B17-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-foods-10-00293"><title>3. Food Products for Vegetarian and Vegan Consumers</title><p>Consumers who call themselves vegetarian ingest all type of plant-based food and reject animal food. The vegetarian diet may include eggs, dairy and honey, while the vegan diet does not include any food or derivatives of animal origin.</p><p>A variety of meat and milk alternatives are available and are widely accepted and used in vegetarian and vegan diets, while other products like cheese, egg and fish substitutes are in development and will be briefly presented in the innovations section of this review. <xref rid="foods-10-00293-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents description, advantages and disadvantages of all these alternatives.</p><p>Meat alternatives are products that resemble meat in their sensory attributes but made from protein sources that do not come from animals. Although insects are considered a meat alternative for their high protein content, they are not suitable for vegetarians and vegans and therefore will not be discussed in this review.</p><p>Plant-based proteins are the most common ingredients used to prepare meat alternatives. Soy, wheat gluten and mushrooms are the main ingredients used. Soy is used for its high nutritional quality to prepare protein rich products, such as tofu, obtained from coagulating and pressing soy curds into a compact block. Soy flour is the least processed soy product and is used both in the preparation of soy texturized vegetable protein and soy protein concentrate (70% protein) and isolate (90% protein). Soy meat alternatives, such as texturized vegetable protein, are usually prepared by an extrusion process, which allows for different shapes and sizes of the product [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Wheat gluten, also called seitan, is obtained during the isolation of starch from wheat flour and is used for its binding, dough-forming and leavening ability. Its cohesive and chewy quality gives the meat-like texture to the products prepared with wheat gluten. Mushrooms are also added to products for their chewiness [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Legume proteins from pea, lentil, lupine or chickpea have also been used in the formulation of meat alternatives. Among these, pea-based protein is the most promising. Oilseed proteins from rapeseed and canola can be used as structuring agents when heated, promoting meat-like textures [<xref rid="B20-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Mycoprotein is a protein rich product obtained from the mycelium produced by the growth of the fungus <italic>Fusarium venenatum</italic> during fermentation, which can be processed for human consumption. Mycoprotein is mixed with a small quantity of egg albumen, some roasted barley malt extract and water or a natural flavoring is mixed in instead of malt to give a savory character [<xref rid="B28-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The filamentous structure of mycoprotein is what gives this product the meat-like texture.</p><p>Cultured meat is produced by growing the cells of livestock in a culture medium to recreate the complex structure of animal muscle tissue. Although, technically, the use of animals is necessary to retrieve the animal cells, very few animals are necessary for the production of high quantities of meat due to cell proliferation [<xref rid="B31-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Plant-based milk alternatives are water-soluble extracts from legumes (chickpeas, soybeans), cereals (oats, rice), pseudo-cereals (quinoa, teff, amaranth), nuts (almonds, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, coconut) or seeds (sesame, sunflower) that resemble cow&#x02019;s milk and are consumed as a substitute. The milk-like fluids result from breakdown (size reduction) of plant material (cereals, pseudo-cereals, legumes oilseeds, nuts) extracted in water and further homogenization of such fluids, which imitates cow&#x02019;s milk in appearance and consistency [<xref rid="B37-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The main drivers for consumption of these milk alternatives are adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, and also health reasons, e.g., lactose intolerance or cow&#x02019;s milk protein allergy [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Microalgae are microscopic algae rich in protein, carbohydrates, lipids and other bioactive compounds. Microalgae-derived proteins have complete essential amino acids profiles and their protein content is higher than that of conventional sources, such as meat, poultry and dairy products. In addition, they are a source of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, microalgae and its derived compounds have been recently used as dietary supplements and sources [<xref rid="B57-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Furthermore, microalgae have been recently pointed out by 130 national academies of science and medicine as one of the innovative foods that can bring benefits to human health and climate in the near future [<xref rid="B58-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-foods-10-00293"><title>4. Challenges</title><sec id="sec4dot1-foods-10-00293"><title>4.1. Consumer Challenges</title><p>Meat has been in our diet since the beginning of time and has a strong cultural and gastronomic significance. Not surprisingly, many people consider meat to be an important part of the meal both culturally and as an indispensable source of nutrients [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B26-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to Piazza et al. [<xref rid="B22-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] the majority of justifications people give for eating meat are it being natural, normal, necessary and nice (4Ns theory). Meat has also been associated with formal meals, such as restaurant dinners or business meals and is deemed to be more acceptable in these situations compared to meat alternatives. For informal situations, such as eating alone or with one&#x02019;s family on a weekday, meat alternatives are better accepted [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Meat alternatives are, thus, more likely to be accepted by the public when portrayed as a healthy alternative in informal meals (<xref rid="foods-10-00293-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Vegetarian and vegan diets have repeatedly been regarded as inconvenient, products difficult to cook or prepare and their ingredients not always available in stores [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B24-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Contrary to previous findings regarding environmental awareness, meat eaters in the UK do not need to be persuaded by ethical and environmental arguments, as they recognize the benefits of reducing animal product consumption. Most meat-eaters are aware of the benefits of switching to a more vegetable diet but find vegetarianism and veganism inconvenient, expensive or not enjoyable [<xref rid="B25-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These aspects prevent purchase and consumption of these products, even when there is an awareness of their environmental and health benefits.</p><p>Food neophobia is characterized by a reluctance to consume novel or unfamiliar foods and is common in consumers when first trying plant-based alternatives [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B59-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is more easily triggered when consumers are exposed to unfamiliar, processed or different products than the traditional foods they are used to. Early familiarization during childhood is determinant to reduce food neophobia and develop food habits of a variety of traditional and new food items. Meat substitutes derived from soy, legumes and cereals might be a good option to introduce consumers to plant-based diets, as they are less likely to trigger feelings of rejection and suspicion than more unfamiliar alternatives. In this respect cultured meat, which is grown from animal cells in a culture medium, is often viewed as unnatural and raises concerns among consumers related to its safety [<xref rid="B32-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B60-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>Food neophobia can be partially alleviated through informative and clear labeling. Product perception can be improved by specifying the exact protein source in the ingredients list, confirming a trend toward &#x0201c;clean labeling&#x0201d; desired by consumers. Schouteten et al. [<xref rid="B61-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found that acceptance of insect-based burgers improved for consumers when they were informed of the ingredients compared to when information was not disclosed. Similarly, when participants are informed in a nontechnical way that emphasizes the final product instead of the production method, the perception of cultured meat improves [<xref rid="B33-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>A major challenge of plant-based meat alternatives is to recreate the appearance, texture, flavor and mouthfeel of meat products. While vegetarian and vegan consumers are more likely to accept plant-based alternatives that lack meat-like sensory properties, omnivorous and flexitarian consumers prefer alternatives that resemble meat as much as possible [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B62-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. According to Michel et al. [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], taste plays the most important role, as some consumers refuse to purchase protein alternatives because they &#x0201c;won&#x02019;t like the taste&#x0201d;. Furthermore, consumers most frequently associate regular meat with taste in contrast to meat alternatives [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This indicates that taste is a major driver in favor of meat, making it a challenge for the food industry to match the flavor of meat alternatives with regular meat. Interestingly, consumers find plant based alternatives more convincing when they imitate processed meat products (hamburgers, sausages, nuggets) than when they imitate unprocessed meats (e. g. steak) [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This is likely because the texture of processed meats is easier to replicate than the complex matrix of unprocessed meat. Meat alternatives, therefore, have a better chance if presented in a format that resembles processed meat products such as burgers and sausages.</p><p>To mimic the sensory properties of meat, plant proteins require a high degree of processing and manipulation, which modifies the product to such a degree from the original ingredients that it can trigger food neophobia. Clark and Bodgan [<xref rid="B5-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found the main reasons for not increasing the consumption of protein alternatives were being &#x0201c;too processed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;high in sodium&#x0201d; among the group unlikely to purchase them. Among the group likely to purchase such products, &#x0201c;too many preservatives&#x0201d; was one of the main deterrents.</p><p>Milk alternatives have similar sensory challenges to overcome, especially among regular cow&#x02019;s milk consumers. Cow&#x02019;s milk has repeatedly been preferred over soy-based alternatives in comparative sensory testing, for both adult and children studies [<xref rid="B36-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Participants in these studies were not regular plant milk consumers. In a study involving regular soy consumers and non-soy consumers, both groups agreed that the taste of soy was the greatest factor in consuming or not consuming soy products, including soy milk [<xref rid="B41-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It has been reported that consumers perceived plant-based milk alternatives as more sustainable than dairy products, although the &#x0201c;organic&#x0201d; status also played a significant role in perception [<xref rid="B42-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Consumers look for naturally sweetened or no added sugar beverages. McCarthy et al. [<xref rid="B43-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed that sugar content in plant-based beverages was the most important attribute, whereas the most important attribute for cow&#x02019;s milk consumers was fat content. Another study confirms that negative perceptions of cow&#x02019;s milk are related to high cholesterol, fat and energy content of whole milk [<xref rid="B63-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Therefore, the sensorial improvements should be made without increasing the content of fat and sugar beyond acceptable levels taking into account the nutritional composition of the final product.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-foods-10-00293"><title>4.2. Sustainability Challenges</title><p>The current agriculture and food systems are threatened by pressing issues of the present and the future: population growth, competition for natural resources, climate change, conflicts, crises and food losses and waste. Under these circumstances, our agricultural landscape is in need of a transition to more sustainable food production systems and products. Finding solutions to improve our food systems will help us move towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, described by The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 [<xref rid="B64-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>Although meat alternatives and other plant-based products (e.g., beverages) are presented as less environmentally harmful, the sustainability gains from these products are still a subject of debate and study. The evidence is clear on the lower environmental footprint of legume production [<xref rid="B5-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but the influence of legumes in reducing greenhouse gas emissions also depends on the management of the agro-ecosystem used (e.g., mono cropping vs. conservation agriculture) [<xref rid="B65-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, the post-harvest processing factor may play a role in sustainability.</p><p>Cultured meat, also called lab-meat, synthetic meat or in-vitro meat, is still in the early stages of development and its environmental impact in large-scale production is still unclear. Mycoprotein has been found to have a higher global warming impact than chicken and pork, although land use is substantially lower [<xref rid="B29-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A life cycle assessment study comparing different meat alternatives found the highest environmental impact for cultured meat and mycoprotein, medium impact for chicken (local-feed), dairy and gluten-based alternatives, and the lowest impact for insects and soy-based alternatives [<xref rid="B30-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Last, microalgae require less land area for protein production than animal sources. Algae requires about 2.5 m<sup>2</sup>/kg of protein production compared to 47&#x02013;64 m<sup>2</sup> for pork, 42&#x02013;52 m<sup>2</sup> for chicken, and 144&#x02013;258 m<sup>2</sup> for beef. Furthermore, microalgae are also efficient CO&#x02082; fixing agents. Microalgae are ecologically beneficial with a CO&#x02082; fixation efficiency of about 90%, which is very high compared to that of the terrestrial plants.

The nutritional quality of food proteins can be defined by their ability to cover the needs in essential amino acids for growth and tissue maintenance. The quality of plant proteins (vs. those from animal sources) has become a very debatable topic due to the increase in consumption of plant products.</p><p>Important factors besides from the quantity, is the quality of protein intake in terms of digestibility and amino acid composition. About 30 years ago, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed a reference method for evaluating the quality of dietary protein known as Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS). But in 2013, FAO proposed a new index, the Digestible Essential Amino Acid Score (DIAAS), which reflects, not only the amino acid composition of proteins, but also their bioavailability (digestibility in the small intestine) [<xref rid="B73-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>Bioavailability and amino acid profile of some plant-proteins such as soy are similar to the ones of eggs.

Nonetheless, a plant-based diet that is well planned and balanced, in which different amino acids are combined and complemented through different plant-based foods, does not result in protein deficit [<xref rid="B73-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>In addition, as it is well-known, there are mechanical and thermal pre-processing techniques (e.g., roasting, dehulling, blanching, soaking, cooking and sprouting), which can be applied to reduce anti-nutrients such as protease inhibitors, decrease off-flavor, and improve mouthfeel and color. However, some anti-nutrients are very resistant. For example, phytates cannot be destroyed entirely even by heating to 100 &#x000b0;C and a fermentation process that produces phytases that hydrolyse phytates into myo-inositol and phosphate may be more efficient [<xref rid="B47-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this regard, there is a need to develop plant-based food products that contain all essential amino acids or at least most of them and without anti-nutrients that decrease their bioavailability. Moreover, using the complementarity concept in terms of amino acid composition between plant protein sources (for example, grains and legumes eaten together or throughout the day), it will be possible to develop new food products and meat analogs of optimized nutritional and organoleptic qualities.</p><p>Nowadays, there are options like plant-based products with highly bioavailable plant proteins like soy.

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (Cobalamin)</title><p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is an essential nutrient as it is necessary for the synthesis of DNA and other several functions. Cobalamin deficiency can damage the nervous system and cause irreversible cognitive disorders like confusion, poor memory and in more severe cases, dementia. Other symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, and megaloblastic anemia [<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is synthesized exclusively by microorganisms. Animals acquire this vitamin through the grass, where the bacteria responsible for synthesizing B<sub>12</sub> live, or by B<sub>12</sub> fortified feed. In contrast, only a few algae and mushrooms contain vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, thus, making plant-based diets inadequate.

Therefore, plant-based diet consumers must ingest B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods or B<sub>12</sub> supplements to prevent deficiency.</p><p>In addition, other factors can play significant effects. For example, food processing might contribute to deficiency as losses of cobalamin up to 50% can occur during food processing which involves cooking, pasteurization and exposure to fluorescent light. Furthermore, a decrease in the absorption capacity for this vitamin is common in ageing. Thus, factors such as food processing and ageing should be compensated with an increase in cobalamin concentration in food [<xref rid="B86-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Some researchers claim that the currently recommended intake levels may not be sufficient for an adequate daily intake, with particular regard to aging and the physiological reduction in absorptive capacity. If the aged individual follows a plant-based diet the provision of adequate and bioavailable amounts of the vitamin should be guaranteed.</p><p>Attempts to produce cobalamin supplements from non-animal sources have been made using certain algae (e.g., Chlorella) and cyanobacteria such as Spirulina <italic>(Arthrospira)</italic>, which is known to contain large amounts of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, though unfortunately, it is biologically inactive in humans [<xref rid="B77-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B87-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].

However, there is no evidence that fortification on its own is enough to achieve recommended daily intakes of cobalamin, as quantities of this vitamin are not high enough, thus making it necessary to consume large amounts of these products to reach the required levels. In this regard, studies have consistently shown that the risk of deficiency is higher for plant-based eaters who do not take B<sub>12</sub> supplements as food fortification has not shown to be sufficient [<xref rid="B75-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is water soluble, meaning that excess is excreted through urine, avoiding toxicity. Therefore, the food industry should evaluate developing plant-based products that contain higher quantities of active forms of B<sub>12</sub>. The standardization of cyanocobalamin-rich plant foods may be useful in preventing vitamin deficiency while overcoming the frequent lack of supplement use [<xref rid="B86-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>Concerning B<sub>12</sub> fortification, it has been suggested that lupin can serve as an alternative substrate for soybeans due to its similar protein content resulting in &#x0201c;lupin tempeh&#x0201d;.

A significant increase of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> content (up to 0.97 &#x003bc;g/100 g) was achieved by fermenting lupin using these two bacteria without affecting other parameters, such as texture and volatile organic compounds. Therefore, these results are promising for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> fortification of legumes making products with increased nutritional value for a healthy human diet.</p><p>In addition, Watanabe et al. [<xref rid="B77-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] provide other alternatives to increase vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in plant-based foods. The juice of fenugreek (<italic>Trigonella foenum graecum</italic>) leaves can be enriched with B<sub>12</sub> (12.5 &#x003bc;g/100 mL) by certain lactic fermentations. The addition of <italic>Propionibacteria</italic> to cabbage during sauerkraut production results in higher concentrations of B<sub>12</sub> (7.2 &#x003bc;g/100 g). Compared to synthetic fortification, fortification with natural vitamin-producing microorganisms is widely recognized as safer, more natural and more environmentally friendly [<xref rid="B47-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Another technique is hydroponic cultivation, an emerging technology that enables to grow crops directly in nutrient-rich water, which is an interesting approach to increase vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in foods.

Japanese radish sprouts (kaiware daikon) also show significant increases in B<sub>12</sub> content (1.28 &#x003bc;g/g fresh weight) after the seeds had been soaked for 6 h in a solution containing 200 &#x003bc;g/mL of B<sub>12</sub>.

In addition, vitamin D influences a large number of metabolic pathways beyond bone metabolism [<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] as vitamin D receptors are found in many cell types in the body, thus, being involved in numerous functions such as cellular and immune roles [<xref rid="B88-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Therefore, this vitamin is necessary to prevent not only skeletal and muscular alterations, such as osteoporosis and rickets but also other numerous diseases.</p><p>Although vitamin D can be obtained through sun exposure by activation of a skin precursor, there appears to be a worldwide epidemic of deficiency [<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], since there are many factors that influence cutaneous vitamin D synthesis such as lifestyle, latitude, age, skin pigmentation, type of clothes and sunscreen use [<xref rid="B89-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Therefore, dietary intake of this vitamin is needed. There are very few food sources that are naturally rich in vitamin D and these are mostly from animals (oysters, beef, fish, milk and eggs) [<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], which are also in its higher bioavailable D<sub>3</sub> form, compared to the D<sub>2</sub> form found in plant sources. As a result, plant-based diet consumers might be at risk of vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>Lower serum vitamin D levels have been reported in vegetarians and vegans when compared to omnivores, especially when the blood was collected in late winter or beginning of spring and especially in those living at high latitudes where there is less opportunity for sun exposure [<xref rid="B61-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B65-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B73-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for vegetarians to increase their vitamin D intake through sources such as milk and eggs, and fortified foods, which preferably contain the high bioavailable D<sub>3</sub> form. Vegans fall at a higher risk for deficiency as their only reliable source is sun exposure and some fortified plant-based foods such as breakfast cereals, plant-based drinks and mushrooms.</p><p>There is still no consensus regarding the amount of vitamin D that should be ingested due to between-person and population variabilities. It is important to notice that the daily reference intakes are given for periods where sun exposure is low, as in winter, and lately the recommended levels of intake are much higher than in the past. A recent meta-analysis using food-based approaches that incorporates individual data concludes that an intake of ~12 &#x003bc;g/day could prevent vitamin D deficiency (i.e., serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol &#x0003c; 30 nmol/L) in adults in the absence of sufficient ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation [<xref rid="B90-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the food industry has the challenge of developing creative plant-based food solutions that cover the gap between current intakes and higher recommended intake values by using good sources of vitamin D, which target vegetarian and flexitarian consumers in order to prevent or revert the deficiency that is being faced in these consumers.</p><p>Based on this background, food fortification might be the best option to increase the vitamin D supply to the population compared with vitamin D supplementation (e.g., pharmaceutical pills) [<xref rid="B90-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Fortification, including biofortification (increase the natural content of vitamin D in food), of a wider range of foods, which accommodate diversity, is likely to have the potential to increase vitamin D intakes across population groups and consequently minimize the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D-biofortified eggs are a good example of one of these novel food-based solutions, which together with other vitamin D-containing foods, can play a role in tackling low vitamin D intakes [<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B74-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B79-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>Even though fortification have shown to contribute to lower vitamin D deficiency in some populations such as children, the problem of fortification with this vitamin nowadays is that it is focused mainly in products suitable for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, such as dairy and eggs but not for vegans, which makes it harder for these population to avoid deficiency. Therefore, this contributes to the food industry challenges of developing new options that target all types of vegetarian populations, including vegans.</p><p>Several studies state that biofortification with vitamin D could also embrace the practice of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of mushrooms and baker&#x02019;s yeast, which have been shown to stimulate their endogenous vitamin D<sub>2</sub> content [<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B74-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B79-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].

Non-heme iron can be affected by dietetic inhibitors (phytates, polyphenolics, oxalates) or enhancers (vitamin C, organic acids, citric acids) of iron absorption, thus, being a useful strategy for plant-based eaters to combine non-heme iron with enhancers while avoiding combinations with inhibitors to prevent deficiency [<xref rid="B74-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In addition, several studies show that non-heme iron absorption increases when there are low iron stores as in the case of vegetarians and vegans as an adaptative response of the body to achieve adequate iron levels.

Food vehicles must be designed considering its synergistic effects with iron compounds for effective absorption and bioavailability.

These could be interesting approaches for food industries to fortify foods with iron even though the cost-benefit of each technique should be discussed and evaluated.

Each year, approximately nine million people worldwide suffer from fractures due to osteoporosis [<xref rid="B72-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Due to bone mineral optimization and bone health, calcium has been a nutrient of concern regarding its deficit.

Calcium intake in vegetarians can be up to 25% less than in omnivores and its sources come mainly from fortified plant-based drinks. Therefore, it is recommended for plant-based consumers to choose plant-based foods that are rich in calcium but most importantly, with high bioavailability as well as choosing fortified food products to avoid calcium deficiency and bone health maintenance [<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B74-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>More important than how much calcium is consumed, is how much calcium is absorbed. Calcium absorption from foods depends on physiological aspects such as age, pregnancy, lactation, and dietetic inhibitors or enhancers of absorption. Phytates and oxalates are the most prominent inhibitors of calcium in plant foods. Therefore, plant-based consumers must consider these factors in order to choose foods that are low in inhibitors and high in calcium like soy derived products fortified with calcium. Furthermore, serum vitamin D levels must be within optimum range for the body to absorb calcium. Calcium excretion may also be increased by excessive intake of sodium, animal protein, caffeine, and phosphorus (e.g., phosphoric acid in carbonated beverages), thus decreasing calcium body levels [<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>An emerging fermentation technique that consists of mixed cultures can be of particular interest. A mixed culture of <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> resulted more effective than fermentation of the individual strains in eliminating phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors in cowpea. Similarly, a mixed culture of <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic> dramatically decreased phytic acid and saponin levels in soy.

Labeling Regulations</title><p>The disruption of the market by vegetarian and vegan products has brought attention to the need for labeling regulations for these products. In 2018, the European Commission approved the &#x0201c;Mandatory food labelling Non-Vegetarian/Vegetarian/Vegan&#x0201d; initiative. This initiative proposed laws mandating the use of pictorial labels on all food products to help vegetarians and vegans identify suitable food products and reduce ambiguity [<xref rid="B93-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Currently, there is no legal definition to label a product as vegetarian or vegan food in the EU, and the terms are being defined at the EU level. The use of meat terms when labeling plant-based meat alternatives is unclear because there are few legal names for meat products, with a few exceptions. Meat products regulation contains only general sales descriptions, but currently no different language versions of terms for meat products like sausage, prosciutto or steak. Therefore, establishing a list of protected terms for meat products (where plant-based meat alternatives would not be included) in the EU is challenging [<xref rid="B27-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>There have been proposals to better regulate labels on meat-free plant-based alternatives to avoid confusion among consumers. A recent example is the proposal to the European Parliament to reserve the use of terms like &#x0201c;burger&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sausage&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;scallop&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;steak&#x0201d; exclusively for products containing meat [<xref rid="B94-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In opposition to these proposals, it has been argued that current labeling is not misleading and the use of meat terms are useful to set up expectations. Certain labels like &#x0201c;sausage&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;nuggets&#x0201d; inform the consumer the type of meat the product is trying to mimic and the kind of sensory properties that should be expected from that product.</p><p>Dairy alternatives, especially milk, have harsher legislation barriers than meat alternative products, concerning the use of dairy terms. To use such names, like &#x0201c;milk&#x0201d;, a product must comply with the legal description of what &#x0201c;milk&#x0201d; is. Because milk is described as &#x0201c;mammary secretion obtained from one or more milking&#x0201d;, plant-based milk alternatives cannot be described (labeled) as &#x0201c;milk&#x0201d;. Under these laws, plant-based products cannot use protected dairy terms laid down in Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 1308/2013 [<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Contrary to meat products, dairy contains a long list of reserved names in different languages, exclusively for milk products, including whey, cream, butter, buttermilk, butter oil, caseins, anhydrous milk fat (AMF), cheese, yogurt, kefir, koumiss, viili/fil, smetana, fil, rja&#x0017e;enka and r&#x0016b;gu&#x00161;piens. To complicate things further, EU Member states have approved exemptions in their national language, allowing certain terms that are not allowed in other countries [<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Outside the EU in Australia, for example, the term &#x0201c;soy milk&#x0201d; is allowed.</p><p>Such heterogeneity of regulations among states of the EU, as well as between countries can create a climate of uncertainty and result in a stifling of investment in innovation [<xref rid="B95-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6-foods-10-00293"><title>6. Product Innovations for Plant-Based Diets</title><sec id="sec6dot1-foods-10-00293"><title>6.1. Cultured Meat</title><p>Cultured meat has been presented earlier as one of the newest alternatives to livestock meat. This alternative has been proposed as a more sustainable source of meat than livestock, although the environmental impact of large-scale cultured meat production is still unclear. Cultured meat has been estimated to reduce land use by 99% for its production compared to livestock meat production. Nevertheless, other energy needs and a strict hygiene installation required for the production of cultured meat makes it inefficient in terms of energy, water and feedstock expenditure [<xref rid="B34-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Energy cost and CO&#x02082; derived from cultured meat production has been estimated to be worse than cattle in the very long term [<xref rid="B35-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as long as we continue to use carbon-based energy sources.</p><p>An important innovation in this alternative is the capacity to alter the nutritional profile of the meat by altering the medium. This can be done by adding nutrients, for example vitamins, or modifying the fatty acid profile of the meat. Co-culturing the cells with adipocytes could increase tissue fat and therefore help modify the flavor of the final product [<xref rid="B36-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, cultured meat is a promising alternative for its nutritional and sensory properties, further investigation is warranted to reduce the energy costs and environmental impact cultured meat currently requires for its production.</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot2-foods-10-00293"><title>6.2. Milk and Dairy Alternatives</title><p>The main challenges of milk alternatives are to provide a desirable and acceptable sensory experience for consumers and to match the nutritional value of milk. To compensate for possible nutritional deficiencies, fortification with vitamins and amino acids is applied to these products. Furthermore, fermentation of milk alternatives improves sensory perception because it decreases the beany flavor of plant materials and provides desirable volatile flavors [<xref rid="B47-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The addition of a starter culture to plant-based beverages is also used in the production of vegan or plant-based yogurts. Probiotic strains can be added to soy-based yogurts, and these strains can compete better with starter cultures in a soy beverage than in cows&#x02019; milk [<xref rid="B96-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].</p><p>Fermentation with two or more microorganisms can improve plant protein solubility and amino acid composition and availability. For example, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> significantly increased the protein content of soy-based drinks. Moreover, fermentation of soybean with <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> resulted in an increase of essential amino acids such as lysine. Furthermore, co-fermentation of peanut using <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> significantly increased the total protein and lysine, methionine and tryptophan contents compared to those of the corresponding mono-culture fermentations. Spontaneous co-fermentation of strains originating from cowpea and chickpea improved methionine levels. However, in other cases, mixed-culture fermentation appeared inferior to mono-culture processes [<xref rid="B47-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In Asia, cheese analogs have been around since the 1500s. Fermented tofu has been used as a substitute because its strong aroma reminds of mold-ripened cheeses like Roquefort or Camembert. Although, it does not melt, it can be easily spread. To produce this alternative cheese, tofu cubes are inoculated with a special mold and left to ripe in a warm environment to let the mycelium grow [<xref rid="B97-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].</p><p>In Western countries, the production of cheese analogs involves the use of fat and/or protein sources other than those from cow&#x02019;s milk, together with flavors that resemble as closely as possible those of the original product. It is important to note that cheese analogs can completely exclude milk and milk products (vegan) or partially contain milk or milk components (e.g., casein, butter oil, etc.) together with coconut or soybean extract [<xref rid="B48-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In cheese analogs, the milk protein and milk fat are partly or totally replaced by vegetable proteins (i.e., peanut protein, soybean protein) and vegetable fats and oils (i.e., partly hydrogenated vegetable fat like soybean, palm, etc.). Cheese analogs have been consumed for decades, mainly used in pizza as cheaper alternatives to cut production costs. Still, the difficulties of reproducing the unique flavors of different types of cheese is what has prevented the use of cheese analogs as &#x0201c;cheese board&#x0201d; products for many years [<xref rid="B48-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, innovations in vegan cheese recipes and preparation methods have greatly improved the sensory properties of these products.

Cashews can be soaked in rejuvelac (fermented grain beverage) to obtain vegan Mozzarella [<xref rid="B98-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].

Egg Alternatives</title><p>Egg alternatives are used instead of eggs in recipes by consumers following a vegan diet or individuals with egg allergy. While other products such as meat alternatives aim to replicate the sensory qualities and experience of consuming the original product, the main objective of the egg alternative is to replace the functional properties of egg protein (solubility, emulsification, foaming and gelling) for backing and cooking. &#x0201c;Vegan mayonnaise&#x0201d; is the most tested product in studies on the effectiveness of vegetable ingredients to substitute the egg&#x02019;s properties.

Furthermore, according to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS), soy was found to have similar protein quality to egg, but pea protein was found to be incomplete. In order for pea protein to become complete, the complementarity concept in terms of amino acid composition between different plant protein sources may be used (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot3dot1-foods-10-00293">Section 4.3.1</xref>.). Another aspect that should be taken into account is that soy and pea protein have distinct flavors due to their content in saponins, ketones and aldehyde compounds. These flavors are often described as &#x0201c;beany&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;green&#x0201d; and can be off-putting to the consumer.</p><p>Garcia et al.

Although there is an ample list of ingredients that can emulate eggs when cooking, the nutritional value of these ingredients must be taken into account. Protein rich foods like legumes can offer similar protein content, while other ingredients contain only marginal protein.

Therefore, high levels of fiber in vegan and vegetarian diets may contribute to reduce levels of inflammation and decrease risk for metabolic disease and obesity [<xref rid="B106-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>].</p><p>In regard to hypertension, clinical trials generally support the finding that a vegetarian diet may reduce it. According to the AHS-2 study [<xref rid="B108-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], vegetarian diets may be associated with a reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared to omnivorous diets. In this study, it was found that vegetarians, and especially vegans, had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and lower hypertension prevalence than the omnivores in the cohort. In addition, lower LDL-C, lower total cholesterol, and reduced risk for obesity and diabetes was found among the participants [<xref rid="B106-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="B108-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].</p><p>More investigations are needed about plant-based diets regarding chronic diseases and the different benefits presented by gender and population groups [<xref rid="B106-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], and further investigations need to be done in order to confirm therapeutic effects in other diseases such as colon cancer and ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec8-foods-10-00293"><title>8. Conclusions</title><p>The number of consumers who are reducing their intake of food from animal origin is increasing globally due to many reasons and this involves a growing market of plant-based products. Consumers demand products that are sustainable, palatable, safe, nutritious, available, and affordable. There are many issues that should be considered when planning new sources and ingredients. In this regard, the production of alternatives to meat, such as cultured meat, has a great potential but still needs optimization. Other biotechnology processes including microalgae culture, fermentation or addition of microorganisms, such as those that are producers of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, have also a great potential. It should be emphasized that these plant-based products may be applicable to subjects with special needs, e.g., due to allergy to compounds present in food from animal origin or chronic diseases that are known to revert by reducing animal food and increasing vegetables intake. Finally, being aware of protecting the planet means that plants, animals and humans are part of it and a healthy planet should be compatible with a healthier human being.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>E Garc&#x000ed;a-Maldonado is acknowledged for critical revision of the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, all authors; searching literature, A.A. and A.P.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, A.A. and A.P.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, A.T., M.D.A. and M.P.V.; supervision, M.D.A. and M.P.V.; funding acquisition, M.P.V.
