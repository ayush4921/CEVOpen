    "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Though several natural products have been reported regarding their efficacies against cervical cancer, there has been no review article that categorized them according to their anti-cancer mechanisms. In this study, anti-cancerous natural products against cervical cancer were collected using Pubmed (including Medline) and google scholar, published within three years. Their mechanisms were categorized as induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of metastasis, reduction of resistance, and regulation of miRNAs. A total of 64 natural products suppressed cervical cancer. Among them, <i>Penicillium sclerotiorum</i> extracts from <i>Cassia fistula</i> L., ethanol extracts from <i>Bauhinia variegate candida</i>, thymoquinone obtained from <i>Nigella sativa</i>, lipid-soluble extracts of <i>Pinellia pedatisecta</i> Schott., and 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol extracted from <i>Alpinia conchigera</i> have been shown to have multi-effects against cervical cancer. In conclusion, natural products could be attractive candidates for novel anti-cancer drugs."
