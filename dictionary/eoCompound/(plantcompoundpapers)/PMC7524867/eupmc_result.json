    "Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) of group A play a significant role in the regulation of various processes in plants including growth, development, ion transport, and stress acclimation. In this study, we selected potential PP2C group A inhibitors using a structure-based virtual screening method followed by biochemical and <i>in vitro</i> validation. Over twenty million chemical compounds from the ZINC database were used for docking studies. The precision of the calculations was increased by an induced-fit docking protocol and the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method, which yielded approximate values for the binding energy of the protein-ligand complex. After clustering and ranking their activity, the top-ranking compounds were tested against PP2C group A members <i>in vitro</i> and their <i>in vivo</i> activity was also explored. Phosphatase activity assays identified two compounds with significant inhibitory activity against ABI1 protein ranging from around 57 to 91% at a concentration of 100 μM. Importantly, this <i>in vitro</i> activity correlated well with <i>in vivo</i> inhibition of seed germination, as expected for PP2C inhibitors. The results should promote the design of novel inhibitors with improved potency against ABI1-like and other PP2Cs that might be used in agriculture for the protection of crops against stress."
