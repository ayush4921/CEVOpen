Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">The purpose of this review is to advance the field of applied cannabis research by providing insights into the patenting of medical cannabis and current intellectual property rights (IPR) data.</p> <p id="Par2">Medical cannabis (MC) patent and plant breedersâ€™ rights (PBR) registrations are filed on industrially applicable aspects of research. Studying the filing data and trends informs researchers of both gaps in current applied knowledge in MC (where patents have not been filed) and prior knowledge (where patents have already been filed).</p> <p id="Par3">Our focus is on those intellectual property rights (IPR) that are registered and germane to technical innovations in MC and related products. These are patents and PBR and thus exclude trade secrets, copyrights, franchises, or trademarks. Methods used for surveying the defined IPR landscape include searches of publicly available patent and PBR data and classifying the data according to the upstreamâ€"midstreamâ€"downstream innovation paradigm of the MC industry.</p> <p id="Par4">The findings suggest that the technical knowledge as expressed by patent filings is growing commensurate to the economic and legislative activity. Specific cannabis patents in agricultural technologies directed at improving yield, efficiency, and quality (known as â€œagritechâ€�) are being filed and granted. These agritech-focused patents represent original novel and applied MC research achievements that address specific problems in cannabis cultivation, such as protection of the cannabis crop, maximizing cannabis yield, harvesting and post-harvesting of cannabis, and new advantageous varieties. Patents on <i>ex planta</i> and <i>in planta</i> cannabis genes expression have been published in recent years while patents on extraction methods for cannabinoids have increased since 2015. Much patent activity is in the downstream category of MC patient-oriented products and delivery systems for a very wide range of medical indications and disease conditions.</p> <p id="Par5">The emerging importance of access and benefit-sharing treaties and regulations is noted with implications on the industry briefly discussed. Patent data on leading and emerging patentee companies and institutions are shown. We also provide evidence of prior art and freedom to operate.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par31">Medical cannabis (MC) or medical marijuana is defined herein as those products prescribed by physicians for patient therapy. There is no agreed definition of medicinal cannabis. The term is often used to refer to the therapeutic use of herbal cannabis and its constituents (Whiting et al. <a href="#CR66">2015</a>). The cannabis plant contains more than 100 different chemicals, known as cannabinoids. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the main relevant chemicals used in medicine (Bridgeman and Abazia <a href="#CR1">2017</a>). THC produces the â€œhighâ€� that people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foodstuffs containing it. The number of patients receiving medical cannabis products in the USA is estimated at over 3,000,000, with physicians in other countries such as the UK, Europe, Canada, Israel, and Australia increasingly prescribing MC to their patients (Number of Legal Medical Marijuana Patients - Medical Marijuana <a href="#CR18">n.d.</a>).</p> <p id="Par32">MC compounds emerge from processing beginning with a cultivated plant to a natural product (â€œplant-to-drugâ€�), rather than a pharmaceutically synthesized molecule. Thus, the nascent MC industry has product pathways that sharply differ from the mainstream pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p id="Par33">MC-related matters are complicated in that, in almost all countries, cannabis is an illegal drug and is subject to legal constraints at the national and international level.</p> <p id="Par34">Although the geographical, historical, and cultural ubiquity of cannabis products has been described, knowledge surrounding the origins of cannabis use in folklore medicine is still vague (Heilig <a href="#CR11">2011</a>; Zlas et al. <a href="#CR82">1993</a>; Kuddus et al. <a href="#CR14">2013</a>; Ren et al. <a href="#CR20">2019</a>; West <a href="#CR65">n.d.</a>). In spite of the fact that cannabis has been used for centuries, the rigor demanded by present day regulatory authorities and modern medical standards raises particular challenges not often encountered in classical pharmaceutics based on defined single molecules.</p> <p id="Par35">These difficulties notwithstanding, MC companies must obtain governmental approval for specific indications if MC products are to enjoy the potential profits unlocked by manufacturing and distributing a novel approved medical product, influencing the scope and feasibility of cannabis drug development.</p> <p id="Par36">As MC use gains greater credibility, the market has come under constant and growing scrutiny from many stakeholders, including patient groups, physicians, research teams, companies, investors, government agencies, business analysts, lawyers, and Intellectual Property (IP) specialists. Much statistical information on MC is now routinely available and widely reported, some of which is introduced in this review.</p> <p id="Par37">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports 162 clinical trials on cannabis-based drugs overall (Search of: cannabis or cannabinoid or marijuana - List Results <a href="#CR24">n.d.</a>) with 58 clinical trials listed in the European Union Clinical Trials Register (Clinical Trials register - Search for Cannabis <a href="#CR4">n.d.</a>).</p> <p id="Par38">In 2018, the medical cannabis market was estimated at about 13.4 billion USD and is expected to reach 66.3 billion USD by 2025 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.9% from 2019 to 2025 (Medical Cannabis Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2019-2024 <a href="#CR16">n.d.</a>). The North American Medical Marijuana index (founded in 2015) has already documented 49 companies with a total market capitalization of 32 billion USD (The Marijuana Index For Publicly Traded Companies <a href="#CR27">n.d.</a>). The worldwide market cap is $40.88 billion USD as of January 28, 2020 (Medical Marijuana Market Cap | MJNA <a href="#CR17">n.d.</a>).</p> <p id="Par39">As the increasing MC demand and economic and financial impact is contemplated, the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR) in this industry comes into focus. In this review article, the most important IPR instruments used in the MC industry are presented, accompanied by examples and data.</p> </div> <div class="intellectualpropertyrights" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Intellectual property rights</div> <div class="theinternationalframeworkforipr" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
The international framework for IPR</div> <p id="Par40">The World Trade Organization (WTO), founded in 1995, is the premier body regulating trade between nations and has enacted the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The TRIPS agreement provides benchmark standards for many types of intellectual property rights (IPR). IPR are those intangible rights owned and legally protected by a company or individual from outside use or implementation without consent. Intellectual property (IP) consists of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know how, franchises, and trademarks. IPR are regarded as the transmission gear at the nexus of innovation, business, and law.</p> <p id="Par41">These types of IPR are most relevant to medical cannabis research:</p> <div class="utilitypatents" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Utility patents</div> <p id="Par42">Utility patents are an intellectual property right granted by a state within its territory to patent owner(s), excluding others from commercializing a technology recognized as novel and inventive claimed in the granted patent for a given time (up to 20â€‰years with occasional judicial exceptions). Commercialization is defined as the commercial use, offer to use, sale, offer of sale, manufacture, or distribution of a patented technology or its products.</p> </div> <div class="plantbreedersâ€™rights" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Plant breedersâ€™ rights</div> <p id="Par43">IP instruments, known as Plant Variety Protection Rights (PVPR) or plant breederâ€™s rights (PBR), are an intellectual property right employed to protect commercialization of new varieties of cannabis plants developed by traditional breeding. A new cannabis variety unique in morphological characteristics may be protected using this IP instrument in most countries. To be eligible for a PBR, the new variety must be clearly distinguishable from any other commonly known variety and be sufficiently uniform and stable under cultivation.</p> </div> <div class="plantpatents(usa)" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Plant patents (USA)</div> <p id="Par44">An additional IPR protection for plant varieties, unique to the USA, termed a plant patent, exists. Plant patents extend the ownerâ€™s control and protection to asexual reproduction of a distinct and new variety of plant that expresses characteristics determined by its genotype. Plant patents can be granted for mutants (induced or spontaneous), hybrids, or transformed plants.</p> <p id="Par45">The exercise of IPR in the MC field incentivizes, accelerates, and rewards progress in this knowledge domain. Nations and regions all have their own particular histories and legacies entwined with ever changing social, economic, and cultural conditions. This influences local legislation on the scope and exploitation of IPR in MC.</p> <p id="Par46">Numerous articles have been published regarding cannabis plants and IPR but they are focused and localized to either a specific geographical territory (Rowand and Mcmahon <a href="#CR22">2018</a>), a specific type of IPR (Jacobs <a href="#CR12">2017</a>), specific fields in the cannabis plant industry (Flores-Sanchez and Ramos-Valdivia <a href="#CR8">2017</a>; Gerra et al. <a href="#CR9">2010</a>; Ranieri et al. <a href="#CR19">2016</a>) or a specific species of Cannabis (Hahn <a href="#CR10">2019</a>). Therefore, there is still a need for a broader analysis of IPR data concerning cannabis plants.</p> <p id="Par47">As the authors have noted, innovation in MC encompasses multiple activities in the journey from plant-to-drug. Therefore, it is not at all surprising that the relevant IPR instruments and policies are quite intricate, varied, and heterogenous, both regionally and nationally. In this study, we present IPR trends relevant to innovations in MC along the entire MC supply chain from upstream agritech (improved strains, genetic modification, plant material assessment, harvesting technology, and post-harvesting processing), midstream chemistry/analytics (extractions, purification methods, and separation methods), and downstream medical/biology (diseases, medical devices, compositions, formulations, and dosage forms). In this review, these categories will be applied. Furthermore, within this study, the researcher will be directed towards topics within IPR that bear consequences on MC research, including IPR-derived risks and limitations.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Upstream MC technologies</div> <p id="Par54">Upstream technologies are an important differentiator from traditional Pharma IP domains as these technologies are centered upon agricultural innovation. Before a cannabis product can be produced or even investigated as a medical candidate, strains must be selected, followed by the development and implementation of efficient cultivation methods. Companies that can repeatedly deliver high-quality harvests of appropriate plants with predictable yields and cannabinoid content will be at an advantage and protect their beneficial applied research by means of registered IPRs, namely plant breeders rights, plant patents, and utility patents.</p> <p id="Par55">Traditional breeding is increasing the production of Cannabis plants with unique traits. intellectual property rights to such plants are typically registered as PBR.</p> <p id="Par56">In order to characterize the cannabis-related PBR filings, a search was conducted for PBR registrations pertinent to <i>Cannabis sativa</i> (see â€œ<a href="#Sec7">Materials and methods</a>â€� section). Data obtained from the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) database, which includes the global figures, revealed 434 <i>Cannabis sativa</i> varieties applications. PBR filed in the European Union are the most numerous (48%), followed by Australia (8%), Russia (7%), and Canada (5.7%). The USA only has 4 listings, all approved in 2019. This is probably because, in the USA, it is only since 2019 that plant variety protection certificates under the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) are obtainable for new and distinct <i>Cannabis sativa</i> varieties with THC content not exceeding 0.3%.</p> <p id="Par57">As for plant patents, 30 cannabis plant patents and applications have been filed in the USA. The first cannabis plant patent USPP27475 (Cannabis plant named â€œEcuadorian Sativaâ€� (USPP27475P2 - Cannabis plant named â€˜Ecuadorian Sativaâ€™ - Google Patents <a href="#CR63">n.d.</a>)) was granted in 2016 to Kubby Patent and Licenses LLC. Recently, the Biotech Institute LLC was granted US Plant Patent USPP31535 for their â€œLemon Crush OGâ€� (USPP31535P3 - Cannabis plant named â€˜LEMON CRUSH OGâ€™ - Google Patents <a href="#CR64">n.d.</a>) cultivar.</p> <p id="Par58">From the data revealed in the above searches, it can be seen that researchers are exploiting the relatively low technological barrier needed to qualify for PBR or Plant Patent protection. They do this by protecting varieties for morphological trait uniqueness (as required by the authorities), while in practice protecting the therapeutic or pharmacological value of their plant variety.</p> <p id="Par59">As for MC utility patents focused on upstream technologies, 236 patent documents were found (see the â€œ<a href="#Sec7">Materials and methods</a>â€� section; search B), representing 101 patent families. Following a manual inspection, 39 patents or patent applications were deemed by the criteria described in the â€œ<a href="#Sec7">Materials and methods</a>â€� section to be specific MC upstream technology patents.</p> <p id="Par60">To cover additional areas in this specific field, mainly sensing monitoring in greenhouses, a second search was carried out (see the â€œ<a href="#Sec7">Materials and methods</a>â€� section; search C). Fifty-two patent documents were returned by the search engine, representing 26 patent families. Following a manual screening, 4 patent families were identified.

Midstream technologies</div> <p id="Par69">The major patenting activity in this part of the supply chain is still in natural product technology, namely extraction of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids as well as purification, separation, and preservation methods. The challenge here is to provide easily scalable extraction methods with a high yield of the desired compounds, chiefly the non-psychotropic ingredient CBD. Other potentially medically useful compounds, referred to as â€œentourageâ€� compounds, are present in low concentrations in the natural state and require the development of meticulous extraction, separation, and purification techniques.

The company patent portfolio should also include technologies that may be contemplated by their competitors so as to exclude them from the market, at least for a time. Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>a lists the top 10 patent assignees in the field of downstream MC technologies. GW Pharmaceuticals is a company, which on the evidence of their patent filing, market, and financial data implements patent strategies successfully. It will be noted that Yissum Research development is the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. So, their motivation for holding a substantial patent portfolio relevant to medical cannabis is for licensing purposes and/or for supporting tech incubator companies. Other companies, such as Zelda Therapeutics (currently known as Zelira Therapeutics Ltd), Cannabics Pharma, and AximÂ® Biotechnologies Inc., will find their patent portfolios tempting to future partners and investors or serving as assets that may be sold or licensed for royalties. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 5</span></a></div>   <p>Main patent assignees and markets of patents related to downstream medical cannabis technologies were filed. <b>a</b> Graphical depiction of the main assignees in the field of downstream medical cannabis technologies and the number of patent applications they own. <b>b</b> Graphical depiction the concentration of the main patent assignees from 2001 to 2020.

Interestingly, we can observe that, in spite of GWâ€™s ownership of a large group of patents, the overall patent monopolization in the field has been on a downward trend. This is signified by the decreased ratio of the number of patents of the top 10 assignees relative to the total number of applications when compared to the ratio found in the early 2000s (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5</a>b). This observation is a characteristic of a nascent industry and is evidence of the rapid formation of new companies and startups in recent years creating their own patent eligible technologies.</p> <p id="Par76">Moreover, in the last 5â€‰years (2016â€"2020), companies such as Buzzelet (presently Bazelet) and Radient Technologies have been resurfaced and also filed patent applications. Such companies provide a burgeoning source of new innovation and monetizable patents. They are often regarded as potential partners to companies with complementary technologies or acquisition targets for bigger companies or competitors.</p> <p id="Par77">An analysis of the origin and patent protection of the technology field in Europe, China, Japan, Korea, and the USA reveals that companies typically seek to protect their inventions in their own local market and are possibly overlooking potentially profitable markets elsewhere as legislation continues to liberalize.</p> </div> <div class="innovationsdirectedtomedicalconditions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Innovations directed to medical conditions</div> <p id="Par78">An obvious trend observed among the resulting patent literature was related to MC modes of delivery. Various modes of delivery are used and patented to administer cannabinoid formulations and compositions to the patient, such as transdermal, topical, oral, buccal, sublingual, and rectal. Medical cannabis compounds may be smoked or inhaled. Medical cannabis can be in edible form, capsules, tablets, pills, ampoules, oils, waxes, liposomes, particles, suspensions, cartridges, droppers, micelles, pastes, and more.

Some of the most cited patents presented in Table <a href="#Tab7">7</a> are not necessarily from downstream categories themselves, yet have been cited by the examiner during examination. It is often the case that, quite legitimately, the examiner will cite from any document felt to have a bearing on patentability even if the citations were not from the same patent category. It can be observed that, in the downstream medical cannabis arena, the data shows that most of the key cited patents have expired. Therefore, while the expired patents noted in Table <a href="#Tab7">7</a> do not restrict freedom to operate, they may hamper patentability due to prior art issues (novelty or inventiveness).</p> <p id="Par81">The technology fields are still rather open to patent competition. Within the top patent holders, and the newly formed companies, there are no great conglomerates of patents. This bodes well for researchers and investors alike who may see opportunities, given the patent filing trends shown in the figures.</p> <p id="Par82">A useful way of classifying technology fields within medical cannabis is to use the WIPO authorized International Patent Classification (IPC) hierarchical system. The IPC provides language-independent symbols to designate patented technology within a field.

Exemptions in patent law affecting research in medical cannabis</div> <p id="Par84">Medical cannabis research is a very often applied research with commercialization as the ultimate goal. Therefore, it is essential for MC researchers to consider the potential of patent law to block a research program whether the researchers are affiliated to academia, research institutions, companies, or collaborations.</p> <p id="Par85">The exclusive rights conferred to the owner of a patent are wide in scope to incentivize investment in useful technological advance for the benefit of society as a whole. Comprehensive enforcement of these IPR without exception may not always serve the best interests of the public. A need to balance between the rights of the patent owner and the broader interests of society is recognized by most national governments. In national jurisdictions and regional authorities, laws, regulations, and practices are enacted to provide exceptions and safe harbors to the maximal patent exclusivity right (Expertsâ€™ Study on Exclusions from Patentable Subject Matter and Exceptions and Limitations to the Rights <a href="#CR7">n.d.</a>). Among these exceptions are (i) private and/or non-commercial use, (ii) experimental use and/or scientific research, (iii) extemporaneous preparation of medicines, (iv) prior use, (vi) acts for obtaining regulatory approval from authorities, (vii) exhaustion of patent rights, (viii) compulsory licensing and/or government use, and (ix) certain use of patented inventions by farmers and breeders.</p> <p id="Par86">Likely to be pertinent to the MC researchers are research exemptions or safe harbor exemptions to the rights conferred by patents, particularly in the case of drugs where regulatory or marketing approval is sought. In the USA, these exemptions are called the Â§ 271(e)(1) exemptions or Hatch-Waxman exemptions, but in many countries they are referred to as Bolar provisions (Roche Products, Inc. Appellant, v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., Inc., Appellee, 733 F.2d 858 (Fed. Cir. 1984) : Justia <a href="#CR21">n.d.</a>).</p> <p id="Par87">Many nations have similar exemptions in place of varying nature and scope. For example, India clearly and broadly provides Bolar type exemptions for research under Section 107A of the Indian Patent Act.</p> <p id="Par88">In the European Union, Bolar equivalent exemptions are allowed under the terms of EC Directives 2001/82/EC (as amended by Directive 2004/28/EC) and 2001/83/EC (as amended by Directives 2002/98/EC, 2003/63/EC, 2004/24/EC and 2004/27/EC).</p> <p id="Par89">A comparative study of patent law (Jaenichen and Pitz <a href="#CR13">2015</a>) determined that Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands do not extend patent rights to studies and trials necessary for obtaining drug approval for the marketing of a drug. In Great Britain, it has not been settled whether the patented product used as a tool during a process for obtaining regulatory approval is exempt.</p> <p id="Par90">In the USA, exemptions from patent enforcement rights exist when the research using the patented product is done in order to obtain regulatory approvals for use, manufacturing, or marketing approvals (Russo and Johnson <a href="#CR23">2015</a>).</p> <p id="Par91">In Eli Lilly and Co. v. Medtronic, 496 US 661 (1990) (Lilly, and Co. v. Medtronic, Inc. :: 496 U.S. 661 (1990) :Justia US Supreme Court Center <a href="#CR15">n.d.</a>), the US Supreme Court held that the exemption also applies to medical devices, an interesting decision that affects cannabis delivery devices.</p> <p id="Par92">University researchers should also note well that experimentation by universities and not-for-profit-organizations using patented products may not be exempt even if the intention is not directly commercial. The universityâ€™s experiments may result in publications advancing the prestige of the university or its researchers, possibly attracting funds and students, which constitutes furtherance of a business activity. As a consequence, the research is prohibited (Cai <a href="#CR3">2004</a>).</p> <p id="Par93">In light of the above, researchers in medical cannabis should note that patent law allows sufficient room for research activities to promote innovation (Jaenichen and Pitz <a href="#CR13">2015</a>), but academic researchers must be aware of potential pitfalls, particularly in light of the restrictions to ostensibly academic research at research institutes in the USA.</p> </div> <div class="medicalcannabispatentlitigationandfreedomtooperate" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Medical cannabis patent litigation and freedom to operate</div> <p id="Par94">To date, there has been little litigation concerning patent infringement, probably because of relatively recent acquisition of IPR concerning MC research, but this trend is likely to change. Patented CRISPR technology is increasingly used to edit plant genes without inserting foreign genetic material. Patents for gene editing in plants are an established feature of the plant innovation landscape. These gene editing patents often cover a wide variety of plants or are general to all plants including Cannabis. Two examples of patents potentially limiting to gene editing in Cannabis are further detailed in Table <a href="#Tab10">10</a>. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Tab10"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 10</span> </div></p><p>Examples of patents potentially limiting to cannabis gene editing</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Title</th> <th>Short description</th> <th>Patent doc. number</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Methods and compositions for targeted gene modification (US9957515B2 - Methods and compositions for targeted gene modification - Google Patents <a href="#CR62">n.d.</a>)</td> <td>Methods and compositions for effecting a targeted genetic change in DNA in a cell.

Another CIBUS patent, US10287594, covers use of the GRON in combination with other strand breaking gene editing elements as well as CRISPR. When contemplating using gene editing, it is advisable for applied researchers in MC to be well acquainted with such patents that may block or limit their patentability in MC or limit the freedom to operate of an applied MC researcher.</p> <p id="Par96">It is clear from the presented patent data that much of the patenting activity has been focused on the downstream product segment. It is in this segment that the first patent litigation conflicts have arisen. Such litigation signals clearly to the MC researchers that patent holders value patents in this field and, through the agency of patent law, are willing to prevent competitor researchers from utilizing patented technology without consent of the patent holder. Patents are also opposed by competitors to increase the freedom of their MC researchers to operate.</p> <p id="Par97">The most notable cases so far are the GW pharmaceuticals case litigated at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the United Cannabis Corporation Case, which was litigated at the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (see Table <a href="#Tab11">11</a>). <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Tab11"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 11</span> </div></p><p>Patent litigation cases in medical cannabis field</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Title</th> <th>Patent owner</th> <th>Alleged Infringer</th> <th>Patent doc. number</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Use of one or a combination of phyto-cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy</td> <td>GW Pharma Ltd.</td> <td>INSYS Therapeutics</td> <td>US9066920 (US9066920B2 - Use of one or a combination of phyto-cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy - Google Patents <a href="#CR59">n.d.</a>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cannabis extracts and methods of preparing and using same</td> <td>United Cannabis Corp.</td> <td>Pure Hemp Collective</td> <td>US9730911 (US9730911B2 - Cannabis extracts and methods of preparing and using same - Google Patents <a href="#CR60">n.d.</a>)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <div class="gwpharmaceuticalsv.insystherapeutics" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
GW Pharmaceuticals v.

This patent is one that potentially protects GWâ€™s FDA approved Epidiolex (CBD) for epilepsy.</p> <p id="Par99">The grounds for invalidation asserted by INSYS before the USPTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) were essentially obviousness. INSYS complained that previous publications provided sufficient guidance to an expert in the field in order to obtain the claimed invention, namely that CBD of plant origin of a given dosage was effective against certain types of epilepsy and that this was therefore too obvious to deserve patent protection. Although claims 1 and 2 were invalidated in the proceedings, the PTAB found the essence of the patent (recited in the remaining claims) to be sound and thus assertable against an infringer.</p> <p id="Par100">The authors comment that this case demonstrates the importance of obtaining a patent as part of an overall business strategy. Although it took about 6â€‰years for GW pharmaceuticals to obtain the patent and FDA approval was only granted in 2018, the patent will be valid for another 12â€‰years at time of writing, providing GW with monopoly rights. The first external challenge to the patent was beaten off such that interested parties will comprehend the value of such a patent in a medical cannabis IP and product portfolio.</p> </div> <div class="ucannv.purehempcollective" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
UCANN v. Pure Hemp Collective</div> <p id="Par101">Another example heralding the importance of patents in this high-value area is the case of United Cannabis Corporation (â€œUCANNâ€�), which, in 2018, sued Pure Hemp Collective Inc. (â€œPure Hempâ€�) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (<i>United Cannabis Corporation v. Pure Hemp Collective, Inc.</i> (Case No.: 1:18-cv-01922-NYW) (United Cannabis Corporation v. Pure Hemp Collective Inc., 1:18-cv-01922 <a href="#CR28">n.d.</a>) for patent infringement. UCANN found a similar product allegedly within the scope of their granted claims in terms of concentrations. Here, the defendant Pure Hemp asserted that the specification of UCANNâ€™s patent was not sufficiently clear as to define the boundary of the claim. Judge Martinez then directed the parties to obtain a summary judgment as to the indefiniteness issue in the claims. At the time of writing, the issue has not been settled but few can doubt that it was important for UCANN to file the patent. At the very least, the contentiousness of the patent and court proceedings must be expensively distracting to UCANNâ€™s competitor while UCANN gains traction in the market. These two cases illustrate the value to researchers of obtaining a more than superficial knowledge of patents in the MC field.</p> </div> </div> <div class="indigenouspropertyrights,traditionalknowledge,andcannabisiprs" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Indigenous Property Rights, traditional knowledge, and cannabis IPRs</div> <p id="Par102">The Scottish physician W.B. Oâ€™Shaunghnessy can be said to have introduced cannabis to Western medicine in 1841 after observing its use in India and carrying out animal trials prior to treating patients. In cultures and countries as varied as China, India, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Brazil, and Jamaica, traditional medical uses of cannabis include menstrual fatigue, gout, rheumatism, constipation, anesthesia, bronchitis, asthma, diabetes, anthrax, malaria, blackwater fever, blood poisoning, dysentery, glaucoma, diarrhea, fever, burns, abrasions, and wasting disease. It can be thus said that the contributions of modern researchers are, to an extent, built upon contributions of traditional non-western cultures and their ancestors (Spicer <a href="#CR26">2002</a>).</p> <p id="Par103">The data presented in the previous sections attests to the very recent commercial medicalization of cannabis, but medical and therapeutic cannabis has a very long history. Indigenous and local peoples of many countries and regions have been preparing traditional cannabis remedies and selecting and stewarding local landraces, cultivars, and varieties of cannabis plants for centuries (Duvall <a href="#CR5">2016</a>). Geographically and culturally isolated gene pools were blended in unprecedented combinations to develop both industrial hemp and recreational/medicinal Cannabis cultivars that would be productive when grown in environments to which they were adapted. Human selection has increased seed and fiber yield and quality as well as altered cannabinoid profiles.</p> <p id="Par104">Local and indigenous farmers, as well as communities, in developing and emerging regions that traditionally grew Cannabis have valued it in their cultures and made the herb popular in the first place. These farmers must be safeguarded against being excluded from rewards and economic opportunities now flowing towards the burgeoning developed world industrialization of medical cannabis. The above-mentioned conventional IPR (patents and PBR) work in favor of modern-day research in the developed world and offer little or no protection to the indigenous stakeholders. Examples of plants long known by indigenous peoples and nurtured and stewarded by them whose natural qualities are not guaranteed by patent law are shown in Table <a href="#Tab12">12</a>. These examples reveal that the patent system is inadequate for ensuring rights to Indigenous Peoples. Accordingly, it would be desirable to protect the rights of these peoples in the rush to patent medical cannabis research. There is a growing demand for industry to share some of its rewards with the traditional knowledge custodians and practitioners that provided the building blocks of medical cannabis knowledge to the medical cannabis researcher. What is being done to ensure that traditional knowledge (TK) owners will be rewarded for their stewardship, nurturing, and knowledge, passed down through the generations? Commercial breeders may use traditional farmers as a source of cannabis to produce advantageous hybrids, which then may be protected by Plant patents or PBR. Other commercially useful patent-protected cultivation methods or extraction methods or medical uses may have partial origins in TK of a particular Indigenous People. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Tab12"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 12</span> </div></p><p>Patents concerning plants known to Indigenous Peoples</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Plant</th> <th>Title</th> <th>Assignee</th> <th>Patent doc. number</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Oubli (<i>Pentadiplandra brazzeana</i></td> <td>Brazzein sweetener (US5326580A - Brazzein sweetener - Google Patents <a href="#CR52">n.d.</a>)</td> <td>Wisconsin Alumni Res.Found.</td> <td>US5326580</td> </tr> <tr> <td><i>Azadirachta indica</i> (Neem)</td> <td>Fungicidal compositions derived from neem oil and neem wax fractions (US5409708A - Fungicidal compositions derived from neem oil and neem wax fractions - Google Patents <a href="#CR53">n.d.</a>)</td> <td>W.R.

It provides a means by which fair distribution of benefit and fair access can be allotted to Indigenous Peoples and other custodians of traditional knowledge and germplasm. Although not an IPR for rewarding innovation as such, rights conferred by CBDR/Nagoya fulfil an IPR function for the custodianship and curation of important plant species that are so fundamental to all agriculture, including <i>C. Sativa</i>. There is every reason to expect that such a â€œquasi IPRâ€� will be relevant to cannabis since obligations under the Nagoya Protocol apply to the use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge. Uses of resources and TK are defined as research, development, innovation, pre-commercialization, or commercialization as well as the benefits arising from their utilization. Contracting parties are obliged to take measures in relation to access to genetic resources, benefit-sharing, and compliance.</p> <p id="Par106">The protocol includes prior informed consent (PIC) procedures between traditional knowledge providers and companies, mutually agreed terms (MAT), access permits, and benefit-sharing obligations, whether monetary or non-monetary (royalties and the sharing of research data). These obligations are harmonized with the domestic legislation or regulatory requirements of the contracting party providing genetic resources. A permit is issued when access is granted by administration of the Access and Benefit Sharing Clearing House (ABCH). Compliance is acknowledged by an Internationally Recognized Certificates of Compliance (IRCC) as voucher evidence that the accessed genetic resources or traditional knowledge have appropriate PIC and MAT in accordance with the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) requirements of the provider country.</p> <p id="Par107">It is not difficult to foresee that the evolution of instruments such as the Nagoya Protocol with future modifications will have a serious role to play in the multinational and multicultural relationships that are forming around medical cannabis commercialization and IPR rights. The authors foresee that research organizations, institutions, and companies with a stake in medical cannabis will incorporate compliance with the Nagoya Protocol and similar ABS regulations into the standard IPR due diligence process for commercial risk mitigation before committing resources into research and development of medical cannabis products.</p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par108">In this review of IPR data, we have presented characteristics of intellectual property landscape of the medical cannabis field. IPR data is distributed along the entire MC supply chain, following the upstreamâ€"midstreamâ€"downstream paradigm.</p> <p id="Par109">Agri-technology specific to the cultivation of cannabis plants is not well covered, opening up much scope for research in this area. Work has been reported on genetic manipulation of the cannabis plant, which is likely to have an impact on the discourse framed around MC as a natural herbal therapeutic. Patents directed to gene editing in cannabis are making their appearance in the literature. It is likely that researchers in this field will have to be wary of the contentiousness of patent holders of CRISPR/Cas9 system patents in their attempt to prevent freedom to operate blocks to their research.</p> <p id="Par110">In contrast, traditional variety development has led to over 300 protected cannabis varieties according to observed PBR and Plant Patent data. It is to be expected that more variety registrations and plant patents will be granted in the USA as a result of continuing legislative changes easing the path of this branch of MC research.</p> <p id="Par111">Remote monitoring and analysis of cannabinoid content, biological control of cannabis plants, successful endogenous, and exogenous expression of cannabinoids in cannabis plant cells have not been convincingly reported although progress has been made using yeast and other cell expression systems. Biosynthetic production of cannabinoids by exploiting enzymes of the cannabinoid metabolic pathways has been reported, with several extraction methods having been claimed. These too are all areas that certainly warrant further research.</p> <p id="Par112">Although IPR (especially patents) in the upstream and midstream technologies are not as numerous as other equivalent fields in agritech, approximately ten-fold more patents have been filed in the downstream therapeutic sector. Medical cannabis products cannot be successfully and efficiently generated without full knowledge and development of upstreamâ€"midstream processes required to provide characterization and consistency of the downstream product or drug. This may well explain why, although a large group of patent families exist encompassing various medical indications, only three cannabis derived drugs, Epidiolex, Sativex, and synthetic Syndros (liquid formulation of THC), have received FDA marketing approval. The broad implications to downstream research are that upstream and midstream research must be bolstered and the number, quality, and depth of clinical trials and clinical research should be increased. The patent review data supports the notion that multidisciplinary discourse between researchers along the entire supply chain is likely to yield fruitful results.</p> <p id="Par113">There is much opportunity for research but researchers should be aware of the potential risks and challenges that patents pose to inventors. Two contentious patent cases are reported, which no doubt herald future infringement and invalidation challenges to claimed IPR in this industry. Such cases are important since they reinforce to researchers the importance of obtaining and defending patents and maintaining hard won priority advantages.</p> <p id="Par114">The authors predict that IPR scenarios in medical cannabis will be further enriched by the emergence of international and national â€œquasi â€" IPRâ€� in the form of the CBDR, Nagoya protocol, and other arrangements to facilitate research partnerships between multidisciplinary departments in academia, industry, emerging nations, and local and Indigenous Peoples.</p> <p id="Par115">Our review provides evidence that an understanding of the pertinent IPR environment is essential for MC researchers to (i) minimize risks of having their work hindered, halted, or made irrelevant and (ii) recognize research opportunities of unfulfilled needs.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="glossary" title="glossary"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
