    "Phytoparasitic nematodes cause severe damage and yield losses to numerous agricultural crops. Considering the revision of the EU legislation on the use of pesticides on agricultural crops, control strategies with low environmental impact are required. The approach based on the use of bacteria seems particularly promising as it also helps to reduce the applied amounts of chemicals and stabilize ecological changes. This paper gives an overview of the main types of bacteria that can be used as biological control agents against plant parasitic nematodes and their interrelationships with plants and other organisms. Many experiments have given positive results of phytoparasitic nematode control by bacteria, showing possible prospects for their application. In vitro, greenhouse and field experiments have shown that bacteria can regulate the development of ecto- and endoparasitic nematodes by different modes of action. Triggering the induction of plant defense mechanisms by bacteria is seen as the optimum tool because the efficacy of bacterial treatment can be higher than that of chemical pesticides or at least close to it. Moreover, bacterial application produces additional positive effects on growth stimulation, raises yields and suppresses other pathogenic microorganisms. Commercial formulations, both as single bacterial strains and bacterial complexes, are examined."
