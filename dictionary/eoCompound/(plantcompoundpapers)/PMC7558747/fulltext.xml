Zimbabwe has a rich plant biodiversity with only a limited number reported for the treatment of cancer. The leaf extracts of <italic>Dolichos kilimandscharicus</italic> were selected for the screening of their antiproliferative efficacy and cytotoxicity effects. This plant has increasingly been used by local folk as a treatment for cancer or cancer-related symptoms though its bioactivity has not been scientifically determined. This investigation also sought to identify constituent compounds in the crude extract preparations responsible for their antiproliferative efficacy. The antiproliferative effects of six-leaf extracts on Jurkat-T <italic>in vitro</italic> were investigated using the Trypan blue exclusion assay. The extracts were tested with increasing concentration, using chlorambucil as a standard anticancer drug. Cytotoxicity of extracts was determined against RAW 264.7 cells using a colorimetric tetrazolium-based assay. In additionthe ability of the extracts to induce apoptosis was determined for the most potent leaf extracts. The order of potency of the leaf extracts of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> against Jurkat-T cell line was found to be MeOH &#x0003c; Ethyl Acetate &#x0003c; DCM: MeOH &#x0003c; EtOH with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 33.56, 30.44, 22.93, and 21.59&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the most potent extracts exhibited very low cytotoxicity against all the tested cells. <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> leaf extracts induced apoptosis in the Jurkat-T cells as was shown by DNA fragmentation. UPLC-MS analysis of crude extracts led to the identification of 23 compounds from the ethanol extract and these may be responsible for the observed antiproliferative effects. Rutin, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, hispidulin, kaempferol derivatives, as well as caffeoylquinic acid are some of the compounds identified in the extracts. The results of this study showed that the ethanol and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> have antiproliferative activity against Jurkat-T cells and may act by inducing apoptosis.. The current findings offer supporting evidence for the use of these plant species in the treatment of cancer in ethnomedicinal practices.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>International Foundation for Science</funding-source><award-id>IFS F/3413-03</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>International Program in the Chemical Sciences</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The World Health Organization estimated cancer deaths to be over 9.6 million in 2018, with most of these deaths in low- and medium-income countries [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The cost of cancer treatment is beyond the reach of most cancer patients in Zimbabwe. Though access to medical care is generally poor, the situation for cancer patients is worse due to minimal health facilities offering cancer treatment. Leukaemia is a cancer of the bone marrow and blood, marked by distorted proliferation and development of leukocytes and their precursors in the blood and bone marrow. It is estimated that in Zimbabwe, 17 465 cancer cases were diagnosed in 2018 alone [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Leukemic cell lines represent an essential instrument for the biological characterization of human leukaemia. Jurkat-T cells are an IL-2 producing T lymphocyte cell line, shown to express T cell characteristics and complement receptors [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Jurkat-T cells are easy to culture, and grow rapidly, and can be used in human immunodeficiency virus research, though they are contaminated by previously undetected retroviruses [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>A major part of traditional therapy involves the use of plant extracts or their active principles to treat ailments [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Natural products may be sources of compounds that are lead compounds for application in various pharmacological, physiological, and biochemical studies [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several studies on medicinal plants have highlighted the dependence of a large percentage of the world population on traditional medicine for the management of an array of ailments [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These ethnobotanical surveys on plants traditionally show that these medicinal plants are used either alone as a primary therapeutic choice or in conjunction with conventional medicines [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Though there is this dependence on herbal medicines, often, clinicians are either unaware of their patients' use of herbs as well as the specific herb being used. Traditional healers further complicate matters, as they are unwilling to divulge the identity of their herbal concoctions that they consider &#x0201c;safe.&#x0201d; This makes it difficult to ascertain if the herb may be a contributor to the healing properties or failure of treatment. WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy, in realising the increasing importance of traditional medicine in various healthcare systems around the world, has recently set out to promote the safe and effective use of traditional medicine [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is, however, a need to carry out systematic screening of these plants to validate their use in folk medicine and to reveal the active compounds by isolation and characterisation of their constituents.</p><p>Advanced biological experimental procedures, which include cell viability and cytotoxicity assays, are essential for drug screening in determining the safety of drug molecules and herbal products [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in vitro. There is a need to acquire knowledge of the toxicological profile of the plants used traditionally to anticipate the ingestion of toxic plants. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is the more commonly employed assay for cytotoxicity screening of bioactive compounds which measure for cell death, inhibition of cell growth, or cell proliferation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in vitro. Probable risks associated with herbal medicine use have been reported and are of major concern in herbal medicine toxicity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Compounds from herbal medicines have become the default treatment option used in chemotherapy as they have a variety of different structures and mechanisms of action [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Apoptosis, also termed programmed cell death, is a gene-directed form of cell death that is evident typically in cell morphology. Generally, mammalian cells undergo apoptosis during normal development or as a result of a variety of stimuli, which are not limited to DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, and abnormal expression of oncogene or tumour suppressor genes [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Apoptosis is widely viewed as an important mechanism in the reduction of cell growth. Inhibition of the enzymes in the pathway renders most of the chemotherapeutic drugs ineffective. In a study by Raskin et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it was shown that plants possess diverse compounds with multiple therapeutic effects which can be used to counter the inhibition of enzymes to reduce the ineffectiveness of drug.</p><p>
<italic>Dolichos kilimandscharicus subsp. kilimandscharicus</italic> has been used as a natural fungicide in small-scale farming, as a nonvertebrate poison mainly applied in fishing [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The root slurry of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> is used in Ethiopia to treat sorghum smuts, and the methanolic crude extracts from <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> were shown to possess <italic>in vitro</italic> antifungal activity with <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A few ethnomedicinal uses have been documented on the plant. The roots are used for the treatment of aching limbs [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, the leaves are boiled together with other plants for the treatment of colic, dysentery, gonorrhoea, and syphilis [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There are few research reports on the phytochemical profiles of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic>. As part of an investigation of the antiproliferative properties as well as the composition of the leaf extracts of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> seven extracts prepared from the plant were investigated to determine if they posessed antiproliferative properties against cancer cells in vitro.</p><p>This study was aimed at determining the antiproliferative, cytotoxic effects on Jurkat-T cells as well as determine the profile of possible phytocompounds of the leaf extracts of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic>. Further to this, the study also sought to explore whether the leaf extracts induced apoptosis as a biochemical mode of action for the oberserved effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Mr. Christopher Chapano, a taxonomist at the National Botanic and Herbarium Gardens (Harare, Zimbabwe), authenticated the plant. Herbarium samples were kept at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Zimbabwe (DK2017C). The leaves were air-dried in an oven at 40&#x000b0;C and ground to a powder using a pestle and mortar. Serial exhaustive extraction was done with a sample to solvent ratio of 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;5. The solvents used for serial exhaustive extraction were in the order of increasing polarity starting with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and ending with water. The extracts were filtered and evaporated under vacuum until a constant dry weight of each extract was obtained and the residues stored at 4&#x000b0;C until required. The extract solutions for testing were prepared by dissolving the plant extract in DMSO and RPMI media, with a final concentration of DMSO when added to test well 0.83%.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] on the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of a triterpenoid isolated from the plant <italic>Zizyphus jujube</italic> showed that plant-derived compounds may lead to apoptotic cell death in human leukaemic cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Cytotoxicity Effects of Leaf Extracts <italic>In Vitro</italic></title><p>The cytotoxicity profile of the extracts of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> was determined by assessing for the cell viability of RAW 264.1 cells using the resazurin assay. The ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts were investigated as they had shown to be the most potent extract in reducing Jurkat-T cell viability. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) demonstrated that the ethyl acetate extract had an IC<sub>50</sub> of 428&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL and that of ethanol was 422&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, and these values are considered nontoxic. The American National Cancer Institute guidelines set the limit of activity for crude extracts at a 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of proliferation of less than 30&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL after an exposure time of 72&#x02009;hrs. The polar leaf extracts showed greater antiproliferative activity than nonpolar leaf extracts indicating that most of the compounds that may be responsible for the observed antiproliferative effect are more soluble in polar solvents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> 4</xref>. The cytotoxicity screening of plants is useful that it provides information on the safety levels at which plants may be used without causing harm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates a typical UPLC-MS/MS chromatogram of the ethanolic extract of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> leaves.

The corresponding mass spectra are shown in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The presence of these phytochemicals indicates the potential of <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> leaves as a source of proliferation inhibitors. Our findings identified the most prominent antiproliferative compounds as rutin, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, hispidulin, kaempferol derivatives, as well as caffeoylquinic acid whose structures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>UPLC-MS analysis of crude extracts led to the identification of 23 components from the ethanol extract with precisely rutin, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, hispidulin, kaempferol derivatives, as well as caffeoylquinic acid being the most prominent antiproliferative compounds. A number of studies have shown that rutin inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer, cervical, and human neuroblastoma by triggering apoptosis in these cells [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Quercetin has been reported to possess antiproliferative effects on a wide range of cancer cells including colon carcinoma CT-26 cells, prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells, human prostate PC3 cells, pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia MOLT-4&#x02009;T-cells, human myeloma U266B1 cells, human lymphoid Raji cells, and ovarian cancer CHO cells [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Luteolin exhibits a variety of inhibitory activities against various cancers such as lung, breast, glioblastoma, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Apigenin from previous studies has been shown to potentially be used as a dietary supplement as well as cancer treatment agent [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a study by Imran et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it was shown that hispidulin can act potentially in the control tumour progression and angiogenesis. Kaempferol and its glycoside derivatives can be found vastly in nature as well as showing antiproliferation effect on the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, mouse colon cancer cell line CT26, and mouse melanoma cell line B16F1 [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The activity of compounds against microorganisms was shown to depend largely on the structure of the compound [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The compound 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid has also been identified from the methanolic extracts of <italic>Cydonia oblonga</italic> Miller and has been shown to possess antiproliferative effects on human kidney and colon cancer cells [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the highly complex chemical compositions of the leaf extracts make it difficult to assign the growth-inhibitory effect to one particular compound present in <italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> unless the pure compounds are isolated and their structure elucidated.</p><p>The study of the constituent phytochemicals in medicinal herbs is pivotal to reveal the potential candidates in each medicinal herb that would likely explain their therapeutic effects. The study showed significant antiproliferative effect of the ethanol and ethyl acetate leaf extracts that has stimulated us to carry out ongoing work to determine the active compounds, that may prove to be valuable as lead compounds in their ability to kill Jurkat-T cells but exerting a marginal cytotoxic effect on normal cells. No data relating ?tex id="A80" author-cmt="Text corrected to make grammatical sense"?&#x0003e; to the components with antiproliferative effects of the two active leaf extracts have been reported and as such further phytochemical work on the isolation and identification of active structures of these extracts is required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>It can be concluded that the most active compounds of the plant may be in the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of D. kilimandscharicus. The ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts<italic>D. kilimandscharicus</italic> induced apoptosis in Jurkat-T cells and can, thus, be considered for further studies to identify compounds with potential anticancer activity. Furthermore, these extracts were found not to be cytotoxic against the RAW 264.7 normal cell line. UPLC-MS analysis of the leaf extracts led to the identification of 23 compounds from the ethanol extract, and these may be responsible for the observed antiproliferative effects. Rutin, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, hispidulin, kaempferol derivatives, as well as caffeoylquinic acid are some of the compounds identified in the leaf extracts of D. kilimandscharicus and may be responsible for the observed effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Mr. Christopher Chapano from the Botanic Gardens, Harare, who identified <italic>Dolichos kilimandascaricus</italic> (Fabaceae).
