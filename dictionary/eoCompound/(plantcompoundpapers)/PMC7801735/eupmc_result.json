    "Roots have important roles for plants to withstand adverse environmental conditions, including salt stress. Biostimulant application was shown to enhance plant resilience towards abiotic stresses. Here, we studied the effect of a tannin-based biostimulant on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown under salt stress conditions. We investigated the related changes at both root architecture (via imaging and biometric analysis) and gene expression (RNA-Seq/qPCR) levels. Moreover, in order to identify the main compounds potentially involved in the observed effects, the chemical composition of the biostimulant was evaluated by UV/Vis and HPLC-ESI-Orbitrap analysis. Sixteen compounds, known to be involved in root development and having a potential antioxidant properties were identified. Significant increase of root weight (+ 24%) and length (+ 23%) was observed when the plants were grown under salt stress and treated with the biostimulant. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that the application of the biostimulant upregulated 285 genes, most of which correlated to root development and salt stress tolerance. The 171 downregulated genes were mainly involved in nutrient uptake. These data demonstrated that the biostimulant is able not only to restore root growth in salty soils, but also to provide the adequate plant nourishment by regulating the expression of essential transcription factors and stress responsive genes."
