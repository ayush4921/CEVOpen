    "<h4>Background</h4>The demand for traditional herbal medicine is increasing and about 85% of the world population use herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of diseases. More than 62.5% of the forest areas in Ethiopia are found in the southwest region, which have been used as a source of traditional medicine to treat different human and livestock ailments. The aim of this study was the investigation of the ethnobotanical and physicochemical properties of commonly used medicinal plants in Jimma zone, southwest Ethiopia.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted in the district of Jimma zone from June 1 to 30, 2017. The ethnobotanical data were collected from traditional healers through semi-structured questionnaires. Specimens collected from various habitats were taken into Jimma University, Herbarium laboratory, dried, and prepared using standard herbarium specimen techniques for identification. Physicochemical analysis was done for selected medicinal plants.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 72 medicinal plants categorized under 61 genera and 39 families were stated by the respondents for the treatment of different human and livestock ailments. Herbs constitute the largest category (28 species, 38.89%) followed by shrubs (21 species, 29.17%), trees (20 species, 27.78%) and climbers (3 species, 4.17%). Leaves (39.19%) were the most commonly used plant parts followed by roots (27%) and seeds (10.81%). Traditional healers reported processing remedies mainly through crushing (46.91%), powdering (18.52%), pounding (11.11%), and pressing (9.88%). The water-soluble extractive value of the selected medicinal plants were between 1.825 to 18.507%w/w and the alcohol-soluble extractive value were between 0.143 to 1.107%w/w. The moisture content (%LOD) of <i>Barleria argentea</i> Balf. f. was higher than the recommended standard which consisted of 21.063%w/w and followed by high %LOD of <i>Crateva adansonii</i> D.C. Prodr (8.143%w/w) and <i>Euphorbia abbyssinica</i> J.F. Gmel. (16.347%w/w). The highest total ash value was registered in <i>Dioscorea quartiniana</i> A.Rich. species which consisted of 18.563%w/w and followed by <i>Crateva adansonii</i> D.C. Prodr (16.033%w/w) and <i>Barleria argentea</i> Balf. f. (15.648%w/w). High acid-insoluble ash value (7.227%w/w) and water-soluble ash (6.731%w/w) was recorded in <i>Euphorbia abbyssinica</i> J.F. Gmel.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study revealed that the water-soluble extractive value of the selected medicinal plants indicates the presence of water-soluble components such as sugar, acids, and inorganic compounds. In the future, these characters can be used to check the genuine nature of the crude drug; thus, it plays an important role in preventing the possible steps of adulteration."
