It ranks next to rice, wheat, and maize in terms of its importance as a staple food crop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over 100 million metric tons of the crop are produced annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, this crop production is severely hampered by Panama disease (also known as Fusarium wilt disease) caused by <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cubense</italic> race 4 (FOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], leading to extensive failure of commercial plantations in all banana-producing areas, including Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

So far not yet a practically effective approach of controlling this notorious disease in the field is available.

Environmentally friendly cultural practices and fungicides are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Fungicides are not able effectively to control this soil-borne pathogen in the field, for a variety of ecological reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nowadays, cultural practices have been tried with little success, for there has not been a suitably productive cultivar to selection or breeding for reducing the incidence of diseases caused by FOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, crop rotation and microorganisms have shown promise for reducing the disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Chinese farmers have practiced intercropping and rotation for disease control over 2000 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Intercropping, which is defined as the growing of two or more crop species in proximity simultaneously during a growing season, is an agricultural practice that not only increases crop yield and stress resilience, but also reduces the incidence of microbial diseases. Chemicals produced by one plant in the intercropping system, can either directly inhibit microbial pathogens in the soils, or indirectly trigger resistance through the induction of the plant defense system in neighboring plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

They are among the oldest medicinal herbs, used as antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant and cytotoxic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition to many organosulphur compounds, mainly disulphides and trisulphides, <italic>Allium</italic> plants also produce non-volatile compounds such as spirostanol, furostanol and cholesterol saponin with antimicrobial, antifungal, antiplatelet aggregating, and cytotoxic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Chinese chive is now gaining increasing attention due to its diverse important pharmacological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

All results from laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments suggested that the cultivar FJH is the best cultivar of Chinese chive for intercropping with banana to control Panama disease.
