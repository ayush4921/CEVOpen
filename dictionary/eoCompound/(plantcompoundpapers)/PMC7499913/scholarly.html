Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Panama disease (Fusarium wilt disease) caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4 (FOC) severely threatens banana (Musa spp.) production worldwide. Intercropping of banana with <i>Allium</i> plants has shown a potential to reduce Panama disease. In this study, six cultivars of Chinese chive (<i>Allium tuberosum</i> Rottler) were selected to compare their differences in antifungal activity and active compounds. Three cultivars Duokang Fujiu 11, Fujiuhuang 2, and Duokang Sijiqing with higher levels of antifungal compounds were further used for intercropping with banana in the pots and field to compare their effects on growth and disease incidence of banana.</p> <p id="Par2">The six cultivars showed significant differences in antifungal activity against FOC mycelia growth in both leaf volatiles and aqueous leachates. The aqueous leachates displayed stronger antifungal activity than the volatiles. FJH cultivar showed the best inhibitory effect among all six cultivars. Contents of three main antifungal compounds dipropyl trisulfide (DPT), dimethyl trisulfide (DMT), and 2-methyl-2-pentenal (MP) in volatiles and aqueous leachates varied considerably among cultivars. Pot and field experiments showed that intercropping with three selected Chinese chive cultivars significantly improved banana vegetative growth, increased photosynthetic characteristics and yield but decreased disease incidence of Panama disease.</p> <p id="Par3">Our results indicate that intercropping with Chinese chive shows potential to reduce banana Panama disease and selection of appropriate cultivars is vital for effective disease control.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par20">Banana (<i>Musa</i> spp.) is one of the worldâ€™s most important crops and it serves as a staple food in many developing tropical and subtropical countries [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. It ranks next to rice, wheat, and maize in terms of its importance as a staple food crop [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. Over 100 million metric tons of the crop are produced annually [<a href="#CR3">3</a>]. However, this crop production is severely hampered by Panama disease (also known as Fusarium wilt disease) caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4 (FOC) [<a href="#CR4">4</a>], leading to extensive failure of commercial plantations in all banana-producing areas, including Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and Australia [<a href="#CR5">5</a>â€"<a href="#CR7">7</a>]. The soil-borne fungal pathogen colonizes and occludes the host xylem to cause vascular wilt [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>]. So far not yet a practically effective approach of controlling this notorious disease in the field is available. Soil sterilization using fungicides has been used only for intensive agriculture in greenhouses on a limited scale [<a href="#CR9">9</a>, <a href="#CR10">10</a>]. Environmentally friendly cultural practices and fungicides are urgently needed [<a href="#CR11">11</a>â€"<a href="#CR13">13</a>]. Fungicides are not able effectively to control this soil-borne pathogen in the field, for a variety of ecological reasons [<a href="#CR14">14</a>]. Nowadays, cultural practices have been tried with little success, for there has not been a suitably productive cultivar to selection or breeding for reducing the incidence of diseases caused by FOC [<a href="#CR15">15</a>]. Recently, crop rotation and microorganisms have shown promise for reducing the disease severity [<a href="#CR16">16</a>, <a href="#CR17">17</a>].</p> <p id="Par21">Chinese farmers have practiced intercropping and rotation for disease control over 2000 years [<a href="#CR18">18</a>, <a href="#CR19">19</a>]. Intercropping, which is defined as the growing of two or more crop species in proximity simultaneously during a growing season, is an agricultural practice that not only increases crop yield and stress resilience, but also reduces the incidence of microbial diseases. Chemicals produced by one plant in the intercropping system, can either directly inhibit microbial pathogens in the soils, or indirectly trigger resistance through the induction of the plant defense system in neighboring plants [<a href="#CR20">20</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a>]. The <i>Allium</i> plants are characterized with the production of many antimicrobial substances [<a href="#CR21">21</a>â€"<a href="#CR24">24</a>]. They are among the oldest medicinal herbs, used as antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant and cytotoxic drugs [<a href="#CR25">25</a>]. In addition to many organosulphur compounds, mainly disulphides and trisulphides, <i>Allium</i> plants also produce non-volatile compounds such as spirostanol, furostanol and cholesterol saponin with antimicrobial, antifungal, antiplatelet aggregating, and cytotoxic activities [<a href="#CR26">26</a>â€"<a href="#CR30">30</a>]. Many <i>Allium</i> species such as garlic, onion and Chinese chive (<i>Allium tuberosum</i>) are widely cultivated for their spice and medicinal properties. Chinese chive is an important vegetable for making dumpling and kimchi in many Asian countries such as China and Korea. Chinese chive is now gaining increasing attention due to its diverse important pharmacological activities [<a href="#CR28">28</a>, <a href="#CR31">31</a>]. Although many studies have been conducted for food and pharmacological purposes [<a href="#CR24">24</a>, <a href="#CR32">32</a>], <i>Allium</i> plants as biological control agents for crop disease in the intercropping system and underlying mechanisms are scarcely addressed [<a href="#CR33">33</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a>]. The sequential cropping systems are becoming increasingly popular in all management practices for their environmental friendliness.</p> <p id="Par22">Recent studies indicated that banana intercropping with Chinese chive could effectively control Fusarium wilt of banana [<a href="#CR31">31</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a>, <a href="#CR35">35</a>]. Our previous study showed that Chinese chive exhibited strong inhibitory effects on FOC through the release of organic volatiles, among which 2-methyl-2-pentenal, dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dipropyl disulfide, and dipropyl trisulfide are the main active antifungal compounds [<a href="#CR34">34</a>]. However, crop varieties may markedly differ in their ability to produce antimicrobial chemicals [<a href="#CR36">36</a>].</p> <p id="Par23">In this paper, we selected six Chinese chive cultivars with obviously morphological difference and distinct characteristics to compare their antifungal activity against FOC and active compounds in the leaf volatiles and aqueous leachates of aerial parts. Three cultivars with higher contents of three antifungal compounds including dipropyl trisulfide (DPT), dimethyl trisulfide (DMT), 2-methyl-2-pentenal (MP) in the volatiles or aqueous leachates were further used in pot experiments to evaluate their potential in reducing disease incidence of Fusarium wilt disease of banana.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Discussion</div> <p id="Par56">Panama disease severely affects banana production worldwide. Appropriate agricultural practices show potentials to successfully minimize the detrimental effect of the disease [<a href="#CR9">9</a>, <a href="#CR10">10</a>, <a href="#CR40">40</a>, <a href="#CR41">41</a>]. Rotation and intercropping with Chinese chive have been demonstrated to be effective approaches to control the disease at both greenhouse and field levels [<a href="#CR31">31</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a>, <a href="#CR35">35</a>]. This study showed that the cultivar selection is a key factor for successful control of the disease. Although all cultivars displayed obvious inhibition to the disease in both greenhouse and field conditions (Figs.Â <a href="#Fig7">7</a> &amp;amp; <a href="#Fig8">8</a>), they showed significant difference in their ability to reduce the disease incidence. Two cultivars FJH and DKS exhibited much stronger inhibition against Panama disease. In particular, the cultivar FJH showed the highest inhibition to the disease and best improvement for the banana yield in both pot and field experiments (Figs. <a href="#Fig7">7</a> &amp;amp; <a href="#Fig8">8</a>). Interestingly, in laboratory both volatiles and aqueous leachates of FJH showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the pathogen FOC among the six cultivars tested (Figs.Â <a href="#Fig1">1</a> &amp;amp; <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Meanwhile, the cultivar FJH produced the highest amount of 2-methyl-2-pentenal in both volatiles and aqueous leachates (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>a &amp;amp; b), which showed the strongest antifungal activity against FOC (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a> [<a href="#CR34">34</a>];). All results from laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments suggested that the cultivar FJH is the best cultivar of Chinese chive for intercropping with banana to control Panama disease. The second better cultivar is DKS, which produced the second abundant 2-methyl-2-pentenal in the aqueous leachate (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>b), and showed the second strongest antifungal activity against FOC in the leachate (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Schulz et al. [<a href="#CR42">42</a>] revealed the influence of the genetic background of the parent cultivars on the sulfur volatile composition in the <i>Allium</i> hybrid. Therefore, selection of appropriate cultivars of Chinese chive with strong anti-FOC activity for intercropping is a key for successful control of Panama disease. More cultivars should be screened to find suitable ones for intercropping with banana.</p> <p id="Par57">Volatile compounds released from host plants play an important role in plant defense against microbial pathogens [<a href="#CR43">43</a>]. <i>Allium</i> species are well-known to produce many volatile organosulfur compounds, which contribute to the unique smell and taste of these plant species [<a href="#CR38">38</a>, <a href="#CR44">44</a>]. These compounds exhibit broad-spectrum biological activities towards microorganisms, plants and animals [<a href="#CR44">44</a>, <a href="#CR45">45</a>]. Although this study showed that aqueous leachates displayed much higher anti-FOC activity, the active compounds in the aqueous leachates were volatiles and low polarity [<a href="#CR34">34</a>, <a href="#CR46">46</a>], which is consistent with the result that the aqueous leachates had significantly more active compounds than volatiles (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>). The results indicated that anti-FOC compounds such as 2-methyl-2-pentenal and dimethyl trisulfide are easily released by Chinese chive via leaching and root exudation. Lian et al. [<a href="#CR46">46</a>] demonstrated that the aqueous leachates of Chinese chive roots were more inhibitory to FOC than those of stems and leaves. Zhang et al. [<a href="#CR34">34</a>] revealed that volatiles excluded by roots of Chinese chive inhibited spore germination of FOC. It is likely that in the field most active compounds of Chinese chive are released into the rhizospheres and then these volatiles spread into the soils to exhibit anti-FOC activity.</p> <p id="Par58">Volatile sulfur compounds have been demonstrated to be inhibitory to <i>Fusarium</i> and other pathogenic fungi [<a href="#CR47">47</a>]. Non-sulfur-containing compound 2-methyl-2-pentenal, a degradation product of thiopropanal S-oxide [<a href="#CR48">48</a>], displayed the strongest anti-FOC activity (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4</a>). The chemical was also found in the onion (<i>Allium cepa</i> L.) essential oil and displayed antifungal activity to <i>Fusarium</i> [<a href="#CR47">47</a>].</p> <p id="Par59">Anti-FOC activity and contents of 2-methyl-2-pentenal in the volatiles and aqueous leachates may serve as two desired parameters for preliminary selection of appropriate cultivars of Chinese chive for intercropping with banana.</p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p id="Par60">Panama disease (Fusarium wilt disease) caused by <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4 (FOC) severely threatens banana (Musa spp.) production worldwide. Intercropping of banana with Chinese chive can effectively reduce Panama disease.</p> <p id="Par61">Our study demonstrates that banana intercropping with Chinese chive can effectively reduce Panama disease and selection of appropriate cultivars of Chinese chive for intercropping is key for the success. The six cultivars showed significant differences in antifungal activity against FOC mycelia growth in both leaf volatiles and aqueous leachates. Pot and field experiments showed that intercropping with three selected Chinese chive cultivars significantly improved banana vegetative growth, increased photosynthetic characteristics and yield but decreased disease incidence of Panama disease. Among the six cultivars used FJH and DKS are the most suitable cultivars for intercropping.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="glossary" title="glossary"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
