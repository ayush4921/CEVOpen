    "During preservation, Jerusalem artichoke (JA) tubers are subjected to deterioration by mold fungi under storage, which signifies a serious problem. A new blue mold (<i>Penicillium polonium</i>) was recorded for the first time on JA tubers. Penicillium mold was isolated, identified (morphologically, and molecularly), and deposited in GenBank; (MW041259). The fungus has a multi-lytic capacity, facilitated by various enzymes capable of severely destroying the tuber components. An economic oil-based procedure was applied for preserving and retaining the nutritive value of JA tubers under storage conditions. Caraway and clove essential oils, at a concentration of 2%, were selected based on their strong antifungal actions. JA tubers were treated with individual oils under storage, kept between peat moss layers, and stored at room temperature. Tubers treated with both oils exhibited lower blue mold severity, sprouting and weight loss, and higher levels of carbohydrates, inulin, and protein contents accompanied by increased levels of defense-related phytochemicals (total phenols, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase). Caraway was superior, but the results endorse the use of both essential oils for the preservation of JA tubers at room temperature, as an economic and eco-safe storage technique against the new blue mold."
