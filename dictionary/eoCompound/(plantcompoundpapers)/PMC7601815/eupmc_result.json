    "The effects of green tea extract (GTE) at acidic and alkaline pH (pH 3 and 11, respectively) on the physico-mechanical, thermal, and water transmission properties of silver carp surimi-based edible films were investigated. Incorporation of GTE significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduced elongation at break (EAB) but improved tensile strength (TS). Significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) decreases in the solubility of films and water vapor permeability (WVP) were also perceived in GTE-containing films. Transparency and color were also affected, depending upon the concentration and pH. Films prepared at an acidic pH demonstrated significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) improved WVP, transparency, solubility, and thermal stability compared to those prepared at an alkaline pH. The protein pattern of films revealed a strong interaction between phenolic compounds of GTE and surimi proteins as evidenced by the presence of a myosin heavy chain (MCH) at the top of the gel. Generally, the addition of GTE at an acidic pH had significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) greater impact on film properties than at an alkaline pH and could offer great potential for surimi protein-based edible films with improved properties."
