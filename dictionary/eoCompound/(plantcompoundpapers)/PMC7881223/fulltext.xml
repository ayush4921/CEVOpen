Airborne PM is commonly classified according to particle size; inhalable PM includes particulates with an aerodynamic diameter &#x02264;10 &#x003bc;m (PM<sub>10</sub>), which can penetrate the respiratory tract below the larynx, while respirable PM &#x02264; 2.5 &#x003bc;m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) may penetrate the gas-exchange region of the lungs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">The human health hazards associated with PM exposure are universally acknowledged both in terms of the effects of their components and the enhanced transmissibility of pathogens (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Setti et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">van Doremalen et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

SEM/EDX is a powerful, fast, and non-destructive analysis technique, and determining both the chemical and morphological characteristics of particles typically allows their accurate identification and classification. Single particles can also be counted and their size measured for detailed quantitative assessment. In the present study, we applied this methodology to investigate PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> accumulated on honey bees in an urban area of the Po Valley, which is one of the most important industrial and agricultural areas in Italy and Europe, characterised by a high population density and low air quality (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Marcazzan et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pirovano et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">The study area includes agricultural fields, a relatively new incinerator plant, and a stretch of the Milano-Bologna motorway.

Approximately five worker bees were collected on a monthly basis in June, July, August, and October, yielding a total of 20 bees. In September, bees were not sampled owing to the treatments applied by the beekeeper against the ectoparasitic mite <italic>Varroa destructor</italic>.</p><p id="p0065">Negative control bees consisted of newly eclosed individuals from a brood frame kept in a growth chamber. Briefly, a brood frame was selected and placed in an incubator at 36 &#x000b0;C and 60% relative humidity for approximately 16 h. Newly eclosed adults were randomly selected and prepared for SEM/EDX analyses. Once collected, worker bees were immediately placed in soda-glass capped vials, stored on ice to keep them inactive, and rapidly brought to the lab for sample preparation. Preliminary studies have shown that PM on the bees is mostly concentrated along the costal margin of the forewings, medial plane of the head, and inner surface of the hind legs (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Negri et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we examined the forewings, which are relatively easy to explore with the SEM probe owing to their flatness and lack of long setae (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pellecchia and Negri, 2018</xref>). The bees&#x02019; wings were cut under a stereoscope with a scalpel and mounted onto SEM stubs using double adhesive carbon tape. Before the SEM/EDX investigation, because of the insulating properties of the samples, the stubs were carbon coated to make them conductive to avoid charging flare during the observations. Moreover, haemolymph (blood) was extracted from the control bees by puncturing the dorsal aorta, following the method standardised by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Garrido et&#x000a0;al. (2013)</xref>, to distinguish the potential contribution of the haemolymph (that permeates the wings) to the EDX spectra; haemolymph droplets were set and dehydrated upon stubs under a sterile hood, graphitised, and analysed using SEM/EDX.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>SEM/EDX analyses</title><p id="p0070">The SEM/EDX investigation was performed using a Zeiss Gemini 500 field-emission instrument equipped with a Bruker XFlash 6130 EDX micro-analyser. A panoramic electron backscattered (BSE) image was acquired for each analysed area along with magnified images of some particles representative of the different phases encountered. Each analysed particle was attributed to a phase (or phase aggregate) based on the elements present in the corresponding spectrum as well as the relative amounts and morphologies of the particles themselves. For instance, different minerals were characterised and distinguished based on elemental compositions; clay minerals generally have a pronounced lamellar habit in addition to a given elemental content; halides have a cubic habit as well as some sulphides that, in turn, feature distinct elemental signals. While this methodology is rapid, cost-effective, and able to reveal nano-sized particles, it has the following limitations: (1) the EDX system is not very sensitive to light elements such as hydrogen and carbon. Therefore, hydrocarbon molecules cannot be efficiently identified and characterised; (2) BSE imaging is sensitive to the average atomic number of the particles. Therefore, heavy particles can most easily be recognised on light organic substrates, including bee wings, while conversely, light particles show poor contrast and tend to be underestimated; (3) even when nanometre-scale image resolutions are obtained under optimal experimental conditions, the spatial resolution of the EDX probe is only few microns. Therefore, for particles smaller than the EDX probe&#x02014;namely PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;m&#x02014;the surroundings will always contribute to the resultant spectrum. As such, we could obtain the average composition of the mixture small-particle aggregates; and (4) different mineral species may have the same elements in different proportions, and the only way to distinguish them is to determine the atomic proportions. For example, forsterite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) can be distinguished from enstatite (MgSiO<sub>3</sub>) based on their respective Mg/Si ratios of 2:1 and 1:1. Such determinations are straightforward for ideal samples (i.e., with a flat and polished surface and of sufficient size to entirely contain the electron beam interaction volume i.e., &#x0003c;10 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>); however, for non-ideal samples, raw data cannot be properly reduced, that is, intensity data cannot be properly transformed into concentrations. In our case, most particles had an irregular shape, rough surfaces, and were smaller than the EDX probe, meaning that interpretation was sometimes more difficult. The airborne particles on the honey bee wings were also analysed in terms of the number of particles per surface area and their size distribution using the image-processing software &#x02018;DigitalMicrograph&#x02019; (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). Briefly, 12 SEM-BSE images randomly chosen among the obtained pictures with a homogeneous background and magnifications ranging from 1.14 KX and 25.38 KX were considered. Particles that could be distinguished from the background (i.e., the honey bee wing) based on brightness and contrast were selected and counted, and their morphological parameters were measured. The PM mass was estimated assuming an average particle density of 2.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (corresponding to the density of quartz, which is the dominant mineral in soils; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000fc;hlmann et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), and a measured mean circular particle diameter of 0.75 &#x003bc;m.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Particulate matter analysis</title><p id="p0075">In the negative controls, the electronic scan did not detect any PM contamination (Fig.&#x000a0;S1); the experimental bees displayed contamination with inorganic dust typically &#x0003c;10 &#x003bc;m in diameter.

Herein, the BSE images and elemental distributions show that the PM<sub>10</sub> particles comprise at least three different major phases and contribute to the whole spectrum. The upper left particle primarily contains Si, Al, K, and Fe, likely being a clay mineral such as illite, with sub-microscopic inclusions of Fe oxides; the lower right particles primarily contain Na, S, Cl, and Ca, although Na and Ca are present in much greater abundance suggesting these elements may be combined with C to form secondary oxalates. In other cases, the different phases were easily distinguished by the BSE imaging, as in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;9</xref> where clay minerals associated with organic matter are shown. The two different materials yielded different EDX spectra. For example, the P, S, and Na peaks were much higher in the organic matter spectrum than in the clay mineral one, suggesting that P, S, and Na were more highly concentrated in the former, and the small peaks in the clay mineral spectrum were spurious. Analogously, the small Si and Al peaks in the organic matter spectrum are considered to be spurious peaks originating from the clay minerals.<fig id="fig8"><label>Figure&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>Elemental mapping of compound PM<sub>10</sub> particles (sample 14/10): (a) SEM-BSE image showing at least three different particles and some brighter inclusions within the particle in the upper left; (b) averaged EDX spectrum; (c)&#x02013;(m) single element maps.

Clay minerals and calcite were more abundant on the bees collected in June and October, accounting for approximately 75% of the acquired spectra. In June, the ratio between clay minerals and calcite was 1.3:1; conversely, in October, calcite was more than twice as abundant as clay. In July and August, the percentage of clay minerals and calcite was lower than in June and October, decreasing to approximately 56% and 36%, respectively (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;10</xref>). Fe-bearing PM appeared rarely on bees collected in June (2%), more commonly on those collected in July (13%), and peaked on those collected in August (about 50%). In October, Fe compounds comprised approximately 12% of the total obtained spectra (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;10</xref>).

For the contaminated bees, the density of particles ranged from a few thousand to several hundreds of thousands per mm<sup>2</sup>; however, this difference was primarily attributable to differing image magnifications rather than actual differences in PM concentrations. In general, low-magnification images tended to underestimate fine and ultrafine particles, while high-magnification images obscured coarser particles. Ultrafine particles (PM<sub>0.1</sub>) did not contribute much to the overall PM mass, although they contributed considerably to the total number of particles (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kurth et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">Most of PM accumulated on bees could be interpreted as naturally derived minerals, such as quartz, phyllosilicates, calcite, and feldspars from the surrounding alluvial deposits and agricultural soils. Calcite and clay minerals were found in all samples and, along with quartz, are by far the most abundant mineral phases in the silty clays and sandy silts that comprise the alluvial deposits of the Taro River and the Parma Stream. These waterways originate in the numerous Flysch formations of the Apennines that feed the alluvial deposits of the Po Valley on the southern side of the Po River. Agricultural activities, especially those involving the harvesting and sowing of wheat and alfalfa near the hive, may have contributed to the spread of minerals from the soils. However, the abundance of clay minerals and calcite was highly variable over time. This suggests the influence of further human activities, such as municipal waste incineration. Calcite is indeed one of the most common phases found on incinerator bottom ash, but further work is needed to assess the specific contributions of waste-treatment process including the removal and disposal of ash. The incinerator plant could also be responsible for the presence of airborne quartz PM, as SiO<sub>2</sub> is often abundant in bottom ash (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alam et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). In the studied samples, quartz was typically more abundant than feldspar, although both are prevalent in sedimentary lithic rocks, particularly in silts and sands. A possible explanation is that feldspars are much more sensitive to weathering than quartz, and therefore, degrade to clay minerals more rapidly (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Klein and Philpotts, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">Other mineral phases frequently found were Fe compounds including Fe oxides, metallic Fe, and Fe -alloys. Fe oxides (and Fe hydroxides) can be very abundant in nature, especially in association with mafic and ultramafic rocks, lateritic horizons, and the alteration of sulphide ores; however, these compounds are not abundant in the outcrops in the study area, which are largely Flysch rock. Metallic Fe is rare and may reach the Earth's surface via siderite meteorites in small quantities. Similarly, natural Fe alloys, in particular Fe&#x02013;Ni alloys, may have an extra-terrestrial origin, and therefore, are very rare. In contrast, metallic Fe and Fe alloys derived from anthropogenic activities can be very abundant in the environment, being present in various manufactured goods (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gonet and Maher, 2019</xref>). For example, materials containing Fe are commonly used in the automotive industry (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Carrero et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gonet and Maher, 2019</xref>). Thus, the Fe compounds identified in the study area may originate from the wearing of the mechanical parts of vehicles travelling on the adjacent A1 motorway. Other occasionally detected metallic particles, such as Cu and Al particles, may have similar origins, as they are otherwise considered rare (Cu) or absent (Al) in nature but are widely used in electric circuitry (Cu) and in the lighter chassis and engine parts of vehicles (Al). In July and August, tourism-related road traffic is particularly high due to the summer holiday season, often resulting in frequent traffic jams. In 2017, between the end of July and the first two weeks of August, during the &#x0201c;summer exodus&#x0201d;, light vehicle traffic on the motorway increased by more than 50%, and the average daily number of light and heavy vehicles taking the nearby exit was 11,280 and 3,460, respectively (Autostrade per l&#x02019;Italia S. p.A., traffic report). Thus, during this peak traffic period, bees collected on August 10 would have been exposed to increased levels of metal-bearing PM (relative to bees collected on July 20).</p><p id="p0115">Another mineral phase frequently found on the bee wings was barite, a Ba sulphate. Barite is not rare in nature but is concentrated in hydrothermal deposits; therefore, it must be rare in the study area. Barite is, however, commonly used as a filler in various manufactured objects including vehicle tires and brakes. In particular, barite is the major chemical phase of break-pad material and is used as a filler to improve thermal and noise properties as well as wear resistance (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;sterle et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Neis et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Menapace et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). In this study, barite was present in all samples, and always as part of the &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;m size fraction. This is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that, when abraded from brakes and tyres, the grain size of barite is significantly reduced to the nanometre scale (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;sterle et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pellecchia and Negri, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Papa et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0120">Round, non-crystalline SiO<sub>2</sub> dust found on the bee wings could be linked to high-temperature combustion, such as that occurring at the nearby incinerator plant. According to the European Waste Incineration Directive, incinerator combustion must be conducted at above 850 &#x000b0;C to ensure the proper breakdown of toxic organic substances such as dioxins (Directive 2000/76/EC). Under such conditions, silicate matter may melt, and rapid post-combustion cooling can result in the formation of spherical PM (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kutchko and Kim, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alam et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0125">An anthropogenic origin is also suggested for Ti oxide. Titanium dioxide, occurring as rutile, is not rare in nature and may concentrate in the heavy fraction of sediments. Yet, synthetic TiO<sub>2</sub> is widely used as a filler and whitening agent in various manufactured objects, such as plastics and paints, and is abundant in vehicle components.</p><p id="p0130">Phosphorous was a minor but common element in the studied samples, generally associated with other elements as N, Cl, S. In one case, the observed spectrum was consistent with apatite [Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH,F,Cl)]. Apatite, one of the main constituents of bones (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hughes and Rakovan, 2002</xref>), is an accessory mineral in many types of rocks, and can occur at relatively high concentrations in igneous and marine sedimentary rocks. Apatite is not, therefore, expected to be naturally abundant in the study area. Given the prevalence of phosphate-based fertilisers, the observed apatite may have had a secondary origin stemming from reactions between phosphates and Ca-compounds (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Moore et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arai and Sparks, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Shen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). For example, such nutrients are needed in large quantities by <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>, a widespread crop in the study area, as low nutrient availability reduces the yield and persistence of this perennial plant (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berg et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0135">We hypothesised that the background N, Si, P, S, Cl, K &#x000b1;Al, &#x000b1;Na, &#x000b1;Mg, and &#x000b1;Fe peaks obtained for the measured smaller particles (i.e., &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;m in diameter) were signals from the honey bee wings components, including the cuticle and the haemolymph. The cuticle is primarily composed of chitin (a long-chain polymer with the composition (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>5</sub>N)<sub>n</sub>) microfibers fixed in a protein matrix, e.g., hydrophobic proteins, with alanine (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>) as the predominant amino acid (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Micas et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Falcon et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) and resilin, an elastomeric protein with proline (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>) and glycerine (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>) as principal amino acids (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ma et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Insect haemolymph comprises water, inorganic salts (mostly Na, Cl, K, Mg, and Ca), and organic compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). Trehalose (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) and glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) are the major circulating carbohydrates, and fatty acids, diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospholipids are major lipids in the haemolymph (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mikulecky and Bounias, 1997</xref>). While C, H, and O are major constituents of all these lipids, P is a minor constituent of phospholipids. Key proteins in adult bee haemolymph are transferrin, an Fe(III) transporter; apolipophorin, a lipid transporter; and vitellogenin, a nutrient-storage protein (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chan et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). P and S are minor constituents of these organic compounds. Therefore, C, H, O, and to a lesser extent, N, are major elements in honey bee wings, which is consistent with the EDX spectral features observed for small particles (PM<sub>1</sub>). All other background elements, with the possible exception of Si and Al, are minor elements in the aforementioned wing components and consistently appeared in the spectra at very low concentrations.</p><p id="p0140">In many cases, the spectra generated for very fine particles were dominated by Cl, S, or N peaks. At least in some cases, these elements could represent chlorides, SO<sub>x</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub> as well as ammonia stemming from vehicle exhaust gas and incinerator emissions. These compounds may condense either directly onto honey bee wings or on fine airborne PM, such as clay minerals, that acts as condensation nuclei before accumulating on bees. This might explain the recurrent association of the background peaks with Na, Mg, Al, Si, and K. In other cases, background peaks were associated with Fe or Ba, suggesting that fine particles of iron or barite, respectively, may have acted as condensation nuclei. Detailed results and implications relating to fine and ultrafine particles are reported elsewhere (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Papa et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0145">P, K, and N are also major constituents of fertilisers (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gowariker et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), and Cl, P, S, and N (and Br and F) may be present in pesticides used in beekeeping and/or applied to crops (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ravoet et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). These substances may contaminate the bodies directly when bees visit inflorescences during foraging or, in a manner similar to vehicle exhaust gas and incinerator emissions, may be present in the atmosphere as aerosols and condense either directly onto bee wings or suspended fine mineral particles later collected by the bees. However, as our discussion demonstrates, the precise identification and provenance of fine particles continue to pose challenges.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0150">Our results provide evidence of the presence of specific inhalable and respirable airborne PM (i.e., dust able to pass beyond the larynx and ciliated airways, respectively) in the study area. The honey bees analysed were highly contaminated with PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> primarily comprising quartz, calcite, clay minerals, Fe-bearing PM, including iron oxides/hydroxides, metallic iron, Fe alloys, and barite.</p><p id="p0155">Our data suggest that people living in the area are subjected to chronic (continuous/repeated) exposure to specific airborne PM emitted by vehicular traffic, local agricultural operations, and waste incineration, and exposure levels may vary rapidly based on recurrent local activities. For example, the increase in natural mineral compounds (e.g., clay minerals, calcite, and quartz) was closely linked to cultivation cycles, while metal-bearing PM abundance increased in conjunction with periods of elevated local road traffic.</p><p id="p0160">In view of the recent COVID-19 outbreak occurring in Italy and centred in the Po Valley, it is also important to verify the possible association between the outbreak of respiratory viruses and exposure to specific components of airborne PM. More particle identification and classification data are needed, therefore, alongside improved information on viral viability on specific airborne PM components.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0165">Ilaria Negri: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0170">Giancarlo Capitani: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0175">Giulia Papa: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p><p id="p0180">Marco Pellecchia: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0185">This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">ECORESILIENTE project of the Universit&#x000e0; Cattolica del Sacro Cuore</funding-source> (Italy) (I.N.).
