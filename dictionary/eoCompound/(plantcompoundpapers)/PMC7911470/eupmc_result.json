    "Increased problems associated with side effects and bacterial resistance of chemical drugs has prompted the research focus on herbal medicines in the past few decades. In the present investigation, the antimicrobial activity of the various parts of <i>Avicennia marina</i> (AM), a mangrove plant, has been evaluated. The plants were collected from the Jazan area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Primary extracts of roots, stem, leaves, fruits, and seeds were made in ethanol and fractioned in ethanol, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, chloroform, and water. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extracts were determined against <i>Bacillus</i><i>subtilis</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. It has been observed that the chloroform extract of roots of the AM exhibited inhibitory effects against both <i>S. aureus</i> (MIC = 1.5 ± 0.03 mg/mL) and <i>E. coli</i> (MIC = 1.7 ± 0.01 mg/mL). The ethanolic extract of the AM roots has shown antibacterial activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (MIC = 10.8 ± 0.78 mg/mL)<i>, Bacillus</i><i>subtilis</i> (MIC = 6.1 ± 0.27 mg/mL), <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MIC = 2.3 ± 0.08 mg/mL), and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (MIC = 6.3 ± 0.28 mg/mL). The leaf extract of the AM in ethyl acetate showed antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. Antifungal activity of these extracts was also investigated against <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Candida albicans.</i> Ethanolic extract of roots and seeds of the AM has shown antifungal activity against <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> when applied individually. Ethanolic extract of the AM fruits has shown an inhibitory effect on the growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>. It is suggested that the plant extracts of AM have tremendous antimicrobial activity against a group of microbes, and this effect depends on both the plant part and the solvent used for extraction. Therefore, this plant can be considered to treat various diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
