    "Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived plant hormones involved in the development of various plants. SLs also stimulate seed germination of the root parasitic plants, <i>Striga</i> spp. and <i>Orobanche</i> spp., which reduce crop yield. Therefore, regulating SL biosynthesis may lessen the damage of root parasitic plants. Biosynthetic inhibitors effectively control biological processes by targeted regulation of biologically active compounds. In addition, biosynthetic inhibitors regulate endogenous levels in developmental stage- and tissue-specific manners. To date, although some chemicals have been found as SL biosynthesis inhibitor, these are derived from only three lead chemicals. In this study, to find a novel lead chemical for SL biosynthesis inhibitor, 27 nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivatives were screened for inhibition of SL biosynthesis. Triflumizole most effectively reduced the levels of rice SL, 4-deoxyorobanchol (4DO), in root exudates. In addition, triflumizole inhibited endogenous 4DO biosynthesis in rice roots by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Os900, a rice enzyme that converts the SL intermediate carlactone to 4DO. A <i>Striga</i> germination assay revealed that triflumizole-treated rice displayed a reduced level of germination stimulation for <i>Striga</i>. These results identify triflumizole as a novel lead compound for inhibition of SL biosynthesis."
