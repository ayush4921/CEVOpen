    "<i>Combretum erythrophyllum</i> is an indigenous southern African tree species, a metal hyperaccumulator that has been used as a phytoextraction option for tailing dams in Johannesburg, South Africa. In hyperaccumulators, metal detoxification has also been linked or attributed to the activities of endophytes, and, in this regard, metal detoxification can be considered a form of endophytic behavior. Therefore, we report herein on the identification of proteins that confer heavy metal resistance, the in vitro characterization of heavy metal resistance, and the production of plant growth-promoting (PGP) volatiles by <i>Methylobacterium radiotolerans</i> MAMP 4754. Multigenome comparative analyses of <i>M. radiotolerans</i> MAMP 4754 against eight other endophytic strains led to the identification of zinc, copper, and nickel resistance proteins in the genome of this endophyte. The maximum tolerance concentration (MTC) of this strain towards these metals was also investigated. The metal-exposed cells were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts (1:1 <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) of heavy metal untreated <i>M. radiotolerans</i> MAMP 4754 were also screened for the production of PGP compounds by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS). The MTC was recorded at 15 mM, 4 mM, and 12 mM for zinc, copper, and nickel, respectively. The TEM analysis showed the accumulation of metals in the intracellular environment of <i>M. radiotolerans</i> MAMP 4754, while the GC/MS analysis revealed several plant growth-promoting compounds, including alcohols, phthalate esters, alkenes, ketones, sulfide derivatives, phenols, and thiazoles. Our findings suggest that the genetic makeup of <i>M. radiotolerans</i> MAMP 4754 encodes heavy metal resistant proteins that indicate hyperaccumulator-specific endophytic behavior and the potential for application in bioremediation. The production of plant growth-promoting volatiles in pure culture by <i>M. raditotolerans</i> MAMP 4754 is a characteristic feature for plant growth-promoting bacteria."
