    "Optimization of the extraction conditions of polyphenolic compounds for different parts of the Damas species, <i>Conocarpus lancifolius</i> and <i>Conocarpus erectus</i>, grown under UAE conditions was studied. The combination of ethanol concentration (50, 75, and 100%), temperature (45, 55, and 65 Â°C) and time (1, 2, and 3 h) was used by applying the Response Surface Methodology. The data showed that the extracts (<i>n</i> = 90) contained phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and tannins, and were free of alkaloids. Changing the extraction conditions had a significant effect on the detection of phytosterols, saponins, and glycosides and on the solubility of vanillic acid, <i>p</i>-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, <i>t</i>-ferulic acid, rutin hydrate, protocatechuic acid, quercetin, and flavone. The data reveal that the roots and leaves of <i>C. erectus</i> and the leaves and fruits of <i>C.</i><i>lancifolius</i> are the most important plant parts from which to extract these compounds. This study draws attention to the unordinary use of <i>Conocarpus</i> spp. as a source of natural food additive."
