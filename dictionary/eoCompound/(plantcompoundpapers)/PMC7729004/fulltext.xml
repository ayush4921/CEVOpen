Successful biocontrol is based on the perception of signals derived from both the plant symbiont and the fungal prey. Here, we applied three different chemotropic assays to study the chemosensing capacity of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> toward compounds known or suspected to play a role in the mycoparasite/plant or host/prey fungal interactions and to cover the complete spectrum of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> developmental stages. Purified compounds, including nutrients, the fungal secondary metabolite 6-amyl-&#x003b1;-pyrone (6-pentyl-&#x003b1;-pyrone, 6-PP) and the plant oxylipin 13-(s)-HODE, as well as culture supernatants derived from fungal preys, including <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, were used to evaluate chemotropic responses of conidial germlings, microcolonies and fully differentiated mycelia. Our results show that germlings respond preferentially to compounds secreted by plant roots and <italic>T. atroviride</italic> itself than to compounds secreted by prey fungi. With the progression of colony development, host plant cues and self-generated signaling compounds remained the strongest chemoattractants. Nevertheless, mature hyphae responded differentially to certain prey-derived signals. Depending on the fungal prey species, chemotropic responses resulted in either increased or decreased directional colony extension and hyphal density at the colony periphery closest to the test compound source. Together these findings suggest that chemotropic sensing during germling development is focused on plant association and colony network formation, while fungal prey recognition develops later in mature hyphae of fully differentiated mycelium. Furthermore, the morphological alterations of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> in response to plant host and fungal prey compounds suggest the presence of both positive and negative chemotropism. The presented assays will be useful for screening of candidate compounds, and for evaluating their impact on the developmental spectrum of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> and other related species alike. Conidial germlings proved particularly useful for simple and rapid compound screening, whereas more elaborate microscopic analysis of microcolonies and fully differentiated mycelia was essential to understand process-specific responses, such as plant symbiosis and biocontrol.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>fungal plant pathogens</kwd><kwd>mycoparasitism</kwd><kwd><italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic></kwd><kwd>chemotropism</kwd><kwd>plant symbiosis</kwd><kwd>host sensing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Austrian Science Fund<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002428</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Tiroler Wissenschaftsf&#x000f6;rderung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100009968</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> employs several mechanisms to counteract soil-dwelling plant pathogenic fungi, including the competition for space and resources, rhizosphere modification, secretion of antifungal compounds, and direct mycoparasitism (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ben&#x000ed;tez et al., 2004</xref>). Biocontrol by competition for resources describes the more effective mobilization and absorption of nutrients from the soil by <italic>Trichoderma</italic> than by fungal plant pathogens inhabiting the same space (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chet and Inbar, 1994</xref>). In addition, a higher resistance against fungistatic secondary metabolites secreted by other fungal species, plants or soil bacteria provides <italic>Trichoderma</italic> with a fitness advantage against other fungal species (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ben&#x000ed;tez et al., 2004</xref>). Active rhizosphere modification by <italic>Trichoderma</italic> through the secretion of toxic secondary metabolites and compounds with fungistatic or antifungal properties inhibits the growth of other fungi and other microorganisms with less effective ABC pumps or enzyme secretion systems (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Delgado-Jarana et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ben&#x000ed;tez et al., 2004</xref>). Numerous <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species employ volatile and non-volatile compounds, hydrolytic enzymes, and peptaibols for this purpose (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Monte, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wiest et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Howell, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Mycoparasitism describes the direct attack of one fungus (the prey) by another fungus (the mycoparasite) with the aim to exploit the prey as a nutrient source. Key stages of the process include prey recognition, positive chemotropic growth toward it, chemical and physical attack &#x02013; the combination of both usually results in the killing of fungal prey hyphae &#x02013; and finally nutrient uptake. The pre-contact chemical attack includes the induced production and mass release of cell wall degrading enzymes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Viterbo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Howell, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harman et al., 2004</xref>), whereas physical attack during the contact phase is accompanied by significant morphological changes that may include intense branching, hyphal coiling or the formation of appressorium-like structures (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although positive chemotropism in response to prey-derived stimuli has been recognized as a key initiating feature of mycoparasitism early on (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chet et al., 1981</xref>), the cellular and molecular details of prey sensing are still poorly understood. Inter-species recognition in fungi has been linked to remote sensing of cell wall components (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chet et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zeilinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Viterbo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Vinale et al., 2008</xref>). It is accepted that fungi permanently secrete low amounts of extracellular chitinases that release cell wall oligomers from target fungi in the vicinity. These, in turn, are thought to serve as ligands for prey recognition by the mycoparasite and induce the production and mass release of cell wall degrading enzymes and other associated cellular processes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brunner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ben&#x000ed;tez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Viterbo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Druzhinina et al., 2011</xref>). This cascade of events is considered as the starting point for the activation of a mycoparasitic attack program in various <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zeilinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Viterbo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brunner et al., 2003</xref>). However, little is known about the prey-derived molecules that trigger the directed growth of mycoparasitic hyphae toward those of the prey fungus (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Vinale et al., 2008</xref>). Chemotropic events, that either lead to positive chemotropism guided by compounds that elicit attraction (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lichius and Lord, 2014</xref>), or to negative chemotropism, when a compound has a repellent or toxic activity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Miyoshi, 1894</xref>), results in hyphal tropism. Most of these observations have been made by evaluating the growth redirectioning of conidial germlings from fungi like <italic>Penicillium glaucum</italic>, <italic>B. cinerea, Trichoderma harzianum</italic> or <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, toward gradients of self-generated or exogenously derived chemical substances to test their chemotropic activity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Miyoshi, 1894</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Massee, 1905</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Turr&#x000e0; et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Vitale et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lombardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Partida-Hanon et al., 2020</xref>). Chemotropism in hyphae has been investigated under different conditions, including the presence of potentially harmful products (negative chemotropism), or autotropism, comprising chemical attraction between genetically identical cells by means of vegetative hyphal fusion (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hickey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Roca et al., 2005</xref>) or self- avoidance mediated by low oxygen content areas (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brand and Gow, 2009</xref>). Sexual attraction is an essential non-self signaling process on the basis of secreted mating type-specific peptide pheromones (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gooday and Adams, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Turr&#x000e0; and Di Pietro, 2015</xref>), and represents the so far best understood chemotropic mechanism.</p><p>How the perception of diffusible compounds released by plant hosts triggers morphological responses in fungal plant pathogens that ultimately lead to parasitism are crucial insights required to broaden our understanding of the physiological and molecular factors involved in this process (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brand and Gow, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Turr&#x000e0; et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nordzieke et al., 2019</xref>). Proof of these chemotropic events, however, often remains elusive due to the lack of proper evaluation schemes.</p><p>In this study, we have developed three different chemotropic assays to evaluate the chemical sensing ability of the mycoparasite <italic>T. atroviride</italic> toward selected compounds known or suspected to play essential roles in the mycoparasite/plant host/prey fungus interaction covering the complete spectrum of the fungal developmental stages from conidial germling to a mature colony. This comparison revealed that during all developmental stages association with the plant host and self-signaling for colony network establishment are prioritized, while fungal prey recognition becomes increasingly important as the colony matures. These findings suggest that germling assays are highly useful for rapid screening of chemotropic compounds, while the analysis of fully differentiated colonies is essential for the identification of chemotropic compounds that are specific for a given process such as plant symbiosis or mycoparasitism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Strains and Culture Conditions</title><p><italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> strain P1 (ATCC 74058) was used as mycoparasite; <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, <italic>R. solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>, and <italic>F. graminearum</italic> PH-1, were used as prey fungi. <italic>B. cinerea</italic> is a plant leaf pathogen, whereas <italic>R. solani</italic> and the two <italic>Fusarium</italic> species attack plant roots and spikes, respectively.

This classic assay format is highly valuable to gain new insights at the macroscopic level into general attack, defense and counter-attack responses displayed by mycoparasite and prey. Certain plant pathogens, such as <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and <italic>R. solani</italic>, are easily mycoparasitised by <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, i.e., after 7 days under standard confrontation conditions as previously described (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zeilinger et al., 2005</xref>). By contrast, other plant pathogens such as <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> or <italic>F. graminearum</italic> are very difficult to almost impossible to be mycoparasitised by <italic>T. atroviride</italic> under standard assay conditions, since the mycoparasite fails to overgrow the prey mycelium or does so only to a small extent (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Speckbacher et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis that each prey fungus displays different defense mechanisms against the mycoparasitic attack by <italic>T. atroviride</italic> prompted us to investigate if <italic>T. atroviride</italic> has a differential chemotropic behavior toward its preys. To this aim, multiple confrontation assays were conducted to evaluate changes in growth direction, growth speed, and mycoparasitic efficiency of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> in response to different prey fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We noted that <italic>T. atroviride</italic> did not show significant changes in speed or direction of hyphal growth, nor did we observe specific mycoparasitism-associated morphological changes related to individual prey fungi, except in the interaction with the two <italic>Fusarium</italic> species which it was unable to overgrow. This suggests that neither the classic confrontation assay nor the biochoice assay is suitable for revealing particular attack preferences or subtle changes in colony morphology in response to different prey species. Hence, the screening of potential chemotropic compounds relevant to mycoparasitism needs to be performed with a different assay format. Furthermore, the classic fungus-fungus confrontation assay completely excludes the plant host, which is an essential symbiotic partner in the natural context of the rhizosphere. Therefore, we decided to examine the response of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> germlings to different chemotropic compounds relevant to plant symbiosis and mycoparasitism.</p></sec><sec id="S3.SS2"><title>Minimum Carbon and Nitrogen Quantities, pH Stability and Increased Oxygen Availability Are Essential for Stress-Free Chemotropism Assays With <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic></title><p>Based on an assay design previously used to quantify the chemotropic response in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> germlings (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Turr&#x000e0; et al., 2015</xref>), the experimental conditions were optimized for <italic>T. atroviride</italic> to enable detection of chemotropic responses in a stress-free environment. The use of embedded growth in water agar &#x02013; as used by Turr&#x000e0; and co-workers for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> &#x02013; produced abnormally shaped germlings and reduced the germination rate of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> to only 20&#x02013;30%, two features indicating significant cell stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Addition of at least 27 mM glucose and 10 mM NaNO<sub>3</sub> complemented germ tube morphology but failed to increase germination rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that starvation stress was alleviated but that other abiotic stresses remained present. Therefore, water agar was replaced with a pH-buffered MM9. After titrating increasing molarities of glucose and ammonium chloride as the sole carbon (C-) and nitrogen (N-) sources, respectively, 0.1 mM glucose and 0.5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl were found to optimize the morphological appearance of germlings and to improve overall chemotropic behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The intention was to supply as much C- and N-sources as necessary for healthy germling development, but as little as possible to avoid nutrient sensing interfering with chemotropic processes related to the perception of chemotropic cues derived from plant host or prey fungus. In addition, conidia were not embedded into the agar but instead homogeneously spread on top using glass beads, in order to ensure maximum oxygen availability and to facilitate microscopic observation. Taken together these measures improved the germination rate of healthy growing germlings to the experimentally achievable maximum of 80&#x02013;90%. Only germlings that developed germ tubes of at least 50 &#x003bc;m length under these conditions were considered for quantification of chemotropism. Before adding test chemoattractant compounds, initial verification of the method was performed by double diffusion assays with glucose as positive and copper sulfate as negative chemotropic controls. From a tested range of 1&#x02013;50 mM glucose as starting concentration on the filter disc, 10 mM provided the strongest chemoattractive stimulus, whereas the initial application of 10 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was consistently chemorepellent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Chemotropic behavior can be quantitatively expressed as simple percentage of the total number of evaluated germlings or as chemotropic index (CI) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Turr&#x000e0; et al., 2015</xref>). The comparison of both scoring methods showed that the percentage expression does not clearly illustrate the difference between chemoattraction and chemorepulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

The underlying biological sense is most likely linked to the need for rapid colony establishment and symbiotic association with a plant partner. The relevance of non-self chemoattraction to other fungi might become more important at later developmental stages, when a proper colony network of mature hyphae has been established, that are capable of mass secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes.

The next logical step, therefore, was to evaluate morphological responses of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> hyphae in chemotropism assays using microcolonies. Microcolonies represent a transitional stage between the conidial germling network and the fully differentiated mature fungal colony.

Conidial germlings respond by either directly aligning the point of germ tube emergence toward or away from the chemotropic source or by redirecting tip growth accordingly. At this earliest developmental stage, chemoattraction was most pronounced toward self-signaling cues (6-PP, SnTa and CWTa), plant-derived signals (13(s)-HODE) and simple metabolites (glucose and glutamine). The preference for simple C- and N-sources is obvious as they are easily metabolized and thus promote rapid cell growth and development. The high sensitivity of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> germlings toward plant oxylipins correlates to recent reports showing that conidial germlings of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> are strongly attracted to 13(s)-HODE (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lombardi et al., 2018</xref>). This provides further evidence that chemotropic recruitment of mycoparasitic fungi to (stressed) plant roots may be part of a plant defense mechanism against fungal plant pathogens (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hermosa et al., 2013</xref>). The chemotropic self-preference of conidial germlings reflects the need for establishing an interconnected germling network by cell-cell fusion as key step of colony initiation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Read et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Roca et al., 2005</xref>). Together, both processes promote colony development and plant symbiosis and thus the rapid establishment of a fungal network in the rhizosphere.</p><p>Although conidial germlings responded differentially to culture supernatants of &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; (SnBc and SnRs) and &#x0201c;difficult&#x0201d; (SnFo and SnFg) prey fungi, the relative weakness of these responses compared to <italic>Trichoderma</italic> self-signaling and plant association suggests that the perception of potential prey fungi has no major relevance at this early developmental stage. Although the attachment of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> germlings to prey hyphae has been documented (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Inglis et al., 1999</xref>), there is no evidence so far that this physical interaction results in localized prey killing. Consequently, the low responsiveness of conidial germlings toward compounds from prey fungi suggests that they are still not able to perform a mycoparasitic attack. This makes biological sense considering that: (1) their small size limits the surface area of physical interaction with the fungal prey and also their ability to induce local nutrient limitation or space competition, (2) they lack secondary metabolites and sufficient metabolic activity to significantly modify the surrounding environment through content secretion, and (3) there is no evidence for conidial germlings of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species being able to kill prey hyphae through penetration and invasive growth. In contrast, all of these features have been widely observed in mature hyphae of mycoparasitic <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ben&#x000ed;tez et al., 2004</xref>). The symbiotic association of conidial germlings to plants, including endophytic colonization of root tissue, on the other hand, is well documented (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chac&#x000f3;n et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rom&#x000e3;o-Dumaresq et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Zhuang, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, 6-PP has been related to inhibition of fungal plant pathogens (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Serrano-Carre&#x000f3;n et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rubio et al., 2009</xref>) and promotion of plant and root growth (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Garnica-Vergara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The direct impact of 6-PP on <italic>Trichoderma</italic> morphology, however, has not been studied in detail. Studies so far have mostly focused on the metabolism and the physiological implications of 6-PP production (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Serrano-Carreon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rocha-Valadez et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, in terms of self-signaling, the role of 6-PP in cell fusion requires further evaluation. It was previously demonstrated that the ability to establish cell fusion is essential for efficient mycoparasitic activity of <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, using mutants lacking key components of the MAPK pheromone response pathway (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gruber and Zeilinger, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Notably, 6-PP is an oxygenated compound which was previously suggested to belong to the oxylipin family (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Serrano-Carreon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Howe and Schilmiller, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zeilinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Speckbacher et al., 2020a</xref>). This implies that independent of their origin, compounds of similar oxylipin-like structure may elicit strong chemotropic responses in <italic>Trichoderma</italic> &#x02013; and probably other fungal species &#x02013; and thus may constitute an interspecies signaling mechanism. In the context of mycoparasitism it is compelling to speculate that the plant oxylipin functions in recruiting the mycoparasite toward roots affected by fungal plant pathogens &#x02013; or already as precautionary measure &#x02013; while the fungal oxylipin (6-PP) induces morphological changes in <italic>Trichoderma</italic> required to launch a localized mycoparasitic attack. Our findings in the different developmental stages provide some support for this idea.</p><p>With the developmental transition from germ tube to hyphae, detection of prey fungi becomes relevant. This is most evident with the SnRs F30 fraction, where the chemotropic response of hyphae constituting the periphery of microcolonies toward prey-derived signals exceeded that of the other two fractions and the glucose control. Notably, the phenotype of this response did not result in obvious directional changes of tip growth of individual hyphae, but rather in an increase of the overall colony extension rate and hyphal density in the region closest to the chemoattractant source. This suggests that addition of nutrients available from prey-derived resources becomes biologically important for <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, even though it is not obligate under experimental conditions. In a nutrient poor natural habitat, however, this effect could be highly relevant, especially during the intermediate developmental stage of the microcolony which is still limited in size and cannot accumulate significant internal reserves. Therefore, besides searching for a potential prey in the vicinity, self-signaling compounds and plant oxylipins remain important chemotropic cues to advance the expansion of an interconnected symbiotic mycelium. Provision of nutrients from the plant host are likely to play an important role for the rapid transition to a fully developed mature colony.</p><p>The differentiation of morphological responses also points toward early changes of metabolic activity. SnTa and 13(s)-HODE, for instance, most notably promoted colony extension, whereas 6-PP primarily led to an increase in hyphal density. Similarly, SnRs F10 noticeably restricted colony extension, while SnRs F30 significantly increased hyphal density. The longer the exposure, the more pronounced these distinct features developed. The onset of mycoparasitic prey killing has already been associated with the induction of hyphal multipolarization (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, we speculate that the perception of prey-derived signals also triggers localized enlargement of available secretory and probably absorption surfaces to prepare the colony region closest to the signal source for imminent prey lysis and nutrient uptake, along with the required metabolic adaptations.</p><p>Full colony development generated mature hyphae with high sensitivity toward prey-derived signals. The SnRs F30 fraction induced a positive directional growth response that exceeded that of the glucose control and brought the colony periphery into close contact with the compound source. This marks the point at which fungal prey sensing overrides sensing of nutrients available in the growth medium. The fact that strong inductive cues can switch the morphological and metabolic program to an unnecessary behavior, because there are sufficient nutrients provided in the culture medium, is long known from (hemi-)cellulase induction in the related species <italic>T. reesei</italic> (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sternberg and Mandels, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kubicek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lichius et al., 2014</xref>) and has been shown at the level of altered gene expression in T. <italic>atroviride</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Atanasova et al., 2013</xref>). As mentioned before, in a nutrient poor soil environment it is essential for survival of the fungus to swiftly exploit a potential prey fungus as food source. The chemorepellent SnRs F10 fraction, on the other hand, restricted localized extension of the colony periphery, preventing its contact to the compound source. This is equally important in order to avoid investing valuable growth resources into nutritional &#x0201c;dead ends.&#x0201d; Together, these findings suggest that mature hyphae of the colony periphery are the primary sensors and signaling responders to prey-derived chemotropic cues, and consequently, are responsible for eliciting the mycoparasitic attack program only when appropriate. Initiating signals are likely to be passed to the sub-peripheral region, in which further morphogenetic and metabolic adaptations prepare subsequent prey lysis and nutrient uptake. However, in contrast to microcolonies, localized regions that drive colony edge expansion and others that increase secretion and absorption areas can no longer be discriminated at this mature developmental stage due to the high hyphal density.</p><p>The mass release of 6-PP at this stage would not only have an inhibitory antifungal action, but might work as a signal highly secreted in the regions of the colony in contact with the prey fungus, in order to promote hyphal growth and hyphal redirection as a mechanism of mycoparasitism. Additional secondary metabolites secreted by <italic>T. atroviride</italic> are likely involved during these events to support and refine the chemoattraction process and further mycoparasitism, indicated by consistently strong chemotropic responses to SnTa in all assays.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, each of the three assays described here evaluates different aspects of morphological responses to chemotropic compounds. Conidial germlings emerged as being ideal for chemotropic compound screening aimed at the rapid identification of strong chemoattractants and chemorepellents, as already reported by others (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Turr&#x000e0; et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lombardi et al., 2018</xref>). High CI values while evaluating complex chemotropic compounds, such as SnBc and SnRs, directly correlated with the ability of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> to efficiently parasitize the corresponding prey species in standard confrontation assays, identifying them as &#x0201c;easy preys,&#x0201d; while low CI values correlated with reduced mycoparasitic activity identifying &#x0201c;difficult preys,&#x0201d; such as <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Backed up by these correlations, the germling format produced results within a few hours instead of days required in macrocolony-level experiments. Furthermore, liquid germling assays performed in a micro-well format allow automated high content screening and are therefore increasingly relevant for industrial applications. Microcolonies represent an intermediate state that allows studying how molecular and cellular features of chemotropism adapt until the fungal colony reaches full maturity. Therefore, microcolonies, together with expansion-limited mature colonies, are essential for investigating the effects of chemotropic compounds on mature hyphae and on particular cellular processes that occur only in the context of an interconnected and differentiating fungal colony. Consequently, all three approaches are best used in combination to gain comprehensive insights on chemotropic signaling throughout filamentous fungal development. Our study also indicates that the concentrations of prey-derived chemoattractants are presumably too low in the complex SnBc, SnRs, and SnFo mixtures to induce morphological changes visible at the macroscopic and low-magnification microscopic levels. Simple molecular fractionation allowed detection of such responses and may provide deeper insights. More sophisticated molecular fractionation, concentration and purification methods of culture supernatants from prey fungi has thus a high potential to identify novel compounds able to induce chemotropic responses in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> or in other mycoparasitic species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DM-R, AL, and SZ conceived and directed this study and drafted the manuscript.
