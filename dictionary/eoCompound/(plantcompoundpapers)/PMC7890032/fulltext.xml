In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, vernalization induces epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor gene <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>). The repressive epigenetic mark trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 proteins (H3K27me3) is a critical contributor to the epigenetic silencing of <italic>FLC</italic>. Interestingly, the deposited H3K27me3 in the <italic>FLC</italic> locus can be erased by short-term high-temperature treatment. This is referred to as devernalization. In this study, we identified a novel chemical compound, 4-Isoxazolecarboxylic acid, 3,5-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-isoxazole carboxylic acid 1-methyl-2-oxoethyl ester named as DEVERNALIZER01 (DVR01), which induces devernalization in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, by an <italic>FLC</italic>-luciferase reporter-based high-throughput screening assay. DVR01 decreased the amount of H3K27me3 in the <italic>FLC</italic> locus in vernalized plants, resulting in the upregulation of <italic>FLC</italic> in the whole plant, including the vasculature and meristem, where FLC represses floral induction genes. We also showed that a 2-week treatment with DVR01 reverted plants with a vernalized status back to a fully non-vernalized status. Collectively, this study provides a novel structure of DVR01, which modulates devernalization via demethylation of H3K27me3 in the <italic>FLC</italic> locus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vernalization</kwd><kwd>devernalization</kwd><kwd>chemical screening</kwd><kwd><italic>FLC</italic></kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>H3K27me3</kwd><kwd>high-throughput screening</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flowering is a critical developmental process in the plant life cycle. Many annual plants flower after being exposed to warm conditions following prolonged winter coldness (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chouard, 1960</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Simpson and Dean, 2002</xref>). Acquiring the ability to undergo flower-bud formation induced by the cold is referred to as vernalization. In a model plant, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, flowering is promoted by both the vernalization pathway and autonomous pathway (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Sheldon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Simpson and Dean, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Michaels et al., 2005</xref>) and is inhibited by the activity of the zinc finger protein FRIGIDA (FRI) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Johanson et al., 2000</xref>). The vernalization pathway and autonomous pathway repress the expression levels of the floral repressor gene <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sheldon et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Simpson and Dean, 2002</xref>), and they counteract <italic>FRI</italic>, which activates the expression of <italic>FLC</italic> during the development of plants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Johanson et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>FLC</italic> acts upstream and represses the downstream floral inducers <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) and <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hepworth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Michaels et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Helliwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Searle et al., 2006</xref>). The vernalization pathway has a primary role in the regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> and triggers multiple repressive epigenetic modifications of the <italic>FLC</italic> locus, including the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and H3K9me2 in a stepwise fashion (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bastow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Whittaker and Dean, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the vernalized state can be canceled by short-term treatment at a high temperature. This is referred to as devernalization (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Purvis and Gregory, 1945</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Gregory and Purvis, 1948</xref>). In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the expression levels of <italic>FLC</italic> are partially recovered after devernalization (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rilleux et al., 2013</xref>). H3K27me3 is erased, and H3K4me3 very slightly accumulates at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus during devernalization (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bouch&#x000e9; et al., 2015</xref>). These observations suggest that the decrease in H3K27me3 is a key event during devernalization. However, the detailed mechanisms of heat-induced devernalization are largely unknown. In this study, by employing a chemical biology approach, we aimed to identify novel chemicals that can induce devernalization in a model plant, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p><p>Chemical biology, in which researchers use small compounds to understand biological processes, has expanded in recent years (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Nemhauser and Torii, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Hagihara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Halder and Russinova, 2019</xref>).

Chemical treatment can overcome genetic redundancy and transiently inhibit/activate protein function. To our knowledge, compounds regulating vernalization/devernalization have not yet been identified.</p><p>In this study, we performed screening by using the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM) chemical library, which is one of most broadly used libraries in the plant science field (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Toh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ono et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Uehara et al., 2019</xref>). We established a luciferase-based high-throughput screening system. From 3010 compounds, we identified a novel compound, DEVERNALIZER01 (DVR01), which activates the expression of the floral master repressor <italic>FLC</italic>, in vernalized plants. In addition, DVR01-treated vernalized plants exhibited a late flowering phenotype. These results suggested that DVR01 is an inducer of devernalization in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Finally, we showed that DVR01 decreased the accumulation levels of a repressive histone mark H3K27me3, at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus. This study provides a novel structure of devernalization-inducing compounds. DVR01 may be useful for the induction of devernalization instead of heat treatment in agriculture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Plant Materials and Growth Conditions</title><p>All <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seed stocks used in this study were in the Columbia (Col-0) background. <italic>flc-3</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>), <italic>FRI</italic><sup><italic>sf</italic>&#x02013;2</sup> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1993</xref>) and the reporter line <italic>FLC-GUS</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bastow et al., 2004</xref>) were reported previously. <italic>FLC:LUC</italic> was generated in this study. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds were grown on cotton balls with liquid Murashige Skoog (MS) medium or on 0.5% gellan gum with MS.

In addition, the expression level of <italic>FLC</italic> in DVR01-treated NV was comparable with that in NV plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). These results suggested that DVR01 induced the expression of <italic>FLC</italic> specifically in V plants. To find the optimum and effective concentration of DVR01, we treated V plants with DVR01 at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 25 &#x003bc;M DVR01 and identified that both 10 and 25 &#x003bc;M DVR01 induced the expression of <italic>FLC</italic> at maximum levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Tukey&#x02013;Kramer test).

DVR01 does not share the clear structural similarity with plant hormones or known H3K27me3 inhibitors. The activity of DVR01 was dose-dependent, but a high concentration of DVR01 retarded plant growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Instead of using a high concentration of DVR01, longer treatment periods of DVR01 permitted us to revert vernalized status back to the non-vernalized status almost perfectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Then, to understand structure-activity relationship of DVR01, we selected 30 structurally related compounds having 4-isoxazolecarboxylic acid moiety and tested them as with the same manner mentioned above. Unfortunately, none of the compounds induced <italic>FLC</italic> expression or morphological changes, as DVR01 did (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These results suggested that the whole structure of DVR01 may be privileged scaffold for its activity.</p><p>Our study also revealed that DVR01 could manipulate the histone modification H3K27me3 of the <italic>FLC</italic> locus by ChIP-qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with this, DVR01 did not upregulate the expression of <italic>FLC</italic> in NV plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), in which H3K27me3 was not deposited on the <italic>FLC</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Whittaker and Dean, 2017</xref>). How specific DVR01 affects the accumulation levels of H3K27me3 on the <italic>FLC</italic> locus? In addition to the upregulation of <italic>FLC</italic>, DVR01-treated plants showed the dwarfism and the pale green leaves. It might be caused by the loss of H3K27me3 on the locus of developmental regulators which inhibit the proper growth and maturation of chloroplasts when they are ectopically expressed at inappropriate tissues/cells. However, phenotypes of DVR01-treated plants were not identical with those of mutants of PRC2 complex (for example, <italic>CURLY LEAF</italic>). This result suggests that DVR01 has some specific activity against H3K27me3. Future research employing ChIP-seq may serve to elucidate in detail the mechanisms of DVR01 in the accumulation of H3K27me3.</p><p>In the future, further structure-activity relationship study of DVR01 may reveal a privileged scaffold to identify target molecule(s) of DVR01, which will provide more detailed mechanistic insights into DVR01 in plants. Additionally, our high-throughput screening system will identify other molecules that have devernalization-inducing activity without harmful effects on plant growth and clarify common structures for devernalization-inducing compounds.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS2"><title>Heat Versus Chemicals in Devernalization</title><p>It was reported in the 1940s that heat could cancel vernalized status in plants (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Purvis and Gregory, 1945</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Gregory and Purvis, 1948</xref>). In this study, we showed that a small molecule, DVR01, could also induce devernalization in vernalized seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. It remains an open question whether DVR01 functions by similar mechanisms to heat in devernalization. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it was reported that heat-treated V plants showed about 2- to 3-fold higher expression levels of <italic>FLC</italic> than V plants (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rilleux et al., 2013</xref>). Compared with this, DVR01 increased the expression levels of <italic>FLC</italic> to a similar extent against V plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, more detailed work, including omics analyses (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) and the combinational treatment of heat and chemicals, is required for the comparison of two kinds of devernalization.</p><p>In our study, we also found that heat treatment of seeds under dark conditions followed by cultivation under light conditions was required for the effective induction of devernalization (Shirakawa and Ito, unpublished data). In addition, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 1 week of heat treatment of seeds in the dark triggered a clear reduction in the germination ratio of seeds (Shirakawa and Ito, unpublished data). Moreover, DVR01 treatment was performed under light conditions during 1 week of cultivation after the vernalization of seeds. Therefore, it is not easy to directly compare heat-induced devernalization and DVR01-induced devernalization. However, we did not exclude the possibility that targets of heat treatment may overlap with those of DVR01 treatment because they reactivated the expression levels of <italic>FLC</italic> through a decrease in H3K27me3 at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rilleux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bouch&#x000e9; et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3"><title>Chemicals for the Modification of H3K27me3 in Plants</title><p>We showed that DVR01 could revert the epigenetic status determined by H3K27me3 on the <italic>FLC</italic> locus. How and when does DVR01 function in the regulation of H3K27me3? First scenario is that H3K27me3 spreading is established in seeds just after cold treatment and DVR01 might actively exclude the H3K27me3 through histone demethylases. However, it is still unclear when H3K27me3 spreading and stable silencing of <italic>FLC</italic> are established only upon exposure to warmth (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Whittaker and Dean, 2017</xref>). Second scenario is that H3K27me3 spreading is established during the development of seedling from the germination and DVR01 might inhibit the activity of PRC2 and/or activate histone demethylases to counteract PRC2. Recently, it was proposed that DNA replication may have an active role in propagating repressive histone marks (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Whittaker and Dean, 2017</xref>). Therefore, DVR01 might also inhibits the spreading of H3K27me3 by affecting DNA replication. In addition to H3K27me3, other histone modifications, including H3K36me3 and H3K4me3, are involved in the regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Whittaker and Dean, 2017</xref>). It remains open question whether DVR01 function in the accumulation/deposition of other histone modifications. Future work may attempt to identify targets of DVR01. Moreover, using chemical compounds to regulate devernalization will shed light on the detailed mechanism of epigenetically stable and heritable silencing of <italic>FLC</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MS, AS, and TI conceived this study and wrote the manuscript.
