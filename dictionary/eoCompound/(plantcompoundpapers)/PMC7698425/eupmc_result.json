    "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that progresses as age increases, and some of its major symptoms include tremor and postural and movement-related difficulties. To date, the treatment of PD remains a challenge because available drugs only treat the symptoms of the disease or possess serious side effects. In light of this, new treatment options are needed; hence, this study investigates the neuroprotective effects of an organic <i>Boophone haemanthoides</i> extract (BHE) and its bioactive compounds using an in vitro model of PD involving the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>) and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. A total of seven compounds were isolated from BHE, viz distichamine (<b>1</b>), 1α,3α-diacetylnerbowdine (<b>2</b>), hippadine (<b>3</b>), stigmast-4-ene-3,6-dione (<b>4</b>), cholest-4-en-3-one (<b>5</b>), tyrosol (<b>6</b>), and 3-hydroxy-1-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanone (<b>7</b>). Six compounds (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>) were investigated, and five showed neuroprotection alongside the BHE. This study gives insight into the bioactivity of the non-alkaloidal constituents of Amaryllidaceae, since the isolated compounds and the BHE showed improved cell viability, increased ATP generation in the cells as well as inhibition of MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings support the claim that the Amaryllidaceae plant family could be a potential reserve of bioactive compounds for the discovery of neuroprotective agents."
