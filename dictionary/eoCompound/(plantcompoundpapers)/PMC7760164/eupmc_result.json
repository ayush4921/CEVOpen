    "At present, the consumption of medical plants and functional foods is growing in the whole world. Rosebay willowherb (<i>Chamerion</i><i>angustifolium</i> (L.) Holub) is an important medicinal plant that has various pharmacological effects (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and others), can improve the state of health and well-being, and reduce the risk of various diseases. The aim of this work was to investigate volatile compounds, polyphenols, and antioxidant activity in rosebay willowherb leaves fermented for 24 and 48 h in solid state fermentation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for polyphenols and the spectrophotometric method for antioxidant activity determinations were used. To recognize and identify the leaves' fragrances, electronic nose (Alpha M.O.S) measurement technology was used. The results showed that the highest amounts of total polyphenols in dried matter were after 48 h aerobic solid state fermentation (SSF). Antioxidant activity was higher under 48 h SSF compared to the control. The most abundant flavoring compound groups were esters, terpenes, and aldehydes. In unfermented leaves, (z)-3-hexen-1-ol, acetate, hexyl acetate, and trans-hex-2-enyl acetate prevailed, characterized by fragrances of greenery, flowers, and fruits. The undesired esters group compounds, ethyl butyrate and butyl acetate, with pungent odor, were detected after 48 h anaerobic SSF."
