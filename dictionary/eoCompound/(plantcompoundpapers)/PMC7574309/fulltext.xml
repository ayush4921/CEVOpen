Nakai (Caoshanhu or Zhongjiefeng in Chinese medicine), belonging to the Chloranthaceae family, is an evergreen and traditional Chinese herb. <italic>S. glabra</italic> is widely distributed in Southern China and throughout Southeast Asia, mainly propagated by seeds or asexual methods (vegetative propagation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China has reported that the whole dry plant can be used as medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which contains abundant bioactive phytochemicals that not only contribute to protecting the plant against abiotic or biotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but also confer anti-oxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], anti-bacterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and anti-tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] properties. Previous studies of this species mainly focused on the isolation and extraction of its phytochemical components, which can be divided into six groups; organic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], coumarins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], terpenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], phenolic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and polysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among these components, flavonoids (e.g., quercitrin and kaempferol), coumarins (e.g., isofraxidin and scopoletin), and phenolic acids (e.g., rosmarinic acid) are closely associated with the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par72">To address the limited natural resources and meet consumer demand for safe and high-quality herbal products, China has initiated the project; &#x0201c;Good Agricultural Practice (GAP)&#x0201d; based on Chinese materia medica to enhance herb&#x02019;s resources and quality of cultivation. Currently, various studies are underway to overcome the issue and challenges faced by the herbal industry in China, to improve the quality and growth rate of the medicinal plants, such as stereoscopic cultivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or greenhouse cultivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consequently, the production of <italic>S. glabra</italic> is gradually shifting from conventional models to more advanced and sustainable farming practices, such as greenhouse cultivation<italic>.</italic> Greenhouse cultivation is considered as an effective agricultural method for growing large quantities of herbs that help to ensure the product quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">Environmental factors like water, light, temperature, and soil nutrients are key elements for the growth, development, and high quality of plants. Among these factors, it is necessary to emphasize the light factor because it is responsible for photosynthesis. Recently, the new-generation of Light Emission Diode (LED) technology has been applied to the greenhouse cultivation, providing favorable conditions for better plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Recently, a large number of studies have shown that specific LED lights have a significant effect on plant morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For instance, both the stem length and the leaf area of the tomato seedlings were significantly restricted at the higher BL/RL ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similarly, the hypocotyl length and leaf area were suppressed when cucumber seedlings were exposed to a high percentage of BL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, the different LED lights have shown a significant impact on the yields of the primary and species-specific secondary metabolites in plants. For instance, the BL significantly increased the yields of phenolic compounds in pea sprouts and basil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], flavonoids production in <italic>Cyclocarya paliurus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the amount of salidroside in callus culture of <italic>Rhodiola imbricata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the contrary, the red and far-red parts of the light spectrum induce the production of salicylic acid, which in turn increased the flavonoids accumulation in <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, it was found that yellow LED light had a beneficial effect on the concentrations of flavonoids in <italic>Epimedium pseudowushanense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Collectively, these studies have shown that flavonoids and other phenolic compounds originating from the phenylpropanoid pathway are accumulated in response to monochromatic LED light irradiation. The phenylpropanoid pathway is also responsible for the production of coumarins and lignins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">So far, many efforts have been made in elucidating the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and the finding have shown that this complex regulatory network is highly dependent on several factors, including enzymatic interactions, transcription factors (TFs), and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For TFs, MYB, bHLH, WDR, and the MBW complex (comprising of MYB, bHLH, and WD) are well conserved in plants and play a critical role in the regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">The purpose of this study was to experimentally compare the effects of WL, RL, and BL on <italic>S. glabra</italic> seedlings, and analyze the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling within these treatments. Besides, we also identified the functional genes and TFs (R2R3-MYB and bHLH) involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived compounds, as well as their expression patterns. The findings of this study will provide a better understanding of the effects of the different monochromatic LED lights on plant growth and secondary metabolites accumulation<italic>,</italic> and promote the quantity and quality of <italic>S. glabra</italic> cultivation by fine-tuning the optimum light condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of different light qualities on plant growth</title><p id="Par77">At the final harvest (day 60), the leaf area was significantly lower in the RL and BL treatments relative to the WL treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

Moreover, five genes related to rosmarinic acid biosynthesis were also found. The biosynthesis of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and most of the coumarins is derived from the core phenylpropanoid pathway, which is composed of three committed steps catalyzed by PAL, C4H, and 4CL enzymes. In this study, four <italic>PAL</italic> genes, four <italic>4CL</italic> genes, and one <italic>C4H</italic> gene were identified, of which the <italic>PAL</italic> gene (Cluster-22,883.50216), <italic>4CL</italic> gene (Cluster-22,883.47381), <italic>C4H</italic> gene (Cluster-22,883.50271) exhibited the highest expression levels compared to other members and showed higher expression levels in BY and RY. In the chlorogenic acid pathway, five genes encoding hydroxycinnamoyltransferases were found, and the expression level of gene (Cluster-22,883.48487) was much higher than other members. Besides, the gene (Cluster-22,883.48487) was highly expressed in BY. Furthermore, the gene (Cluster-22,883.21708) was only highly expressed in WG compared to other samples. The scopoletion biosynthesis is derived from a key precursor, namely ferulic CoA, produced by the enzymatic reactions of 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and 4CL on caffeic acid or by Caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) reacting with caffeoyl CoA.

Furthermore, five genes encoding 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent dioxygenases family proteins were characterized. Particularly, the F6&#x02019;H and S8H proteins belong to 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent dioxygenases family<italic>.</italic> The unrooted phylogenetic tree showed that the proteins encoded by these five genes were highly similar to F6&#x02019;H or S8H proteins (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Fig. S4).

In addition, among these genes, the gene (Cluster-22,883.51443) was highly expressed in WG, while another gene (Cluster-22,883.50772) had a significantly higher expression level in BY compared to other samples. The pathway to the product of rosmarinic acid consists of four consecutive enzyme reactions, starting from the precursor (tyrosine) and four enzymes tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (HPPR), rosmarinate synthase (RAS), and cytochrome P450 reductase (CYP). These were encoded by genes of Cluster-22,883.49301, Cluster-22,883.50853, and Cluster-22,883.50532, respectively. For the rosmarinate synthase (RAS) protein, the unrooted phylogenetic tree showed that RAS protein encoded by the gene (Cluster-22,883.29589) from <italic>S. glabra</italic> had the maximum similarity with RAS proteins from <italic>Juglans regia</italic> (XP_018826314.1) and <italic>Arachis ipaensis</italic> (XP_016205435.1) Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Fig. S5).

As the intermediate compound (dihydrokaempferol) was produced by the core enzymatic reactions, it would be flowed into several branches to generate anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, etc. The biosynthesis of kaempferol is catalyzed by flavonol synthase (FLS) enzyme on dihydrokaempferol, and FLS enzyme was encoded by the gene of Cluster-22,883.47725, the expression level of Cluster-22,883.47725 was significantly up-regulated in BY. Rutin also originates from the precursor of dihydrokaempferol through the enzymatic reactions by flavonoid 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase (F3&#x02019;H, encoded by Cluster-22,883.55303), FLS, UDPG flavonoid O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT, encoded by Cluster-22,883.49005), and rhamnosyl transferase (RT, encoded by Cluster-22,883.85233 or Cluster-22,883.49258). These genes (except Cluster-22,883.85233) had similar expression patterns that BL had the potential to induce higher expression levels. Interestingly, the gene of Cluster-22,883.85233 was mainly expressed in WG to synthesize rutin, but Cluster-22,883.49258 showed a higher expression level in WY and WJ. A series of enzymes, including dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR), anthocyanin synthase (ANS), and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), are responsible for the production of catechin and epicatechin, which eventually synthesize the product of proanthocyanidins (PAs).

SgMYB53 showed a high degree of functional similarity within the subgroup of S6 (AtMYB75/90/113/114), regulating the anthocyanin pigments pathway. Six R2R3-MYB proteins of SgMYB8/14/28/43/27/39 were in the same branch of the PAs biosynthetic pathway with AtMYB123 in subgroup 5.

The intermediate products of this reaction are dihydroflavonols (e.g., dihydrokaempferol or dihydroquercetin) which are subsequently used as substrates in other pathways involved in flavonol, anthocyanin, and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis regulated by downstream genes (designated late biosynthetic genes (LBGs), Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Our analysis of metabolism profiling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) revealed that the yield of some flavonols (e.g., quercitrin and kaempferol) were significantly higher in BY. They play an important role in pollen fertility, flower color, and UV-B protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In flavonol metabolism, FLS, belonging to 2-oxoglutarate-dependant dioxygenase, is a branch-point enzyme with multiple isoforms that catalyzes the conversion from dihydrokaempferol to products in a tissue-specific and inducible manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In this study, the gene (Cluster-22,883.47725) encoding FLS enzyme was identified. We noticed that flavonol production varied according to its relative expression in WY, RY, BY, and WG. Given the higher relative expression of <italic>FLS</italic> gene in the blue light treatment, the production of quercitrin, kaempferol, and rutin increased drastically in the leaves of <italic>S. glabra.</italic> Cinnamic acid and 4-coumaric acid are both upstream products of the first two steps of the core phenylpropanoid pathway, their production thus regulates the flow of precursors to all side branches in connection with the biosynthesis of lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Among these, lignins are synthesized by the conversion from 4-coumaric acid to caffeic acid catalyzed by C3H enzyme, and caffeic acid subsequently enters the lignins pathway. Meanwhile, the 4CL enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 4-coumaric acid to 4-coumaroyl CoA, a substrate assigned into the chlorogenic pathway in combination with shikimate or quinic acid, and it also proceeds to all classes of flavonoids production together with malonyl CoA. According to metabolite analysis, compared to WY, the initial products of cinnamic acid and 4-coumaric acid contents were increased by 1.47-fold and 1.08-fold in BY, respectively, but the bypass of caffeic acid production was inhibited in BY. Therefore, the increasing production of 4-coumaric acid led to more synthesis of 4-coumaroyl CoA, which in turn generated a higher production of flavonoids and chlorogenic (e.g., chalcone and naringenin). Generally, the accumulation of initial precursors is closely related to the expression level of biosynthetic genes, including <italic>PAL</italic>, <italic>C4H</italic>, and <italic>4CL</italic> genes that are the three consecutively committed enzymes in core phenylpropanoid pathway leading to varieties of flavonoids. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the <italic>PAL</italic> gene family (<italic>AtPAL1</italic>-<italic>AtPAL4</italic>), <italic>4CL</italic> gene family (<italic>At4CL1-At4CL4</italic>), and only one member of <italic>AtC4H</italic> have been identified and elaborated, some of which-like <italic>AtPAL1</italic> and <italic>AtPAL2 -</italic>are thought to have a major role in the phenylpropanoids pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], while <italic>At4CL3</italic> is thought to has a preference for the flavonoids biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The unrooted phylogenetic tree showed that the genes of Cluster-22,883.50216, Cluster-22,883.50271, and Cluster-22,883.47381 were highly homologous with <italic>PAL1/2</italic>, <italic>C4H</italic>, and <italic>4CL3</italic> genes, respectively, which exhibited the up-regulated expression levels under blue and red light condition, suggesting that these consecutive genes served to the flavonoids biosynthesis (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>: Fig. S9).</p><p id="Par93">Coumarins are widely distributed in numerous plant species and encompass multiple bioactivities in defense against phytopathogens, abiotic stress, oxidative stress, clinical diseases, and are the crucially specialized metabolites of <italic>S. glabra</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to the crucial enzymatic steps related to coumarins biosynthesis are still largely unknown in plants including <italic>S. glabra</italic>, this study investigated the current possible pathways and analyzed the genes encoding F6&#x02019;H, S8H, and scopoletin glucosyltransferase (SGTF) involved in the biosynthesis of scopoletin, fraxetin, and scopolin. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, except scopolin and scopoletin, the productions of fraxetin, esculin, isofraxidin, and fraxidin were most abundant in WG. Regrettably, the isofraxidin and fraxidin biosynthesis are not mapped in KEGG pathway database. The substantial accumulation of fraxetin was closely related to the higher expression level of the gene (Cluster-22,883.51443) encoding S8H in WG. Furthermore, the yield of scopolin was decreased in RY, BY, and WG because of the lower expression level of <italic>SGTF</italic> gene (Cluster-22,883.45883), which catalyzes scopolin formation.

Under the BL condition, the reduced production of scopoletin might be caused by the less yields of its both precursors of ferulic acid and esculetin. Similar to scopoletin, the biosynthetic pathway of esculetin originated from umbelliferone or caffeic acid on earth that is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Some R2R3-MYB and bHLH TFs regulate the expression levels of EBGs and LBGs</title><p id="Par94">To date, there have been various studies on TFs of R2R3-MYB, bHLH, WDR, and MBW complexes as regulators of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. These studies highlighted the importance of these TFs and MBW complexes in the regulation of flavonoids biosynthesis in plant tissues and the seed coat. The complete flavonoids pathway relies on the coordinated expression of EBGs and LBGs. Moreover, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the subclasses (S4, S5, S6, and S7) of R2R3-MYB proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the subgroups (S8, S7, and S15) of bHLH proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and several WD40 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] (e.g., TTG1) have been proved to be involved in the regulation of the expression of EBGs and LBGs in the flavonoids biosynthesis in a certain way. In flavonol biosynthesis, the EBG genes are regulated by members of AtMYB11/12/111 proteins from subgroup 7, and consequently control the development of flavonol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. SgMYB38 was assigned to subgroup 7 and was likely to control the expression level of <italic>CHS</italic>, <italic>CHI</italic>, <italic>F3H</italic>, <italic>F3&#x02019;H</italic>, and <italic>FLS</italic> genes. Compared to WY and RY, <italic>SgMYB38</italic> gene was significantly up-regulated in BY, which directly increased the expression levels of EBGs and promoted the accumulation of some flavonol compounds. In addition, the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-seq data of these EBGs have demonstrated it. The accumulation of PAs is mainly distributed in the innermost cell layer of the seed coat regulated by more than four MBW complexes, i.e., AtMYB123 (TT2)-TT8/GL3/EGL3-TTG1, and AtMYB5-TT8-TTG1, which target the different LBGs, such as <italic>ANS (LDOX)</italic>, <italic>DFR</italic>, and <italic>UFGT</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The MBW complexes of AtMYB75/90/113/114-TT8/GL3/EGL3-TTG1 also determine anthocyanin biosynthesis via the regulation of the spatial and temporal expression of LBGs in vegetative tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Based on these results, it is reasonable to assume that MBW complexes target gene specificity. Therefore, in this study, we screened and identified some genes encoding R2R3-MYB, bHLH and WDR TFs. Among these TFs, SgMYB8/14/27/28/43/39 might encode the homologous protein TT2 belonging to subgroup 5 of R2R3-MYB proteins, while the protein encoded by <italic>SgMYB53</italic> showed a high degree of functional similarity within members in subgroup 6 of R2R3-MYB proteins. SgbHLH12/13 were predicted to encode TT8/GL3/EGL3/MYC1 belonging to subgroup 7 of bHLH proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, while the gene of Cluster-22,883.52183 was largely thought to encode TTG1. It is reasonable to assume that the assembled MBW complexes of SgMYB8/14/27/28/43/39-SgbHLH12/13-TTG1 might be involved in the synthesis of PAs, while SgMYB53-SgbHLH12/13-TTG1 were likely to be associated with anthocyanins biosynthesis. In this study, we just identified these genes encoding TFs and proposed potential MBW complexes in <italic>S. glabra</italic> according to the studied model plants. However, some aspects of the flavonoid biosynthesis still remain unknown: for instance, due to the unavailable genomic data for <italic>S. glabra</italic>, the copy numbers of important genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway have not yet been identified.
