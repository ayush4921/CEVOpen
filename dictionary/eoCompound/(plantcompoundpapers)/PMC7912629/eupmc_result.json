    "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of mortality in many low-income and middle-income countries, including Indonesia, with elevated blood cholesterol level being one of significant risk factors for this condition. The problem should be addressed by combining healthy lifestyle and diet, where functional foods having a cholesterol-lowering activity could play a significant role. A group of compounds that had been proven to show cholesterol-lowering ability are plant sterols. To develop more suitable functional foods that could substantially contribute to hypercholesterolemia prevention in Indonesian population, up-to-date data about plant sterols dietary intake are required, and were not available until this research was done. This study aimed to estimate daily plant sterols intake and to determine the consumption pattern of foods containing plant sterols in rural and urban area of Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. The research was conducted with a cross-sectional design, with 200 respondents. The study revealed that the level of plant sterols intake in Bogor reached on average 229.76 mg/day and was not significantly different between urban and rural area. Cereals, vegetables, and fruit products were the main food sources of plant sterols in both areas. In addition, a list of several surveyed food items possible to be enriched with plant sterols was developed within the study. These results provide baseline data to develop functional foods fortified with plant sterols suitable for the Indonesian needs and taste. However, further studies are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of introducing such phytosterol-enriched products into a habitual diet, especially considering possible long-term side effects of plant sterol treatment."
