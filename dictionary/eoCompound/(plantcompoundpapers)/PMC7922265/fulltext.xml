The present study evaluated different aspects of resistance of six maize cultivars, cropped by farmers in Kenya, to FAW larvae feeding under laboratory and field conditions. We assessed the arrestment and feeding of FAW neonate larvae in no-choice and choice experiments, development of larvae-pupae, food assimilation under laboratory conditions and plant damage in a field experiment. We did not find complete resistance to FAW feeding in the evaluated maize cultivars, but we detected differences in acceptance and preference when FAW larvae were given a choice between certain cultivars. Moreover, the smallest pupal weight and the lowest growth index were found on &#x02019;SC Duma 43&#x02032; leaves, which suggests an effect of antibiosis of this maize hybrid against FAW larvae. In contrast, the highest growth index was recorded on &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019; and the greatest pupal weight was found on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019;. The density of trichomes on the leaves of these maize cultivars seems not to be directly related to the preference of neonates for feeding. Plant damage scores were not statistically different between cultivars in the field neither under natural nor artificial infestation. However, plant damage scores in &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; tended to be lower in the two last samplings of the season compared to the two initial samplings under artificial infestation.

Introduction</title><p>Fall armyworm (FAW) <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous insect pest that had been confined to the tropical and subtropical Americas until it was reported first in Nigeria, Benin, Togo, and Sao Tome and Principe in 2016 [<xref rid="B1-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. FAW invasion has become the biggest threat to maize production in sub-Saharan Africa due to its rapid spread to almost all countries in the region and associated crop damage [<xref rid="B2-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The pest has further spread, during the last two years to India [<xref rid="B3-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Yemen, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, China [<xref rid="B4-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Vietnam, Egypt, the Republic of Korea, and Japan [<xref rid="B7-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the most recent invasions has been detected in Australia, Mauritania, and East Timor [<xref rid="B8-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The impact of FAW on maize yield in Africa has been severe [<xref rid="B9-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Based on farmers&#x02019; perceptions, some authors have estimated the loss of maize yields between 22 and 67% in Ghana and Zambia [<xref rid="B2-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and between 32% and 47% in Ethiopia and Kenya [<xref rid="B10-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; resulting in millions of US dollars in losses. Baudron et al. have estimated that, with an incidence of FAW ranging between 32 and 48%, the impact of FAW on maize yield is around 11.5% [<xref rid="B9-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Host plant resistance is an important component of integrated pest management [<xref rid="B11-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], thus finding any maize cultivars that are FAW-resistant could be a key aspect for developing sustainable strategies to control this voracious insect and minimize yield losses in a context of low input agriculture in developing countries [<xref rid="B12-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Screening for FAW resistant maize germplasm has been carried out exhaustively in the Americas since the 1950s [<xref rid="B13-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; however, maize germplasm locally adapted to the new geographical distribution of FAW in Africa still requires investigation. Currently, several maize cultivars from CIMMYT collections have been assessed for resistance to FAW in Kenya [<xref rid="B14-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, maize landraces that are the most preferred and are grown by smallholder farmers in Kenya have not been evaluated for resistance to FAW. These open pollinated varieties (OPVs) have been grown by smallholder farmers over generations because they are perceived to be drought and pest tolerant, low costs of acquiring seeds, and give reasonable yields under marginal environmental conditions without application of fertilizers and pesticides [<xref rid="B15-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, studies have reported that they are less affected by the parasitic striga weed, <italic>Striga hermonthica</italic> Benth. (Orobanchaceae) [<xref rid="B16-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and have superior defense against cereal stemborers [<xref rid="B17-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our study evaluates a number of these OPVs for resistance to feeding by FAW larvae comparing to locally grown hybrids. We hypothesized that FAW larval arrestment (i.e., behavior which makes the insect restrict its movement to a small area), feeding, development and plant damage vary depending on maize cultivar, measures that can be used as a proxy for resistance to FAW. We used laboratory experiments to assess the arrestment, feeding, development and food assimilation of FAW larvae and a field experiment to estimate FAW damage to maize plants. We also measured the density of trichomes on maize leaves as a possible explanation of any variation observed in acceptance and preference by FAW larvae. We discuss our findings in terms of host-plant selection behavior (selection, acceptance, and preference), features of direct resistance of maize cultivars to larvae feeding and the nutritional value of maize cultivars for larvae. The integration of maize resistance with other strategies of sustainable FAW management are also discussed within updated approaches of host-plant resistance [<xref rid="B18-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-10-00392"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The six maize cultivars in the current study, selected on the basis of being preferred by farmers in the study area, were rigorously evaluated for several aspects of resistance to FAW feeding. None of the cultivars were found to be fully resistant to FAW larvae feeding but some differences in acceptance and preference were observed under choice test conditions. Furthermore, differences in plant suitability of maize leaves of different cultivars were found to impact FAW larval weight and pupal weight. Growth rate on the most favourable cultivars, &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019;, were almost double the growth rate on the least favourable cultivar &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032;. However, there were no differences between cultivars in leaf weight consumed by larvae under laboratory conditions and in the field experiment no differences were found in plant damage scores.</p><p>In Petri-dish experiments, neonate larvae of FAW fed less on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; compared to &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; and &#x02018;WH507&#x02032; plants after 24 h under no choice conditions; however, no differences were detected between the cultivars after 48 h of experimentation. From the insect point of view, this might be interpreted as subtle differences perceived by the neonate larvae during the test-biting phase; however, these differences may be neglected by the insect as time passes and the need of food increases [<xref rid="B20-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In two-choice conditions, FAW neonate larvae arrested less on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; compared to the hybrid &#x02018;WH507&#x02032; in a period of 24 h, and neonates fed less on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; compared to &#x02018;WH507&#x02032; after 24 h and 48 h of experimentation. In the choice setups, selection behavior takes place, and we assume that sequential contact-testing of alternative cultivars occurs before a final selection is made by the insect. The results of the two-choice experiment indicate that FAW neonate larvae avoid feeding on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; leaf cuts and prefer to feed on &#x02018;WH507&#x02032; leaf cuts. There was also a consistent significant preference for settling on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; leaf cuts over &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; which was observed both at 24 and 48 h. Since neonates used in our experiments were one-day old, we argue that discrimination is high in these larvae [<xref rid="B20-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We discuss possible reasons for these choices below. In our experimental context, acceptance occurs when there is sustained feeding on a leaf cut or plant; meanwhile, preference occurs when an insect, having a choice, consistently feeds more on one of the alternative plant cultivars. The process of host-plant selection and acceptance by an insect involves several behavioral steps and it is a result of the integration of internal physiological state parameters of the insect [<xref rid="B21-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Initially, when an insect touches a plant, it evaluates physical and chemical plant traits which are often used for an initial behavioral decision, either to proceed or to reject the plant. In the evaluation phase insect restrict their movement to a smaller area, a behavior that is called arrestment. As a next step, the insect may damage the plant by test-biting, when the sensory information is judged positively by its nervous system, the final decision is taken, the host-plant is accepted and food intake starts [<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Physical features of plant organs or tissues and secondary toxic metabolites can influence host-plant selection behavior and are part of the array of direct defenses of the plant; for example, trichomes, wax crystal structures, leaf thickness and toughness, and silica content may cause avoidance behavior in insects [<xref rid="B19-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In maize, several characteristics have been reported to confer resistance to maize cultivars against FAW damage. For example, it was found that cuticular lipids in maize leaves play a role in FAW larvae performance. When FAW larvae fed on leaves from which cuticular lipids had been removed, weighed more and developed faster than when they fed on leaves with cuticular lipids [<xref rid="B23-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In another study, FAW neonate larvae traveled longer distances and crawled faster on upper leaves, which have a smooth appearance, than on lower leaves, which had a dense array of wax crystals [<xref rid="B24-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The presence of trichomes in maize leaves, in our study, did not appear to influence acceptance or preference, since &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; leaves have a similar density of trichomes to the cultivar &#x02018;WH507&#x02032;, but are less preferred for feeding. In contrast, trichomes play a defensive role in some rice cultivars against chewing insects [<xref rid="B25-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that other physical features such as structure of cuticular compounds, leaf toughness and/or thickness may have been involved in the reduced preference for feeding on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; leaf cuts. Another possibility is that antifeedant or repellent chemicals were present on the latter cultivar. On the other hand, lipophilic constituents of leaf surfaces (alkenes, esters, and fatty acids) and secondary plant metabolites are known to promote test-biting and subsequent feeding in many insects [<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, the noctuid <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> Boisduval (Noctuidae), was found to be attracted to nine plant volatiles, proving that plant chemicals play a role in caterpillar searching behavior of host-plants [<xref rid="B26-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. On the other hand, polyphagous insects species may also be stimulated by the presence of flavonoids in their food [<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since acceptance of a host-plant is determined by the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory compounds, a thorough analysis of the compounds in the leaves tissues of these cultivars is needed to unravel their role in host-plant selection and preference.</p><p>Our findings regarding food assimilation of tested maize cultivars by third instar larvae were not statistically different. However, there was a trend with larvae consuming relatively more leaf weight of &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; plants compared to &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019;, &#x02018;Pioneer 30G19&#x02032;, &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019; and &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032;. The results also showed relatively less food assimilation when larvae fed on &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; leaves compared to &#x02018;Pioneer 30G19&#x02032;, &#x02018;WH507&#x02032; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019; leaves. The higher consumption of &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; leaves compared to the other four cultivars suggests that there may be differences in leaf composition. A previous study has demonstrated, for example, that the contents of hemicellulose and cellulose are higher in the whorls of FAW resistant maize plants compared with susceptible plants [<xref rid="B27-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another study has shown the role of leaf toughness in maize resistance to the European corn-borer <italic>Ostrinia nubilalis</italic> H&#x000fc;bner (Crambidae), finding that this character seems to be an important defense mechanism in maize across diverse groups of germplasm [<xref rid="B28-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, several factors unrelated to preference influence how much an insect eats; for example, larvae may consume more of a plant low in protein or high in protein inhibitors to compensate for its lower nutritional value [<xref rid="B21-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Through experiments investigating insect weight gain, we show that FAW larvae (at day nine) gained more weight on &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019; leaves compared to the same instars developed on &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; leaves. The same pattern was also observed for the pupal weight at day fifteen. Thus, we argue that &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; leaves are detrimental for FAW larvae development; meanwhile, &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019; are optimal. Interestingly, larval weight was not different between cultivars at day twelve. This may be explained by the fact that the larvae that grew slower could have attained the same weight of larvae entering the prepupal stage at day twelve. Furthermore, we found differences in growth index between &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019; that are derived from differences in mortality (see <xref rid="plants-10-00392-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Looking together at larval mortality (50%) and low larval-pupal weight when larvae fed &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; leaves, it is clear why growth index for &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; was the lowest (See <xref rid="plants-10-00392-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that antibiosis against FAW larvae exist in the cultivar &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032;. Further investigations need to focus on analyzing factors affecting growth of FAW immature instars such as protein&#x02013;carbon ratios, allelochemicals, and protease inhibitors [<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, several investigations have demonstrated the effects of certain maize cultivars on larvae weight [<xref rid="B30-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], development time and mortality of FAW larvae [<xref rid="B32-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] when used as food. It has been shown that, for example, certain types of flavones-C-glycosides and chlorogenic acid are responsible for antibiosis activity in maize plants [<xref rid="B11-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other mechanisms of defense, such as maize defense genes [<xref rid="B34-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or toxic proteins [<xref rid="B35-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] are triggered by FAW feeding. Characters of plants&#x02019; cultivars that confer them partial resistance to insects often have effects on their biology and further success [<xref rid="B19-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B36-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In terms of insect&#x02013;plant interactions, the field experiment reflects two different scenarios. In artificially infested plots, FAW larvae were forced to feed on a predetermined cultivar (a no-choice situation) and maize plants were challenged to defend themselves against FAW feeding. Meanwhile, in naturally infested plots, the preference of larvae for feeding (a choice situation) takes place. Indeed, it has been proposed in a model that FAW female moths oviposit indiscriminately on different hosts but neonate larvae leave the natal hosts plants by ballooning, search and colonize suitable hosts [<xref rid="B37-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although we measured plant damage by FAW larvae in the field set-up with a subjective scale, our method is a standard procedure that has been used in FAW resistance research programs for many years [<xref rid="B38-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We did not find any significant differences in plant damage scores between maize cultivars under artificial or natural infestation. However, under artificial infestation, which reflects high insect pest pressure, the landraces &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; had lower damage scores later in the season which may suggest the potential for compensatory regrowth of these maize cultivars. Indeed, maize plants can display tolerance in response to insect attack [<xref rid="B39-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In contrast, these cultivars under natural infestation, showed a slight increase in plant damage scores at the end of the season, which indicate that these cultivars may have borne successive colonization beyond the second sampling of the season. The cultivars &#x02018;WH507&#x02032;, &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019;, and &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; showed stable plant damage scores across the three last samplings of the season under natural infestation. Furthermore, plant resistance evaluations in the field become complex due to the interaction of the plant with several other factors, such as location, soil type, plot area, agroecological conditions, weeding frequency, use of hedgerows, intercrops, manure, nitrogen, and year [<xref rid="B9-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B40-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As Ni and his colleagues recommended, environmental conditions and predatory insects abundance should be taken into account when assessing the resistance of maize cultivars to FAW and other insects in the field [<xref rid="B40-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Rove beetles, earwigs and spiders are important predatory insects of FAW [<xref rid="B41-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; however, the sampling effort of predatory arthropods in our study was not big enough to draw conclusions on this aspect (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00392">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>). Future studies should also investigate the role of indirect defense against FAW in these maize cultivars. Indeed, several studies have shown that certain maize cultivars emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which attract parasitoids of their insect pests, after plant damage [<xref rid="B43-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], insect eggs oviposition [<xref rid="B17-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or even volatiles are produced by plants as constitutive volatiles [<xref rid="B44-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to defend themselves. In maize plants VOCs are not only important for parasitoids&#x02019; attraction but also for predatory insects attraction [<xref rid="B45-plants-10-00392" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-10-00392"><title>4.

A leaf cut of 7 cm length was cut off the plant and weighed using a Mettler Toledo PM 460 scale (Mettler Instruments; Greiffensee, Switzerland). Leaf cuts were obtained from new fully open leaves of maize plants of the six cultivars and placed inside glass vials (2.8 cm &#x000d7; 7.3 cm). Ten replicates were performed per cultivar. Glass vials contained a piece of moisten cotton in the bottom. The initial weight of the larvae (W1) was recorded before introducing them into the glass vial, then vials were plugged with cotton and kept in dark conditions.

Conclusions</title><p>Taken together these findings suggest that there is no complete resistance to FAW larval feeding in the evaluated maize cultivars. However, there are differences in acceptance and preference between certain maize cultivars. For example, when larvae are given a choice between the landrace &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and the hybrid &#x02018;WH507&#x02032; they preferred to feed on the latter. The density of trichomes on maize leaves seems not to be associated with preferences of neonate larvae for feeding. The greatest pupal weight was recorded on the leaves of the landraces &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019;; meanwhile, the smallest pupal weight was found on the hybrid &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032;. Moreover, the lowest growth index was observed on &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032;. Therefore, our findings suggest that &#x02018;SC Duma 43&#x02032; leaves have antibiosis effect against FAW larvae growth. In contrast, the highest growth index was calculated on &#x02018;Rachar&#x02019;, which indicates this cultivar is more suitable for FAW growth. Plant damage scores were statistically not different between cultivars in the field neither under natural nor artificial infestation. Moreover, scores tended to be lower in &#x02018;Nyamula&#x02019; and &#x02018;Jowi&#x02019; at the end of the season under artificial infestation. For successful pest management in low input agriculture, it is desirable to combine more than one measure to keep plant damage at low levels. Therefore, it is necessary to study further how other FAW control options, such as biological control and habitat management could be integrated with maize cultivars with partial resistance to FAW. This study contributes to identify cultivars with partial resistance to FAW that can be used with other management options in Africa.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thankful for the professional contribution of Bach.
