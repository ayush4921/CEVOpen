    "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of gold and silver nanoparticles on the activity of antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POX), and catalase (CAT)), the free radical scavenging capacity, and the total polyphenol capacity of lavender (<i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> Mill.) cultivar \"Munstead\" propagated in vitro. In the experiment, fragments of lavender plants were cultivated in vitro on medium with the addition of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mg∙dm<sup>-3</sup> of AgNPs or AuNPs (particle sizes 24.2 ± 2.4 and 27.5 ± 4.8 nm, respectively). It was found that the nanoparticles increase the activity of the antioxidant enzymes APX and SOD; however, the reaction depends on the NP concentration. The highest APX activity is found in plants propagated on media with 2 and 5 mg∙dm<sup>-3</sup> of AgNPs. AuNPs significantly increase the APX activity when added to media with a concentration of 10 mg∙dm<sup>-3</sup>. The highest SOD activity is recorded at 2 and 5 mg∙dm<sup>-3</sup> AgNP and AuNP concentrations. The addition of higher concentrations of nanoparticles to culture media results in a decrease in the APX and SOD activity. The addition of AuNPs to culture media at concentrations from 2 to 50 mg∙dm<sup>-3</sup> increases the POX activity in comparison to its activity when AgNPs are added to the culture media. No significant influence of NPs on the increase in CAT activity was demonstrated. AgNPs and AuNPs increased the free radical scavenging capacity (ABTS<sup>•+</sup>). The addition of NPs at concentrations of 2 and 5 mg∙dm<sup>-3</sup> increased the production of polyphenols; however, in lower concentrations it decreased their content in lavender tissues."
