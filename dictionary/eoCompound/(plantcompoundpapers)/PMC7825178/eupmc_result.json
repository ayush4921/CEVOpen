    "<h4>Background</h4>Glycoalkaloids are bioactive compounds that contribute to the defence response of plants against herbivore attack and during pathogenesis. Solanaceous plants, including cultivated and wild potato species, are sources of steroidal glycoalkaloids. Solanum plants differ in the content and composition of glycoalkaloids in organs. In wild and cultivated potato species, more than 50 steroidal glycoalkaloids were recognized. Steroidal glycoalkaloids are recognized as potential allelopathic/phytotoxic compounds that may modify the growth of target plants. There are limited data on the impact of the composition of glycoalkaloids on their phytotoxic potential.<h4>Results</h4>The presence of α-solasonine and α-solamargine in potato leaf extracts corresponded to the high phytotoxic potential of the extracts. Among the differentially expressed genes between potato leaf bulks with high and low phytotoxic potential, the most upregulated transcripts in sample of high phytotoxic potential were anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase-like and subtilisin-like protease SBT1.7-transcript variant X2. The most downregulated genes were carbonic anhydrase chloroplastic-like and miraculin-like. An analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed that the most abundant group of proteins were those related to stress and defence, including glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase acidic isoform, whose expression level was 47.96× higher in potato leaf extract with low phytotoxic.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The phytotoxic potential of potato leaf extract possessing low glycoalkaloid content is determined by the specific composition of these compounds in leaf extract, where α-solasonine and α-solamargine may play significant roles. Differentially expressed gene and protein profiles did not correspond to the glycoalkaloid biosynthesis pathway in the expression of phytotoxic potential. We cannot exclude the possibility that the phytotoxic potential is influenced by other compounds that act antagonistically or may diminish the glycoalkaloids effect."
