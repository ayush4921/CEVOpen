    "Endophytic microbes are microorganisms that colonize the intracellular spaces within the plant tissues without exerting any adverse or pathological effects. Currently, the world population is facing devastating chronic diseases that affect humans. The resistance of pathogens to commercial antibiotics is increasing, thus limiting the therapeutic potential and effectiveness of antibiotics. Consequently, the need to search for novel, affordable and nontoxic natural bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi in developing new drugs with multifunction mechanisms to meet human needs is essential. Fungal endophytes produce invaluable bioactive metabolic compounds beneficial to humans with antimicrobial, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor properties, etc. Some of these bioactive compounds include pestacin, taxol, camptothecin, ergoflavin, podophyllotoxin, benzopyran, isopestacin, phloroglucinol, tetrahydroxy-1-methylxanthone, salidroside, borneol, dibenzofurane, methyl peniphenone, lipopeptide, peniphenone etc. Despite the aforementioned importance of endophytic fungal metabolites, less information is available on their exploration and pharmacological importance. Therefore, in this review, we shall elucidate the fungal bioactive metabolites from medicinal plants and their pharmacological potential."
