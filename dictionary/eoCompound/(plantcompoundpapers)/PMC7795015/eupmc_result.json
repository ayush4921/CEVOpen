    "C and N are the most important essential elements constituting organic compounds in plants. The shoots and roots depend on each other by exchanging C and N through the xylem and phloem transport systems. Complex mechanisms regulate C and N metabolism to optimize plant growth, agricultural crop production, and maintenance of the agroecosystem. In this paper, we cover the recent advances in understanding C and N metabolism, regulation, and transport in plants, as well as their underlying molecular mechanisms. Special emphasis is given to the mechanisms of starch metabolism in plastids and the changes in responses to environmental stress that were previously overlooked, since these changes provide an essential store of C that fuels plant metabolism and growth. We present general insights into the system biology approaches that have expanded our understanding of core biological questions related to C and N metabolism. Finally, this review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the trade-off concept that links C and N status to the plant's response to microorganisms."
