    "<h4>Context</h4><i>Schumanniophyton magnificum</i> Harms (Rubiaceae) is used traditionally in Nigeria for the treatment of snake bites. Snake venom contains phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) which plays a key role in causing inflammation and pain.<h4>Objective</h4>To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the methanol extract of <i>Schumanniophyton magnificum</i> (MESM) leaves through the inhibition of PLA<sub>2</sub> and investigate the compounds responsible for the effect.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>PLA<sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of MESM was assessed at concentrations of 0.1-0.8 mg/mL using human red blood cells as substrate. Prednisolone was used as the standard control. MESM was subsequently partitioned using <i>n</i>-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and aqueous-methanol (90:10 v/v), after which PLA<sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of the partitions was determined. The best partition was subjected to chromatographic techniques and the fractions obtained were assessed for PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition at 0.4 mg/mL. Compounds in the most active fraction were determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy <b>(</b>FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).<h4>Results</h4>MESM significantly inhibited PLA<sub>2</sub> activity at 0.8 mg/mL (44.253%) compared to prednisolone (35.207%). <i>n</i>-Hexane partition (SMP1) proved more active with inhibition of 55.870% observed at 0.1 mg/mL. Fraction 1 (SMF1) showed the highest PLA<sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of 58.117%. FTIR studies revealed the presence of some functional groups in SMF1, and GC-MS confirmed the presence of 9 compounds which are first reported in this plant. Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester was identified as the major compound (24.906%).<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>The PLA<sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of MESM suggests that its compounds may be explored further in monitoring anti-inflammatory genes affected by the venoms."
