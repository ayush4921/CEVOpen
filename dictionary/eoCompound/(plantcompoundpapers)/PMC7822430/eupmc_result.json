    "This paper explains a thorough exergy analysis of the most important reactions in soil-plant interactions. Soil, which is a prime mover of gases, metals, structural crystals, and electrolytes, constantly resembles an electric field of charge and discharge. The second law of thermodynamics reflects the deterioration of resources through the destruction of exergy. In this study, we developed a new method to assess the exergy of soil and plant formation processes. Depending on the types of soil, one may assess the efficiency and degradation of resources by incorporating or using biomass storage. According to the results of this study, during different processes from the mineralization process to nutrient uptake by the plant, about 62.5% of the input exergy will be destroyed because of the soil solution reactions. Most of the exergy destruction occurs in the biota-atmosphere subsystem, especially in the photosynthesis reaction, due to its low efficiency (about 15%). Humus and protonation reactions, with 14% and 13% exergy destruction, respectively, are the most exergy destroying reactions. Respiratory, weathering, and reverse weathering reactions account for the lowest percentage of exergy destruction and less than one percent of total exergy destruction in the soil system. The total exergy yield of the soil system is estimated at about 37.45%."
