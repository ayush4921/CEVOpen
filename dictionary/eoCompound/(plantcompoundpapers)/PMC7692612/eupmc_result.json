    "<i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L. is a Mediterranean shrub known for its health promoting effects attributed to a large extent to polyphenols accumulated in all parts of the plant. Microwave-assisted extraction is a green extraction technique enabling fast and effective isolation of plant polyphenols. Therefore, the aim of this research was to optimize the microwave-assisted extraction of polyphenols from <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L. leaves and fruit in terms of temperature, extraction time and microwave power and to evaluate their polyphenolic profile by UPLC/ESI-MS<sup>2</sup> and antioxidant capacity by ORAC assay. Optimal extraction conditions for leaf polyphenols were 69 °C, 512 W and 12 min, while for fruit were slightly more intensive-75 °C, 602 W and 15 min. Obtained total phenolic content in leaves and fruit was similar to that obtained after 30 min of the heat-reflux method. The polyphenolic profile of extracts included 34 compounds, with myricetin glycosides being the most abundant compounds among flavonoids in <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L. leaves and fruit and gallic acid and its derivates among the phenolic acids. ORAC assay showed higher antioxidant capacity for <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L. leaves extract than for fruit, which is in correlation with their respective phenolic content."
