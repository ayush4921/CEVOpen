    "Ionic liquids (ILs) have sparked much interest as alternative solvents for plant materials as they provide distinctive properties. Therefore, in this study, the capacity of ILs to extract oxypeucedanin hydrate and byakangelicin from the roots of <i>Angelica dahurica</i> (<i>A. dahurica</i>) was investigated. The back-extraction method was examined to recover target components from the IL solution as well. Herein, [Bmim]Tf<sub>2</sub>N demonstrated outstanding performance for extracting oxypeucedanin hydrate and byakangelicin. Moreover, factors including solvent/solid ratio, extraction temperature and time were investigated and optimized using a statistical approach. Under optimum extraction conditions (solvent/solid ratio 8:1, temperature 60 Â°C and time 180 min), the yields of oxypeucedanin hydrate and byakangelicin were 98.06% and 99.52%, respectively. In addition, 0.01 N HCl showed the most significant ability to back-extract target components from the [Bmim]Tf<sub>2</sub>N solution. The total content of both oxypeucedanin hydrate (36.99%) and byakangelicin (45.12%) in the final product exceeded 80%. Based on the data, the proposed approach demonstrated satisfactory extraction ability, recovery and enrichment of target compounds in record time. Therefore, the developed approach is assumed essential to considerably reduce drawbacks encountered during the separation of oxypeucedanin hydrate and byakangelicin from the roots of <i>A. dahurica.</i>"
