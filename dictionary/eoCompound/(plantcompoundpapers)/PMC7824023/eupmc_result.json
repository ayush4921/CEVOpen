    "<i>Arctium lappa</i> is a weed used in traditional medicine in the treatment of skin inflammation and digestive tract diseases. <i>Arctium tomentosum</i> is used in folk medicine interchangeably with <i>Arctium lappa</i> and, according to European Medicines Agency (EMA) monography, provides an equal source of <i>Arctii radix</i> (<i>Bardanae radix</i>), despite the small amount of research confirming its activity and chemical composition. The aim of the study was the comparison of the anti-lipoxygenase and the antioxidant activity, scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), of 70 % (<i>v/v</i>) ethanolic extracts from the aerial parts and the roots of <i>Arctium lappa</i> and <i>Arctium tomentosum</i>. In the tested extracts, the total polyphenols content and the chemical composition, analyzed with the HPLC-DAD-MS<sup>n</sup> method, were also compared. The extracts were characterized by strong antioxidant properties, but their ability to inhibit lipoxygenase activity was rather weak. A correlation between the content of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant activity was observed. The extracts from <i>A. lappa</i> plant materials scavenged reactive oxygen species more strongly than the extracts from <i>A. tomentosum</i> plant materials. Moreover, the extracts from <i>A. lappa</i> plant materials were characterized by the statistically significantly higher content of polyphenolic compounds."
