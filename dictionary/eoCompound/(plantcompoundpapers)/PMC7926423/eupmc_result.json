    "Our present study was designed to investigate the role of both <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> and chamomile (<i>Matricaria chamomilla</i> L.) flower extract in mutual reaction against growth of <i>Pythium ultimum</i>. In vitro, the activity of chamomile extract was found to reduce the radial growth of <i>Pythium ultimum</i> up to 30% compared to the control. Whereas, the radial growth reduction effect of <i>T. harzianum</i> against <i>P. ultimum</i> reached 81.6% after 120 h. Data also showed the productivity of total phenolics and total flavonoids by <i>T. harzianum</i>, was 12.18 and 6.33 mg QE/100 mL culture filtrate, respectively. However, these compounds were determined in chamomile flower extract at concentrations of 75.33 and 24.29 mg QE/100 mL, respectively. The fractionation of aqueous extract of chamomile flower using HPLC provided several polyphenolic compounds such as pyrogallol, myricetin, rosemarinic acid, catechol, <i>p</i>-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and other minor compounds. In vivo, the potentiality of <i>T. harzianum</i> with chamomile flower extract against <i>Pythium</i> pathogen of bean was investigated. Data obtained showed a reduction in the percentage of rotted seed and infected seedling up to 28 and 8%, respectively. Whereas, the survival increased up to 64% compared to other ones. There was also a significant promotion in growth features, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, total polyphenols and flavonoids, polyphenol-oxidase and peroxidase enzymes compared to other ones. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported studies that included the mutual association of fungus, <i>T. harzianum</i> with the extract taken from the chamomile flower against <i>P. ultimum</i>, either in vitro or in vivo. In conclusion, the application of both <i>T. harzianum</i> and/or <i>M. chamomilla</i> extracts in the control of bean <i>Pythium</i> pathogen showed significant results."
