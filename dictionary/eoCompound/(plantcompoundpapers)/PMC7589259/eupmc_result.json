    "Synthetic insecticides are effective in controlling insect pests but can also harm nontarget organisms and the environment. During the last 40 years, there has been an increasing interest in alternative insecticides, particularly those derived from plants, commonly known as botanical insecticides. However, commercially available botanical insecticides remain limited. Rotenone is one of the earliest identified compounds and was used as fish poison and pest management. Due to its link with Parkinson disease, the use of rotenone was banned in many developed countries. Rotenone used to be isolated from <i>Derris</i> spp. and <i>Lonchocarpus</i> spp., and it can also be isolated from <i>Tephrosia</i> species. In this article, we present basic botanical information on selected <i>Tephrosia</i> species and their major compounds related to insecticidal activities and highlight the current use of extracts derived from some species, <i>T</i><i>ephrosia</i> <i>vogelii</i> in particular, for control of insect pests in stored grains and crop production. The crude extracts contain multiple bioactive compounds, mainly rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin, which act in either additive or synergistic fashion, resulting in effective control of insect pests. There are about 400 species in the genus <i>Tephrosia</i>, and species and even strains or variants vary greatly in these active compounds. We argue that a systematic evaluation of bioactive compounds in different species are needed, and species or strains with high insecticidal activities should be selected for use in the sustainable control of insect pests."
