    "Anaerobic soil disinfection (ASD) has been identified as an alternative soil-borne pathogen control strategy to chemical fumigation. ASD involves the application of an easily liable carbon source followed by irrigation to field capacity and maintenance of an anaerobic condition for a certain period. A literature search undertaken on ASD found that more than 50 comprehensive research projects have been conducted since its first discovery in 2000. Most of these studies were conducted in the USA and in the Netherlands. Though the exact mechanism of ASD in pathogen control is unknown, promising results have been reported against a wide range of pathogens such as fungi, nematodes, protists, and oomycetes. However, it is interesting to note that, except for a few studies, ASD research in the developing world and in the tropical countries has lagged behind. Nevertheless, with soil quality depletion, reduction in arable lands, and exponential population growth, a drastic change to the current agricultural practices should be adapted since yield gain has reached a plateau for major staple crops. Under such circumstances, we identified the gaps and the potentials of ASD in tropical agricultural systems and proposed promising biodegradable materials."
