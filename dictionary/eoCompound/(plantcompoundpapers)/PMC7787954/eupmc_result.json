    "Pathogens and pests are one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. For decades, targeted resistance breeding was used to create crop cultivars that resist pathogens and environmental stress while retaining yields. The often decade-long process of crossing, selection, and field trials to create a new cultivar is challenged by the rapid rise of pathogens overcoming resistance. Similarly, antimicrobial compounds can rapidly lose efficacy due to resistance evolution. Here, we review three major areas where computational, imaging and experimental approaches are revolutionizing the management of pathogen damage on crops. Recognizing and scoring plant diseases have dramatically improved through high-throughput imaging techniques applicable both under well-controlled greenhouse conditions and directly in the field. However, computer vision of complex disease phenotypes will require significant improvements. In parallel, experimental setups similar to high-throughput drug discovery screens make it possible to screen thousands of pathogen strains for variation in resistance and other relevant phenotypic traits. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence can capture rich phenotypic information across pathogen genotypes. Through genome-wide association mapping approaches, phenotypic data helps to unravel the genetic architecture of stress- and virulence-related traits accelerating resistance breeding. Finally, joint, large-scale screenings of trait variation in crops and pathogens can yield fundamental insights into how pathogens face trade-offs in the adaptation to resistant crop varieties. We discuss how future implementations of such innovative approaches in breeding and pathogen screening can lead to more durable disease control."
