The original protocol was given the name sponge-like protocol and then was reduced and modified from a microorganism to another to prepare microbial ghosts for various applications such as immunological applications, drug delivery, and isolation of DNA and protein. Fungal pathogens that infect plants critically affect cost effectiveness, quality, and quantity of their production. They kill plant cells and/or cause plant stress. Plant fungal infections can originate from many sources such as infected soil, seeds, or crop debris causing diseases and quality losses around the world with billions of US dollars annually as costs of the associated productivity loss. This study focused on the application of the sponge-like protocol in protecting <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue cultures of plants against fungal pathogens. This can be useful for research purposes or may be developed to be introduced in field applications. <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> infection in tissue culture of jojoba (<italic>Simmondsia chinensis</italic> (Link) Schn.) was used as a model to establish the employment of this protocol to control plant fungal diseases. The best conditions for <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> ghosts production previously mapped by randomization experimental design (reduced Plackett&#x02013;Burman experimental design) were used to prepare fungal ghosts. SDS, NaOH, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were used in their MIC (+1 level) or minimum growth concentration (MGC, &#x02212;1 level) according to the determined optimal experimental design. The release of both of DNA and protein from the fungal cells was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 260<sub>nm</sub> and 280<sub>nm</sub>, respectively, as an indicator for cell loss of their cytoplasm. Fungal ghost cells were also examined by transmission electron microscopy. After confirming the preparation of high-quality fungal ghost cells, the same conditions were mimicked to control plant fungal infection. Jojoba grown in tissue culture was sprayed with fungal cells (about 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;CFU) as a control experiment or fungal cells followed by treatment with solution (a) represents the fungal ghost cells formation calculated critical concentration (FGCCC) of SDS, NaOH, and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and then treatment with solution (b) represents H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> FGCCC. The plant was examined on day 0 (plant grown before any infection or infection followed by treatment), day 5 (plant at day 5 after infection or infection followed by treatment), and day 10 (plant at day 10 after infection or infection followed by treatment). We observed fungal growth in case of control experiments at days 5 and 10 on the tissue culture medium, as well as plant, and the absence of any fungal growth in case of plant treated with FGCCC even after day 10. We recommend using this FGCCC in the form of chemical spraying formulation to treat the plants aiming to control different plant fungal infections in <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue culture systems or applied in field.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Phytopathogenic fungi cause most of the diseases arising in agricultural and horticultural setups [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Generally, phytopathogens developed infection strategies to attack any plant [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], searching for entry and sourcing nutrients forcefully to achieve microbial growth and development [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These pathogens can overcome plant immune defences [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This negatively affects the health, homeostasis, and physiology of plants and may result in systemic damage [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Plant fungal pathogens can be responsible for a complexity of problems for farmers in plant production as listed by Dean et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] who reviewed the top ten plant fungal pathogens. To overcome the problem of persistent attack of phytopathogenic fungi on agricultural products, numerous agrochemicals were used, some of which are toxic to humans and a withdrawal period is essential between the last dosage and crops harvesting. Besides, they may also have negative environmental effects on soil organisms, insects, and plant pollinators [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (black mold) is one of the most common fungal species of the genus <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. It is abundant in soil and common in indoor environments [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It shows phytopathogenic effects [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] causing black mold disease on certain fruits and vegetables and is a common contaminant of food. <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> is responsible for sooty mold of onions and ornamental plants. <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> (yellow mold) exists worldwide as a soil saprobe and infects various important agriculture crops. Common hosts of the pathogen are legumes, cereal grains, and tree nuts [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This pathogen can produce the polyketide-derived carcinogenic and mutagenic secondary metabolite, which is called aflatoxin [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Aflatoxin causes aflatoxicosis due to inhaling or ingesting food and feed contaminated with high levels of aflatoxin.</p><p>Amara et al. [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were the first to introduce and develop the MIC-MGC chemical technique to gently induce pores in the microbial cells. They named the new technique as sponge-like protocol for preparing bacterial ghosts. The protocol is based on using MIC-MGC of a combination of some cheap, safe, and active chemical compounds (SDS, NaOH, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for evacuating microbial cells. The Plackett&#x02013;Burman optimization and randomization experimental design (full and reduced) was applied to map the best chemical and physical conditions to produce bacterial ghosts [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The protocol enables evacuation of microbial cells while keeping their 3D structure. This turns live cells to dead ghost cells with retained immunogenicity that could be used in immunization [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Microbial ghosts prepared by this protocol can also be applied as a drug delivery system [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Even the cytoplasm itself released from the evacuated ghost cells contains many important biomacromolecules and biological structures other than DNA and protein. The sponge-like chemical protocol was evolved to produce microbial ghosts from Gram-negative [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Gram-positive [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] bacteria, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>Candida</italic>, filamentous fungi [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, as an approach to develop the benefits of the sponge-like chemical protocol, it was applied to protect <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue cultures of plants against fungal pathogens. As a model, tissue culture of jojoba <italic>(Simmondsia chinensis</italic> (Link) Schn.) was infected with <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> representing the phytopathogenic fungi. The infected plant tissue culture was sprayed with FGCCC for each fungus. The fungal growth was observed after 5 and 10 days of infection followed by treatment. The success of the protocol to prevent plant fungal infection can be useful for research purposes or may be developed to be introduced in field applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Results and Discussion</title><p>It is obvious that phytopathogenic fungi result in several and diverse problems associated with a potential vast impact on plant production. Phytopathogenic fungi, thus, have a huge negative part in providing food efforts for the ever-growing world population. The diseases they cause in plants, as well as the mycotoxins they produce, severely threaten agricultural production. Much effort has been made to minimize damage caused by phytopathogenic fungi in agricultural setups including various management/control approaches and innovations. Fungal plant pathogens have been controlled by several approaches such as inducing plant natural resistance (using plant defence molecules in agricultural production) against invading fungi [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], fungicides [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], biological pesticides [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and using plant extracts [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The sponge-like protocol was primarily designed to use cheap and safe chemical compounds (NaOH, SDS, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for microbial ghost cells preparation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ghosts from various microbes were produced by this gentle chemical protocol that was applied to induce evacuation-pores at the microbial cell wall [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The main feature that distinguishes this protocol from other chemical evacuation methods was the combined use of MIC and MGC of the used chemicals responsible for killing microbes according to the optimal experimental design to prepare microbial ghosts mapped by full or reduced Plackett&#x02013;Burman experimental design. MIC of a used chemical will kill microbial cell while MGC allows cells to escape and live in the presence of a chemical compound, but still it has an effect on the cell wall. The MIC of NaOH gently induces the pore (s) in the microbial cell wall, while SDS is essential to wash the &#x0201c;sponge-like&#x0201d; cells content, as well as to perturb and destabilize the cell wall/plasma membrane of yeasts and fungi [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> increases the cell permeability. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is applied to hydrolyse the remaining nucleic acids in the ghosts, and ethanol is used to inactivate the remaining nonlysed cells [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Our scientific group is working extensively to establish the sponge-like protocol and expanding its applications in humans and economically important animal and plant healthcare.</p><p>Microbial ghosts prepared by this protocol can be applied in immunization [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as a drug delivery system [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and even DNA and protein isolation [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, the protocol was applied to protect <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue cultures of plants against fungal pathogens. As a model, tissue culture of jojoba (<italic>Simmondsia chinensis</italic> (Link) Schn.) was infected with <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> representing the phytopathogenic fungi. The success of the protocol to prevent plant fungal infection can be developed to be introduced in field applications or research purposes (via spraying or immersing the plants in field or tissue cultures with chemical compounds involved in the study at concentrations achieving the best conditions for fungal cells killing and ghosts production).</p><p>The best conditions for <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> ghosts production previously mapped [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] by randomization experimental design (reduced Plackett&#x02013;Burman experimental design) were used to prepare fungal ghosts.

We observed the presence of fungal growth in case of control experiments at days 5 and 10 on the tissue culture medium, as well as plant parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and the absence of any fungal growth in case of plant infected with fungal cells and treated with FGCCC even at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>This study succeeded in preventing plant fungal infection via fungal cell evacuation. The used FGCCC inhibits any form of fungal growth. The spraying of fungal cells during infection of plant tissue culture may cause some spores to contaminate the culture medium as seen in negative control experiments, while no sign of fungal growth was observed on the culture medium of treated plants even with multiple spraying steps with fungal cells and FGCCC solutions. These results can be applied through spraying the plants in field or tissue cultures with chemical compounds involved in the study at concentrations achieving the best conditions for fungal cells killing and ghosts production. However, further studies are recommended to screen the optimal incubation time for applying these chemicals to the plant to prevent any negative effect they may cause on plant growth and quality.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>This preliminary study aimed to use sponge-like protocol for preparing FGCCC spray able to protect plants against fungal pathogens. <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> FGCCC were calculated for each, and ghost cells were confirmed by measuring the release of each of protein and DNA, as well as by the use of the light and electron microscope. The FGCCCs were examined for their ability to suppress the fungal infection on jojoba tissue culture. No fungal growth was observed in the treated experiments compared with the control. Apparently, the used chemical compounds at the calculated concentrations did not affect the plant growth. This study might be a step towards a new approach to control phytopathogenic fungi. Further studies are in need to validate and to optimize our results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study recieved institutional instrumental and chemical support.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>All the data are given in the original file.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Nawal Abd El-Baky and Raoufa Ahmed Abdel Rahman contributed equally to this study.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agrios</surname><given-names>G.
