Plant status in respect to photosynthetic apparatus efficiency was determined and linked with changes in biochemical composition of shoots, namely phenolic acids&#x02019; and stress-related phytohormones. Results showed the considerable inter-ecotype differences in (1) the photosynthetic pigments&#x02019; amount, (2) the functioning of membrane electron transporters as well as (3) the linear and alternative electron transport pathways, whose lower values were reported in NM than in M HM-treated culture. Photosynthetic apparatus protection in M specimens was assured by the activation of cinnamic acid synthesis (by phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and its further transformations to benzoic acid derivatives with high ability to counteract oxidative stress, that was accompanied by the overexpression of jasmonic acid stimulating antioxidant machinery. In turn, detrimental HM effects on NM shoots could result from the diminution of most phenolics&#x02019; accumulation, and only the content of coumarate (produced by bifunctional phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyase) and rosmarinic acid increased. All these together with an enhanced concentration of abscisic acid might suggest that NM strategy to cope with HMs is based mostly on a restriction of metal movement with transpiration flow and their limited distribution in leaves. Summarizing, our findings for the first time point out the physiological and metabolic adaptation of pseudometallophyte <italic>A. montanum</italic> to adverse conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Physiology</kwd><kwd>Plant sciences</kwd><kwd>Environmental sciences</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Heavy metals (HMs) are one of the main abiotic stress factors that lead to multiple alterations in plant physiology and biochemistry, including water uptake, nutrient distribution, transpiration or nitrogen metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. After exceeding the optimum threshold, accumulated HMs may also affect photosynthesis in many ways. In particular, they damage the chloroplast membrane functions and components of the electron transport chain in the reaction center of photosystem (PS) II and I as well as alter the energy transfer rate from light-harvesting chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> protein complex (LHC) to both PS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Since PSII was found to be more susceptible to metallic ions compared with PSI, the inhibition of its photochemical activity may also result from the replacement of magnesium, calcium or manganese by HM cations either in the chlorophyll of LHCII or in the internal PSII antenna system and chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> dimmer in reaction center<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. What is more, metals may restrain photosynthesis by a decline of the photosynthetic pigment content or relative proportions of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> to <italic>b</italic> due to the inhibition of enzymes involved in their biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. All these changes impair the light phase of photosynthesis, whereas HM-induced drop in the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation can be strongly related to the reduction of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Further, HMs may act indirectly on the photosynthesis by decreasing stomata number and conductance, which limit carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) assimilation and its intercellular concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, metallic ions accumulated in leaves as main photosynthetic organs may contribute to their premature senescence and consequently to the reduction of light absorption surface. Although in such circumstances the efficiency of photosynthesis decreases, changes in photosynthetic machinery manifested in general growth disturbances strictly depend not only on the HM dose and the duration of exposure but also on plant species.</p><p id="Par3">Under the exposure to environmental stress factors, plants often accumulate an array of diverse metabolites. Among them, phenolic compounds have multiple functions in acclimation processes to an excessive amount of HMs, since they possess a high tendency to bind metallic ions via hydroxyl and carboxyl groups as well as to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Phenols are mainly synthesized by phenylpropanoid pathway, whose early metabolites are trans-cinnamic acid produced during deamination of L-phenylalanine catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and/or <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acid obtained from L-tyrosine as a substrate for tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) or via cinnamate hydroxylation. In the further chemical reactions of coumarate, simple phenylpropanoids, including sequentially caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, are formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the degradation of the cinnamic acid side chain may result in the composition of benzoic acid, which in turn can undergo the same hydroxylation and methylation reactions as cinnamic and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acids, giving analogous derivatives, such as <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic or protocatechuic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Both cinnamic acid and the structurally related benzoic acid, together with their derivatives belong to a specific group of phenols called phenolic acids. These firstly mentioned compounds serve as a starting point for the biosynthesis of many other important molecules, like monolignols (coniferyl-, sinapyl- and <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl alcohols), which compose lignan and lignin units, flavonoids, or coumarins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In turn, benzoic acid derivatives are known for their particularly strong antioxidant properties that are the more effective the more hydroxyl moieties in aromatic rings occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, gallic acid, with three hydroxyl groups, shows the highest antioxidant activity, followed by dihydroxybenzoic acids (with two hydroxyl groups) such as&#x000a0;gentisic and protocatechuic acids, whereas salicylic and <italic>p</italic>&#x02010;hydroxybenzoic acids (with one hydroxyl group) have the lowest ability to ROS scavenger.</p><p id="Par4">Survival in the presence of HMs depends on complex networks of various cellular processes to overcome the negative effects of stress. In the signal cascade involved in plant responses, phytohormones play key roles as coordinators of metabolic adjustment leading to improved protection against stressors and thus providing better growth plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The common reaction to various abiotic factors is a drop in the concentration of phytohormones considered as growth stimulants (i.e. cytokinins, auxins, and gibberellins), which is accompanied by an enhanced accumulation of phytohormones inhibiting cell elongation and division as well as accelerating senescence and dormancy (i.e. abscisic and salicylic acids, jasmonates)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In recent years, great progress has been achieved toward explaining the roles of exogenously applied phytohormones in the mitigation of metal toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Despite many efforts held to elucidate the functions of both individual phytohormones and their interactions under HM treatment, there is limited information about their profiling and significance in metallophytes as tolerant representatives that are the best adapted by microevolutionary changes to grow in heavily contaminated areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Zinc, lead and cadmium occur abundantly in soils of the Olkusz Ore-bearing Region located in Southern Poland, which is considered as one of the longest-exploited industrial areas in Europe, where ore deposits have been mining and processing since the Middle Ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although many centuries of human activity have drastically affected the local vegetation and landscape, they have also contributed to the development of valuable HM-tolerant plant communities on the oldest, but still highly contaminated waste heaps. In the present study, <italic>Alyssum montanum</italic> as a representative species of such calamine flora has been selected to verify HM effects on physiological and biochemical properties of shoots cultured under fully-controlled in vitro conditions that were applied deliberately to exclude potential alterations in plant metabolism caused by changing environmental factors, e.g. light intensity, temperature or pathogens. In turn, the comparative assessment of HM effects between different ecotypes of the same species allows us to identify specific tolerance mechanisms involved in alleviating metal-induced damages.

The condition of photosynthetic apparatus <italic>A. montanum</italic> ecotypes under multi-metal stress was evaluated for the first time.

Moreover, metallic ions caused a significant decrease in the activity of the OEC (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>o</sub>) in NM plants.

It is believed that decrease of RC efficiency results both from a decline of effective energy transfer on the PSII donor side in the closest vicinity of the PSII RC (V<sub>i</sub> increase) and an electron transport efficiency decrease on the acceptor side of PSI (&#x003c1;R<sub>o</sub>, &#x003b4;R<sub>o</sub>, &#x003c6;R<sub>o</sub> decrease)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

The observed functional adaptations of the photosynthetic apparatus and unaltered ultrastructure of chloroplasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> suggest the possibility of a remarkably effective balance between linear and alternative electron transport pathways. The ability to quick electron redirection to alternative flows allows fast acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus to the changed redox state in the presence of metallic elements.

Despite it, minimal attention has been paid to both the overall phenolic profile of metallophytes and changes in these compounds formation after the application of metal doses corresponding to the natural growth condition of the metal-tolerant population. Our statistical analysis revealed that phenolic acids were determined by ecotype as well as its combination with treatment (except for synapic and <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acids influenced separately by both applied factors) suggesting that this research field is particularly important to broaden the knowledge about acclimation and adaptation mechanisms to HMs.</p><p id="Par56">The investigation of main enzymes involved in the pivotal step of phenols&#x02019; biosynthesis showed that the modification of their activity could affect the final phenolic acid content in <italic>A. montanum</italic> shoots and consequently modify plant response to metallic ions. In M specimens treated with HMs the increase in PAL activity positively correlated with the concentration of cinnamic acid, whose accumulation was significantly strengthened in comparison with control culture. Surprisingly, in NM shoots changes in cinnamate after metal applications were not detected although enhanced PAL activity was simultaneously ascertained. It might indicate that in NM ecotype monofunctional PAL producing trans-cinnamic acid was not identified, but instead bifunctional phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyase (PTAL) turning over both amino acids could occur. Therefore, the level of <italic>p-</italic>coumarate as a reaction product of (P)TAL was the highest among all treatments in NM shoots cultivated on metal-enriched medium. Although PTAL is mainly restricted to grasses known from the unique composition of cell walls comprising mostly syringyl (S) units of lignin and cell wall-bound coumarates as well as from the possibility to generate nearly half of deposited lignin just from tyrosine, its overexpression can be also preferentially activated in other plants during stress-induced lignification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In turn, (P)TAL activity in M HM-treated shoots was completely suppressed, confirming that cinnamate generation with the help of monofunctional PAL may be much more important in the successful alleviation of stress conditions. It can be related to the central position of cinnamic acid as a precursor in its further chemical conversions leading finally to the synthesis of both benzoic and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acids and their hydroxylated derivatives with a wide spectrum of biological activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Although these phytohormones share the common target of limiting water losses by stomatal closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, JA is also known to ameliorate oxidative damage through the activation of antioxidant machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In the case of our study, JA seemed to take part in the ROS removal pathways rather than in stomatal closure since this last process often refers to the restricted conversion of 12-OPDA to JA, which then promotes the stomatal movement individually or jointly to ABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Regarding M culture, a diminished level of jasmonate precursor was noticed under HM treatment, and therefore the role of JA in ROS scavenging could be supported. The ameliorative effects of JA on Ni-induced oxidative stress were&#x000a0;also proved for serpentine and non-metalliferous <italic>Alyssum inflatum</italic> specimens, in which the reduction of ROS content occurred due to the enhancement accumulation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Further, Sirhindi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> reported that JA supplementation minimized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in <italic>Glycine max</italic> under Ni stress through the improvement of superoxide dismutase, peroxidases and catalase activity. According to these findings, the mechanism responsible for HM tolerance in M ecotype may be related to the effective synthesis of JA as a signalling molecule that combats detrimental HMs effects by rapid ROS neutralization involving secondary metabolites as well as peroxidases and catalase, whose presence was previously visualized by histochemical method in leaves of HM-treated M culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, M specimens growing on HM-enriched medium showed also strongly enhanced accumulation of ABA glucosyl ester, but free ABA level did not change in comparison to control. It may implicate the antagonistic relationship of ABA and JA in <italic>A. montanum</italic> response to HMs, and therefore inactive ABA form was not still hydrolyzed. Undoubtedly, research on the multifarious cross-talk of these plant hormones and other signal transduction pathways are worthy to be undertaken to better understand tolerance mechanisms in respect to reprogramming of metallophytes metabolism activated by long-term exposure to HMs.</p><p id="Par60">The conceptual diagram comparing the metabolic responses of NM and M <italic>A. montanum</italic> ecotypes is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> as a summary of data collected so far both in the present and previous experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> as well as to identify paths of research that still represent a mystery worth to be exploring in the future.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of physiological actions (bold font) leading to metal tolerance or toxicity, which result from the activation of ecotype-specific pathways of phenolic compound biosynthesis as well as different phytohormones operating in metallicolous and non-metallicolous <italic>Alyssum montanum</italic> specimens treated with Zn, Pb and Cd ions.

One of them relies on the effective protection of both the photosynthetic pigment synthesis pathway and the key structural elements of the photosynthetic apparatus. The second one is based on the rearrangement of electron transport pathways allowing for dynamic changes in the flow directions between linear transport and alternative pathways. The observed effects result from the increased synthesis of membrane electron transporters as well as from the enhanced accumulation of phenolic acids (mainly benzoic acid derivatives) providing an efficient neutralization of metal-induced ROS. This defence mechanism based on phenolics is accompanied by the exaggeration of jasmonic acid, which seems to take part in ROS removal pathways, too (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Simultaneously, M specimens eliminate toxic ions by their translocation from the metabolically active tissues of the leaf blade to its outer surface and trichomes. In turn, in the non-metallicolous, sensitive ecotype the destruction of photosystems, the destabilization of thylakoids and a decrease in chlorophyll content are observed together with the lack of effective electron flows leading to an uncontrolled ROS generation. Despite the increase in the activity of the (P)TAL enzyme, the content of most phenolic acids decreased which may suggest an ineffective ROS scavenging system. Thus, NM strategy to cope with an excess amount of HMs can rely on the reduced metal distribution associated with abscisic acid, which provokes stomatal closure and thereby limits metal uptake and translocation, rather than on the counteraction of oxidative stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
