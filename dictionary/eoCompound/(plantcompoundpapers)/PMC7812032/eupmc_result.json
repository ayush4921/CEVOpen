    "Wine fractionation is an old practice widely applied for many reasons, including the production of food-grade alcohol and spirits, alcohol-reduced wines and beverages, functional products, and aromas. The purpose is the need to satisfy different lifestyles and legal constraints. The raw material, usually called industrial wine, includes wine overproduction and wine not used as such: mainly table wine, the fermented juice of unsold table grapes, and quality wine. Three technologies are currently in use: Vacuum distillation, Reverse osmosis in dialyzing mode, and the Spinning cone column. The process developed in this work results from the integration of a multistage reverse osmosis section operating in dialyzing mode, with the Atmospheric distillation of the permeate stream; the two most applied technologies for fractionating liquid mixtures. This process allows the fractionation of the wine into four products (the vegetation water, the azeotropic Ethanol, a concentrated aqueous solution of the solid extract, and a concentrated alcoholic solution of volatile aroma compounds) while preserving sensorial, nutritional and functional properties of the individual compounds. Then, the proper recombination of these products gives rise to a wide variety of wine-based products to meet the specifications of each market segment. The process is environmentally friendly and, in comparison with the competitors, is less energy-intensive, other than resilient and flexible regarding the production potentiality."
