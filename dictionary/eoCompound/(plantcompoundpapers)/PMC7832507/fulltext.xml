Extensive studies have been performed to explore and develop strategies based on microbial antagonists to biologically control pathogens [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The mechanisms of these microbial antagonists underlying the biocontrol activity, including competition for nutrients and space, enzyme secretion, toxin production, mycoparasitism, volatile organic compound (VOC) release, and resistance induction in plants, are likely to be involved in the antagonistic function [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. VOCs are low-molecular-weight organic compounds that easily reach the target by vaporizing and diffusing in air. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on determining the function of VOCs [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and their efficiency in reducing the viability and proliferation of devastating plant pathogens [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Galactomyces</italic> genus of fungi (Saccharomycetales: Dipodascaceae) has long been considered a potential biological control agent owing to its capacity to inhibit the growth of other phytopathogenic fungi by using nonvolatile antimicrobial compounds [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>]. The inhibition of mycelial growth acts not only on living planted crops but also on harvested fruits, which makes them potentially valuable in controlling both pre- and post-harvest diseases. In our previous study, we observed that <italic>G. candidum</italic> JYC1146 could inhibit the growth of coexisted fungi by producing VOCs. Such capability was not displayed by the other five genera of the fungi examined in the same study [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, because all the three phytopathogenic fungi (<italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, <italic>Fusarium incarnatum</italic>, and <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic>) showed significant inhibition in growth, VOCs from <italic>G. candidum</italic> JYC1146 exhibited a potentially broad spectrum of activities against sympatric phytopathogens [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Broad-spectrum antipathogenic activity has been noted in some bacterial strains but has rarely been observed in VOCs from fungi. In the case of the bacteria, the broad-spectrum antipathogenic activity can be achieved by releasing lytic enzymes, causing permeability changes in the membrane, producing hydrogen cyanide, and secreting siderophores [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These mechanisms act on structures shared by several cellular organisms. Thus, despite these studies mainly focusing on phytopathogenic fungi, antipathogenic activities might also occur in other phytopathogens. Although numerous studies have examined the effects of VOCs on pathogenic fungi, their effects on the free-living stages of nematodes have rarely been studied [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nematodes cause crop losses by both directly attacking host plants and acting as the vectors of other pathogens [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Various methods have been developed against the damage from nematodes including genetic host resistance, cultural practices, chemical applications, government regulatory measures, and biological control [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, as the only metazoan phytopathogen with the largest body mass, nematodes are usually harmful for the agricultural environment [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The antipathogenic activity of VOCs from yeast-like fungi, <italic>Galactomyces</italic>, was confirmed in our previous study to be potentially broader than that from other <italic>Galactomyces</italic> species. In the present study, we further examined the effect of VOCs from three <italic>Galactomyces</italic> strains, <italic>G. candidum</italic> JYC1146, <italic>G. candidum</italic> JYC546, and <italic>G. geotrichum</italic> JYC549, on nine phylogenetically distant phytopathogenic fungi (belonging to the three classes: Agaricomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Sordariomycetes) grown on agarose plates. To more directly simulate adoption on postharvest diseases, the effects of VOCs were examined <italic>in situ</italic> with the phytopathogenic fungi growing on the plate and harvested fruits of marketed cherry tomato. The mortality of the soil nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was also examined to estimate the protection of VOCs against the infection of plant nematodes.</p></sec><sec id="S0002" disp-level="1"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001" disp-level="2"><label>2.1.</label><title>Fungal inoculum</title><p>Three <italic>Galactomyces</italic> strains were isolated from rotten leaves (<italic>G. candidum</italic> JYC1146) and the rhizosphere of cherry tomato (<italic>L. esculentum</italic> var. <italic>cerasiforme</italic>) (<italic>G. candidum</italic> JYC546 and <italic>G. geotrichum</italic> JYC549) for examining the antagonistic effects of VOCs on fungi.</p><p>Nine phytopathogenic fungi used for examining the response to VOCs included four fungi, which caused tomato wilt disease (<italic>F. proliferatum</italic> JYC2153 and JYC2155 and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>incarnatum</italic> JYC2156) and southern blight disease (<italic>Athelia rolfsii</italic> JYC2163); <italic>Col. gloeosporioides</italic> JYC2139, which causes ripe rot in grapes, bitter rot in apples, and several diseases in fruits and vegetables; and four fungal strains, namely <italic>F</italic>. <italic>incarnatum</italic> JYC2140, <italic>Cladosporium uredinicola</italic> JYC2141, <italic>Cla. cladosporioides</italic> JYC2144, and <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp.

Except for <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. JYC2145, which has never been noted to attack living plants, the other four <italic>Fusarium</italic> strains are common plant pathogens. To break the defense of living plants, several fungal strains display local adaptation to the current host cultivars and trade off those less encountered [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Despite causing plant diseases, the facultative infection and relatively low damage to the host plant make <italic>Cla. cladosporioides</italic> a less important phytopathogenic fungus. By contrast, it is also a potential biocontrol agent because of its antifungal activity against coexisting phytopathogenic fungi [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hence, growth inhibition caused by the <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi might be a negative factor in the adoption of multiple biocontrol agents. Biocontrol agents potentially offset each other&#x02019;s potency. In the case of controlling infection in the invasive tropical shrub <italic>Mimosa pigr</italic> in Australia, the efficiency of the fungal plant pathogen <italic>Phloeospora mimosae-pigra</italic> was significantly reduced in the presence of another biocontrol agent, the stem-boring moth <italic>Neurostrota gunniella</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Because the interaction network of microorganisms in the soil is more complex than that in the culture medium, the <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> effect of the <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi on living plants may be worthwhile to investigate in the future.</p><p>The growth of <italic>A. rolfsii</italic> JYC 2163 was also highly inhibited by the <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi. <italic>A. rolfsii</italic> (syns. <italic>Sclerotium rolfsii</italic>) is a soil-borne facultative plant pathogen, which causes southern blight disease in several host plants. Members of <italic>Athelia</italic> cause economic crop (fruits and vegetables) losses in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate countries and are difficult to control because of the variety in host range, fastidious growth, and ability to produce persistent sclerotia [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The reaction of VOCs from the <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi is similar to that of 6-pentyl-alpha-pyrone (6PAP), which is produced by numerous <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species. 6PAP has been previously noted to suppress the disease caused by <italic>A. rolfsii</italic> when applied onto the surface of the soil [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Such effects explain the efficiency of soil amendments, which are frequently adopted as environmentally friendly strategies to replace the application of chemical nematicides [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, little is known regarding chemicals released from soil microorganisms. Fungi which negatively affect the fitness of soil nematodes can be characterized into two main groups, nematophagous fungi, which exploit nematodes for nutritious substances, and, endophytic fungi, which colonize plant roots and reduce the incidence of plant disease by enhancing plant resistance or releasing enzymes or toxins against nematodes [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi examined in the present study are more likely to be endophytic fungi, which release volatile toxins. Although a similar effect was observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in our study, nematodes exposed to VOCs from the <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi demonstrated a more intense effect. Some chemicals released from the fungi were detected to be toxic to nematodes.

In addition to the <italic>Galactomyces</italic> fungi, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Neotyphodium</italic> spp. are known to release toxic compounds against nematodes and enhance plant growth.
