however, their consumption is often insufficient, partly because of
unpleasant taste characteristics. This study aimed to investigate
the mechanisms underlying bitter taste reception and to develop methods
to suppress bitterness. We focused on sesquiterpene lactones found

was 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M, in agreement with the previously reported
bitterness threshold of the compound. Adjustment of pH from neutral
to weak acidic conditions reduced the response of TAS2R46-expressing

regulating the bitterness of Asteraceae species by controlling the

part of the human diet because they are
sources of important micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals,
as well as many other compounds that contribute to health. For example,
polyphenols and terpenoids are ubiquitously present in plants and
have been reported to have various bioactivities. Other examples of
bioactive compounds of plant origin include anthocyanin, apiin, catechin,
guaiazulene, momordicin, quercetin, and rutin, which have been reported
to have health benefits through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> inhibition of carcinogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and prevention of osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Although
increasing the consumption of vegetables is recommended, many people
fall short of this recommendation, partly because of the unpleasant
taste of some vegetables.</p><p>Many functional components of plant
origin have strongly bitter
tastes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> For example, the bitterness threshold of
cucurbitacin C&#x02014;found in cucumbers&#x02014;has been shown to
be &#x0003c;0.1 mg/L,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> considerably lower than
that of quinine hydrochloride,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> which is
intensely bitter. Strong bitterness is generally perceived as an unpleasant
taste; thus, altering the palatability of vegetables through the use
of technology to control the bitterness may help to increase individuals&#x02019;
consumption of vegetables. Recently, the relationship between preferences
toward vegetables and sensitivity to bitterness has been explored,
focusing on genotypical variations of the bitter taste receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Although the effects of strategies to mask bitterness
on preferences for vegetables have been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity to
bitter compounds of plant origin are yet to be elucidated. A deeper
understanding of these mechanisms would enable one to devise new methods
to control the bitterness of vegetable. Tastants in ordinary foods
are recognized by specific receptors in the oral cavity. Recently,
molecular characterization of taste receptors has been conducted,
and their functional features have been studied in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Bitter substances were detected by human type
2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs), which are G protein-coupled receptors
present in taste bud cells of the tongue epithelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Some TAS2Rs that bind to bitter components of plants, including
vegetables, have been revealed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> including salicin (which
activates TAS2R16)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and catechins (which
activates TAS2R39);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> however, the receptors
and associated mechanisms of detection have not been determined for
many bitter compounds. Examples of such compounds are lactucin (Lac),
lactucopicrin (LP), and 11&#x003b2;,13-dihydrolactucin (DHL), which
are found in Asteraceae plants, such as chicory (<italic>Cichorium
intybus</italic> L.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> and lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> These sesquiterpene lactones have sedative and
analgesic effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> and the anti-malaria
activity of Lac and LP has been confirmed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Although these compounds are strongly bitter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> with bitterness thresholds equal to or higher than quinine hydrochloride,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> the mechanism underlying the detection of Lac,
LP, and DHL has not yet been determined.</p><p>Controlling the bitterness
of foods is important in the food industry,
and methods to suppress bitterness have been developed on the basis
of investigations into the underlying mechanisms of bitterness reception.
Some compounds have been characterized, which act as inhibitors for
the human bitter taste receptor; for example, 4-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl)butanoic
acid (GIV3727) was identified by screening chemical compound libraries
and has been shown to suppress the bitter aftertaste of artificial
sweeteners, such as saccharin and acesulfame K.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> It has also been shown that the response of TAS2R16 to
bitter disaccharides is suppressed by lowering the surrounding pH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In addition, it has been reported recently that
some acidic amino acids and peptides can suppress the response of
TAS2R16 to salicin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>The purpose
of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying
bitter taste reception and to develop methods to control or suppress
bitterness. We focused on bitter sesquiterpene lactones found in lettuce,
for which the reception mechanisms are not clear. To this end, we
investigated human bitter taste receptors known to respond to the
bitter compounds in lettuce and evaluated the intensity of bitterness
of the sesquiterpene lactones. We confirmed the suppression of bitterness
using both cellular assays and human sensory tests.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Characterization of Human
Bitter Taste Receptors
that Respond to Sesquiterpene Lactones in Lettuce</title><p>To investigate
the mechanisms underlying the reception of bitter taste of vegetables,
we first examined the response of cells expressing human bitter taste
receptors to LP, which is a well-known bitter sesquiterpene lactone
found in lettuce. The presence of sesquiterpene lactones has been
reported in Asteraceae species, and LP and Lac are known to be partly
responsible for the bitterness of chicory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and lettuce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> From sensory tests, the
bitterness threshold of LP has been reported to be 0.5 ppm (approximately
1.2 &#x003bc;M).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study,
we used a 10 &#x003bc;M LP solution, which should be sufficient considering
the bitterness threshold of LP. Twenty-five kinds of HEK293T cells
that express human bitter taste receptors and G16t2 were tested for
cellular responses to 10 &#x003bc;M LP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). We observed a clear cellular response
from TAS2R46-expressing cells to LP (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001,

a faint response to 10 &#x003bc;M LP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). These results strongly indicate that the
bitterness of LP is primarily recognized by TAS2R46 in the oral cavity
of humans because we confirmed a clear response at a concentration
of about 10 times the bitterness threshold.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Representative ratiometric

detected when the four sesquiterpene lactones
were examined at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 &#x003bc;M,
as in the case for LP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). Quantitative analysis showed that the responses were dose-dependent,
with different effective concentrations determined for each compound
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). Among
them, DHLP induced a cellular response at the lowest concentration,
with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M. Hence, responses
to LP and DHLP agreed with the previously reported functional threshold,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> indicating the possibility that the bitterness
intensity of the sesquiterpene lactones can be evaluated by the response
profile of TAS2R46-expressing cells.</p><p>Moreover, we examined the
response of TAS2R46-expressing cells
to other compounds including parthenolide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and santonin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> (TAS2R46 agonists) and

and santonin (300 &#x003bc;M) induced strong responses in TAS2R46-expressing
cells, whereas no clear response was observed with salicin application
(50 mM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B).
This suggests that the sesquiterpene lactones including LP, DHLP,
Lac, and DHL in lettuce appear to be selectively and specifically
recognized by TAS2R46.</p><p>Compared with the results of LP and DHLP,
the response of TAS2R46
to Lac and DHL was relatively low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). This might be attributed to the differences
in the chemical structures; both LP and DHLP include 4-hydroxyphenyl
acetic acid that is bonded to the hydroxyl groups of Lac and DHL,
respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). The response of TAS2R46 clearly differs depending on the presence
or absence of this structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B), suggesting its importance in ligand recognition
by TAS2R46.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Suppression of the Bitterness
Detection of
Sesquiterpene Lactones by Controlling pH</title><p>We aimed to develop
methods to control the bitterness of foods, such as vegetables. Previous
reports proposed methods for the suppression of bitterness by inhibiting
human bitter taste receptors. For example, the response of TAS2R16-expressing
cells to gentiobiose (a rare, bitter-tasting disaccharide) was suppressed
by the pH reduction of the ligand solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, the response of TAS2R16 to salicin was inhibited by
adding acidic amino acids or umami peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, we examined the influence of pH conditions
to establish whether this could reduce the response of TAS2R46 to
sesquiterpene lactones. When the pH value of the LP solution was decreased
by the addition of citric acid, the response of TAS2R46-expressing
cells was attenuated compared with the control condition (pH 7.4)
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A). Quantitative
analysis indicated that the cellular response at pH 6.3 and 5.0 was
significantly decreased compared with that at pH 7.4. Because the
cellular response to 10 &#x003bc;M LP at pH 5.0 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B) was almost equivalent to that induced
by 3 &#x003bc;M LP at pH 7.4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B), it can be considered that the bitterness of LP
is greatly suppressed by a change in the pH from neutral to weakly
acidic conditions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The suppression effects on bitterness of sesquiterpene

significantly reduced compared with those at pH 7.4 at the same ligand
concentrations in the case of all sesquiterpene lactones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>C), indicating that
suppression of the bitterness of sesquiterpene lactones from lettuce
can be achieved by controlling the pH.</p><p>In the experimental conditions
of the present study, the inhibitory
effects of decreased pH were in line with previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> In addition, the inhibitory effects under acidic
conditions were confirmed for all four sesquiterpene lactones tested
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B,C), and
no clear influence of chemical structure was observed. These results
may indicate that suppressing TAS2R46 responses to sesquiterpene lactones
is a feature shared between TAS2R46 and TAS2R16. On the other hand,
it is also possible that this inhibitory effect occurs when taste
information transmitted separately from taste receptors through taste
nerves is integrated in the central nervous system. Therefore, it
is necessary to carefully consider the possibility of peripheral and
central effects on the suppression of bitterness due to sourness.
Future experiments are required to determine whether the modulatory
effect of pH is limited to select TAS2Rs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Sensory

compared with the control juice (pH 6.3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>D). This result suggests that the bitterness
of lettuce can be suppressed by lowering the pH when eating through
the use of acidic compounds. Notably, endive juice somewhat had a
sour taste when the pH was lowered, but the bitter taste was perceived
as significantly reduced compared with the control. In addition, further
lowering of the pH resulted in members of the panel reporting increased
sourness, and the evaluation of actual bitterness became difficult
(data not shown).</p><p>The concentration of LP in endive juice was

curve for TAS2R46 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B), the bitterness of endive juice perceived in sensory evaluations
can be attributed to the presence of LP and DHLP. Although conditions
in the oral cavity differ from those in our cellular experiments in
terms of temperature, pH-buffering capacity of saliva, and so on,
the suppression of responses of bitter taste receptors might also
occur in the oral cavity.</p><p>Various studies have been conducted
into the suppression of bitterness
in vegetables and other foods, which have utilized physical methods,
such as the removal of bitter components, suppression of bitter taste
receptors with inhibitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> and masking of bitterness with other tastes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Because physical removal of the bitter components in vegetables
also impairs the functional components, other methods, such as the
adsorption of bitter components using polymer compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> or proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> have
been developed to prevent these from reaching the bitter taste receptors.
In addition, masking bitterness with other strong tastes, such as
sweetness, has been confirmed to have favorable effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> However, there is a certain degree of consumer resistance to the
addition of excessive sweetness to vegetables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p><p>The results of this report, namely, that bitterness
in vegetable
juice can be effectively suppressed by lowering the pH, strongly indicate
that the bitter taste of lettuce could be easily suppressed using
sour seasonings such as vinegar, dressing, or mayonnaise in everyday
meals. It is known that the newly targeted bitter taste receptor TAS2R46
responds to a wide range of plant-derived bitter components such as
sesquiterpene lactones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> In conclusion,
the possibility of controlling food tastes may contribute to increasing
vegetable intake among the general population without high costs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Chemicals</title><p>DHL,

45 amino acids of rat somatostatin receptor type 3 (sstr3) was ligated
to the 5&#x02032;-terminus of the coding region of the gene for each
TAS2R. A chimeric G protein (G16t2) was designed, which replaced the
44 amino acids at the C terminus of human G&#x003b1;16 with those from
zebrafish G&#x003b1;t2 (refseq: NM_131869). The resultant cDNA was subcloned

Subsequently, cells were washed with assay buffer; then, 5 &#x003bc;M

Fura-2 fluorescence intensities were measured by excitation at 340
and 380 nm, followed by detection at 510 nm using a Lambda 10-3 computer-controlled
filter changer (Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA, USA), a CoolSNAP
HQ2 camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), and an IX-81 inverted
fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were recorded
at 4-s intervals and analyzed using the MetaFluor software (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Changes in intracellular calcium ion
concentrations were measured by randomly selecting DsRed2-positive
cells, which were considered to be transfected cells. Changes in fluorescence
are presented as the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at the
two excitation wavelengths (F340/F380). The fluorescence intensity
ratio at the start of imaging of each cell was defined as &#x0201c;ratio
(at time = 0)&#x0201d;. The difference between the maximum fluorescence
intensity ratio within 48 s of imaging and &#x0201c;ratio (at time

&#x00394;ratio&#x0201d; was defined as the average value of &#x00394;ratio/[ratio
(at time = 0)] for 100 cells in one field. For each measurement condition,
the average normalized &#x00394;ratio for four to six independent wells
was calculated. Half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values were calculated from dose&#x02013;response data using Clampfit
9.2 (Molecular Devices) using Hill&#x02019;s equation.</p><p>When the
