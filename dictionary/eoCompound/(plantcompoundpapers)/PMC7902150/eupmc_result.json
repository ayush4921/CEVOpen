    "<i>Filipendula palmata</i> (Pall.) Maxim. remains unexplored and underutilized resources with a high potential to improve human health. In this study, a new ursane-type triterpenoid, namely, 2<i>α</i>, 3<i>β</i>-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-aldehyde (compound 10), and other 23 known compounds were isolated. 5 triterpenoids (compounds 6, 8, and 10-12), 11 flavonoids (compounds 13-15 and 17-24), 6 phenolic compounds (compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 16), 2 sterols (compounds 3 and 7) were isolated from the aqueous solution extract of the aerial parts of <i>F. palmata</i>. The structures of all compounds were elucidated by the use of extensive spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. The solvent extractions of ethyl acetate fraction were evaluated for antioxidant activities using DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS<sup>+</sup> (2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) methods. The anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The extract cytotoxicity on the cancer cell lines MCF-7, HeLa, 4T1, and A549 was determined by MTT assay. As a result, compounds 10, 11, and 12 exhibited better antioxidant activity compared to the other compounds. Compounds 8-24 had different inhibitory effects on the release of NO, TNF-<i>α</i>, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The new compound has shown a significant inhibiting effect on cancer cells, and the cell inhibition rate increased in a dose-dependent manner. Further research to elucidate the chemical compositions and pharmacological effects of <i>F. palmata</i> is of major importance towards the development and foundation of clinical application of the species."
