    "<i>Momordica dioica</i> have proven medicinal potential of antidiabetic, antiviral and immune stimulating properties. Flavonoids and triterpenoids from <i>M. dioica</i> were more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular docking and <i>in silico</i> ADME predictions methods. According to the binding affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The <i>in vitro</i> protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The <i>in silico</i> binding studies correlated with the <i>in silico</i> binding studies. Further, <i>M. dioica</i> being used as antidiabetic and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, <i>M. dioica</i> phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney disorders.
