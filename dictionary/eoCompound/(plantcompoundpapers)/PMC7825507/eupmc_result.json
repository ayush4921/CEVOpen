    "Root exudates accumulate as a radial gradient around the root, yet little is known about variability at the individual root level. Vertical gradients in soil properties are hypothesized to cause greater accumulation of exudates in deeper soil through hindering diffusion, increasing sorption, and decreasing mineralization. To this end, a single root exudation model coupling concentration specific exudation and depth dependent soil properties was developed. The model was parameterized for a peatland ecosystem to explore deposition to the methanogen community. Numerical experiments indicate that exudates accumulated to a greater extent in deeper soil, albeit the effect was solute specific. Rhizosphere size for glucose doubled between the 10 and 80 cm depths, while the rhizoplane concentration was 1.23 times higher. Root influx of glucose increased from 1.431 to 1.758 nmol cm<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>, representing a recapture efficiency gain of 15.74% (i.e., 69.06% versus 84.8%). Driven by increased root influx, overall net exudation rates of select sugars and amino acids varied by a factor two. Model sensitivity analysis revealed that soil depth and root influx capability are key determinants of the rhizoplane concentration and subsequently net exudation, which determines whether effluxed compounds escape the root oxic shell and are available to the methanogen community."
