    "This study investigates updated information in different search engines on the distribution, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of <i>Brugmansia suaveolens</i> (Solanaceae) using the extracts or chemical compounds at present. This plant has been used in traditional medicine in different cultures as a hallucinatory, analgesic, aphrodisiac, nematicide, sleep inducer, and muscle relaxant, as well as a treatment for rheumatism, asthma, and inflammation. The flowers, fruits, stems, and roots of the plant are used, and different chemical compounds have been identified, such as alkaloids, volatile compounds (mainly terpenes), coumarins, flavonoids, steroids, and hydrocarbons. The concentration of the different compounds varies according to the biotic and abiotic factors to which the plant is exposed. The toxic effect of the plant is mainly attributed to atropine and scopolamine, their averages in the flowers are 0.79 ± 0.03 and 0.72 ± 0.05 mg/g of dry plant, respectively. Pharmacological studies have shown that an aqueous extract exhibits the antinociceptive effect, at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg i.p. in mice. On the other hand, the ethanolic extract at 1000 mg/L, showed a nematocidal activity in vitro of 64% against <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> in 72 h. Likewise, it showed a 100% larvicidal activity at 12.5 mg/L against <i>Ancylostoma spp</i>. In another study, the lethal activity of shrimp in brine from an ethanolic extract showed an LC<sub>50</sub> of 106 µg/mL at double serial concentrations of 1000-0 (µg/mL). Although there are pharmacological and phytochemical studies in the plant, they are still scarce, which has potential for the examination of the biological activity of the more than one hundred compounds that have been reported, many of which have not been evaluated."
