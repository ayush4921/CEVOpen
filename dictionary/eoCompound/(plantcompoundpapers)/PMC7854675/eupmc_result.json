    "Tea leaves possess numerous volatile organic compounds (VOC) that contribute to tea's characteristic aroma. Some components of tea VOC were known to exhibit antimicrobial activity; however, their impact on bacteria remains elusive. Here, we showed that the VOC of fresh aqueous tea leaf extract, recovered through hydrodistillation, promoted cell division and tryptophan-dependent indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production in Pseudomonas sp. NEEL19, a solvent-tolerant isolate of the tea phylloplane. 1-octanol was identified as one of the responsible volatiles stimulating cell division, metabolic change, swimming motility, putative pili/nanowire formation and IAA production, through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, microscopy and partition petri dish culture analyses. The bacterial metabolic responses including IAA production increased under 1-octanol vapor in a dose-dependent manner, whereas direct-contact in liquid culture failed to elicit such response. Thus, volatile 1-octanol emitting from tea leaves is a potential modulator of cell division, colonization and phytohormone production in NEEL19, possibly influencing the tea aroma."
