    "The floral fragrance of plants is an important indicator in their evaluation. The aroma of sweet cherry flowers is mainly derived from their essential oil. In this study, based on the results of a single-factor experiment, a Box-Behnken design was adopted for ultrasound- and microwave-assisted extraction of essential oil from sweet cherry flowers of the Brooks cultivar. With the objective of extracting the maximum essential oil yield (w/w), the optimal extraction process conditions were a liquid-solid ratio of 52 mL g<sup>-1</sup>, an extraction time of 27 min, and a microwave power of 435 W. The essential oil yield was 1.23%, which was close to the theoretical prediction. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of the sweet cherry flowers of four cultivars (Brooks, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit) were identified via headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that a total of 155 VOCs were identified and classified in the essential oil from sweet cherry flowers of four cultivars, 65 of which were shared among the cultivars. The highest contents of VOCs were aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and esters. Ethanol, linalool, lilac alcohol, acetaldehyde, (E)-2-hexenal, benzaldehyde and dimethyl sulfide were the major volatiles, which were mainly responsible for the characteristic aroma of sweet cherry flowers. It was concluded that the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers were qualitatively similar; however, relative content differences were observed in the four cultivars. This study provides a theoretical basis for the metabolism and regulation of the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers."
