    "Plant extracts have gained more attention as natural therapeutic agents against inflammation characterized by an overproduction of several inflammatory mediators such as reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although <i>Abeliophyllum distichum</i> Nakai is generally known for its ornamental value, recent pharmacological research has demonstrated its potential therapeutic properties. Thus, to further evaluate the applicability of <i>A. distichum</i> in the food, cosmetic, and medical industries, we identified the phytochemicals in three organ extracts (fruits: AF, branches: AB, leaves: AL) of <i>A</i>. <i>distichum</i> and determined their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Using UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS, a total of 19 compounds, including dendromoniliside D, forsythoside B, isoacteoside, isomucronulatol 7-O-Glucoside, plantamajoside, and wighteone were identified in the <i>A. distichum</i> organ extracts. AB exhibited a strong reducing power, an oxygen radical antioxidant capacity, and radical scavenging values compared with other samples, whereas AL exhibited the best anti-inflammatory properties. Gene expression, western blot, and molecular docking analyses suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of AL was mediated by its ability to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of reactive oxygen species and/or inhibit LPS-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) in RAW264.7 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that AL is a potential source of phytochemicals that could be used to treat inflammation-associated diseases."
