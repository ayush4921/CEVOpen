    "<h4>Objectives</h4><i>Ferula ovina</i> is an Iranian medicinal plant. Tschimgine and stylosin are two of its major monoterpene derivatives. In this study, we proceeded to investigate some fungal endophytes from <i>F. ovina</i> that can produce plant secondary metabolites.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The isolated endophytic fungi were fermented in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium and their extracts were screened for the presence of the plant compounds by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Endophytes identification was performed by morphological and molecular methods. Three markers (ITS, LSU, and TEF1) were used for accurate molecular identification.<h4>Results</h4>Forty isolates from 9 different genera of endophytic fungi were identified, of which two recently reported species of <i>O. ferulica</i> and <i>Pithoascus persicus</i> were able to produce tschimgine and stylosin.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These fungi can be used as a substitute for the production of plant's medicinal compounds independent of wild populations of the source plant."
