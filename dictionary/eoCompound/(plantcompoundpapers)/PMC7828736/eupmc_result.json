    "<i>Eucryptorrhynchus scrobiculatus</i> and <i>E. brandti</i> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are host-specific pests of <i>Ailanthus altissima</i> (Mill.) Swingle (Sapindales: Simaroubaceae), causing extensive damage to the host. There are no effective attractants available for pest management. The main aim of this study was to explore the role of host plant-derived volatiles in the behavioral response of both weevil species. In a field experiment, both weevil species showed positive response to phloem, and there was no preference for phloem associated with healthy or injured trees. Significantly more <i>E. brandti</i> adults responded to the olfactory treatments compared to <i>E. scrobiculatus</i>. In a large-arena experiment, both males and females of <i>E. scrobiculatus</i> significantly preferred phloem from the tree trunk while adults of <i>E. brandti</i> responded in significantly greater numbers to tree limbs than to any other parts of host. Females and males of <i>E. scrobiculatus</i> responded positively to all parts of host tested in the Y-tube bioassay, while <i>E. brandti</i> adults were only attracted by the phloem from healthy and injured trees. There were dissimilar electroantennographic responses to compounds such as 1-hexanol and (1<i>S</i>)-(-)-<i>β</i>-pinene between the two weevil species. This study represents the first report documenting behavioral and electrophysiological responses of <i>E. scrobiculatus</i> and <i>E. brandti</i> to volatiles from various parts of <i>A. altissima</i> and findings may aid efforts to develop attractants."
