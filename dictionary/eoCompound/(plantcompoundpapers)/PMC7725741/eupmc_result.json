    "Here, we present the data on the biological effects of <i>Hyptis</i> spp. and <i>Lycium</i> spp. plant extracts in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) models of neurodegenerative diseases, which is related to the work presented in the article \"Neurotherapeutic effect of <i>Hyptis</i> spp. leaf extracts in <i>C. elegans</i> models of tauopathy and polyglutamine disease: role of the glutathione redox cycle\" [1]. This dataset was generated to define non-toxic concentrations of these plant extracts and to assess their impact on the motor phenotype and oxidative stress resistance of transgenic <i>C. elegans</i> models of two genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases: Machado-Joseph disease and Frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism associated to the chromosome 17. The impact of the plant extracts on toxicity was assessed using the food-clearance assay, absorbance being measured daily for seven days at 595 nm to quantify <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) strain OP50 bacteria consumption. Worm length and motor behaviour, including spontaneous and stimulated movement, were analysed using videos acquired with an Olympus SZX7 stereomicroscope with an integrated camera (Olympus SC30) and processed using the Image J® software and the Wrmtrck plugin. The resistance to oxidative stress induced by 240 µM juglone was assessed by determining the percentage of live animals after 1 hour of exposure."
