    "Biological nematicides have been widely used to lower the losses generated by phytoparasitic nematodes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the nematicidal effects of <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21(DE3) against <i>Meloidogyne javanica</i> and to identify nematicide-related genes. Culture filtrates of BL21(DE3) caused juvenile mortality and inhibited egg hatching in a dose-dependent manner. In the greenhouse, treatment of tomato seedlings with BL21(DE3) culture filtrates at 50 and 100% concentrations not only reduced the amount of <i>M. javanica</i> egg masses and galls, but improved plant root and shoot fresh weight. Culture filtrate analysis indicated that the nematicidal active ingredients of strain BL21(DE3) were non-proteinaceous, heat and cold resistant, sensitive to pH and volatile. To identify the genes associated with nematicidal activity, a BL21(DE3) library of 5000 mutants was produced using Tn5 transposase insertion. The culture filtrate of the MB12 mutant showed no nematicidal activity after 72 h of treatment and thermal asymmetrical interlaced PCR demonstrated that the <i>carB</i> gene was disrupted. Nematicidal activity was restored when the pH of the MB12 culture filtrate was adjusted to the original pH value (4.15) or following MB12 complementation with the <i>carB</i> gene, confirming a role for <i>carB</i> in mediating pH value and nematicidal activity. The outcomes of this pilot study indicate that BL21(DE3) is a potential microorganism for the continuable biological control of root-knot nematode in tomato and that <i>carB</i> affects the nematicidal activity of BL21(DE3) by modulating the pH environment."
