    "<h4>Main conclusion</h4>The sunflower sesquiterpene lactones 8-epixanthatin and tomentosin can bind to the hydrophobic pocket of sunflower KAI2 with an affinity much higher than for the exogenous ligand KAR. Sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are secondary plant metabolites with a wide range of biological, such as anti-microbial, activities. Intriguingly, the STLs have also been implicated in plant development: in several Asteraceae, STL levels correlate with the photo-inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Although this effect was suggested to be due to auxin transport inhibition, there is no structural-functional evidence for this claim. Intriguingly, the light-induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis has been ascribed to HYPOSENSITIVE TO LIGHT/KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (HTL/KAI2) signaling. KAI2 was discovered because of its affinity to the smoke-derived karrikin (KAR), though it is generally assumed that KAI2 has another, endogenous but so far elusive, ligand rather than the exogenous KARs. Here, we postulate that the effect of STLs on hypocotyl elongation is mediated through KAI2 signaling. To support this hypothesis, we have generated homology models of the sunflower KAI2s (HaKAI2s) and used them for molecular docking studies with STLs. Our results show that particularly two sunflower STLs, 8-epixanthatin and tomentosin, can bind to the hydrophobic pockets of HaKAI2s with high affinity. Our results are in line with a recent study, showing that these two STLs accumulate in the light-exposed hypocotyls of sunflower. This finding sheds light on the effect of STLs in hypocotyl elongation that has been reported for many decades but without conclusive insight in the elusive mechanism underlying this effect."
