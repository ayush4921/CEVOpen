    "Plants are one of a prefect source of natural effective compounds that have antimicrobial, and other activities. This study investigated the activity of the aqueous extract for three wild edible plants (<i>Sonchus oleraceus</i>, <i>Cichorium pumilum,</i> and <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>) at three concentrations (1.5, 2.5 and 5 mg/ml) as antifungal and antitoxigenic. Many functional groups such as alcohols, phenols, alkanes and alkenes, etc were appeared in aqueous extracts by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Where an extract of <i>Portulaca oleracea</i> gave a greater total phenolic and flavonoids were 210.4 ± 1.15 and 36.7 ± 0.79 mg/mL, respectively, followed by <i>Sonchus oleraceus</i> (192.3 ± 2.11 mg/mL) and <i>Cichorium pumilum</i> (186.4 ± 2.18 mg/mL). The results indicated that increasing the concentration of the extract, the area of inhibition zone increased with all treatments, where the highest inhibition zone was observed using 5 mg/ml for <i>Portulaca oleracea</i> extract was 17.1 ± 1.7, 26.5 ± 1.5 and 22.8.±2.3 mm against <i>Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus ochraceus</i> and <i>Aspergillus parasiticus</i>, respectively, while the lowest antifungal activity was marked with <i>Cichorium pumilum</i> extract with all tested fungi. The results have also indicated that the aqueous extract has inhibited formed of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) and ochratoxin A (OTA), where the percentages of inhibition AFB<sub>1</sub> were 78.03, 68.8 and 81.7% after treated yeast extract sucrose (YES) media by 5 mg crude extract for extract <i>Sonchus oleraceus, Cichorium pumilum</i> and <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, respectively. In contrast, the inhibitory effect against OTA at the same concentration was 77.5, 72.3, and 85.2% in the same order for plants. Finally, these plants provide an aqueous extract that contains many effective compounds that enable to play the role of antifungal and antitoxigenic<b>.</b>"
