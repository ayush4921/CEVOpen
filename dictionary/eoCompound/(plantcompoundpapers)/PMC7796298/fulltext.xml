Various NTO treatment technologies are being developed for the treatment of wastewater from industrial munition facilities. This is the first study to explore the potential phytoremediation of industrial NTO-wastewater using vetiver grass (<italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic> L.). Here, we present evidence that vetiver can effectively remove NTO from wastewater, and also translocated NTO from root to shoot. NTO was phytotoxic and resulted in a loss of plant biomass and chlorophyll. The metabolomic analysis showed significant differences between treated and control samples, with the upregulation of specific pathways such as glycerophosphate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, providing a glimpse into the stress alleviation strategy of vetiver. One of the mechanisms of NTO stress reduction was the excretion of solid crystals. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of NTO crystals in the plant exudates. Further characterization of the exudates is in progress to ascertain the purity of these crystals, and if vetiver could be used for phytomining NTO from industrial wastewater.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>insensitive munitions</kwd><kwd>3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO)</kwd><kwd>industrial wastewater</kwd><kwd>vetiver grass</kwd><kwd>phytoremediation</kwd><kwd>phytoextraction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-00074"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Conventional explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) have been used in weapons for decades. Since the 1990s, however, the focus has shifted to developing formulations of insensitive munitions (IMs), which are safer to handle but remain as effective as conventional explosives [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) is one of the main constituents of IM formulations [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is less sensitive to heat and shock and is safer to handle and transport. Detailed chemical properties of NTO are presented in Supplementary Information (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00074">Table S1</xref>). NTO is more water-soluble than conventional explosives such as RDX and TNT. The solubility of NTO in water increases from 9.97 to 1989.67 g/L when the temperature increases from 11 to 33 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to its high solubility, wastewater generated in munition plants containing NTO requires physical, chemical, and/or biological treatment according to regulatory standards before being released into the environment.</p><p>As wastewaters produced in industrial munition facilities have the potential to contain residues of explosive compounds and their transformation products, they are subjected to extensive industrial waste treatment processes under regulatory discharge guidelines [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These processes can be expensive and inefficient. Aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment processes have been explored for the remediation of NTO in wastewater. Under anaerobic conditions, NTO is biotransformed into ATO (3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-5-one), which requires further treatment based on regulatory standards. In a sequential anaerobic-aerobic biodegradation study, while NTO biotransformed into ATO under anaerobic conditions, ATO later mineralized under aerobic conditions [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Sorbents such as granular activated carbon (GAC) are ineffective, as NTO carries an electrostatic charge in aqueous solutions and sorbs very poorly to GAC [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) and electrochemical degradation for NTO removal either produce concentrated waste streams or additional regulated byproducts [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A Fe/Cu bimetal system was used to remove NTO from an aquatic medium, and a pH and a solid-to-liquid ratio-based removal of NTO was reported [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The phototransformation of NTO in an aqueous medium was also tested [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The fate of NTO during biological wastewater treatment was also studied, and the ability of wastewater sludges to promote the biotransformation of NTO to ATO was documented [<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>It is important to develop more effective treatment technologies for wastewater streams containing NTO, since the processes tested so far are expensive, ineffective, or produce harmful byproducts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential use of vetiver grass (<italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic> L.) to remove NTO from wastewater. Vetiver is high biomass, fast-growing, perennial grass. It has an extensive root system that can penetrate deeply (3&#x02013;4 m). Vetiver&#x02019;s ability to remove various environmental contaminants including various metals and antibiotics is well studied [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Vetiver was also shown to be effective in the remediation of various explosive compounds from the environment [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies showed that vetiver grass has the potential to remove TNT, RDX, HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane), DNAN (2,4-dinitroanisole), and NQ (nitroguanidine) from hydroponic media [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Vetiver&#x02019;s ability to uptake TNT from the soil in the presence of urea has also been reported [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

While vetiver has been recognized as an effective candidate for the phytoremediation of several explosive compounds, its potential for removing NTO from water or soil has not yet been tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-00074"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-26-00074"><title>2.1. Uptake of NTO by Vetiver Grass</title><p>The untreated NTO-wastewater used in this study was alkaline, with a pH of 10.2 &#x000b1; 0.1 (&#x000b1; standard deviation, SD). NTO concentration in the wastewater was measured as 23,161 &#x000b1; 135 mg/L (&#x000b1;SD). Nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium-nitrogen concentrations in the wastewater were 1680 &#x000b1; 185 (&#x000b1;SD), 1.07 &#x000b1; 0.05 (&#x000b1;SD), and 19.8 &#x000b1; 2.3 mg/L (&#x000b1;SD), respectively. The wastewater also contained 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 mg/L (&#x000b1;SD) of Na and 44 &#x000b1; 3 mg/L (&#x000b1;SD) of Ca.</p><p>Two different treatments were used for this study: (1) vetiver grown in NTO-wastewater (NV), and (2) NTO-wastewater without plants (negative control, NC). NV and NC were set up in triplicate, resulting in six containers in total. The duration of the entire experiment was 100 days. Vetiver batches were replaced every 20 days in NV treatment resulting in five successive batch studies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00074-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00074">Table S2</xref> present the trend of average NTO reduction in both NV and NC treatments. At the end of the 100-day study, the average NTO concentration was reduced by 83.68 &#x000b1; 0.43% (&#x000b1;SD) of its initial concentration in NV treatments whereas only 5.0 &#x000b1; 1.3% (&#x000b1;SD). NTO reduction was estimated in NC treatments. For NV treatments, the NTO concentration reduced steadily from the first to the fourth successive batches and eventually stayed steady from days 80&#x02013;100 for the 5th batch of vetiver. Varying amounts of NTO were removed in the NV treatments by successive batches of vetiver. While the first batch removed 22.73 &#x000b1; 1.07% (&#x000b1;SD) of the initial NTO, later batches removed 51.97 &#x000b1; 0.56% (&#x000b1;SD), 68.9 &#x000b1; 0.9% (&#x000b1;SD), 83.22 &#x000b1; 1.06% (&#x000b1;SD), and 83.68 &#x000b1; 0.43% (&#x000b1;SD). NTO reduction was measured at the end of the second, third, fourth, and fifth batches, respectively. No significant NTO reduction in NC treatments indicated that NTO reduction was caused by the vetiver plants. Microbiological transformation of NTO to ATO to urea, CO2, and N2 has been reported earlier [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For this study, no transformation products of NTO were detected in the NTO-wastewater in NV treatments, indicating that NTO had been taken up by vetiver over time. Previous studies showed that plants such as big bluestem (<italic>Andropogon gerardii</italic>), Indiangrass (<italic>Sorghastrum nutans</italic>), and switchgrass (<italic>Panicum virgatum</italic>) uptake DNAN and NQ as nitrogen sources and store them in their roots and shoots [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. RDX bioaccumulates in the edible parts of plants such as lettuce, tomatoes, and corn [<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We previously reported that vetiver is capable of taking up TNT from soil and water and degrading it within its tissue [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A decrease in NTO concentration in NV treatments indicate NTO uptake by vetiver. However, since the NTO-wastewater also contained high levels of nitrate, it is not clear if the vetiver used NTO as a nitrogen source.</p><p>The presence of NTO in vetiver roots and shoots was detected in plants collected from NV treatments. It was estimated that on average, vetiver shoots and roots contained 830.9 &#x000b1; 95.1 (&#x000b1;SD) and 747.8 &#x000b1; 73.5 mg/kg (&#x000b1;SD) NTO, respectively. The calculated translocation factor (TF) for NTO in vetiver was 1.11, which indicated that vetiver translocated NTO from root to shoot. The presence of NTO inside vetiver roots and shoots indicated that NTO had been taken up by vetiver, and a translocation factor above 1 demonstrates that vetiver translocated NTO from its roots to its shoots. Many studies have previously reported the translocation of explosives such as DNAN, NQ, TNT, and RDX by plants to their above-ground biomass [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to report the translocation of NTO in a plant.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00074-f002">Figure 2</xref> presents the change in nitrate concentration in NTO-wastewater over time for NV and NC treatments. For NV treatments, 37.26 &#x000b1; 4.52% (&#x000b1;SD) reduction in nitrate in the NTO-wastewater in comparison to its initial value was observed during this study. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and the reduction in nitrate in NV treatments is due to its uptake by vetiver plants. In contrast, for the NC treatments, nitrate concentration increased by 14.88 &#x000b1; 3.34% (&#x000b1;SD) on average from its initial concentration during the study. Nitrate efflux from plants is common and occurs in both stressed and non-stressed plants. Efflux increased in plants that are subjected to mechanical or transplantation stress or changes in the pH of the media [<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-26-00074"><title>2.2. NTO Phytotoxicity Analysis</title><p>At the beginning of each successive batch study, vetiver plants were individually weighed before introducing them to the experimental treatment, NV (vetiver grown in NTO-wastewater). Each successive batch of plants introduced was of approximately the same size and weight (21.1 &#x000b1; 0.7 g (&#x000b1;SD)) as the previous batch. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00074-f003">Figure 3</xref>A presents the change in plant biomass over time. At the end of each successive batch, on average, vetiver lost 16.07 &#x000b1; 6.83% (&#x000b1;SD) of its initial biomass in NV treatments. It was observed that in the first three successive batches, plant biomass loss was higher (22.01 &#x000b1; 0.20% (&#x000b1;SD), 18.2 &#x000b1; 0.6% (&#x000b1;SD), and 22.5 &#x000b1; 0.5% (&#x000b1;SD), respectively). However, for the fourth and fifth batches, the loss in biomass was much lower (8.59 &#x000b1; 0.30% (&#x000b1;SD), and 9.03 &#x000b1; 0.40% (&#x000b1;SD) respectively). NTO concentration was reduced by 69&#x02013;83% of its initial value when the last two batches of plants were introduced, which might be within the tolerance range of NTO for vetiver. From the loss in vetiver biomass in the NV samples, it is clear that NTO is toxic to vetiver plants. Our results are similar to other studies on the effect of explosive compounds on plants. Studies showed that the biomass of <italic>L. sativa</italic> was significantly reduced by TNT at a concentration higher than 32 mg/kg [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00074" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

An average chlorophyll reduction of 60.18 &#x000b1; 18.79% (&#x000b1;SD) was noted for the four successive batches (data for the fourth batch were not analyzed). These results show that NTO is toxic to vetiver and impacts its chlorophyll content.

Control tissues showed statistically significant differences in response when compared to treated shoot and root tissue in the PLS-DA model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00074-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B).

The overall metabolic response resembles the osmotic stress response generated by metal or salt stress in plants. Enhancement of galactose and amino acid metabolism could serve to provide osmoprotectants. An increase in lipid peroxidation and membrane damage is indicated by the presence of high levels of phospholipids and linoleic acid.

The detailed characterization of NTO-wastewater was performed before the study. The pH of the wastewater was measured using an PC 700 pH meter, Oakton, Vernon Hills, IL, USA. HACH test kits, HACH Company, Loveland, CO, USA were used to measure the total nitrogen (TN), ammonia-nitrogen (N-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of the wastewater sample. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) concentrations of the wastewater were measured using Dionex ion chromatography (IC) with IonPac AS16 (4 mm &#x000d7; 250 mm, Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with a guard column IonPac AG16 (4 mm &#x000d7; 50 mm, Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the wastewater sampled was measured using a UV-Persulfate TOC Analyzer Phoenix 8000 (Teledyne Tekmar, Mason, OH, USA). In addition, NTO-containing wastewater sample was analyzed for Na, Ca, K, and Mg using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, 5100 SVDV, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). NTO concentration in wastewater samples was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA, Infinity Series 1260, equipped with a ProStar 410 Auto-sampler and a DAD detector and coupled with a porous graphite column Hypercarb 7 ram, 100 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm).

The sample injection volume was 35 &#x003bc;L. The analytical wavelengths were 215 nm. Under these conditions, NTO elutes at 4.2 min. A calibration range from 1 to 50 mg/L was used for the analysis and the wastewater samples were diluted as required. Dilution factors were considered while calculating the final amount. A known quality check (QC) standard was inserted after every 10 samples to validate the efficiency of the analytical procedure.

Experimental Setup and Analyses</title><p>Vetiver grass (<italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic> L.) was purchased from Agriflora Tropical, Puerto Rico, USA. Plants were initially potted in garden soil and grown there for 30 days. The plants were then placed in a hydroponic system in half-strength Hoagland&#x02019;s solution for 14 days for acclimatization. After 14 days, the plants were removed from the Hoagland&#x02019;s solution, dried completely using paper towels, weighed, and used for the experiment. The experiment was conducted in 1 L plastic bottles with a working volume of 500 mL. Two different treatments were used: vetiver in NTO-wastewater (NV) (triplicates), and NTO-wastewater without any vetiver plant (negative control, NC) (triplicates). A 4% plant to solution ratio was maintained for each treatment. All vetiver plants were trimmed from their shoots and roots in such a way that all of them were of approximately the same size and weight. No plant growth nutrients were provided for NV treatments. The 100-day-long experiment was conducted in five successive batch studies of 20 days each. After every 20 days, the old batches of vetiver plants were replaced by new batches of plants. Wastewater samples including all replicates were collected at the same time from each of the bottles periodically. Before collecting the samples, each bottle was mixed thoroughly by swirling so that a homogenous solution can be obtained inside the bottles. Samples were collected by submerging the pipette in the liquid part of the bottles. Samples were analyzed for their NTO concentration, and nitrate concentration. For each measurement (NTO and nitrate concentration), samples were analyzed in triplicates, and analyzed concentrations were compared in Microsoft Excel (version 2007) by calculating mean and standard deviation values.</p><p>Vetiver plants collected from NV treatments were also tested for NTO translocation inside the vetiver&#x02019;s body. Both vetiver roots and shoots were collected (in triplicates) at the end of each successive batch and were analyzed separately to determine NTO concentration in them. A 0.5 g sample (root and shoot) was initially ground to a powder with liquid nitrogen. The powdered tissue was transferred to a tube and 5 mL of acetonitrile was added to each sample. The tubes were kept on a tube rotator for 24 h. Subsequently, the samples were filtered using a 0.45 &#x000b5;m syringe filter and were analyzed for NTO using HPLC.

The dwell time was set at 5 ms. Purified standards were used to optimize the compound-specific MS/MS parameters. Peaks were manually reviewed, and the peak area of each metabolite was intergraded through Multiquant v3.0 (Sciex). All data processing was done following standard protocol 3450. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 (<uri xlink:href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca">http://www.metaboanalyst.ca</uri>) was used for all statistical analyses.

Conclusions</title><p>We evaluated the potential of using vetiver grass to remove NTO from wastewater collected from a munition manufacturing facility. In addition to a high concentration of NTO, the wastewater also contained a high concentration of nitrate. The wastewater was treated with five successive batches of vetiver hydroponically, and the batches were replaced every 20 days. The average NTO concentration decreased by 84% in 100 days. In control tanks without vetiver, the reduction was about 5% during the same period. NTO was detected in root and shoot tissues of vetiver, and high translocation from root to shoot was observed. The vetiver plants showed toxicity symptoms such as a reduction in biomass and a decline in chlorophyll when exposed to NTO. Metabolomic studies indicated an increase in lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, and osmotic stress in vetiver exposed to NTO. During the batch studies, NTO-treated plants produced an exudate at the junction of root and shoot. The amounts of exudates showed a decreasing trend from the first to the fifth batches. While the highest amount was exuded in the second batch, very little exudation was seen in the fourth and fifth batches, as NTO levels declined. SEM, ESI-MS, and FTIR spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of NTO crystals in the plant exudates, indicating vetiver exudation of NTO as a mechanism to relieve stress in vetiver. Further studies are needed to understand whether any plant or microorganism- mediated biotransformation or degradation of NTO occurs in vetiver. Further studies are also needed to test the feasibility of this technology in large-scale applications under controlled greenhouse environments. If proven feasible in scaled-up settings, existing NTO wastewater holding tanks can be retrofitted with floating treatment platforms of vetiver. At regular intervals, vetiver biomass can be removed and incinerated under controlled conditions. A significant reduction in the total amount of energetics waste is possible by applying this technology at an expense that is much lower than conventional hazardous waste treatment technologies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Tsan-Liang Su, and Andrew Mai for their analytical help; Zhaoyu Zheng, and Athula Attygalle and the Center for Mass Spectrometry (Stevens Institute of Technology) for their help with ESI-MS analysis; and Tseng-Ming Chou for his help with SEM analysis (the Laboratory for Multiscale Imaging, Stevens Institute of Technology).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-molecules-26-00074"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online, Table S1: Relevant chemical properties of NTO.
