    "<h4>Background</h4>Tomato plant growth is frequently hampered by a high susceptibility to pests and diseases. Traditional chemical control causes a serious impact on both the environment and human health. Therefore, seeking environment-friendly and cost-effective green methods in agricultural production becomes crucial nowadays. Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) can promote plant growth through biological activity. Their use is considered to be a promising sustainable approach for crop growth. Moreover, a vast number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolite production are being revealed in PGPR, which helps to find potential anti-microbial activities for tomato disease control.<h4>Results</h4>We isolated 181 Bacillus-like strains from healthy tomato, rhizosphere soil, and tomato tissues. In vitro antagonistic assays revealed that 34 Bacillus strains have antimicrobial activity against Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas syringae; Rhizoctonia solani; Botrytis cinerea; Verticillium dahliae and Phytophthora infestans. The genomes of 10 Bacillus and Paenibacillus strains with good antagonistic activity were sequenced. Via genome mining approaches, we identified 120 BGCs encoding NRPs, PKs-NRPs, PKs, terpenes and bacteriocins, including known compounds such as fengycin, surfactin, bacillibactin, subtilin, etc. In addition, several novel BGCs were identified. We discovered that the NRPs and PKs-NRPs BGCs in Bacillus species are encoding highly conserved known compounds as well as various novel variants.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study highlights the great number of varieties of BGCs in Bacillus strains. These findings pave the road for future usage of Bacillus strains as biocontrol agents for tomato disease control and are a resource arsenal for novel antimicrobial discovery."
