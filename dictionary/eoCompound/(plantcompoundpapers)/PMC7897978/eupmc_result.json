    "<h4>Background</h4>Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are becoming the major cause of death. <i>Urtica simensis</i> is one of endogenous plant which treats a wide range of disease conditions including heart diseases. However, there is limited information on safety and efficacy of the plant.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the in vitro antioxidant, the in vivo cardioprotective activity of crude extract and solvent fractions of <i>Urtica simensis</i> leaves on cyclophosphamide-induced myocardial injury.<h4>Methods</h4>The cardioprotective activity of the crude extract, aqueous and hexane fraction of <i>Urtica simensis</i> leaves was evaluated based on anatomical, biochemical and histopathological methods. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the plant was also assayed in terms of free radical scavenging activity (RSA).<h4>Results</h4>Crude extract and solvent fractions of <i>Urtica simensis</i> significantly prevented the deleterious effect of cyclophosphamide on body weight (P<0.001), heart weight to body ratio (P<0.01), cardiac biomarkers including troponin I (P<0.01), alanine transaminase (ALT) (P<0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P<0.01) and lipid profiles including triglycerides (P<0.001) and total cholesterol (P<0.01). The histopathological study confirmed presence of necrosis, oedema and haemorrhage on cyclophosphamide alone-treated groups while the 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg of the crude extract and aqueous fraction showed normal cardiocytes. The antioxidant assay of <i>Urtica simensis</i> plant exhibited free radical scavenging activity of inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) for the crude extract with the values of 63.27µg/mL, aqueous fraction with the values of 136.38µg/mL and hexane fraction with the values of 258.70µg/mL.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Crude extract and solvent fractions of <i>Urtica simensis</i> leaves have cardioprotective activities. The cardioprotective effect could be attributed to the antioxidant activity of the plant extracts. However, this requires further in-depth understanding."
