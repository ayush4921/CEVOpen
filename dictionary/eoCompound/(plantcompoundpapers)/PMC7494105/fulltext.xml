They specifically identify host-plant leaves using their keen sense of taste. Plant secondary metabolites and sugars are thought to be key chemical cues that enable insects to identify host plants and evaluate their quality as food. However, the neuronal and behavioral mechanisms of host-plant recognition are poorly understood. Here, we report a two-factor host acceptance system in larvae of the silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, a specialist on several mulberry species. The first step is controlled by a chemosensory organ, the maxillary palp (MP). During palpation at the leaf edge, the MP detects trace amounts of leaf-surface compounds, which enables host-plant recognition without biting. Chemosensory neurons in the MP are tuned with ultrahigh sensitivity (thresholds of attomolar to femtomolar) to chlorogenic acid (CGA), quercetin glycosides, and &#x003b2;-sitosterol (&#x003b2;sito). Only if these 3 compounds are detected does the larva make a test bite, which is evaluated in the second step. Low-sensitivity neurons in another chemosensory organ, the maxillary galea (MG), mainly detect sucrose in the leaf sap exuded by test biting, allowing larvae to accept the leaf and proceed to persistent biting (feeding). The two-factor host acceptance system reported here may commonly underlie stereotyped feeding behavior in many phytophagous insects and determine their feeding habits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Silkworm larvae are well known for their preference for mulberry leaves; this study shows that they choose their food by using a two-factor host acceptance system, deploying two different organs and sets of chemosensory neurons with differing sensitivities operating sequentially in time.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K19261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Ryoichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18J00733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5900-7077</contrib-id><name><surname>Endo</surname><given-names>Haruka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>1.

Many herbivorous insects have adapted to a limited range of host plants by overcoming plant defenses against insect herbivory, resulting in mono- and oligophagous insects (so-called specialist insects) [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In parallel, specialists are able to precisely distinguish their host plants from other nonhost plants in their ecosystem using chemical senses, including gustation and olfaction [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In general, gustation is important in determining the acceptance or rejection of a potential food source, whereas olfaction is required when searching for host plants from a distance [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Plant-feeding insect larvae exhibit a typical stepwise feeding behavior, comprising foraging, palpation, biting, and swallowing [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sensory exploration by palpation of the leaf surface is important for host-plant selection in various plant-feeding insects, such as caterpillars, beetles, and grasshoppers [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, the meadow grasshopper <italic>Chorthippus parallelus</italic> sometimes rejects a diet following palpation using peripheral chemosensory organs without biting [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conversely, leaf-surface extracts of the host plant <italic>Poa annua</italic> induced biting behavior in the migratory locust <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, whereas those of nonhost plants were rejected [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, insects use leaf-surface compounds as chemical cues for host-plant selection, but the neuronal basis for this behavior and to what extent the leaf-surface behavior contributes to whole host-plant selection or leaf choice are poorly understood.</p><p>Feeding in insect herbivores is controlled by their physiological responses to phytochemicals that determine the acceptance or rejection of a leaf based on the balance of feeding stimulants and deterrents contained in plant leaves [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chemical ecological studies have identified plant secondary metabolites as feeding stimulants and deterrents for many insect herbivores [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, with regard to the silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, a specialist on mulberry leaves, Hamamura and his colleagues identified nonvolatile compounds from mulberry leaves as key signals: isoquercitrin (ISQ) and &#x003b2;-sitosterol (&#x003b2;sito) as biting factors and chlorogenic acid (CGA) as a feeding stimulant that increases feeding amounts in a long-term assay [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, feeding stimulants and deterrents in the diet choice have been evaluated by their effects on the number of bites and feeding amounts in most cases. However, these observations do not always reflect the instantaneous behavior of insects that accept or reject certain plants [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and thus, careful investigation of behavior at the leaf surface is required for further understanding of role of plant secondary metabolites in host-plant selection.</p><p>In the present study, we assigned chemical host cues to taste organs and feeding behaviors to precisely understand the mechanisms underpinning host acceptance in the silkworm. We found that ultrasensitive chemosensory neurons in the maxillary palp (MP) of silkworm larvae detect a set of key mulberry compounds, including CGA, quercetin glycosides, and &#x003b2;sito, inducing a test bite. Sucrose and <italic>myo</italic>-inositol in leaf saps stimulate lateral sensilla in the maxillary galea (MG) to induce continuous biting and acceptance of the leaf. We propose a two-factor host acceptance system, controlled by 2 peripheral chemosensory organs and mainly driven by 6 phytochemicals, that underlies oligophagy in silkworms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Two peripheral chemosensory organs control two-step biting behaviors in the silkworm</title><p>To clarify the mechanism of host acceptance by silkworm larvae, we observed larval feeding of a host leaf from white mulberry <italic>Morus alba</italic>. When a silkworm encounters a leaf, it first palpates the leaf edge using a peripheral chemosensory organ known as the maxilla, intermittently bites the edge several times, and finally engages in continuous biting (2&#x02013;3 times per second) with its head shaking in the dorsoventral direction along the leaf edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s005">S1 Movie</xref>). The intermittent biting with palpation and the continuous biting with head-moving are termed test biting and persistent biting [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We hypothesized that sensing of chemical cues from an <italic>M</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> leaf via the maxilla induces test biting because test biting always occurs after palpation with the maxilla. The maxilla consists of the MP and MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To assess the roles of the MP and MG in the induction of test biting, we used MP- or MG-ablated larvae. MP-ablated larvae showed palpation, but no test or persistent biting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s006">S2 Movie</xref>). MG-ablated larvae showed palpation and test biting, stopped biting within 1 minute, and did not progress to persistent biting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s007">S3 Movie</xref>). When we ablated an olfactory organ antenna (AN), the larvae showed palpation, test biting, and persistent biting similar to intact larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s008">S4 Movie</xref>). Note that AN ablation increased the number of bites during first 30 seconds, although the reasons for this are unclear. These results indicate that the MP and MG are essential for the induction of test and persistent biting.</p><fig id="pbio.3000828.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000828.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>MP and MG are responsible for test and persistent biting.</title><p>(A) Feeding on mulberry leaves by silkworm larvae.

Of the larvae, 80% &#x000b1; 11.5%, 53.3% &#x000b1; 14.5%, and 30% &#x000b1; 10% proceeded to persistent biting of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>alba</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oleraceus</italic>, and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic>, respectively. In contrast, the larvae had a lower probability of test biting (3%&#x02013;33%) of 12 inedible leaves, which were finally rejected by most of them without persistent biting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Thus, the probability of test biting was higher for edible than for inedible leaves, and persistent biting was induced only by edible leaves. These results suggest that silkworm larvae select their diet sequentially at 2 points, before test and persistent biting, and that host-plant recognition is largely completed when they make a first bite.</p><fig id="pbio.3000828.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000828.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>The MP detects leaf-surface compounds and triggers test biting of edible leaves.</title><p>(A and B) Proportion of larvae showing test biting (A) and persistent biting (B) of edible and inedible leaves.

Therefore, we hypothesized that sugars in the leaf sap exuded by test biting stimulate the MG and induce persistent biting. Because feeding initiation is strictly regulated by test biting, we conducted an agar-based food intake assay using starved larvae [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to simply evaluate persistent biting. In this assay, starved larvae no longer exert specific preference for mulberry leaves and sometimes randomly bite; this biting substitutes for test biting, and consequently, persistent biting occurred in the absence of the inducers of test biting. Alternatively, unlike when feeding on leaves, the MG directly detected high concentrations of compounds at the agar surface during palpation, resulting in induction of persistent biting. Larvae fed an agar diet containing sucrose at &#x0003e;10 mM showed persistent biting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000828.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The amount of food intake seemed to correlate with the duration of persistent biting.

Since the 1970s, entomologists have noticed that insects may identify their host plants at the leaf surface, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remained largely unknown. We report here that ultrasensitive chemosensory neurons in the MP enable silkworm larvae to sense leaf-surface compounds and thus recognize their host plants. CGA, quercetin glycosides, and &#x003b2;sito were isolated as feeding stimulants for silkworm larvae, but it had been generally thought that these compounds could not explain the preference for mulberry leaves by silkworms because they are not specific to mulberry. Now, our findings suggest that the combination of the 3 compounds at the leaf surface explains the preference. Silkworm larvae do not feed on some Moraceae leaves, such as those of fig trees, but will feed on an agar-based diet containing both nonhost Moraceae leaves and mulberry leaves [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting that the nonhost Moraceae leaves do not contain feeding deterrents, but rather lack feeding stimulants. The composition of the inducers of test biting at the leaf surface can vary, even among the Moraceae. Alternatively, there may be limited plant species that produce the required combination within the habitat of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>madarina</italic>, an ancestor of the domesticated silkworm.</p><p>Host-plant recognition in larval feeding and adult oviposition seem to employ quite similar systems, driven by multiple host-plant compounds. Some butterflies are reported to require a specific combination of 6&#x02013;10 host-plant compounds to induce egg laying [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This requirement is very similar to the host-plant acceptance mechanisms that we identified in silkworm larvae feeding. Furthermore, in the swallowtail butterfly <italic>Papilio xuthus</italic>, a specialist feeder on Rutaceae plants, a specific combination of the 3 neurons detecting multiple oviposition stimulants is responsible for oviposition [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The requirement of the combination of 3 compounds to trigger test biting in silkworm larvae suggests that different chemosensory neurons are responsible for CGA, quercetin glycosides, and &#x003b2;sito and that the firing of multiple neurons is required to trigger test biting. Thus, insect herbivores may utilize their own combinations of phytochemicals for host-plant recognition in feeding and oviposition.</p><p>Our study clarifies an essential role of the MP in host-plant selection and feeding initiation in the silkworm. It was known that the MP has both gustatory and olfactory chemosensory neurons in lepidopteran insects [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but its role in gustation had previously been poorly studied. We found that the silkworm MP is tuned to several mulberry compounds, but the specificities of more than 20 gustatory neurons in the MP [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for chemical tastants such as sugars, amino acids, secondary metabolites, salt, and water remain largely uncharacterized. Future work will identify the neurons and receptor molecules that are essential for host-plant recognition. In addition, the possible role of olfaction by the MP in host-plant selection should be addressed. To our knowledge, the sensitivity of the attomolar and femtomolar ranges in gustation is the highest determined to date in insects and other animals. The leaf-surface cuticles are covered by a waxy layer, and therefore, the amounts of phytochemicals at the leaf surface are expected to be low. It is plausible that this ultrahigh sensitivity of the MP is necessary to detect trace amounts of inducers of test biting at the leaf surface.</p><p>The MG has been shown to play a main role in host-plant selection in lepidopteran insects [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The medial styloconic sensillum (MS) of the silkworm MG is known to respond to feeding deterrents, including coumarin, caffeine, and nicotine, at micromolar to millimolar levels [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Considering the two-factor host acceptance system, a probable role of the MS in the silkworm is to probe for toxic compounds in leaf sap generated by test biting. Most larvae exhibiting test biting on inedible leaves did not proceed to persistent biting, supporting the putative role of the MS in a final check to exclude inedible leaves by detecting feeding deterrents. Numerous information by previous studies on caterpillar neurophysiological responses of the MG to feeding deterrents [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] may suggest a similar role of MG in other lepidopteran insects. Note that the MG in some lepidopteran species respond to host-plant secondary metabolites [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whereas silkworm MG did not respond to mulberry secondary metabolites we tested (CGA and quercetin glycosides) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). In these species, host-plant secondary compounds may stimulate the MG and induce persistent biting in combination with sucrose and <italic>myo</italic>-inositol. Meanwhile, insect herbivores often reject a leaf without biting. Glendinning and colleagues reported that <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> larvae rejected a diet treated with an extract from a nonhost plant by sensing it via the MP [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], suggesting the possibility that the MP senses feeding deterrents at the leaf surface with ultrahigh sensitivity. Thus, the two-factor host acceptance system likely comprises sensory responses to deterrents and stimulants by both the MP and MG.</p><p>By expanding existing models for caterpillars that suggest that feeding is governed by the balance of feeding stimulants and deterrents that stimulate the MG [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the two-factor host acceptance system we proposed here may offer a general explanation of host-plant selection in lepidopteran insects. In monophagous/oligophagous caterpillars (i.e., specialists), host-plant recognition by MP is probably conserved, and the tuning of neurons in the MP to unique combinations of phytochemicals must reflect a history of insect adaptation to their host plants. In polyphagous caterpillars (i.e., generalists), feeding initiation may be less restricted by the MP; thus, rejection of foods may fall under control of responses by the MG to deterrent compounds as shown in previous studies [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The stepwise feeding behavior, comprising feeding initiation by recognizing specific foods and followed by sustained feeding, is reported in not only phytophagous insects like caterpillars [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and grasshoppers [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] but a wider range of insects. In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the yeast feeding program starts with proboscis extension regulated by the labellum, and subsequent sustained feeding is regulated by taste pegs [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This suggests that the two-factor system for diet choice, utilizing different chemosensory organs and operating sequentially in time, is largely conserved beyond phytophagous insects. Further comparative studies using other insects will reveal a more concrete picture of the two-factor host acceptance system underpinning their feeding habits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Insects</title><p>The silkworm (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>mori</italic> Kinshu &#x000d7; Showa hybrid) eggs were purchased from Ueda Sanshu Ltd (Nagano, Japan).

This mixture solution was vortexed well and poured into a 90-mm petri dish (Kanto chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan). After the agar-based diet solidified, &#x003b2;sito dissolved in EtOH was applied to the diet, followed by EtOH evaporation. For preparation of agar-based diets containing mulberry leaf extract, mulberry leaves were cut into small pieces and dried in a drying machine at 60&#x000b0;C. Dried leaves were crushed into powder. The composition of the mulberry leaf extract diet was 75% mulberry leaf powder (w/v), 1% agarose (w/v), and 24% Elix water (v/v) based on the ratio of dry and wet mass of intact mulberry leaves. Three to five larvae were put on each petri dish, and larval mass before and after 3 h feeding was measured. Increases of larval mass were regarded as amounts of food intake because no feces were observed after 3 h feeding at 25&#x000b0;C. We adopted increases of body mass (mg) as the index of food intake because no significant correlation between amount of food intake and the original body mass was observed (r = 0.11, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.5) by Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Tip recording</title><p>Tip recordings from all sensilla of the MP and the lateral and medial sensilla of the MG were conducted to determine whether neurons respond to CGA, ISQ, Q3R, and &#x003b2;sito. All 8 sensilla in the MP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) were stimulated together. Because LS and MS in MG have a <italic>myo</italic>-inositol neuron and a deterrent neuron that detects nicotine, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], they were used as positive control for stimulants of LS and MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000828.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). Fifth-instar larvae starved until use were used for recording. CGA, ISQ, and Q3R were dissolved and serially diluted in water, whereas &#x003b2;sito was dissolved and diluted in ethanol. In dilution, solutions were stirred well for more than 30 minutes. We used 5 mM NaCl as an electrolytic solution. Methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (&#x003b2;CD) was used as a complexing agent as described in Brown and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with some modifications. A solution of 2 mg/mL &#x003b2;sito in ethanol was added into 2.5% &#x003b2;CD in 5% NaCl solution so that the final concentration of &#x003b2;sito was 50 &#x003bc;M. The solution was put on a heating block at 80&#x000b0;C until it becomes clear. Tip recording methods were conducted based on Sasaki and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.3000828.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Stimulants were filled up in glass microelectrodes and a silver wire inside of the electrode was connected to a TastePROBE amplifier (Syntech, Kirchzarten, Germany). The sensilla of MP and the sensilla of MG were capped with the recording electrode, using a micromanipulator to stimulate the chemosensory neurons and to record the response simultaneously. As a reference electrode, a fine silver wire insulated to its tip was inserted into the base of the maxilla. Electrical signals were recorded on a computer via a PowerLab 4/25 and analyzed using CHART 5 (ADInstrument, Bella Vista, Australia).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism ver.8 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).

As far as I know, the identification of the relative roles of the maxillary palps and galeae in the process of host acceptance represents a new finding. Previous work had mostly focused on particular subsets of the taste system, such as the medial or lateral sensilla of the galeae, or behavioral mechanisms by themselves. And limited work had been done on taste receptors of the maxillary palps. In the present manuscript, the coupling of the electrophysiological work on the taste system encompassing the palps and galeae with behavioral assays was especially refreshing and insightful. The authors conclude that the silkworm accepts a host plant via a "two-factor authentication system" in that stimulation of the taste cells of the maxillary palps first cause biting of the plant, and, second, stimulation of the taste cells of the galeae are responsible for sustained biting (i.e. feeding). This finding has the potential to explain host acceptance behavior by the larvae of other species of Lepidoptera and perhaps other insect orders.</p><p>Despite my enthusiasm, I have several general criticisms that I introduce here and pursue in greater detail in my specific comments. First, the interpretation of the neurophysiological mechanism of the first step of host acceptance is missing the potential role of olfaction during palpation. The design of the experiments could not determine this possibility in some cases because olfactory responses were not measured. In one other experiment in which the antennae were ablated, there is evidence that this treatment increases biting (Fig. 1), which is consistent with the hypothesis that olfactory stimuli play a role in the first step of host acceptance by deterring biting. Second, there are some significant gaps in scholarship, particularly from the late 1990's through the early 2000's. Many papers were published elucidating gustatory neurophysiological mechanisms of host-plant acceptance by caterpillars of several species during this time. These uncited papers are important in placing the findings of this manuscript in context. For example, Chapman 2003 (see references below) proposed a generalized gustatory neurophysiological mechanism of host-plant acceptance by phytophagous insects (especially caterpillars). The present manuscript would greatly benefit from placing its content in that context. The authors should discuss whether their findings agree with and extend the Chapman proposal in new ways or whether they argue against the Chapman proposal? I will admit that this field is not my main field, so I don't know much of the literature since the Chapman 2003 review. But I see that the review has been cited 192 times as of today, so there may be much more recent work to cite here.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>Abstract, line 15. Replace "nutritional value" with "quality as food" because the food quality of a plant represents both nutritional value and effects of plant secondary metabolites. On the same line, replace "by which insects select host plants through sensing a variety of gustatory inputs" with "of host-plant selection" to avoid lengthy redundancy.</p><p>Abstract, line 17. I strongly suggest replacing "authentication" with "host recognition" system. The latter is a conventional phrase that many researchers would understand. Moreover, the authors use "host recognition" elsewhere in the manuscript. There is no need to introduce a new term here. This change should be made to the title and all other parts of the manuscript.</p><p>Abstract, lines 22-24. This description of the electrophysiological role of the maxillary galea is lacking much understanding about this part of the taste system, as described in various other studies and summarized in Chapman 2003. Sucrose is a critical stimulant, but secondary metabolites are key as well, with either stimulating or deterrent effects on biting and feeding.</p><p>Introduction, line 30. Add "host" before "plants" for clarity, and remove "and carving their own niche" because it does not add any real information.</p><p>Introduction, lines 35-37. An important reference that is missing here is a book on this topic by Chapman and de Boer from 1995 (see references).</p><p>Introduction, lines 41 and 42. Add a hyphen, so it reads "host-plant selection." Elsewhere, this version of the phrase is used.</p><p>Introduction, lines 41-42. I would like to see a bit more of a summary of what's known and what isn't here. It's not entirely fair to say "the neuronal basis" of host-plant selection "and its roles at the leaf surface in whole host-plant selection or leaf choice are poorly understood." While there is certainly more understanding needed, this characterization of the state of knowledge is rather dismissive of what is known (some of which is described in the following paragraph).</p><p>Introduction, line 45. Here is where the Chapman 2003 review should be cited. This paragraph should be expanded with some of the information in that paper and related ones.</p><p>Introduction, line 49. There is a grammatical issue with "number of feces." I'm not sure what the authors are trying to say here, so I can't really offer a correction.</p><p>Introduction, lines 50-51. The end of this paragraph places this study in a very narrow context, as if everyone in the field was mostly interested in understanding host-plant selection by Bombx mori. In fact, B. mori is one of several model species used in this field, and the highly relevant work on these other species can help place the B. mori work in a broader context.</p><p>Introduction, lines 57-58. Replace "authentication" with "host recognition" and replace "that underlies oligophagy" with "responsible for the initiation of feeding" for clarity.</p><p>Results, line 62. Replace "behavior towards" with "of" for simplicity and clarity.</p><p>Results, line 78. Replace "whether" with "how" and replace "contributes" with "contribute" for grammatical improvement.</p><p>Results, line 81. The introduction of Lactuca indica here is confusing because this plant is not tested in the study reported here. I wondered if this name was a mistake because it seems like the authors might be referring to Sonchus oleraceus instead. Also in line 81, replace "consumed a relatively small amount" with "consumed in relatively small amounts."</p><p>Results, lines 101-102. Again, Lactuca indica is mentioned here, but not elsewhere.</p><p>Results, line 111. Replace "were" with "was."</p><p>Results, lines 118-119. Here is where I think the possible role of olfactory inputs should be mentioned.</p><p>Results, lines 123-124. Here is where I think the broader range of stimulants should be considered for taste cells of the lateral sensilla. It might be the case that LS taste cells only respond to these sugars, but that is not the case for other caterpillar species.</p><p>Results, line 135. The "important role of the MG in modulating the amount of food intake" is already known from work on other species. If this information were added to the Introduction section, the statement here could say that this finding confirms "the important role&#x02026;" rather than suggesting that this is a new finding.</p><p>Results, line 137. Replace "in consistent" with "in agreement."</p><p>Results, line 140. Remove "that" after "whether."</p><p>Discussion, lines 150-151. I suggest changing "comprehensively upgrade" to something like "provide new."</p><p>Discussion, line 153. Here, as in the Introduction, the state of knowledge of this field is mischaracterized. Adding the new scholarship should help the authors re-characterize the previous state of knowledge, so their contribution can be more accurately described.</p><p>Discussion, lines 157-161. Here is another place where I think it is important to consider the possible role of olfactory inputs in modulating the biting response. Note that the agar-based diet is not likely to have the olfactory stimuli that leaves would have.</p><p>Discussion, lines 164-167. I don't find this argument very convincing. In natural forests, canopy branches and leaves of multiple tree species often intersect, and individual caterpillars sometimes fall or walk off their host plant. Even dietary specialist caterpillars do not necessarily stay on the same plant for their entire larval lives. Therefore, it is likely to be important for dietary specialists of trees to have the ability to recognize their specific hosts. I agree that such specific signals do not necessarily have to be single compounds that are unique to the host, even though there are cases in which this is true (Bernays et al. 2003, see references). As argued at the end of the following paragraph, unique combinations of compounds can give specific signals, as seen in pheromone-based species recognition systems of insects.</p><p>Discussion, lines 169-178. This paragraph is missing much recent scholarship (see references below) on caterpillar neurophysiological mechanisms of feeding.</p><p>Discussion, lines 183-184. Replace "taste modalities such as sweet, bitter&#x02026;" with "chemical tastants wuch as sugars, amino acids, secondary metabolites&#x02026;" The former are subjective sensations, whereas my suggestion gives objective information.</p><p>Discussion, line 191. Replace "The MG has been believed to play a main role in&#x02026;" with "The MG has been shown to play a main role in&#x02026;" This would be a good place to cite Chapman 2003.</p><p>Discussion, line 193. Note that the MG in at least one species of caterpillar is known to respond to a stimulating secondary metabolite (pyrrolizidine alkaloids) at 10-12 M. Also replace "authentication" with "host recognition."</p><p>Discussion, line 198-199. It's also possible that olfaction plays a role in deterrent inputs provided by the MP, which contains gustatory and olfactory sensilla.</p><p>Discussion, lines 199-200. Replace "authentication" with "host recognition" and replace "negative selection" and "positive selection" with terms that are not conventionally understood to have different meanings in biology (evolutionary biology in this case). In this context, I suggest stimulating and deterrent effects on feeding.</p><p>Discussion, lines 202-206. This final paragraph reads as if the authors are struggling to place their work in a larger context. I think they will find it easier to do this when they re-frame the Introduction with additional scholarship (see references). The revised Introduction will help set up their study and the final points in the Discussion section can more clearly specify the authors' contribution in addition to specific gaps in the knowledge that future research can address.</p><p>Replace "authentication" in the first sentence. Later, the statement "oligophagy and polyphagy are likely consequences of the strict and loose restriction, respectively, of feeding initiation by the MP" confuses proximate and ultimate mechanisms in biology. It is almost certainly the case that the characteristics of the MP and their proximate effects on feeding behavior are a consequence of natural selection for narrow or broad diets in herbivorous insects. I suggest either rewriting this phrase or omitting it. Finally, the concluding line in the paragraph is not truly informative or helpful. At worst, it misleads the reader to believe that "mechanisms underpinning host-plant selection" are not really understood at all. In fact, there are entire books written about this topic (e.g., Bernays and Chapman, 1994, Host-plant selection by phytophagous insects).</p><p>Methods, line 215. Change to "Videos of silkworm feeding on leaves and filter paper&#x02026;" The videos are great, by the way.</p><p>Methods, line 218. Add "on" after "fed."</p><p>Methods, line 219. Add "the" before "maxillary" and make palp, galea, and antenna plural in this sentence. Also, replace "was" with "were."</p><p>Methods, line 221. Replace "towards" with "of."</p><p>Methods, line 223. Replace "in" with "at."</p><p>Methods, line 225. Replace "wet" with "wetted."</p><p>Methods, line 228. The phrase "all larvae started finally palpation towards all kinds of plant leaves" is not grammatically correct or clear. I don't know exactly what the authors are trying to say, so I don't have any correction to offer. On this line at the end, add "the" after "For."</p><p>Methods, line 229. Add "of the" before "stimulant."</p><p>Methods, line 234. Replace "investigated" with "calculated."</p><p>Methods, line 236. Add "an" before "agar-based."</p><p>Methods, line 241. Add "the" before "agar-based."</p><p>Methods, line 243. Provide the temperature at which the leaves were dried in the oven.</p><p>Methods, line 245. Add "the" before "ratio" and replace "weight" with "mass" here and throughout this paragraph.</p><p>Methods, line 252. Add "the" before "lateral" and change "sensillum" to "sensilla."</p><p>Methods, line 256. Starving the larvae here and in the food intake assay can affect the results of these experiments. In addition to generalized effects of food deprivation, there can be specific effects on taste and feeding responses that reflect the insect's physiological state of nutrient deprivation. For example, dietary deficiencies in carbohydrates tend to increase the taste and feeding responses of caterpillars to carbohydrates (e.g., Bernays et al. 2004a in references). I doubt this issue has large effects on the results reported here, but I want the authors to be aware of this phenomenon in case they are not already.</p><p>Methods, line 257. The part of the line after "whereas" is incomplete.</p><p>Methods, line 261. Replace "being" with "it became."</p><p>Figure 1 legend, line 379. Change "persistent bites." to "persistent bites, respectively."</p><p>Figure 4. Replace "weight" in the y-axis labels of panels A, B, C with "mass." Same for the axis labels in Fig. S3.</p><p>Figure 4 legend, line 409. Replace "weight" with "mass." Same for the legend of Fig. S3.</p><p>References</p><p>Bernays and Chapman. 1994.

They explained how mulberry preference of the silkworm was related to the appropriate combination of the three compounds in mulberry leaves. They further proposed that a two-factor authentication system, controlled by two peripheral gustatory organs of maxillary palp (MP) and maxillary galea (MG), and driven by six phytochemicals, that underlies oligophagy in silkworms. This work is interesting and provides valuable information in diet choice of phytophagous insect species. However, the conclusion is too rough to be convincing.</p><p>Assuming that combination of three compounds are responsible for mulberry preference, how to explain that silkworm larvae also feed on artificial diet (should be different compound combination even this diet contained mulberry leaves)? It was reported that polyphagous silkworm mutant strains feed on non-mulberry diets (Iizuka et al., 2012). A recent study also showed that a gustatory receptor gene determines the silkworm feeding preference (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, possibly there are other phytochemicals in mulberry leave will also induce feeding behavior including palpation and biting. The reviewer strongly suggests that using a polyphagous mutant strain, such as Sawa-J, to make clear comparison.</p><p>The tip recording results showed in Figure 3A and Figure S2B and C were very confusing. The concentration of chlorogenic acid (CGA), isoquercitrin (ISQ), quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (Q3R), and &#x003b2;-sitosterol used in MP and MG testing were quite different. In addition, stimulus intensity is usually a positive function between stimulus concentration and the number of spikes elicited in a peripheral neuron. Thus, the authors should add the experiment of tip recording (both MP and MG) with gradient concentration. Otherwise, the present results could not support the conclusion that MP responded to the four compounds and MG did not respond to these compounds.</p><p>Rev. 3: Heiko Vogel - note that this reviewer has waived anonymity</p><p>This is a very nice manuscript by Tsuneto and colleagues, who have studied the perception system by which silkworm larvae decide to continuously feed (or reject) specific host plant species/plant diets.</p><p>The focus of the manuscript is on a proposed "two-factor" authentication system which larvae utilize to first perform leaf palpation, using the maxillary palp, and detecting low levels of leaf surface compounds. This first step is followed by test bites of the larvae, and includes subsequent detection of leaf sap compounds by chemosensory neurons localized on the maxillary galea and finally the induction of persistent feeding - in case the larvae encounter the correct host plant.</p><p>The authors start by illustrating what is known from the literature on decision making related to herbivorous insect feeding. Prior work from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent papers from several authors have indicated leaf surface compounds as important cues for herbivorous insects to accept host plants. In addition, numerous compounds (also mostly present on leaf surfaces) have been identified which induce oviposition of female insects. However, the major factors, insect physiology and molecular players in host plant acceptance and more generally the "turning points" in decision making of herbivorous larvae when feeding on plants were not well understood.</p><p>I found it especially interesting to see that the larval "test biting" clearly shows a frequency gradient on leaves of different host plants. In contrast to this, the persistent biting falls into two clearly separated groups: one group with the acceptable host plants show a gradient of larvae performing persistent biting and the other group (inedible leaves) display essentially zero persistent biting of larvae.</p><p>To summarize, this work does a nice job of combining multiple types of experimental approaches/assays. It is a nice finding that shows how a specialized (oligophagous) herbivorous insect can - by going through a series of "decision points" - ultimately discriminate host and non-host plants and thus accept or reject a specific plant diet. The study is well conceived and connects well with previous results, and the methodology employed in the different aspects is state of the art. The results are properly documented, and their interpretation in the discussion is quite reasonable.</p><p>I have just minor suggestions for improvement, but see no major flaws that can't be easily addressed with some additions/modifications.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>In all of the figures it would be helpful to provide explanations for all of the abbreviations used. Otherwise the interpretation of at least parts of the figures is severely hampered.</p><p>In the discussion the authors compare their findings on compound perception, neuronal perception and decision making in larvae to adult oviposition on plant leaves. Although superficially touched upon, here or in other parts of the discussion the authors could add a few sentences on what their findings might mean in general for monophagous/oligophagous herbivores (i.e. specialist) versus highly polyphagous (i.e. generalist) ones. Do polyphagous species also require a "two-factor authentication system" - and if so what would be the main discriminatory chemical compounds. Or are polyphagous species instead rather relying on deterrents for decision making and host plant acceptance. Even though this would be rather speculative, it would provide a better approach at the more general question of what defines a oligophagous versus a highly polyphagous herbivore.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pbio.3000828.r003" article-type="author-comment"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000828.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3000828" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

My minor comments were addressed to my satisfaction in this revision. My major comments were mostly addressed to my satisfaction, even if I disagree with one or two responses from the authors. </p><p>For example, I am not convinced by the argument that "silkworm larvae have no reasons to deter biting of mulberry leaves" as rationale for discounting the possibility that olfactory inputs might deter biting. From an evolutionary ecology perspective, I can think of at least one reason that a caterpillar might use olfactory cues from its host plant to decide whether to feed or move elsewhere to feed. I preface my speculation with the important point that the decision to feed by a dietary specialist herbivore is not merely an automatic response to the correct host plant species (as the authors suggest in this manuscript). Insect herbivores use chemical cues to perceive phenotypic variation among individual host plants and parts of host plants, and they can respond adaptively to such variation (e.g., Knolhoff and Heckel 2014, Annual Review of Entomology 59:263). Even dietary specialist herbivores do not respond to every plant of the correct host species in the same way. For example, they might discriminate among plants with high or low resistance traits, some of which are inducible. Regarding olfactory cues, plant volatiles induced by herbivores contain information that predators and parasitoids use to locate their herbivorous prey and hosts (e.g., Heil 2014, New Phytologist 204:297), and herbivores can also use these volatile compounds emitted by plants to accept or reject host plants (e.g., Kessler and Baldwin 2001, Science 291:2141; De Moraes et al. 2001, Nature 410:577). Granted, demonstrations of this phenomenon are limited to adult moths and oviposition behavior. However, caterpillars have been shown to respond behaviorally to the induced chemistry of their host plants over very short time and spatial scales (e.g., Perkins et al. 2013, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 280:20122646). Even though Bombyx mori is a domesticated species, it might retain some ability to use olfactory cues from its host plant in ways that would have been adaptive for its wild ancestors.</p><p>I understand that my hypothesis for this unexplained detail in Fig. 1C is highly speculative, thus I am not asking for the authors discuss it. However, I want them to consider it for future work on the functional role of olfaction in caterpillar feeding behavior.</p><p>The only revisions I would insist on at this point are some minor things to correct grammatical mistakes in sections that were re-written or added.

</p><p>Dear Dr Endo,</p><p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Anurag A Agrawal, I am pleased to inform you that we will be delighted to publish your Research Article in PLOS Biology. </p><p>The files will now enter our production system. You will receive a copyedited version of the manuscript, along with your figures for a final review. You will be given two business days to review and approve the copyedit. Then, within a week, you will receive a PDF proof of your typeset article. You will have two days to review the PDF and make any final corrections. If there is a chance that you'll be unavailable during the copy editing/proof review period, please provide us with contact details of one of the other authors whom you nominate to handle these stages on your behalf. This will ensure that any requested corrections reach the production department in time for publication.</p><p>Early Version</p><p>The version of your manuscript submitted at the copyedit stage will be posted online ahead of the final proof version, unless you have already opted out of the process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p><p>PRESS </p><p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>biologypress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p><p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p><p>Thank you again for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Biology and for your support of Open Access publishing. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any assistance during the production process.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Alice Musson</p><p>Publishing Editor, </p><p>PLOS Biology</p><p>on behalf of</p><p>Ines Alvarez-Garcia,</p><p>Senior Editor</p><p>PLOS Biology</p></body></sub-article></article>
