    "Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV), and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) are important pathogens of common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), a crop vital for food security in sub-Saharan Africa. These viruses are vectored by aphids non-persistently, with virions bound loosely to stylet receptors. These viruses also manipulate aphid-mediated transmission by altering host properties. Virus-induced effects on host-aphid interactions were investigated using choice test (migration) assays, olfactometry, and analysis of insect-perceivable volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using gas chromatography (GC)-coupled mass spectrometry, and GC-coupled electroantennography. When allowed to choose freely between infected and uninfected plants, aphids of the legume specialist species <i>Aphis fabae</i>, and of the generalist species <i>Myzus persicae</i>, were repelled by plants infected with BCMV, BCMNV, or CMV. However, in olfactometer experiments with <i>A. fabae</i>, only the VOCs emitted by BCMNV-infected plants repelled aphids. Although BCMV, BCMNV, and CMV each induced distinctive changes in emission of aphid-perceivable volatiles, all three suppressed emission of an attractant sesquiterpene, α-copaene, suggesting these three different viruses promote migration of virus-bearing aphids in a similar fashion."
