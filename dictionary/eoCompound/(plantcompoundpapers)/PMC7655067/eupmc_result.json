    "Glycoside hydrolase family 18 (GH18) chitinases play an important role in various organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. Chitinase inhibitors have potential applications as pesticides, fungicides, and anti-asthmatics. Berberine, a plant-derived isoquinoline alkaloid, was previously reported to inhibit against various GH18 chitinases with only moderate <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> values ranging between 20 and 70 μM. In this report, we present for the first time the berberine-complexed crystal structure of <i>Sm</i>ChiB, a model GH18 chitinase from the bacterium <i>Serratia marcescens</i>. Based on the berberine-binding mode, a hydrophobic cavity-based optimisation strategy was developed to increase their inhibitory activity. A series of berberine derivatives were designed and synthesised, and their inhibitory activities against GH18 chitinases were evaluated. The compound <b>4c</b> showed 80-fold-elevated inhibitory activity against <i>Sm</i>ChiB and the human chitinase hAMCase with <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> values at the sub-micromolar level. The mechanism of improved inhibitory activities was proposed. This work provides a new strategy for developing novel chitinase inhibitors."
