    "The strawberry tree fruit and leaf are a rich source of minerals, easily digestible sugars, dietary fibers, vitamins (especially vitamin C) and many bioactive compounds of significant functional value. Due to their favorable chemical composition, fruits have recently become increasingly popular in consumption. The aim of this study was to determine the physical-chemical composition, content of bioactive compounds, and also the antioxidant capacity of the fruit and leaves of wild strawberry tree populations among the Adriatic coast in Croatia, as well as to investigate the influence of location on the content of specific bioactive compounds. According to the obtained results, both fruit and leaves are pronouncedly high in vitamin C content, the average value for fruits amounted to 224.21 mg/100 g FW, while that for leaves amounted to 138.08 mg/100 g FW. Additionally, significantly high values of total polyphenolic compounds were recorded both in fruits (average value of 637.94 mg GAE/100 g FW) and especially in leaves (average value of 2157.01 mg GAE/100 g FW). Several pigments from different categories were determined in the fruit depending on fruit maturity, including: total anthocyanins, β-carotene and lycopene; while in leaves chlorophylls and carotenoids. Given the high content of different bioactive compounds high values of antioxidant capacity were determined (the average value for fruits was 2269.96 µmol TE/kg and for leaves, 2237.16 µmol TE/kg). Location strongly influenced the physical-chemical composition and also the content of specialized metabolites; populations collected from southern areas (central and south Dalmatia) of the Adriatic coast tended to have higher amounts of vitamin C, total phenols, total anthocyanins and β-carotene."
