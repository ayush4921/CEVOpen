Among them, <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (Fol) infects tomato through root systems and causes discoloration of the vascular tissue, wilting, and eventual death of the plant. Because Fol is a soil-borne fungal pathogen, the common tactics for controlling fungal diseases by fungicides are usually not effective and costly when it applies to the management of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease. To diminish the use of toxic fungicides with adverse ecological effects on soil microbial communities, biological control employing beneficial microbes could be an effective alternative, and it has been done with some success to manage <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease in tomato (Larkin and Fravel, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Amini and Sidovich, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Barhate et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, due to the complexity in the soil environment and quarantine regulations, it remains a daunting task to apply the bio-products to control <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease in different climate and geographical regions.</p><p>Microorganisms produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, some of which are volatile and toxic to plant pathogens. Bacteria produce different volatiles with speculative functions in communication and defense to ensure their survival in various ecological systems (Schulz and Dickschat, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Among them, some are antifungal and have been shown to suppress plant diseases (Wan et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Arrebola et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Di Francesco et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kanchiswamy et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). For instance, <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> produced an array of volatile organic compounds, among which ammonia was determined to suppress <italic>Pythium</italic> damping-off (Howell et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), butyl acetate, phenylethyl alcohol, and 4,5-dimethyl-1-hexene were responsible for reducing the green mold of citrus fruit caused by <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> (Chen et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species produced volatile organic compounds that were toxic to <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> (Fernando et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Volatiles from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> have been shown to induce the formation of abnormal hyphae and inhibit vegetative growth of various fungal pathogens (Fiddaman and Rossall, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Chaurasia et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Chaves-Lopez et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which is potentially applicable for managing plant diseases, such as the antifungal volatiles dimethyl disulfide and ammonia from <italic>B. mycoides</italic> capable of preventing cabbage damping-off diseases from <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> and <italic>Pythium aphanidermatum</italic> (Huang et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p><italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. are gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria, which are commonly found in soils and plant rhizosphere. Numerous <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activities against plant pathogens and effectively reduce diseases on various plants. <italic>B. mycoides</italic> is morphologically unique among all <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. because it forms a rhizoidal colony with spiral filaments on solid media (Fl&#x000fc;gge, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1886</xref>). As with many <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp., <italic>B. mycoides</italic> is a potential bio-agent by enhancing plant growth and reducing plant diseases due to the elicitation of systemic acquired resistance (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Bargabus et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Czaban et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004a</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Thus, <italic>B. mycoides</italic> is commonly known as a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR).</p><p>In this study, <italic>B. mycoides</italic> BM02 originally isolated from tomato rhizosphere in Taiwan was found to reduce Fol infection in the roots of hydroponic tomato seedlings and subsequently reduced the severity of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease in the greenhouse. GC-MS analysis identifies two volatile compounds, phenylacetic acid (PAA) and methylphenyl acetate (MPA), from the culture filtrates of <italic>B. mycoides</italic> strain BM02. PAA is a volatile aromatic compound naturally produced by many organisms with antimicrobial, antifungal, and phytotoxic activities. PAA is also endowed with the induction of induced systemic resistance (ISR) (Akram et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and hormonal activity similar to IAA <italic>in planta</italic> (Sugawara et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Here, PAA and MPA from <italic>B. mycoides</italic> BM02 were demonstrated to be antifungal in suppressing spore germination but not hyphal growth of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>. Taken together with previously reported dimethyl disulfide and ammonia (Huang et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), <italic>B. mycoides</italic> may release volatiles as chemical signals in the rhizosphere to promote plant health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Microorganisms and Growth Conditions</title><p>The BM02 strain of <italic>B. mycoides</italic> Fl&#x000fc;gge was isolated from the rhizosphere of a tomato plant in Taichung, Taiwan, and has been previously characterized (Peng et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Unless otherwise indicated, BM02 was grown on nutrient agar (NA) (per liter contains Beef extract, 3 g; Peptone, 5 g; Agar, 15 g) (BD Difco, Sparks, MD, USA) or in tryptic soy broth (TSB) (per liter contains Pancreatic digest of Casein, 17 g; Papaic digest of Soybean, 3 g; Dextrose, 2.5 g; Sodium Chloride, 5 g; Dipotassium Phosphate, 2.5 g) (BD Difco), and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C. The Fol-04 isolate of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (Sacc.) W.C. Snyder and H.N. Hans was recovered as a single spore from the stem of a diseased tomato plant showing wilting symptoms (Lin et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and its pathogenicity on tomato was confirmed by Koch's postulates. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of Fol-04 was PCR-amplified using ITS1 and ITS4 specific primers (Toju et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and deposited in GenBank under the accession no. MT936807. A Fol-4G isolate constitutively expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed by introducing p1300-CT74FCir plasmid harboring the <italic>ToxA</italic> promoter-driven <italic>gfp</italic> (Lorang et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) (kindly provided by Dr. Miin-Huey Lee, Department of Plant Pathology, NCHU, Taichung, Taiwan) into Fol-04 via <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation as described (Lee and Bostock, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Fungi were routinely grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) [per liter contains Potato Starch (from the infusion), 4 g; Dextrose, 20 g; Agar, 15 g] (BD Difco) at 28&#x000b0;C. After 1-week plate culturing, fungal spores were suspended in sterile water and filtered through 4-layers of cheesecloth for bioassays.</p></sec><sec><title>Assays for Plant Growth</title><p>Seeds of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) cv. Farmers 301 were purchased from Known-You Seed (Kaohsiung, Taiwan). Seeds were sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol for 3 min, followed by 6% sodium hypochlorite (Clorox, CA, USA) for 10 min, washed 5 times with sterile water, and placed on 2% water agar plates. The plates were kept under complete darkness at 25&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;4 days. Tomato seedlings were transferred to hydroponic plugs soaking in a Chlorox-disinfected plastic container containing a 700-ml hydroponic solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The macronutrients of the hydroponic solution were formulated by Hoagland and Arnon (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1938</xref>) with some modifications, and the micronutrients were referred to as the basal nutrient solution for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> as described (Conn et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Each plastic container contained three tomato seedlings. For BM02 treatment, the bacterial suspension was adjusted an initial OD<sub>620</sub> of 1.0 and added into the hydroponic solution at 1,000-fold dilution. All seedlings were grown in a temperature-controlled growth chamber with a daily cycle of 14 h light/28&#x000b0;C and 10 h dark/25&#x000b0;C. Hydroponic solutions supplemented with BM02 bacterial suspension or sterile water were changed once a week to support tomato growth. Seedlings were harvested 4 weeks after the transplant, and the root and shoot fresh weights were measured to record the effects of BM02 on plant growth promotion. Each treatment contained at least 3 replicas, and the experiments were repeated twice.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of Biocontrol Activity</title><p>Tomato seedlings with 2&#x02013;3 true leaves (~2 weeks after transplant) were treated with BM02 by diluting bacterial suspensions at the initial OD<sub>620</sub> of 1.0 1,000-folds in the hydroponic solution. Seedlings treated with sterile water were used as the mock controls. After 3 days, the treated seedlings were inoculated with Fol-04 or Fol-4G by adding spore suspensions (final conc. 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> conidia/mL) into the same hydroponic solution. At 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) with Fol spore suspension, the tomato seedlings were transplanted to a 4-inch pot filled with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of sandy loam and peat moss (BVB Substrate, Bas van Buuren B.V., Coldenhovelaan, The Netherlands), and kept in the greenhouse. The symptoms of tomato <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt were evaluated for 3 weeks after Fol inoculation using the following scales: 0, no symptom; 1, epinasty; 2, yellowing; 3, wilting; and 4, dead (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Roots of BM02- or mock-treated tomato seedlings were inoculated with Fol-4G by the abovementioned conditions and collected at 18 h post-inoculation. The root tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and examined by Axio Scope A1 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) equipped with a GFP filter (ex/em = 500/535 nm). The autofluorescence of the plant tissues was observed by the Texas Red filter (ex/em = 560/647 nm). Germination of fungal spores and the morphology of hyphae were examined on the 18-mm root segments (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 20) randomly selected from the fixed root samples. Each treatment contained at least three independent tomato seedlings (replicas), and the experiments have been repeated twice. Images were captured as TIF files and analyzed by Carl Zeiss Axio Vision SE64 Rel. 4.9.1 SP1 software (Carl Zeiss AG).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of Antifungal Compounds From Culture Filtrates</title><p>To purify antimicrobial compounds, BM02 was cultured in TSB on a rotary shaker set at 150 rpm at 30&#x000b0;C for 2 days. The pH of culture filtrates was adjusted to 2, 7, and 12, mixed vigorously with ethyl acetate in a separating funnel, and incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 1 h. Ethyl acetate (EA) fraction was collected and dried at 60&#x000b0;C using a rotary evaporator (Laborota 4000 efficient, Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) or Savant SpeedVac vacuum concentrator SC110 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The EA-extracted, evaporator-dried compounds were dissolved in 100% methanol, passed through a reversed-phase C-18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (Bound Elut C-18 column, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), and eluted using methanol-water solutions as eluents. Methanol was stepwise increased by 10% in each elution. Each eluate was collected, dried, dissolved in 150 &#x003bc;l 100% pure methanol, and tested for antifungal activity.</p></sec><sec><title>High-Performance Liquid Chromatography</title><p>The active fraction collected from SPE separation was analyzed further by a model of Agilent 1100 series high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent Technologies). Compounds were separated in a Thermo Syncronis C-18 column (5 &#x003bc;m, 250 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a gradient solvent system composed of water-methanol at a flow rate of 1 mL/min as the mobile phase. The concentrations of methanol were programmed as follows: 5&#x02013;42% at 0&#x02013;5 min, 42&#x02013;44% at 5&#x02013;10 min, 44&#x02013;45% at 10&#x02013;25 min, 45&#x02013;95% at 25&#x02013;30 min, and hold in 95% at 30&#x02013;40 min. Compounds were detected by a UV detector with an optical absorbance at 254 nm. Each peak was collected, dried, and tested for antifungal activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Assays for Antifungal Activity</title><p>Bioassays for antifungal activity were performed by mixing 1 &#x003bc;l of the abovementioned HPLC fractions dissolved in 100% methanol with 100 &#x003bc;l of Fol-04 spore suspensions (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> conidia/mL) (1:100, v/v), and placing 20 &#x003bc;l aliquots on a glass slide. Spores treated with 1% methanol only were used as a mock control. Commercially available methyl phenylacetate (MPA) (148442500, Acros Organics, New Jersey, USA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA) (P16621, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in water, serially diluted, and analyzed for their inhibitory activity on Fol-04 by co-culturing with spore suspensions as mentioned and fumigation. Fifty microliters of MPA and PAA at different concentrations were applied to an 8-mm filter paper disc (Advantec Toyo Kaisha, Japan) and placed inside the cap of a Petri dish (15 &#x000d7; 90 mm) to fumigate the spore suspensions on a glass slide. The Petri dishes were sealed with two layers of Parafilm to prevent evaporation. After 12 h incubation at 25&#x000b0;C, both co-culture and fumigation assays were examined for spore germination by a light microscope (Carl Zeiss AG).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Volatile Compounds by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS) Analysis</title><p>The active fraction (retention time t<sub>R</sub> = 31.8 min) after HPLC separation was collected, aliquoted, and evaporated to remove the solvent, and subsequently vacuum-dried using SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 60&#x000b0;C for additional 10, 20, 40, 60, and 90 min. All dried compounds and commercially available MPA and PAA were dissolved in hexane and immediately inserted into the injector (200&#x000b0;C) of a model TRACE GC Ultra gas chromatography (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a model of ITQ 900 ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an electron capture detector. Helium was used as a gas carrier and flowed at 1 ml/min through a DB-5 capillary column (30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm, 0.25 &#x003bc;m, Agilent Technologies). Analytical temperatures were set as follows: initial column temperature at 35&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by an increment of 5&#x000b0;C/min up to 200&#x000b0;C and of 20&#x000b0;C/min up to 300&#x000b0;C with a final temperature at 300&#x000b0;C for 5 min. Compounds were further ionized at 70 eV and analyzed by scanning mass spectrometry over a range of 40&#x02013;600 <italic>m/z</italic> per scan using an ion trap mass spectrometer (ITQ 900, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The identities of volatiles were verified by comparing them with the chemical databases deposited in the GC-mass spectrometry library and by referring the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectral database using NIST MS Search Program (version 2.0). Quantitation of peak area was conducted by referring to the GC peak area of commercially available MPA and PAA at different concentrations (1, 5, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 &#x003bc;g/mL) using a linear interpolation method.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All treatments contained at least three replicas.

Significantly, this study further demonstrated that the BM02 strain protected tomato from Fol infection, and it produced two volatile compounds (MPA and PAA) with antifungal activity. <italic>In-planta</italic> assays showed that BM02 treatment reduced Fol spore attachment and germination, and increased the formation of swollen hyphae, while it did not affect hyphal growth on the surface of the hydroponic tomato roots. GC-MS analysis identified two volatile compounds MPA and PAA that exhibited suppressive effects on the germination of Fol spores. The antifungal activities of MPA and PAA were assayed by co-culture and fumigation on Fol spore suspensions to reveal they were fungistatic (data not shown). Thus, the notion that <italic>B. mycoides</italic> can effectively control plant diseases is likely due to the production of volatile organic compounds and other antimicrobial chemicals, such as surfactants (Peng et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), ammonia, and dimethyl disulfide (Huang et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>PAA has been described to have antifungal and phytotoxic properties. PAA also acted as a plant growth regulator by regulating auxin-responsive genes through the transport inhibitor response 1/auxin-related F-box (TIR1/AFB)&#x02013;mediated signaling pathway (Sugawara et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As an endogenous auxin commonly found in vascular plants and seaweeds (Korasick et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), PAA promotes the initiation of lateral root primordia in pea seedlings at the optimum concentration of 0.1 mM (Wightman et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). Moreover, PAA is reportedly produced by a wide range of microorganisms, including <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> (Kim et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), <italic>B. fortis</italic> (Akram et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), <italic>Azospillium brasilense</italic> (Somers et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> (Sopheareth et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> (Slininger et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> (Siddiqui and Shaukat, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Bartz et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The microbial production of MPA is less known. Our results showed PAA is more potent as an antifungal chemical than MPA in both the aqueous and gaseous forms. Nevertheless, neither PAA nor MPA has inhibitory effects on hyphal growth. PAA produced by <italic>Streptomyces humidus</italic> has been determined to have a differential inhibitory effect on the vegetative growth of microorganisms, e.g., the growth of <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic> was completely inhibited by 10 &#x003bc;g/ml (~0.074 mM) of PAA, whereas <italic>F. moniliforme</italic> and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cucumerinum</italic> were resistant to PAA at the concentration up to 1,000 &#x003bc;g/ml (ca. 7.4 mM) (Hwang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The foliar applications of PAA against Phytophthora blight in pepper plants showed similar protective efficacy as phosphorous acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>), a biostimulant known to suppress diseases and promote growth in horticultural plants, at the concentration of 100&#x02013;1,000 &#x003bc;g/ml (Hwang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In addition to direct toxicity to the pathogens, root applications of PAA in tomato led to increased quantities of the precursor compounds in the phenylpropanoid pathway, e.g., L-phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, and salicylic acid, in the shoot tissues, which subsequently triggered induced systemic resistance (ISR) and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites against <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease (Akram et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p><italic>B. mycoides</italic> can produce plant growth regulators and enhance plant growth (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Czaban et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004a</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ambrosini et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Root drench of <italic>B. mycoides</italic> revealed that it increased the cell wall thickness of the epidermis and the expression of defense-related genes <italic>PAL</italic> (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and <italic>LOX</italic> (lipoxygenase) in tomato roots (Tang et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), indicating the elicitation of defense responses is a generic trait of <italic>B. mycoides</italic> as a protective agent in crop disease management. Although the chemical elicitors of the defense responses remain elusive, <italic>B. mycoides</italic> produces several volatile compounds including PAA and MPA that may act as the activators of plant defense-related pathways.</p><p>After being inoculated onto tomato roots in the hydroponic system, spores of the Fol-4G transformant expressing GFP germinate and grow out on the root surface. Microscopic examination of the fungal structures revealed a spherical ball-like structure was occasionally seen at the tip of the elongating hyphae, and the percentage of the ball-like structure was greatly reduced in the BM02-treated root samples. On the surface of melon radicles infected by a GFP-expressing <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>melonis</italic> transformant, these ball-like structures were formed before the development of infection hyphae in the epidermal cells and named as appressorium-like structures by Inoue et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Although the functions of the appressorium-like structures have not been demonstrated in Fol, it is likely to be involved in the early stage of invasion as proposed in other phytopathogenic fungi (Ryder and Talbot, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We also observed Fol hyphae adhered predominantly to the surface of root hairs to initiate the infection cycle, which has been reported previously by inoculating a GFP expressing <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>radicis-lycopersici</italic> transformant to tomato roots in a sterile sand system (Simons et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Lagopodi et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). These results indicated the hydroponic system is useful, particularly for the analysis of tomato-Fol interactions and the elucidation of bio-agents in controlling Fol infection, for its feasibility of microscopic observation of fungal infection structures on well-developed, intact root tissues. Nevertheless, in the later stage of infection, Fol fully colonized the elongation zone of tomato roots in the hydroponics, more extensive than the colonization pattern in soil culture (Olivain et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Nahalkova et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). To evaluate the protective efficacy of BM02 against tomato <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt, the BM02-treated tomato seedlings in the hydroponics were transplanted to the soil for rating the disease severity under a realistic condition. By comparing with the mock treatment, BM02 greatly reduced the severity of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting the experimental design of combining hydroponics with soil culture is adequate to study plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere.</p><p>In hydroponic-cultured tomato seedlings, BM02-treated roots had fewer Fol spores adhered on the surface than the water control, but the germination rate remained equal when the spores have successfully attached to the root surface, suggesting BM02 and its metabolites may protect tomato roots from Fol infection by eliciting plant defense response (Tang et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), as shown by Neher et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), to reduce spore attachment. In our experimental design, tomato roots were treated with BM02 first, followed by the inoculation of Fol spore suspension. Alternatively, BM02-secreted chemicals in the hydroponic solution may inhibit Fol spore germination prior to root attachment, resulting in the reduction of Fol infection. The swollen hyphae induced by BM02 treatment is a novel structure that has not been observed during Fol infection. Chaurasia et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) reported <italic>in-vitro</italic> treatment of the diffusible and volatile compounds of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> induced swollen hyphal tips, vacuolization in mycelium, and hyphal lysis of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and other fungi; however, similar structures have not been observed on plant tissues. The deformation of fungal hyphae may be induced by several factors, such as cell-wall-degradation enzymes and biosurfactants that elicit pores on fungal hyphae and trigger apoptosis by producing reactive oxygen species (Arlorio et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Qi et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Oliveira Junior et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Vitullo et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Likewise, the inhibitors of fungal cell wall biosynthesis could also lead to morphological alteration of fungal hyphae (Grove and Sweigard, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Kang et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Alternatively, the chemical compounds produced by BM02, e.g., PAA and MPA, may serve as signals to modulate the defense-related metabolism in root tissues, which retards normal hyphae development and reduces the disease severity of <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt (Bent and Morton, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>; Akram et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, using a combination of analytical techniques and bioassays, two volatile compounds, PAA and MPA, were identified from the culture broth of <italic>B. mycoides</italic> BM02 that have antifungal activity in suppressing Fol spore germination.
