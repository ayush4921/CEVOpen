    "<i>Bacillus mycoides</i> strain BM02 originally isolated from the tomato rhizosphere was found to have beneficial functions in tomato by promoting plant growth and reducing the severity of <i>Fusarium</i> wilt caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (Fol). Cytological experiments demonstrated <i>B. mycoides</i> BM02 reduced Fol invasion by reducing spore attachment and increasing hyphal deformation in hydroponics-grown tomato root tissues. Two volatile antifungal compounds, phenylacetic acid (PAA) and methylphenyl acetate (MPA), were identified from the culture filtrates of <i>B. mycoides</i> BM02 by GC-MS analysis. Chemically synthesized PAA, and to a lower extent MPA, suppressed spore germination but have no effects on the hyphal growth of Fol. Our results indicated that the biocontrol agent <i>B. mycoides</i> BM02 produced an array of bioactive compounds including PAA and MPA to suppress plant diseases caused by Fol and other pathogenic microorganisms."
