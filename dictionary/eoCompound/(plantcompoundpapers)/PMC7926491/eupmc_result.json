    "<i>Aneura pinguis</i> (L.) Dumort. is a representative of the simple thalloid liverworts, one of the three main types of liverwort gametophytes. According to classical taxonomy, <i>A. pinguis</i> represents one morphologically variable species; however, genetic data reveal that this species is a complex consisting of 10 cryptic species (named by letters from A to J), of which four are further subdivided into two or three evolutionary lineages. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient method for the characterisation of plant material using marker compounds. The volatile chemical constituents of cryptic species within the liverwort <i>A. pinguis</i> were analysed by GC-MS. The compounds were isolated from plant material using the HS-SPME technique. Of the 66 compounds examined, 40 were identified. Of these 40 compounds, nine were selected for use as marker compounds of individual cryptic species of <i>A. pinguis</i>. A guide was then developed that clarified how these markers could be used for the rapid identification of the genetic lineages of <i>A. pinguis</i>. Multivariate statistical analyses (principal component and cluster analysis) revealed that the chemical compounds in <i>A. pinguis</i> made it possible to distinguish individual cryptic species (including genetic lineages), with the exception of cryptic species G and H. The classification of samples based on the volatile compounds by cluster analysis reflected phylogenetic relationships between cryptic species and genetic lineages of <i>A. pinguis</i> revealed based on molecular data."
