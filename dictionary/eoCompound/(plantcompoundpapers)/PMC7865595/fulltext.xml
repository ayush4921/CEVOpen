The rapid identification of already reported compounds, or structural dereplication, is recognized as a key element in natural product chemistry. The biological taxonomy of metabolite producing organisms, the knowledge of metabolite molecular structures, and the availability of metabolite spectroscopic signatures are considered as the three pillars of structural dereplication. The role and the construction of databases is illustrated by references to the KNApSAcK, UNPD, CSEARCH, and COCONUT databases, and by the importance of calculated taxonomic and spectroscopic data as substitutes for missing or lost original ones. Two NMR-based tools, the PNMRNP database that derives from UNPD, and KnapsackSearch, a database generator that provides taxonomically focused libraries of compounds, are proposed to the community of natural product chemists. The study of the alkaloids from <italic>Urceolina peruviana</italic>, a plant from the Andes used in traditional medicine for antibacterial and anticancer actions, has given the opportunity to test different approaches to dereplication, favoring the use of publicly available data sources.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>dereplication</kwd><kwd>databases</kwd><kwd>spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>taxonomy</kwd><kwd>molecular structures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-00637"><title>1. Introduction</title><sec id="sec1dot1-molecules-26-00637"><title>1.1. General Considerations</title><p>Organic natural products are produced by living organisms to ensure their own basic functional requirements through primary metabolism and to fine-tune the relationships with their surrounding through specialized or secondary metabolism. The term &#x0201c;natural product&#x0201d; (NP) generally refers to an organic specialized metabolite. NP biosynthesis is controlled by the genes and therefore depends on organism species. The biological evolution led to the preservation of some NPs across related species while others were left over. A set of species may consequently share a set of identical specialized metabolites. The taxonomic classification of species relied on phenotype comparison at the time biologists would not even dream to have access to the genome of living organisms. The identification of preserved NP structures or structural features could then assist the classification task through chemotaxonomic studies, as NP structures are part of the phenotype.</p><p>The investigation of NPs is not only bound to taxonomic studies but is motivated by the uses human beings make of them. NPs with therapeutic, organoleptic, psychoactive, poisonous, tinctorial (non-exhaustive list) properties were generally not produced to be used by humans for the purposes organisms produce them. Most of NP properties are related to their interaction with other biologically produced systems, referred to as NP targets. An NP would thus more likely interact with a target of therapeutic interest (an enzyme to be inhibited, for example) than with a randomly chosen molecule drawn from the chemical space of organic molecules, due to the co-evolution of all living species over hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>The understanding of the interaction between an NP and a target is a challenging task and is often a necessary step for the design of chemical compounds with enhanced properties [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This step requires a precise knowledge of the structure of the NP (and of its target) at the atomic level, a concern that converges with the one of chemotaxonomy.</p><p>Finding the structure of a compound that is already known should be, at least seemingly, much easier than the one of an unknown compound. The tentative identification of known compounds is one of the aspects of what is covered by the term &#x0201c;dereplication&#x0201d;, because earlier efforts for purification and/or structure determination have not to be replicated [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Undertaking dereplication in first place makes sense because an organism for which nothing is known about its chemistry may share compounds with an already studied organism with close taxonomic relationship for the reason invoked in the first paragraph. Compounds that resist dereplication may be false (known) unknowns when the employed dereplication tools fail or true (unknown) unknowns [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], for which isolation and structure elucidation tools have to be deployed [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The determination of the molecular structure of NPs by dereplication constitutes an important part of this article.</p><p>Dereplication is a matter of collective memory by essence. This raises the questions of what information has to be preserved and of how to do it. Proving that two substances are identical at the atomic level is currently achieved by physico-chemical methods. The data produced by the analytical instruments and the related conditions in which they are obtained, namely the meta-data, are of prime importance. By language abuse, the analytic data and their associated meta-data will be referred to here as &#x0201c;spectroscopic data&#x0201d;. If the molecular structure of compound A is known and if compound B is proved to be identical to compound A by spectroscopic data comparison, then the structure of compound B can be asserted as being also the one compound A, without having to interpret the data obtained from compound B, hence providing the expected time and effort gain. </p><p>Obviously, structures must be preserved along with associated spectroscopic data as the end of the currently described dereplication process is the labeling of a sample with the structure of a compound (compound naming will be discussed hereafter). A theoretical dereplication strategy would be to preserve the structure and spectroscopic data of all, probably less than 400,000, known NPs to date, and to compare the data from a presumably known compound with all the preserved data. If ever possible, this approach would be highly inefficient and it would be more efficient to limit the comparison work to the compounds from organisms that are taxonomically close to the one from which the currently considered NP comes from, in the way used by NP chemists during the pre-computer age [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This means that a link should be preserved between a NP structure and the taxonomy of the organism(s) it originates from. It clearly appears at this point that structure description, spectroscopy and taxonomy constitutes the three pillars of dereplication. Selected aspects of each of them are detailed hereafter.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-molecules-26-00637"><title>1.2. The Three Pilars of Dereplication</title><sec id="sec1dot2dot1-molecules-26-00637"><title>1.2.1. Molecular Structures</title><p>The structure of purely organic compounds, excluding organometallic species, is remarkably well described by mathematical graphs, with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. The idea of matching a single compound with a single structure is valid at least when a compound cannot be described by more than one tautomeric form. While InChI [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and SMILES [<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] linear notations retain all the necessary structural features of a compound, including chirality, the text-based MOL format (and the derived SDF format) is widely used as it includes atom coordinates necessary either for 2D depictions or for 3D viewing [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The three representation modes evoked here may coexist in order to avoid conversion operations, even though a computer tool can facilitate them [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Structures may be surrounded by various calculated properties (molecular formula, molecular mass, chemical classification, topological descriptors, for example) coded as tag-value pairs. The compound name may be also considered as calculated property. Aspirin is indeed acetylsalicylic acid (another compound name for the same substance) for which IUPAC [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] indicates it is 2-acetoxybenzoic acid in English but &#x0201c;acide 2-ac&#x000e9;toxybenzo&#x000ef;que&#x0201d; in French and &#x0201c;2-(Acetyloxy)benzoes&#x000e4;ure&#x0201d; in German, thus precluding any kind of simple character-by-character name comparison. Considering the name as a molecular property, a compound is better referenced by a list of synonyms rather than by a single name. A structure that is proposed to be a new one because dereplication did not prove it was already known must be searched for in the literature, a task that is simplified by looking, if possible, in comprehensive structure collections such as the one provided by CAS [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or PubChem [<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2dot2-molecules-26-00637"><title>1.2.2. Spectroscopy</title><p>Spectroscopy is considered here in the broadest sense, namely as any physico-chemical methods of characterization. This includes the methods that truly rely on the interaction between electromagnetic waves and matter (UV-visible, IR, Raman, NMR, vibrational and electronic dichroism spectroscopies, optical rotation measurements) but also mass spectrometry (MS), fusion and boiling temperature measurements, and others. Even a single optical rotation value has to be associated to meta-data, such as the nature of the used solvent, the sample concentration, the temperature, and possibly the model of the measurement device. Reporting in NMR spectroscopy is a much more complex task as it must encompass the conditions of raw data acquisition, the nature of the processing operations that lead to spectra and the feature recognition processes that produce &#x0201c;reduced data&#x0201d; (a list of chemical shift values correspond to the position of spectral peaks, for example) and ultimately contributes to molecular structure proposals [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The diversity of spectrometer manufacturers, each proposing its own file formats, clearly precludes the easy comparison of spectroscopic data, even though a universal, text-based format named JCAMP [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] is supported by the IUPAC but could be possibly superseded in a near future by the ADF format of the Allotrope foundation [<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The result of spectroscopic analysis is only meaningful if the link between data and compound structure is preserved, possibly leading to spectra interpretation, thus making possible to associate a particular spectral feature (the mass of a molecular fragment in MS) and a structural feature (a fragment of a molecular structure). There is no easy way to access the spectroscopic data of known natural products [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Most of visible efforts in this direction were devoted to the characterization of primary metabolites in the perspective of metabolomic studies [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>A set of NMR and of MS<italic><sup>n</sup></italic> spectra constitute a better way to identify a known compound than a fusion temperature and an optical rotation value, even though the two latter may suffice to rule out an incorrect structure hypothesis. Dereplication by MS-based methods has earned a high level of interest with the advent of MS<sup>2</sup>-driven molecular network analysis [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Alternatively, a molecular (elemental) formula deduced from high-resolution MS (HRMS) associated to 1D and 2D NMR spectra may suffice to identify a known compound with a high level of confidence if reference data are available. A workaround to the lack of experimental spectroscopic data can be found, more or less accurately depending on the analytical technique, by means of computerized prediction tools. Dereplication of NPs based on <sup>13</sup>C-NMR predicted data has been reported and discussed [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Such predictions may be carried out by various software, including proprietary or free methods, available on local computers or through web interfaces, with possible automated use or not, and with performances that can be difficult to evaluate. CNMR Predictor, NMRPREDICT, ChemDraw, nmrshiftdb2 are such software, among which nmrshiftdb2 may be used for free in an automated may on a local computer while CNMR Predictor is a commercial product renowned for its accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2dot3-molecules-26-00637"><title>1.2.3. Taxonomy</title><p>Taxonomy of living beings is a science in permanent evolution, where the findings of molecular biology separate species that were assumed to be close parents according to phenotype similarity and possibly finds similarities where none was apparent, while taxa names might evolve during time. Tools such as &#x0201c;NCBI Taxonomy Browser&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and &#x0201c;Tree of Life&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] are of great help to navigate through taxonomic information and to locate species belonging to a given taxon. Answering the question of which species produce a given compound and of which compounds are known to be produced by an organism of a given species is possible by means of the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP) with limitations inherent to a commercial product.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2dot4-molecules-26-00637"><title>1.2.4. Databases</title><p>The results of the chemical study of living beings are diluted among a profusion of specialized scientific journals. The construction of a collective memory about NPs is not a spontaneous process, so that the initial dilution of results has to be counterbalanced by efforts for the re-concentration of the knowledge at some well-defined places named databases. Databases that link structural, spectroscopic and taxonomic knowledge should constitute the basis of well-managed NP chemistry. A must-read article recently published focuses on where to find data about NPs in 2020 [<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Open databases for NP research containing structural and spectroscopic data were reported earlier in [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The grouping of structural, taxonomic, and experimental spectroscopic data of natural products was undertaken in the &#x02018;90s in the framework of the SISTEMAT project [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The data and software resulting from this visionary undertaking are unfortunately not accessible to the general public [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Other databases dedicated to the study of NP chemistry always miss some aspect. Biological activity studies are purposely left aside in this article as they do not constitute an entry point for dereplication. As well, bibliographic databases are not considered here, as the creation of NP databases from primary literature is not discussed, even though everyone understands that this is an important aspect of NP research.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-00637"><title>2. Results</title><p>This article reports the availability of a computer software for the creation of taxonomy-focused NP databases named KnapsackSearch and of a database named PNMRNP, exemplified by the study of alkaloids from <italic>Urceolina peruviana</italic>.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-26-00637"><title>2.1. KnapsakSearch</title><p>The KNApSAcK website exposes multiple databases searchable by organism name, metabolite name, and other commonly used compound identifiers [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Searching KNApSAcK for a given genus name displays a series of lines, each one showing a compound identifier, the related CAS identifier, metabolite name, molecular formula, molecular weight, and the name of the species in which it was reported. A genus name refers to a set of species names and each species is related to a set of compounds, each one, as discussed earlier, being possibly present in organisms from different species. Directly querying KNApSAcK for family names of organisms fails. About 54,000 compounds are referenced in KNApSAcK, thus giving access to an incomplete but still non-negligible part of the chemical space of NPs.</p><p>When starting the chemical study of an organism, the search for taxonomy-related ones may not be limited to those of the same species and may extend to the entire family, to parts of it, or to super-sets of it. The goal of the KnapsackSearch (KS) project is to process a list of user-defined genera to produce a list of chemical compounds that are related to one or more of these genera. The result is obtained as an SDF file, so that each compound is associated to a 2D molecular structure with chiral center flags and to a taxonomic and a spectroscopic description. The SDF chemistry file format is not a database format by itself but is sufficiently widespread to be read by most of chemistry software and computational toolkits. The source code of KS is made of Python scripts that rely on the RDKit library of functions for cheminformatics [<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The freely available EdiSDF software is useful for the viewing of 2D structures and related tag-value pairs [<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. </p><p>The workflow of KS (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00637">Figure S1</xref>) starts with the collection of all pairs made of a compound identifier and a binomial name obtained as replies to queries for the queried genus names. Each compound identifier (C_ID) is associated to a list of organism binomial names. As an example, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00637">Figure S2a</xref> shows the beginning of the list of compounds (columns 1&#x02013;5) and organisms (column 6) related to genus <italic>Galanthus</italic>. C_IDs are then used as keys for compound search. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00637">Figure S2b</xref> shows the result of such a query for galanthamine, C_ID C00001570. The resulting in data aggregates containing a compound name, a molecular formula, a molecular weight, a CAS number (if any), an InChI string, the InChIKey hashed form of the InChI, and a SMILES string. The latter is decoded to produce atom and bond lists reshaped as a 2D MOL block. A compound is validated at this stage if the InChI calculated from the MOL block is identical to the one given by KNApSAcK. Molecular formula calculated from the MOL blocks are also compared to the KNApSAcK ones because the latter always lack the electric charge indication if there is one and because they may correspond to [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ion formula; in these cases, the retained molecular formula are deduced from the ones of [M+H]. All InChiKeys are recalculated as it may happen that compounds with different C_IDs yield identical InChIKeys. Such compounds are withdrawn from the regular compound list and processed separately to produce compound aggregates in which the alternative attributes, such as C_IDs and names, are joined together. Each compound is then associated to the taxonomic information retrieved during the first stage of the data collection process and to the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR chemical shifts as predicted by the nmrshiftdb2 software. The data record of galanthamine, as displayed by the EdiSDF software, is presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00637">Figure S2c</xref>.</p><p>The source code of KS is freely available [<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and a few KS-generated SDF files are given with the corresponding lists of organism genera related to a taxonomic family. The <sup>13</sup>C-NMR chemical shifts included in KS files may be reformatted to be imported by NMR spectroscopy software by ACD/Labs and to facilitate compound selection according to chemical shift values, thus allowing the user to benefit from the easy prediction of <sup>13</sup>C-NMR chemical values on a massive scale (massive meaning without one-by-one manual operation on structure records) by nmrshiftdb2 and from the friendly graphical interface of software from ACD/Labs. The future of the web-based approach to family-focused NP databases in KS obviously relies on the continuation of the KNApSAcK web service [<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Database, service, and software discontinuations obviously constitute serious threats, whatever the considered domain of scientific activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-26-00637"><title>2.2. Predicted NMR Data for Natural Products (PNMRNP)</title><p>This section reports the transformation of a discontinued NP database, the Universal Natural Product Database (UNPD), into a &#x0201c;two-pillar&#x0201d; NP database, PNMRNP, in which biological taxonomy data is missing. Chemical classification is tentatively proposed as a remedy to this lack. The initial data used in this process is a set of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files from UNPD, provided as a part of the In Silico Data Base (ISDB) dedicated to MS-based dereplication [<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Most of the data transformations were carried out using RDKit and locally developed Python scripts.</p><p>The Comma Separated Values (CSV) files from UNPD contain SMILES and InChI character strings as structure descriptors of NPs (213,210 compounds). Attempts to decode the SMILES chains led to the detection of a non-negligible amount of badly formed chains, so that only InChIs were considered for 2D structure generation with retained chirality information. A set of 43 compounds was discarded, containing duplicate or organometallic or inorganic compounds.</p><p>Decoding an InChI is achieved through the dedicated software library linked to RDKit and may result into unexpected results. For example, aliphatic amides were reconstructed from their InChI as their iminol tautomer, which is correct because all tautomers of a given molecule share the same InChI. Transforming aliphatic iminols into alphatic amides was undertaken using a chemical transformation rule coded as a reaction &#x0201c;SMILES arbitrary target specification&#x0201d; also known as reaction SMARTS or SMIRKS [<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A set of such rules was applied to fix unlikely tautomeric forms. This step would have benefited from the application of a recent molecule standardization software related to RDKit [<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>RDKit does not handle the axial chirality of substituted allenes or spirans, possibly resulting in incorrect structures upon InChI decoding. Structures of compounds for which the InChI to structure conversion and back-conversion to InChI (the so-called &#x0201c;round-trip&#x0201d;) fails to be consistent were tentatively obtained by means of the ChemDraw software driven by a python for win32 script. An identifier resolution using the Chemical Identifier Resolver (CIR) from the US National Health Institute (NIH) is attempted in case of persisting failure [<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

The link between biological and chemical taxonomy was already exploited in SISTEMAT [<xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The production of chemical classification data constitutes a remedy to the absence of a way to associate easily and at no cost a set of living organism names to an NP identifier. Chemical classification in itself is a fuzzy concept. Discussing about the definition of an alkaloid may result in an answer such as &#x0201c;an alkaloid is like my wife. I can recognize her when I see her, but I can&#x02019;t define her&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Two independent classification systems are available in PNMRNP, one (CL1) is the result of a locally developed attempt that is not comprehensive but that may meet some needs while the other one (CL2) relies on the well-established ClassyFire software [<xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Chemical classes in CL1 are defined according to the presence of specific substructures (subgraphs or molecular graphs) and are identified using SMILES that are interpreted as SMARTS [<xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Chemical classification is organized in PNMRNP with four levels, so that menthol is reported to be a secondary metabolite, a terpene, a monoterpene, and a menthane compound. More precisely substructures are identified as deriving from primary metabolites (identifier: 01) such as amino-acids, sugars, or lipids and are otherwise classified as being specifically related to secondary metabolites (identifier: 02). Terpenes (02-02) include monoterpenes (02-02-01) that share the menthane skeleton (02-02-01-001). Sugar containing compounds (01-01) were identified through a set of 1296 SMILES chains covering open chain and cyclic sugars with possible features such as deoxy- and amino- substitution (63 classes of sugars, overall). Hexopyranoses (01-01-14), with their five asymmetric carbons, thus featuring alpha- and beta-anomeric forms, are identified by a set of 32 SMILES chains to which a generic one without chirality indicator is added. The rather ubiquitous &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose molecular sub-units are identified as 01-01-14-005 and -006, respectively. The idea of searching for sugars in NPs was put into practice recently in the framework of the COCONUT NP database development and the possible <italic>in silico</italic> deglycosylation [<xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The CL1 data items in PNMRNP include the lists of atoms concerned by each detected substructure. A part of the classification was inspired by &#x0201c;Pharmacognosy&#x0201d;, a book by J. Bruneton [<xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and another part from the skeleton library included in the resource files of the LSD software, a library itself borrowed from the SISTEMAT knowledge base [<xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The catalog of SMILES that resulted from the CL1 effort toward a chemical classification of NPs is available as a supplementary information file in Excel format.</p><p>Chemical taxonomy in the second classification system (CL2) in PNMRNP results from replies to queries sent to the web interface of ClassyFire. This system deals with chemistry as a whole, distinguishing between organic and inorganic compounds at the first level, named &#x0201c;Kingdom&#x0201d; by reference to the classification of living beings. The overall hierarchy of chemical classes covers up to eleven levels. The recently reported classification tool named NPClassifier specifically targets NPs [<xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Classification CL2 was introduced with version 2 of PNMRNP [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The link between biological and chemical classifications is highlighted by considering that a molecule can be recognized by ClassyFire as a <italic>Strychnos</italic> alkaloid (<italic>i.e.</italic>, from a plant of the <italic>Strychnos</italic> genus) on a sole structural basis, without any reference to its source, possibly natural or synthetic. The natural origin of so-called &#x0201c;organic&#x0201d; compounds has become difficult to ascertain without resorting to proprietary databases, so that a NP-likeness score, a calculated molecular property, is invoked in order to evaluate to which extent a natural product is natural [<xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

The CSEARCH web server accepts requests made of a list of <sup>13</sup>C-NMR chemical shifts, at best with each value associated to a multiplicity indication (number of attached hydrogen atoms, as deduced from DEPT or multiplicity-edited 2D HSQC spectra) and returns within a few minutes a list of structures sorted in the decreasing order of likelihood, proposed from a database containing several tens of millions of compounds and their predicted chemical shift values [<xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00637" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Databases and Dereplication</title><p>To sum up briefly, KnapsachSearch may be considered as a part of a &#x0201c;two-pillars and half&#x0201d; approach to dereplication, while a &#x0201c;true three pillars&#x0201d; would have been achieved if spectroscopic data were of experimental origin instead of being predicted. PNMRNP can be qualified as &#x0201c;two-pillars&#x0201d; with its predicted spectroscopic data (a half-pillar) and biological taxonomy replaced by chemical taxonomy (a second half-pillar). The &#x0201c;one-pillar and half&#x0201d; NMRPREDICT/CSEARCH approach, dealing with structures and predicted <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy only, should be considered before any other one, if pertinent. A tentatively exhaustive (and even more than that) source of NP data, COCONUT, collects structures from various sources to propose a publicly available document-oriented database of about 400,000 compounds, some of them being clearly not so natural. COCONUT version 1 was a &#x0201c;one-pillar&#x0201d; database, devoid of spectroscopic and taxonomic data but was recently supplemented with chemical classification (a half-pillar) and could be possibly supplemented in the future with predicted spectroscopic data (another half-pillar) to provide a useful &#x0201c;two-pillar&#x0201d; tool for NP structural dereplication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-molecules-26-00637"><title>2.5.

Emergence order of analytes from the CPC column depends on their acidity constant (K<sub>a</sub>) and on the distribution constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of their neutral form between the two liquid chromatographic phases.

After this study, a question arose about the possible results of an identification process solely relying on these lists, without any other NMR information source, only taking into account the possible molecular formula derived from LC-MS data acquired on crude extract 3. The chemical shift lists were used as search keys in DB1 (209 structures from KNApSAcK), DB2 (209 structures from KNApSAcK), DB3 (211,280 structures from full PNMRNP), DB3&#x02032; (635 structures from PNMRNP filtered for Amaryllidaceae-type alkaloids), and DB4 (693 structures from COCONUTv1 filtered for Amaryllidaceae-type alkaloids) with predicted chemical shifts by ACD/Labs software in DB1 and predicted by nmrshiftdb2 in all other DBs. All DBs were formatted for being read by the ACD/Labs DB software so that the same search tool can be used for compound identification. The poor prediction of a single chemical shift in the targetted compound may result in a global failure of the search, to which it can be remedied either by decreasing the number of experimental chemical shifts to be taken into account or by increasing the allowed chemical shift deviation. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00637">Table S2</xref> shows the influence of these parameters on the number and nature of solutions, it illustrates the difficulty of identifying pure compounds without ambiguity solely on the basis of lists of <sup>13</sup>C-NMR chemical shift values and molecular formula.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="sec3-molecules-26-00637"><title>3.

The column was composed of 7 circular partition disks, each engraved with 33 twin-cells of 1.0 mL. The liquid phases were pumped by a preparative 1800 V7115 pump (Knauer, Berlin, Germany). Fractions of 20 mL were collected by a Labocol Vario 4000 (Labomatic Instruments, Allschwil, Switzerland). MtBE, CH<sub>3</sub>CN and H<sub>2</sub>O were equilibrated according the proportion 5:2:3 (<italic>v/v</italic>) and the two phases were separated.

Conclusions</title><p>The rapid identification of natural products, either pure or in mixtures, depends on the availability of databases that connect together molecular structures, taxonomic information, and spectroscopic data, which constitute the three pillars of dereplication. We propose to the scientific community two easily findable NMR-based tools, the PNMRNP database that derives from earlier works on MS<sup>2</sup> spectra prediction, and KnapsackSearch, a database generator that provides focused libraries of compounds whose content is oriented by biological taxonomy. These tools were involved in the study of an iberoamerican plant, <italic>Urceolina peruviana</italic>, in a way that relies strongly on <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy but also on other 1D and 2D NMR techniques as well as on preparative fractionation methods particularly suitable for alkaloid purification and on liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution MS. The identification of five known compounds by these means is reported. The fully unambiguous characterization of a compound within a mixture may be reached only after purification and an exhaustive analytical study. However, the rapid and context adapted structure analysis is feasible by means of an approach that relies on computer databases and that adequately contributes to the study of complex natural substances.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Financial support to the PlAneT CPER project was provided by CNRS, Conseil R&#x000e9;gional Champagne Ardenne, Conseil G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;ral de la Marne, Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESR), and EU-programme FEDER.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Sample Availability:</bold> Samples of compounds are not available from the authors.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-molecules-26-00637"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online, Figures S1 to S5 and Tables S1 to S2: titles as indicated in Table of Contents.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="molecules-26-00637-s001"><media xlink:href="molecules-26-00637-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, J.-M.N. and M.L.; methodology, J.-M.N., M.L. and J.-H.R.; software, J.-M.N., S.K. and R.L.; investigation, M.L., C.M.R., C.S., N.B. and S.R.; data curation, R.L., M.L. and J.-M.N.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, J.-M.N.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, C.M.R., C.S., N.B., S.R., S.K., J.-H.R.; project administration, J.-H.R. and J.-M.N.
