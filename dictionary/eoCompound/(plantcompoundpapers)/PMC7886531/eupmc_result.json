    "The use of medicinal plant extracts and their isolated bioactive compounds for the management of diabetes mellitus has been tremendously increased in recent decades. The present study aimed at providing in-depth information on medicinal flora that has been widely used in the Sri Lankan traditional healthcare system for the management of diabetes mellitus. The data of this review article were obtained from published articles from January 2000 to September 2020 in scientific databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In this review, a total number of 18 medicinal plants with the antidiabetic activity were expressed, and their isolated antidiabetic active compounds were highlighted as new drug leads. Results of the reported studies revealed that medicinal plants exert a potent antidiabetic activity via both in vitro and in vivo study settings. However, bioactive compounds and antidiabetic mechanism (s) of action of many of the reported medicinal plants have not been isolated/elucidated the structure in detail, to date. Reported antidiabetic medicinal plants with other properties such as antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic activities deliver new entities for the development of antidiabetic agents with multiple therapeutic targets. This is a comprehensive review on potential antidiabetic activities of the Sri Lankan medicinal plants that have been widely used in the traditional healthcare system. The information presented here would fill the gap between the use of them by traditional healers in the traditional medicine healthcare system in Sri Lanka and their potency for development of new drug entities in future."
