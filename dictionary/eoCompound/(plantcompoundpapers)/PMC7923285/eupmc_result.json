    "Over the past decade, reckless usage of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture has made the environment and human health progressively vulnerable. This setting leads to the pursuit of other environmentally friendly interventions. Amongst the suggested solutions, the use of chitin and chitosan came about, whether alone or in combination with endophytic bacterial strains. In the framework of this research, we reported an assortment of studies on the physico-chemical properties and potential applications in the agricultural field of two biopolymers extracted from shrimp shells (chitin and chitosan), in addition to their uses as biofertilizers and biostimulators in combination with bacterial strains of the genus <i>Bacillus</i> sp. (having biochemical and enzymatic properties)."
