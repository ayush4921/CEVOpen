Efficient methods to test the permeability of the BBB to specific chemicals would facilitate identification of potentially neurotoxic agents. We report here a simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis in a free-moving mouse to test BBB permeability of different chemicals. Microdialysis sampling was conducted in mice at 3&#x02013;5 days after implantation of a brain microdialysis probe and 1 day after implantation of a blood microdialysis probe. Therefore, mice were under almost physiological conditions. Results of an intravenous injection of lucifer yellow or uranine showed that the BBB was functioning in the mice under the experimental conditions. Mice were given phenyl arsenic compounds orally, and concentration-time profiles for phenyl arsenic compounds such as diphenylarsinic acid, phenylarsonic acid, and phenylmethylarsinic acid in the blood and brain dialysate samples were obtained using simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Peak area-time profiles for linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol (fragrance compounds or plant-derived volatile organic chemicals) were obtained using simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in mice given lavender or rose essential oils intraperitoneally. BBB function was confirmed using lucifer yellow in these mice, and results indicated that the phenyl arsenic compounds, linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol, passed through the BBB. The present study demonstrates that simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis in a free-moving mouse makes it possible to test the BBB permeability of chemicals when coupled with appropriate chemical analysis methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>Microdialysis</kwd><kwd>LC/MS/MS</kwd><kwd>GC/MS</kwd><kwd>Toxicokinetics</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0025">The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts transport of chemicals from the blood into the brain. The primary basis of the BBB is endothelial cells lining the brain capillaries [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given that the brain capillary endothelial cells are highly sealed together by tight junctions, the brain endothelial cells restrict movement of materials including ions, nutrients, hormones and endogenous solutes, larger molecules such as proteins, cells and xenobiotics between the blood and the brain interstitial fluid [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Limited kinds of materials and chemicals can pass through the BBB principally via passive diffusion (or the lipid-mediated transport mechanism) or carrier (or transporter)-mediated specific transport systems [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Chemicals can influence brain function after passing through the BBB. Assessment of neurotoxicity requires information regarding the toxicokinetics of chemicals in both the brain and blood. Conventional methods measuring concentrations of chemicals in blood/plasma and brain tissue are resource-intensive in terms of animals, time, and costs. Alternative methods that allow efficient testing of the permeability of the BBB to chemicals would facilitate exploration of potentially neurotoxic chemicals among the large number of chemicals that have not been studied. A variety kinds of in vivo methods have been developed to assess the BBB transport of chemicals. The methods include the brain uptake index method, the intravenous injection method, the in situ brain perfusion method, the brain efflux index method, the percentage of the injected dose method, the cerebrospinal fluid sampling method, and the positron emission tomography method [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="par0030">Microdialysis is a well-established technique for in vivo measurement of exogenous and endogenous substances in both plasma and tissues [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In terms of toxicokinetic studies of chemicals in the brain, intracerebral microdialysis is the only technique that offers the possibility of continuously monitoring the BBB permeability of unbound chemicals in animals tested under physiological conditions [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Microdialysis allows continuous collection of a high number of samples over short time periods in the same animal, making determination of concentration&#x02013;time profiles with high time resolution possible. In addition, microdialysis allows sampling from multiple sites of the same animal [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. Simultaneous and continuous sampling from multiple sites is made possible without affecting toxicokinetic profiles by implanting more than one probe in the same animal. Simultaneous and continuous sampling from multiple sites in an animal can reduce the number of animals needed for the toxicokinetic studies. As a microdiaysis probe consists of a semipermeable membrane with a molecular mass cut-off ranging from 5000 to 50,000 Da, the dialysis membrane is only permeable to protein-unbound small molecules. Thus, microdialysis samples do not require purification prior to chemical analysis [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is another advantage of using microdialysis to conduct toxicokinetic studies.</p><p id="par0035">One of the disadvantages of microdialysis is that probe implantation may damage the BBB [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, microdialysis studies that examine the permeability of the BBB need to wait for recovery of brain damage after implantation of the brain probe. In addition, because anesthetic agents affect the function of the BBB [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], microdialysis sampling should be done in non-anesthetized animals to allow for examination of BBB permeability under physiological conditions.</p><p id="par0040">We report here a method for simultaneous microdialysis sampling from the blood and brain in a free-moving mouse. The method involved tested fluorescent chemicals that barely permeate the BBB [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Then, we examined whether the method was applicable for testing BBB permeability of chemicals by also performing chemical analysis methods. Whether or not phenyl arsenic compounds and fragrance compounds (plant-derived volatile organic chemicals [VOCs]) permeate the BBB was tested using simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in mice in which the BBB function was examined using the fluorescent chemicals.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p id="par0045">Male ICR strain mice (Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) aged 10&#x02013;20 weeks and weighing 40&#x02013;50 g at the start of experiments were used.

The BBB function in the mice was examined using a fluorescent dye lucifer yellow that barely passes through the BBB. When 25 mg/kg lucifer yellow was intravenously administered to mice, fluorescence intensity in blood dialysate samples significantly increased immediately after injection, whereas fluorescence intensity in the brain dialysate samples barely changed (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(a)). In order to validate this finding, the BBB function in different mice was tested using another fluorescent dye uranine that also barely passes through the BBB.

Our data showed that the BBB functioned almost normally under the experimental condition and thus the method would allow to test the BBB permeability of chemicals. In fact, the method was applicable to test the BBB permeability of phenyl arsenic compounds and plant-derived VOCs when coupled with LC/MS/MS or GC/MS.</p><p id="par0135">Use of chemicals that do not pass through the BBB is a way to test the BBB function. In the present study, two different fluorescent chemicals that barely pass through the BBB were used to validate the BBB function of mice under the experimental condition. Fluorescence intensity in brain dialysate samples barely changed after single administration of lucifer yellow or uranine, suggesting that the BBB was functioning in the mice. This interpretation was further supported by the present results that fluorescence intensity in the brain dialysate samples remarkably increased after co-administration of those fluorescent chemicals with 1 mL of 25 % mannitol solution. Hyperosmotic mannitol causes dehydration, shrinks endothelial cells of brain capillary vessels, tears tight junction between the endothelial cells, and thus opens the BBB [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Accordingly, no significant increase of the fluorescence intensity in the brain dialysate samples after the single administration of the fluorescent chemicals demonstrated the healthy BBB function. Chen et al. [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] report that intravenous mannitol does not increase the BBB permeability to Evans blue and uranine in adult rats. In their study, a single bolus intravenous administration of 20 % mannitol (dose; 0.5 g/kg) is made, immediately followed by intravenous administration of 0.5 mL saline that dilutes the concentration of mannitol in blood. In our study, 1 mL of 25 % mannitol solution was intravenously administered. The dose was calculated to be about 6.3 g/kg. Given that the total blood volume in a mouse is much smaller than that in a rat, mannitol in brain capillary could reach the concentration enough to open the BBB in mice in the current study.</p><p id="par0140">DPAA is a ground water pollutant in Japan [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>], and is suspected to have caused health problems in a group of citizens who used polluted well water. Major symptoms observed in the patients were neurologic in nature such as staggering, gait disturbances, hand tremors, weakness in extremities, titubation, scanning speech, myoclonus, impairment of ocular movement, insomnia and/or nightmares and memory impairment [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. DPAA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Oral administration of DPAA produces various behavioral effects in rodents [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>]. The highest level of arsenicals are detected in the brain compared with other organs in DPAA-administered rats [<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, the concentration of DPAA in the brain is higher than that in the other tissues in DPAA-administered rats [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These observations suggest that DPAA passes through the BBB and affects brain function. The results of the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with LC/MS/MS demonstrated that DPAA was absorbed into the blood and distributed to the brain through the BBB within 25 min after oral administration. Although DPAA rapidly entered the brain after oral administration, the behavioral effects of DPAA in rodents have been shown to become apparent after prolonged administration (the Ministry of the Environment, 2006; [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). DPAA acutely alters gene and protein expressions in cultured astrocytes and cells [<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], although some unknown processes that take a longer time to occur may also cause behavioral effects.</p><p id="par0145">PAA and PMAA are also found in environmental and biological specimens [<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and in urine and serum of the patients exposed to the polluted well water [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, it remained unclear whether PAA and PMAA affected the brain. As our LC/MS/MS analysis method was able to detect not only DPAA but also PAA and PMAA, we tested whether PAA and PMAA entered the brain in mice after oral administration. The results of the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with LC/MS/MS demonstrated for the first time that PAA and PMAA were absorbed into the blood and distributed to the brain through the BBB within 25 min after oral administration.</p><p id="par0150">The current study revealed that phenyl arsenic compounds such as DPAA, PAA and PMAA were rapidly distributed to the brain through the BBB after oral administration.. The phenyl arsenic compounds did not affect the BBB impermeability of lucifer yellow when administered together, suggesting that the passage of these phenyl arsenic compounds into the brain occurred within the intact permeability capacity of the healthy BBB. The BBB permeability of chemicals correlates with their octanol/water partition coefficients (log Pow) [<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Phenyl groups increase the log Pow value of arsenic compounds (arsenic acid, -3.14; DPAA, 1.2; PAA, 0.06) [<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], therefore, phenyl-groups may be involved in the BBB permeability of the phenyl arsenic compounds</p><p id="par0155">As many plant-derived VOCs produce a variety of subjectively pleasant odors, they are used as fragrance compounds in food, beverages, and other products used daily such as cosmetics, cleaning products, and air fresheners. Similar to man-made VOCs such as anesthetics and organic solvents, fragrance compounds are known to influence brain function [<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>]. Lavender and rose essential oils, mixtures of plant-derived VOCs obtained from the flowers, produce behavioral effects such as antianxiety-like effects in mice in the conflict tests after intraperitoneal administration [<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol are the major constituents of lavender and rose essential oils, respectively. Given that linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol also produce antianxiety-like effects in the conflict tests in mice after intraperitoneal administration, it is suggested that linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol enter the brain after the intraperitoneal administration of the lavender and rose essential oils to produce the behavioral effects ([<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], 2006). The results of the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with GC/MS demonstrated that linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol were rapidly absorbed into the blood and distributed to the brain through the BBB after intraperitoneal administration of lavender and rose essential oils. The results suggest that linalool and 2-phenethyl alcohol easily permeate the BBB like man-made VOCs.</p><p id="par0160">One advantage of the method reported here is that blood and brain microdialysis is conducted in a mouse under almost physiological conditions. The micorodialysis was conducted 3&#x02013;5 days after brain probe implantation, which could be enough for the damaged BBB to recover. Sampling was conducted 1 day after anesthesia for implantation of the blood probe; therefore, the BBB was not affected by the anesthesia. Confirmation using fluorescent compounds ensured BBB function in mice. In the present study, the blood and brain microdialysis made it possible to test the BBB permeability of test compounds when coupled with appropriate chemicals analysis methods. Various methods for determining recovery rate have been developed. In vivo recovery estimations for test compounds would allow quantitative toxicokinetic analyses using data obtained by the blood and brain microdialysis. Toxicokinetic analyses using mathematic models can provide information about not only the extent of transport but also estimates of influx and efflux clearances at the BBB [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate the BBB permeability in vivo [<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but it is difficult for the MRI method to identify specific compounds. Positron emission tomography (PET) is also used to assess a unidirectional influx rate constant for specific compounds in vivo [<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The PET method can trace isotope-labeled specific compounds, however, correction for the decay of the isotope and subtraction of the radioactivity signals from the metabolites are necessary to obtain reliable results. Due to their spatial resolution, the MRI and PET methods are difficult to apply small animals such as mice. In addition, both the MRI and PET methods require immobilization of subject animals. Although quantitative toxicokinetic analyses were not conducted in the present study, the present study showed that semi-quantitative data were also useful to examine whether or not test compounds permeated the BBB.</p><p id="par0165">Standard neurotoxicity tests using animals are laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis sampling in a free-moving mouse would help with efficient exploration of BBB permeable chemicals that may trigger neurotoxicologic effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec0075"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="par0170">In the present study, we established the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis in a free-moving mouse. Validation tests using the chemicals that barely permeate the BBB showed that the BBB was functioning in the mice under the experimental conditions. The BBB permeability of phenyl arsenicals was observed using the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with LC/MS/MS. The BBB permeability of fragrance compounds was observed using the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis coupled with GC/MS. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis in a free-moving mouse made it possible to test the BBB permeability of chemicals when coupled with appropriate chemical analysis methods.
