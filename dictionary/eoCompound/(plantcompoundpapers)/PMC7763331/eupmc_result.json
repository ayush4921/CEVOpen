    "In order to contribute to the understanding of the antioxidant behavior of plant bioactive compounds with respect to specific subcellular targets, in this study, their capability to protect aconitase activity from oxidative-mediated dysfunction was evaluated for the first time in plant mitochondria. Interest was focused on the Krebs cycle enzyme catalyzing the citrate/isocitrate interconversion via <i>cis</i>-aconitate, as it possesses a [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster at the active site, making it an early and highly sensitive target of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage. In particular, the effect on the aconitase reaction of five natural phenols, including ferulic acid, apigenin, quercetin, resveratrol, and curcumin, as well as of the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, was investigated in highly purified mitochondria obtained from durum wheat (DWM). Interestingly, a short-term (10 min) DWM pre-treatment with all investigated compounds, applied at 150 µM (75 µM in the case of resveratrol), completely prevented aconitase damage induced by a 15 min exposure of mitochondria to 500 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Curcumin and quercetin were also found to completely recover DWM-aconitase activity when phytochemical treatment was performed after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage. In addition, all tested phytochemicals (except ferulic) induced a significant increase of aconitase activity in undamaged mitochondria. On the contrary, a relevant protective and recovery effect of only quercetin treatment was observed in terms of the aconitase activity of a commercial purified mammalian isoform, which was used for comparison. Overall, the results obtained in this study may suggest a possible role of phytochemicals in preserving plant mitochondrial aconitase activity, as well as energy metabolism, against oxidative damage that may occur under environmental stress conditions. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the physiological role and the mechanism responsible for this short-term protective effect."
