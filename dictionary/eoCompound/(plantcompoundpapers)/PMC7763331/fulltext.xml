Interest was focused on the Krebs cycle enzyme catalyzing the citrate/isocitrate interconversion via <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate, as it possesses a [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster at the active site, making it an early and highly sensitive target of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage. In particular, the effect on the aconitase reaction of five natural phenols, including ferulic acid, apigenin, quercetin, resveratrol, and curcumin, as well as of the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, was investigated in highly purified mitochondria obtained from durum wheat (DWM). Interestingly, a short-term (10 min) DWM pre-treatment with all investigated compounds, applied at 150 &#x000b5;M (75 &#x000b5;M in the case of resveratrol), completely prevented aconitase damage induced by a 15 min exposure of mitochondria to 500 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Curcumin and quercetin were also found to completely recover DWM-aconitase activity when phytochemical treatment was performed after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage. In addition, all tested phytochemicals (except ferulic) induced a significant increase of aconitase activity in undamaged mitochondria. On the contrary, a relevant protective and recovery effect of only quercetin treatment was observed in terms of the aconitase activity of a commercial purified mammalian isoform, which was used for comparison. Overall, the results obtained in this study may suggest a possible role of phytochemicals in preserving plant mitochondrial aconitase activity, as well as energy metabolism, against oxidative damage that may occur under environmental stress conditions. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the physiological role and the mechanism responsible for this short-term protective effect.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aconitase</kwd><kwd>antioxidant capacity</kwd><kwd>plant mitochondria</kwd><kwd>durum wheat</kwd><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>phytochemicals</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-antioxidants-09-01256"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In the past few decades, a great deal of attention has been focused on natural compounds of vegetal origin, often referred to as phytocompounds or phytochemicals. They include chemically and structurally different plant secondary metabolites, divided into the major classes of polyphenols, terpenes, betalains, organ sulfur compounds, etc. [<xref rid="B1-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They are synthesized and accumulated by plants to perform their normal physiological functions, as well as to respond to various environmental stresses and to protect themselves from microbial pathogens, invading insects, herbivorous animals, and competitor plants [<xref rid="B1-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to the advantages for plant development and survival, it is widely accepted that the regular consumption of foods rich in phytochemicals can also exert a beneficial role in extending and/or improving human health [<xref rid="B1-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many beneficial effects of phytochemicals on both plant growth and human health are attributable to their ability to counteract reactive xygen species (ROS), by both direct (free radical scavenging, singlet oxygen quenching, hydroperoxide inactivation, etc.) and indirect (up-regulation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes and modulation of redox signaling and gene expression) antioxidant mechanisms [<xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In order to investigate the antioxidant mechanisms of plant-derived compounds and plant extracts, a considerable number of chemical assays for in vitro measurement of the antioxidant capacity (AC) have been developed [<xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since these methods show the common limit of highlighting only one or a few antioxidant functions [<xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], an AC evaluation of plant metabolites should not be concluded based on a single test; instead, an adequate combinatory application of different in vitro AC assays is recommended [<xref rid="B4-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>However, in vitro AC assessment cannot reflect the in vivo conditions [<xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In light of this, to obtain more advanced information on the antioxidant efficacy of plant metabolites, an evaluation of the effects exerted at a subcellular level is worthwhile. Among subcellular compartments, mitochondria represent an interesting potential target of antioxidant action. These specialized organelles play prominent roles in cell metabolism and energy generation, as well as in the regulation of cell survival/apoptosis and in the maintenance of cellular antioxidant/oxidant homeostasis, also being one of the main intracellular sites of ROS generation [<xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With respect to this last point, plant mitochondria are exposed to high ROS production due to the high oxygen concentration in plant cells, but they also possess very efficient defense systems to counteract ROS-induced damage, thus playing a key role in cell adaptation to environmental stress [<xref rid="B11-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As for animal systems, oxidative stress-induced impairment of mitochondrial functions is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of aging and a broad variety of human degenerative diseases [<xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It should also be considered that the effect of different phytochemicals on various mitochondrial functions and processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis, membrane potential, and ROS production, signaling to and from mitochondria, has been largely investigated in animals [<xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas very few reports are available for plant systems [<xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. </p><p>The aspect of mitochondrial metabolism on which we focused our interest is the aconitase activity. Mitochondrial aconitase (aconitate hydratase; citrate hydrolyase; EC 4.2.1.3) is a dehydratase that operates in the Krebs cycle by catalyzing the reversible stereo-specific isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via the dehydrated intermediate <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate [<xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A different aconitase isoform operates in the cytosol, where it is involved in iron homeostasis in animal cells, as well as in the glyoxylate cycle in oil-storing plant seeds and in the operation of the citrate valve in plant leaves [<xref rid="B16-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Aconitase is an iron&#x02013;sulfur protein containing a [4Fe&#x02013;4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster at the active site. This explains its high sensitivity to oxidative damage by ROS, as well as nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite, which induce reversible inactivation of the enzyme due to Fe-S cluster oxidation according to the reaction [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup>&#x02192;[3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> + Fe<sup>2+</sup> [<xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In light of this, aconitase activity can be considered as an early sensor of the redox status and a biomarker for oxidative stress [<xref rid="B19-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, in animals, Krebs cycle alterations due to the NO targeting of mitochondrial aconitase have recently been demonstrated to play a key role in immunometabolism through regulation of the macrophage function [<xref rid="B20-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In plants, the ROS/NO-induced inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase may be a sensitive mechanism able to mediate the signaling pathways required to initiate responses to abiotic and biotic stresses [<xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>On the other hand, it should also be outlined that the protection of aconitase enzymes may have a critical role in protecting the mitochondrial functions from oxidative stress damage [<xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>With respect to this last point, it should be underlined that the potential protective effect of several plant bioactive compounds against mitochondrial aconitase oxidative damage has been the subject of numerous literature studies only involving animal systems. Most of these are in vivo studies, in which aconitase activity was assayed in mitochondria isolated from tissues/organs of animals administered with both the oxidant and antioxidant under study [<xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other studies were performed on cell cultures, subjected to long-term treatment with the oxidizing compound/condition and the tested phytochemical, followed by aconitase activity measurement in isolated mitochondria [<xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Conversely, knowledge about the short-term protective effect of bioactive compounds on mitochondrial aconitase dysfunction remains very limited. In fact, only one study is available, in which the effect of 5 min incubation with curcumin of mice colon mitochondria was evaluated before treatment with the inflammatory agent 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) [<xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, to date, the effect of bioactive compounds on the activity of plant mitochondrial aconitase has not been investigated. </p><p>In light of this, the goal of this study was to gain the first insights into the effect of short-term mitochondria treatment with different phytochemicals on aconitase damage. For this purpose, six structurally different plant metabolites were evaluated, including five natural phenols, such as the hydroxycinnamic acid derivative ferulic acid, the flavonoids apigenin and quercetin, the stilbenoid resveratrol, and the diphenylheptanoid curcumin, as well as the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. The antioxidant properties of these phytocompounds, as well as their health-promoting effects and therapeutic potential, in age-related disorders have been largely investigated by numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations, including human studies and animal models [<xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In light of the lack of information on the subject in plant systems, the direct effect of the above-mentioned phytochemicals on the aconitase reaction was explored for the first time in highly purified mitochondria obtained from durum wheat (<italic>Triticum durum</italic> Desf.). This is a cereal crop largely cultivated in semiarid Mediterranean regions, where it faces many environmental stresses that can trigger several biochemical, physiological, and morphological changes [<xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as well as an oxidative stress condition at a cellular/subcellular level [<xref rid="B11-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With respect to this last point, durum wheat mitochondria (DWM) have been extensively studied, since they have been demonstrated to be a target of ROS [<xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as to actively participate in the cell defense against oxidative stress [<xref rid="B11-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, for this plant species, an isolation procedure proving the high yield of pure and intact mitochondria from etiolated seedlings is also available [<xref rid="B43-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For a comparison with DWM-aconitase, the enzymatic activity of a commercially available mammalian isoform (m-aconitase) was also evaluated. Oxidative damage to both aconitase activity sources was imposed by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, and the protective and recovery effects of treatment with the phytochemicals under study were evaluated. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-antioxidants-09-01256"><title>2.

In particular, the conversion of citrate into isocitrate catalyzed by aconitase was monitored by following the absorbance increase at 340 nm at 25 &#x000b0;C due to NADPH (&#x003b5;<sub>340</sub> = 6.22 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) generation during the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate catalyzed by the coupled isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction.

The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage to aconitase activity was calculated as the (%) decrease of the reaction rate measured after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment with respect to that of the control reaction, i.e., the reaction measured at time 0 (without the incubation of proteins in the assay mixture) and in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In the experiments aimed at evaluating the protective effects of phytochemicals against the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage, a pre-treatment of m-aconitase for 10 min with the investigated phytochemical in the 50&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M range (25&#x02013;75 &#x003bc;M for resveratrol) was carried out, followed by 15 min treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (750 and 250 &#x003bc;M in Figure 3 and Figure 5, respectively), after which the enzymatic activity was measured.

In Vitro Antioxidant Capacity (AC) of Pure Phytochemicals</title><p>In order to ascertain the direct antioxidant effect of the five different natural phenols under study, as well as the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, in vitro AC was preliminarily investigated using the well-known TEAC and ORAC methods. These AC assays were chosen as they use different reaction mechanisms: TEAC is mainly based on redox reactions involving single electron transfer (SET) between ABTS<sup>+</sup> radical and antioxidant species, while in the ORAC assay, the FL oxidation by peroxyl radicals involves hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions. The results of AC measurements are reported in <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01256-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Both TEAC and ORAC protocols highlighted remarkable ABTS&#x02219;<sup>+</sup> and peroxyl radical scavenging activities of the tested phytochemicals, respectively. TEAC measured the highest AC value for quercetin, followed by the other compounds, according to the following rank: resveratrol &#x0003e; apigenin &#x0003e; curcumin &#x0003e; ferulic acid. As expected, based on the different reaction mechanisms, a different behavior was observed for the ORAC method. This assay provided AC values about 1.5-4-fold higher than those of the TEAC method, with the highest and lowest ones being observed for resveratrol and ferulic acid, respectively. Overall, the TEAC and ORAC measurements confirm the high antioxidant properties of the tested phenolic compounds, in agreement with previous literature data [<xref rid="B44-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As for sulforaphane, both AC assays were not able to evaluate any in vitro AC for this compound within the investigated range. This is in agreement with the incapability of this isothiocyanate compound to exert a direct antioxidant action, despite a wide range of other beneficial effects having been reported in animal systems, including indirect antioxidant effects by the induction of antioxidants and phase II detoxifying enzymes [<xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects [<xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-antioxidants-09-01256"><title>3.2. Induction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Damage to Aconitase Activity</title><p>As stated in the introduction, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of short-term treatment with different phytochemicals on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage on DWM-aconitase activity. For this purpose, the enzymatic activity was evaluated by an aconitase/isocitrate dehydrogenase coupled reaction-based assay, during which a preliminary kinetic characterization of the aconitase reaction was performed (data not shown). In particular, the DWM-aconitase activity exhibited a behavior that was linearly dependent on the DWM amount in the range from 37.5 to 300 &#x003bc;g and a hyperbolic relationship for the citrate concentration according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, with Km for citrate and Vmax values equal to 4.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 mM and 29 &#x000b1; 1 nmol min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of DWM protein, respectively.</p><p>To define the experimental conditions able to induce damage to aconitase activity, preliminarily, the effect of different H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (250, 500, and 750 &#x003bc;M), as well as different incubation times (5, 10, and 15 min), on m-aconitase activity was evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Firstly, m-aconitase activity was shown to remain rather constant over 15 min incubation under control conditions (data not shown). As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not affect m-aconitase activity up to 10 min incubation, regardless of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration used. On the contrary, after 15 min incubation, a decrease of enzyme activity was observed, whose magnitude was proportional to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. When 20 E.U. of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging enzyme catalase (CAT) was preliminarily added to the same reaction mixture, enzyme inactivation was totally prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), confirming that damage really depends on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. CAT was verified to have no effect on the enzyme activity. Data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B were reorganized as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, in which only the data referring to the enzyme activity measured after 15 min incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are reported. A progressive decrease of enzyme activity up to about 55% in the presence of 750 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was clearly observed, which was totally prevented by CAT.</p><p>A similar behavior was obtained when DWM-aconitase was assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In this case, only the effect of 15 min of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure was evaluated. Incubation with different H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (250&#x02013;1000 &#x003bc;M) induced a progressive inhibition of the enzyme activity up to about 60% in the presence of 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Similar to m-aconitase, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage was totally prevented by CAT, thus confirming that, also in this case, the inactivation really depends on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Once again, CAT was verified to have no effect on the mitochondrial enzyme activity and the DWM-aconitase activity under control conditions remained constant for 15 min.</p><p>The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f002">Figure 2</xref> indicate that the inhibition of aconitase activity by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was a function of both the incubation time and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration and confirm, once again, that mitochondrial aconitase represents a protein responsive to ROS-mediated oxidative damage [<xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, at external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations equal to 750 and 500 &#x003bc;M, 15 min incubation halved the enzyme activity of both m-aconitase and DWM-aconitase, respectively. On the other hand, the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f002">Figure 2</xref> may suggest a lower sensitivity of DWM-aconitase with respect to other plant species. In fact, the activity of aconitase isolated from potato tuber mitochondria was found to be completely blocked by 300 and 500 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in about 6 and 3 min, respectively [<xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, the activity of mitochondrial aconitase isoform purified from 4-day-old maize scutella showed complete inactivation at 300 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This different H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity could be explained considering that potato tuber and maize scutella aconitase isoforms were highly purified mitochondrial enzymes, while DWM-aconitase activity was assayed within its biological environment (i.e., the mitochondrial suspension), where the occurrence of other reactions involving H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cannot be excluded.</p><p>Based on the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f002">Figure 2</xref>, in the subsequent experiments on DWM-aconitase and m-aconitase, a 15 min incubation with 500 and 750 &#x003bc;M of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was respectively performed, as these treatments produced comparably significant damage, corresponding to 50 &#x000b1; 5 (%) enzyme inactivation, in both aconitase sources, without completely compromising the enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-antioxidants-09-01256"><title>3.3. Effect of Phytochemicals on the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-Induced Damage of Aconitase</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the possible protective effect of the investigated phenolic compounds, as well as the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, against the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage of m-aconitase activity was reported. The enzyme was pre-incubated for 10 min with the different investigated phytochemicals, followed by 15 min treatment with 750 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated m-aconitase) or not (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-untreated m-aconitase). Based on literature indications [<xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], in the present study, all tested compounds were evaluated in the 50&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M range, except for resveratrol, which was tested in the 25&#x02013;75 &#x003bc;M range due to its higher absorbance at 340 nm. All tested phytocompounds were proven to have no effect on the coupled enzymatic assay.</p><p>In accordance with the results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the incubation of m-aconitase with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> almost halved the enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, when m-aconitase was pre-incubated with ferulic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), partial protection of the enzyme activity was obtained, reaching up to about 80% of the control (corresponding to a protective effect of about 45% of the oxidative damage) in the presence of 100&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M ferulic acid. Moreover, statistically significant but very low (up to about 10%) direct activation was observed in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-untreated m-aconitase at 100&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M ferulic acid.</p><p>Contrarily, quercetin was able to exert a more evident positive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage of m-aconitase was completely prevented by 50 &#x003bc;M quercetin and its positive effect was even more evident at higher quercetin concentrations. Interestingly, a little direct enzyme activation, up to about 20% in the presence of 150 &#x003bc;M quercetin, was also observed in untreated m-aconitase. As for apigenin, no protective effect on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damaged m-aconitase was obtained, despite a very low direct activation of the enzyme (about 10%) being measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast, both resveratrol and sulforaphane were unable to exert an effect on both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damaged and untreated m-aconitase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>D,F), whereas curcumin exerted only a small protective role, up to about 40% of the damage at 150 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>E).</p><p>A very different behavior was obtained when the tested phytochemicals were evaluated on the DWM-aconitase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In this case, all tested compounds were studied at 150 &#x003bc;M (75 &#x003bc;M in the case of resveratrol). In line with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f002">Figure 2</xref>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment induced damage of the enzyme activity of about 50&#x02013;55%. The pre-incubation of DWM with 150 &#x003bc;M ferulic acid almost completely prevented aconitase activity in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated mitochondria, thus indicating the capability of this phenolic acid to prevent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent inhibition of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Quercetin pre-treatment ameliorated&#x02014;up to about 90% of the control&#x02014;the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced suppression of aconitase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), while activity in DWM exposed to both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and apigenin was even 35% higher than that measured in untreated DWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Interestingly, when DWM were treated with 150 &#x003bc;M of both quercetin and apigenin alone, a remarkable activation&#x02014;up to about 25% and 50%&#x02014;of aconitase activity was found, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). Resveratrol alone, applied at a concentration equal to 75 &#x003bc;M, was able to completely protect the enzyme against the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent damage and to increase aconitase activity by about 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). Interestingly, 150 &#x003bc;M curcumin provided the highest activation of DWM-aconitase, being 65% higher than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f004">Figure 4</xref>E); as observed for apigenin, the remarkable aconitase activation by curcumin was also maintained after DWM treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, sulforaphane was able to totally prevent the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced DWM-aconitase damage and activate the enzyme up to about 25% in both the absence and presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The protective effect of phytochemicals was also evaluated against minor damage of aconitase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f005">Figure 5</xref>). For this purpose, we only focused on m-aconitase, since the complete protection of DWM-aconitase by all tested phytochemicals had already been observed against 500 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage. In particular, after a pre-treatment with phytocompounds at 150 &#x003bc;M (75 &#x003bc;M in the case of resveratrol), a 15 min treatment of m-aconitase with 250 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was performed, as it was able to induce oxidative damage of about 25&#x02013;30% (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In accordance with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>, a partial protective effect by ferulic acid and curcumin and more than complete protection by quercetin of the enzyme activity were observed on 250 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated m-aconitase. Interestingly, unlike the results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f003">Figure 3</xref>, a statistically significant protection (about 90% of the control corresponding to about 30% of damage) of the enzyme activity by resveratrol was also observed. Once again, apigenin and sulforaphane were unable to exert any effect. These data suggest that (i) the extent of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage may affect the behavior of the various phytochemicals in a different manner and (ii) the efficacy of the tested compounds may be different, depending on the stoichiometry (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: phytochemical) adopted.</p><p>The tested phytocompounds were also evaluated in relation to their possible role in restoring aconitase activity after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, i.e., when the oxidative damage is already established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Both m-aconitase and DWM were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (750 and 500 &#x003bc;M, respectively) for 15 min; the last 5 min of which occurred in the presence of the tested phytochemicals at 150 &#x003bc;M (75 &#x003bc;M in the case of resveratrol). None of the investigated compounds were able to exert a significant positive effect on m-aconitase activity, with the only exception of quercetin, which induced an almost complete recovery of the enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). As for DWM-aconitase, ferulic acid, resveratrol, and sulforaphane were unable to exert any positive effect under the set experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). On the other hand, apigenin induced only a partial restoration of enzyme activity of about 80% of the control, whereas a more than complete recovery of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damaged DWM-aconitase was observed for quercetin. Interestingly, curcumin was able to not only completely recover the damaged DWM-aconitase activity, but also to activate the enzyme by about 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01256-f006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>On the whole, the information obtained in this study is very interesting and can be considered a novelty with respect to several different aspects, although further investigations are needed to clarify them.</p><p>Firstly, in terms of the comparison of the performance of DWM- and m-aconitase enzymes investigated in this study, a very different sensitivity towards the protecting/recovering action of the phytochemicals against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage was observed. In fact, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage to DWM-aconitase was prevented by all tested compounds, albeit with a different effectiveness, as well as partially recovered by apigenin and totally by quercetin and curcumin. Moreover, with the only exception of ferulic acid, all tested compounds also exhibited the ability to increase aconitase activity in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-untreated DWM. On the other hand, only quercetin seems to have significantly important protective and recovery effects on m-aconitase activity, as well as to induce an about 20% activation of undamaged enzyme. Lacking literature information about these aspects, this different behavior could be speculated to partly depend on differences between DWM- and m-aconitase activity assays, which were performed on purified mitochondria preparations in the first case and on highly purified commercial enzyme from a porcine heart in the second one. The use of this commercial purified aconitase enzyme implies the need to externally supply cysteine and iron to restore activity lost during the purification procedure due to the higher sensitivity of the mammalian Fe-S cluster to degradation compared to plant isoforms [<xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is possible to speculate that the different reaction environment for aconitase activity assessment due to the presence of iron and reducing agents can mask/affect the phytochemical effect in the case of m-aconitase. However, a higher sensitivity to the phytochemical protecting/recovering action of plant aconitases, compared to the animal ones, cannot be excluded, since no literature information is available about this aspect in plant systems, as discussed below.</p><p>It should be considered that the results obtained in this study about the short-term protective role of phytochemicals over aconitase activity changes are in agreement with that reported by Mouzaoui et al. [<xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], showing the capability of 5 min curcumin treatment to restore aconitase activity in TNBS-treated mice colon mitochondria. Moreover, the results of the present study are also in accordance with some literature reports relative to long-term phytochemical treatment performed in animal systems. In particular, these data regard the capability of (i) curcumin to prevent aconitase damage in liver [<xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], heart [<xref rid="B25-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and kidney [<xref rid="B27-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] mitochondria isolated by treated rats; (ii) sulforaphane to abrogate the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effect on mitochondrial aconitase activity in SH-SY5Y cells [<xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and to prevent aconitase inactivation in kidney mitochondria isolated from cisplatin-treated rats [<xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; and (iii) quercetin to partly ameliorate the suppression of aconitase activity in mice subjected to intense exercise [<xref rid="B59-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Compared to these literature data, the present study shows several novelty items, the most relevant of which is that for the first time the phytochemical prevention of oxidative stress-mediated dysfunction of mitochondrial aconitase has been studied in plant systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first study providing evidence about the effect of ferulic, apigenin, and resveratrol on aconitase activity, for which no literature data are available, even in animal systems. In addition, with the only exception of curcumin [<xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], for the first time, the protecting activity of phytochemicals, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and isothiocyanate compounds, has been investigated in the present study by the direct and short treatment of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damaged DWM-aconitase.</p><p>As for the mechanism responsible for the aconitase-damage protecting activity of short-term phytochemical treatment observed in this study, further studies are required to elucidate it.

With respect to this point, the capability to efficiently scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is widely known for the tested phenolic compounds, including ferulic acid, quercetin, resveratrol, and curcumin [<xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Moreover, in accordance with their high reducing activity against the ABTS&#x02219;<sup>+</sup> radical cation, the capability of the investigated phytochemicals to act as reducing agents, which are reported to be capable of maintaining the reducing groups of the protein and the iron in the reduced state [<xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], cannot be excluded under the applied experimental conditions. However, the high protecting efficacy observed after DWM pre-treatment with sulforaphane&#x02014;unable to exert a direct antioxidant action [<xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]&#x02014;strongly suggests that the observed effect cannot depend solely on the direct H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging activity and reducing capacity of the investigated compounds. This is also suggested by the high recovery of aconitase activity shown by quercetin and curcumin, and to a lesser extent, by apigenin on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damaged DWM, as well as by quercetin in the case of m-aconitase. In addition, a direct interaction of phytochemicals with the aconitase enzyme could be another mechanism contributing to aconitase protection by short-term phytochemical treatment. The occurrence of this interaction can be suggested by the significant increase of aconitase activity observed after the incubation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-undamaged DWM with all tested phytochemicals (except ferulic acid), as well as with quercetin in the case of m-aconitase.</p><p>Even with respect to the effect of phytochemicals on untreated aconitase activity, the results provided by the present paper represent a novelty. Only one study is available, reporting a significant increase (30%) of aconitase activity in mitochondria isolated from PC12 cells, which was observed after long-term (24 h) cell treatment with curcumin [<xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, to date, the direct modulation of catalytic activity of mitochondrial aconitases by short-term phytochemical treatment has never been reported in either animals or plants. In light of the absolute lack of information on this issue, the possible chemical mechanisms responsible for direct phytochemical&#x02013;aconitase interaction remain to be fully elucidated. For this purpose, the possible involvement of the Fe-S cluster or other functional groups of the active site of the aconitase enzyme could be very interesting subjects of future investigations. However, the capability of some plant compounds to act as aconitase enzyme activators could have a relevant physiological significance. A potential role of phytochemicals in preserving aconitase functioning can be suggested, as well as in protecting mitochondrial energy metabolism and in maintaining redox homeostasis, in particular under oxidative stress conditions [<xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This regulation may be particularly interesting for plant systems, in which the accumulation of secondary metabolites, particularly that of phenolic compounds, occurs in vegetative tissues for adaptation to environmental stresses. In light of this, a possible role of plant mitochondrial aconitase as a sensitive mechanism operating in the regulation of plant metabolic networks connecting the Krebs cycle, ROS, and phenolic metabolism under stress conditions can be hypothesized based on the results obtained in this study.</p><p>Finally, the results reported in this study also suggest the possibility of using the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-damage protecting activity of mitochondrial aconitase as a useful tool for AC evaluations of plant bioactive compounds. To do this, the study should be enlarged to different classes of phytocompounds and plant extracts, possibly investigated in a wide concentration range, as well as at different incubation times. This innovative approach could integrate in vitro and in vivo AC studies, thus providing as much information as possible reflecting the in vivo antioxidant response.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-antioxidants-09-01256"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study confirm that mitochondrial aconitase represents a protein responsive to ROS-induced oxidative damage in durum wheat. Interestingly, for the first time, the capability of several plant secondary metabolites to counteract ROS-dependent aconitase inactivation has been demonstrated in plant mitochondria, and a possible phytochemical&#x02013;aconitase interaction has been suggested. Hence, this study promotes further research aimed at clarifying the mechanism and physiological role of this protective effect, as well as verifying if it is a property common to other plant mitochondria.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Roberta Montebello, Martina Di Benedetto, and Luigi Alessandro Testa, who participated as students in this work.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, M.S. and M.N.L.; writing of the original draft preparation, M.S. and M.N.L.; writing and editing, M.S. and M.N.L.
