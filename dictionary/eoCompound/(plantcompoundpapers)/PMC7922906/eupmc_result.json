    "This paper presents the results of the analysis of the chemical composition and content of heavy metal contamination in forest logging residues, in order to assess the possibility for their further utilisation. The samples were divided into 9 groups, which included coniferous tree cones, wood, and other multi-species logging residues. The elementary composition, ash content, and calorific value were determined as energy use indicators for the samples. Additionally, the content of heavy and alkali metals, which may affect combustion processes and pollutant emissions, was tested. The high content of heavy metals may also disqualify these residues for other uses. The research shows that the test residues are suitable for energy use due to their high calorific value and low content of heavy metals. However, an increased ash content in some samples and the presence of alkali metals, causing high-temperature corrosion of boilers, may disqualify them as a potential fuel in the combustion process. The forest residues may be used in other thermal processes such as pyrolysis or gasification. A low content of heavy metals and a high content of organic matter permit the use of these residues for the production of adsorbents or composite materials."
