GA<sub>3</sub> and synthetic cytokinin forchlorfenuron (N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N&#x02032;-phenylurea, CPPU) and their combination were applied to 6&#x02009;mm diameter fruitlets of &#x02018;Sable Seedless&#x02019;, and berries were sampled 51 and 70 days (d) following application. All treatments increased berry size and delayed sugar accumulation and acid degradation with a stronger effect of CPPU. CPPU, but not GA, reduced berry color and the levels of anthocyanins. While CPPU reduced the levels of anthocyanins by more than 50%, the combined treatment of GA+CPPU reduced the levels by about 25% at 51 d. CPPU treatment had minor effects on flavonols content but increased the levels of monomeric flavan-3-ols by more than two-fold. Phloroglucinol analysis using HPLC showed that proanthocyanidin content was significantly increased by CPPU, whereas mean degree of polymerization was reduced from 26 to 19. Volatile analysis by GC-MS showed changes in composition with CPPU or GA treatment with potential impact on flavor. RNA-seq analysis showed that GA had a minor overall effect on the transcriptome whereas CPPU had pronounced effects on gene expression at both 51 and 70 d. Comparing the control and CPPU at similar Brix of ca. 19.7&#x000b0;, a reduced expression of <italic>stilbene synthases</italic> (STSs) including their regulators <italic>MYB14</italic> and <italic>MYB15</italic>, and other phenylpropanoid-related genes was observed in CPPU-treated grapes. Overall, our study shows that CPPU had a major influence on the phenylpropanoid pathway and affected multiple ripening-related processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cytokinin</kwd><kwd>Gibberellins</kwd><kwd>Secondary metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IS-4975-16R</award-id><award-id>IS-4975-16R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebeler</surname><given-names>Susan E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lichter</surname><given-names>Amnon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Fruit development is mediated by plant growth regulators (PGRs) that control its major developmental processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As grape berries develop, they exhibit a double sigmoid growth curve separated by veraison that marks the beginning of ripening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Cell division and expansion are the major events during the first phase and are accompanied by synthesis and accumulation of organic acids, methoxypyrazines, and phenolic compounds such as proanthocyanidins (PAs) and hydroxycinnamates. This phase of berry growth is under the control of auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins. Auxins and gibberellins are mostly produced by the seeds while the source of cytokinins in fruits is less established and it is likely to be imported from the plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The number of seeds in the berry can determine berry size, and the lack of seeds or the presence of unfertilized ovules in sternospermocarpic (&#x02018;seedless&#x02019;) berries can be partly complemented by external gibberellin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Schematic representation of the levels of PGRs during development suggests that auxin levels are high at berry set and decrease during phase 1 while cytokinins and gibberellins peak during phase 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The second phase, verasion, marks the beginning of major processes in grapes ripening, berry softening and anthocyanins accumulation in colored varieties. There are reports of a small peak of ethylene preceded by a large peak of abscisic acid (ABA) which coincide with veraison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Brassinosteroids increase at veraison and participate in ripening, possibly by modulation of ethylene content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. On the other hand, auxin treatments retard sugar and anthocyanin accumulation and prevent the decrease in acidity and chlorophyll concentration, and also cause a delay in the usual ripening-associated increase in the levels of ABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The third phase in berry development is ripening which is characterized by accumulation of glucose and fructose, as well as a decrease in the levels of organic acids. Volatile compounds that are produced by grape berries during development and ripening include fatty acid derivatives that are the most abundant group, monoterpenes that are prominent flavor compounds in Muscat flavored grapes, sesquiterpenes, C<sub>13</sub> norisoprenoids, volatile sulfur compounds, and methoxypyrazines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Some volatile compound types such as methoxypyrazines and sesquiterpenes, C<sub>13</sub> norisoprenoids and volatile fatty acid derivatives accumulate in the berry before veraison while volatile monoterpenes and volatile sulfur compounds accumulate during ripening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Physiological studies on the role of PGRs in fruit development often rely on external applications of the hormones or their agonist followed by observations of the changes in fruit development. In table grapes there is a plethora of applicative studies aimed at increasing the berry size in &#x02018;seedless&#x02019; varieties and the color of red varieties grown in hot regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The effect of GA was studied from the late 1950s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> with timing and concentration being major factors. In &#x02018;seedless&#x02019; grapes, application of GA to increase berry size is performed at a fruitlet diameter of 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;mm because earlier application can have negative impacts on fruit-set and berry shot (berry set too high and presence of very small berries) and later application is less effective. The effective concentration of GA can vary markedly according to sensitivity of the variety to the hormone. For example, &#x02018;Thompson Seedless&#x02019; requires multiple applications and large cumulative amounts of GA exceeding 100&#x02009;ppm, while a single application of 10&#x02009;ppm of GA can triple the size of &#x02018;Black Finger&#x02019; berries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. GA is also known to potentially delay maturity, increase pedicel thickness, and increase berry abscission depending on the application time. If applied on the whole vine on sensitive varieties, GA can also harm reproductive meristems and reduce subsequent yield. The molecular aspects of the synthesis, signal perception, and transduction of GA in grapes have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The study of the effects of cytokinins on grape development focused largely on forchlorfenuron (N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N&#x02032;-phenylurea), a synthetic cytokinin known as CPPU, that has been tested and applied to regulate fruit-set, size, and shape in several fruit crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In grapes, CPPU was also reported to delay maturation and reduce berry skin color, increase berry pedicel thickness and rigidity, increase cuticle content, and reduce weight loss of the rachis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. CPPU is commercially applied at levels of 5&#x02009;ppm or lower due to its potential adverse effects on maturation and postharvest quality. The time frame for application of CPPU is usually similar to that of GA and often in combination with GA at reduced concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Other cytokinins such as benzyl adenine had similar effects but a concentration of 500&#x02013;1000&#x02009;ppm was required to increase berry size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Phenylpropanoids are a large class of plant secondary metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine in most plants or tyrosine in some monocots. The main branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway include lignans and lignins, stilbenes, coumarins, isoflavonoids, flavonoids, and PAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The biosynthesis of PAs, anthocyanins, and flavonols share common steps in the flavonoid pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In grape berries, the first committed steps in PA biosynthesis are catalyzed by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) by converting anthocyanidins to flavan-3-ols such as (+)-catechin (C) and (&#x02212;)-epicatechin (EC), respectively. The resulting (&#x02212;)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin derivatives can be oxidized to quinones, which are polymerized. However, it is not clear whether this polymerization of the soluble precursors proceeds enzymatically by laccases or non-enzymatically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The subunits of PA are derived from 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ols (i.e., (&#x02212;)-epicatechin and (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin (EGC), as well as from 2,3-<italic>trans</italic>-flavan-3-ols (i.e., (+)-catechin and (+)-gallocatechin) and are most commonly linked via 4 &#x003b2;&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;8C&#x02212;C bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The PAs are oligomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols that can range in size from 2 to 30 or more subunits. The regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway was studied extensively in grapes with respect to anthocyanins, PAs, and other branches of the pathway with emphasis on the role of R2R3-MYB, bHLH, and WD40 transcription factors and their target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Our previous study demonstrated that CPPU causes a marked increase in tannin content of Thompson Seedless<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thompson Seedless is a major variety but it does not produce anthocyanins and is very low in volatile content. In the current study we presented the following questions: (1) how do CPPU and GA affect tannin accumulation in a variety that is rich in anthocyanins and volatile compounds; and (2) how are biological processes at ripening affected by the treatments. These questions were addressed at the phenological level, by the analysis of relevant metabolites from the phenylpropanoid pathway, by volatile composition, and by transcriptome analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material and tissue collection</title><p id="Par7">Experiments were carried out on <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cv.

Fruitlet diameter and weight increased significantly by application of both GA and CPPU measured 7&#x02009;d after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, c</xref>). Interestingly, at 34&#x02009;d post treatment, berry diameter and weight of CPPU-treated berries was smaller than the control but this trend was reversed at later time points. At 51 and 70&#x02009;d after the treatments, CPPU increased berry weight and diameter significantly with respect to the control and the GA treatment. The GA treatment increased berry size by 17.5% and 13.4% at 51 and 70&#x02009;d, respectively, but at a later time point, the difference was not statistically significant from the control. The diameter and weight of berries treated with the combined treatment of GA&#x02009;+&#x02009;CPPU was higher than that of CPPU alone at both 51 and 70&#x02009;d. Brix of the control grapes was higher at all time-points followed by GA and CPPU (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). At 34&#x02009;d, berries treated with GA&#x02009;+&#x02009;CPPU had higher Brix as compared to CPPU-treated berries, but at later time points there were no differences among the two treatments. CPPU had a major effect on TA that was much higher than the other treatments at 34&#x02009;d after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). At both 34 and 51&#x02009;d, GA seemed to mitigate the effect of CPPU on TA.

There were major differences in ripening between the untreated grapes and grapes treated with CPPU, and this was also expressed in the number of DEGs at both early and late sampling. At the early and late sampling, there were 697 and 382 DEGs between the untreated and the CPPU-treated berries, respectively, and the reduction in the number of DEGs was mainly in the late sampling for genes with lower expression following CPPU treatment (Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). KEGG analysis of these two groups did not show any functional bin enrichment. In a separate analysis, the treatments were compared on the basis of similar Brix; this comparison was possible because the untreated berries reached a Brix of 19.8 at 51&#x02009;d while the CPPU-treated berries reached Brix of 19.6 at 70&#x02009;d. Comparing these two groups resulted in 313 and 589 DEGs with higher and lower expression from the untreated and CPPU-treated berries, respectively (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). KEGG analysis demonstrated that in this &#x02018;similar Brix&#x02019; group there was enrichment of 11 functional bins similar to those already present in cluster 3 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">A subset of 42 genes showed significant differences in three combinations: (1) Control vs. CPPU at 51&#x02009;d; (2) Control vs. CPPU at 70&#x02009;d; (3) Control at 51&#x02009;d vs. CPPU at 70&#x02009;d (similar Brix) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

Some cultivars are very sensitive to the treatment while others have a modest response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Sable Seedless can be assigned to the category of &#x02018;modest response to GA&#x02019;, with a significant effect on size at early sampling that is reduced at late harvest. The transcriptomic data for both 51 and 70&#x02009;d after the treatment, corresponding to early and late commercial harvest, suggest that GA did not have long-term effects on biological processes and this was also confirmed in the profile of phenylpropanoid metabolites. However, GA did delay maturity as expressed by lower TSS and TA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>), and also had an effect on volatile compounds (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In addition, when combined with CPPU, GA had some additive effects on fruit weight but it mitigated the response to CPPU with respect to acidity and reduction in some phenylpropanoid metabolites (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It is likely that higher doses of GA than the concentration used in this study (20&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), but still considered in the range of commercial practice for this cultivar, or multiple applications, would further increase the size and delay the ripening as previously reported in many studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our data and the literature support the notion that GA can trigger quantitative effects on berry size, but does not have a major impact on ripening processes under standard practice.</p><p id="Par28">In contrast to GA, CPPU affected a wide range of phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular responses. Since the introduction of CPPU, there have been a number of studies in grapes reporting beneficial effects on fruit size, and delays in maturity, abscission, rachis browning, decay, cuticle formation, volatile profile and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our study on the colorless cultivar &#x02018;Thompson Seedless&#x02019; pointed to the effect of CPPU on total tannin content resulting in higher astringency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It was therefore of interest to study how the interplay between the anthocyanin branch and the PA branch of the pathway is manifested in colored cultivars. Our data clearly shows that synthesis of PA is at the expense of anthocyanins with no particular effects on the type of anthocyanins produced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The fact that the level of flavonols was also reduced points to the possibility that either PA synthesis was induced by CPPU or that there was multiple repression of both the flavonol and anthocyanidin branches by genes such as <italic>MybA1</italic> and <italic>MybF1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. One interesting trend was the increase of (&#x02212;)-epicatechin during late ripening, both in the control and CPPU-treated berries (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), in contrast to previous results showing that flavan-3-ols in the skins peak at 2&#x02013;3 weeks after veraison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This increase can result from degradation of PAs, but there was no evidence for this in the total PA levels and the only PA monomer that decreased in content during ripening was ECG (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Both flavan-3-ols, (+)-catechin and (&#x02212;)-epicatechin, had higher concentration in CPPU-treated grapes and, thus, it can be hypothesized that there was a concomitant induction of their biosynthetic genes, <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>ANR</italic> by TFs such as <italic>MybPA1</italic> and <italic>MybPA2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. CPPU did not affect the expression level of <italic>VvMybPA1</italic> at 51&#x02009;d but the level of this gene was reduced at 70&#x02009;d post treatment (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). It is not known if the gene was actually induced by CPPU before veraison. It should however be noted that PAs are synthesized prior to veraison while anthocyanins are synthesized during or after veraison, bringing up the possibility that the decrease in anthocyanins may be due to deficiency in substrates in the berry rather than repression of the rate-limiting genes. In previous studies, cytokinins were shown to promote anthocyanin synthesis in shoots and leaves of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with concomitant transcriptional activation of the pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Likewise, introduction of a bacterial <italic>ipt</italic> gene to tobacco leaves increased the level of phenolic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">The inherent discrepancy of comparing gene expression by treatments that delay maturity was partially compensated by comparing differential expression of phenylpropanoid-related genes at similar Brix, i.e., control at 51&#x02009;d and CPPU at 70&#x02009;d after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). There is a remarkable reduced expression of 28 STSs in CPPU-treated berries (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The STS multigene family in grapes includes 48 annotated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Expression maps of STS genes suggest induction of gene expression by multiple biotic stresses including ethylene and jasmonate, while abiotic stresses had both suppressive and inductive effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, according to our data cytokinin may contribute to long-term inhibition of Vv<italic>STS</italic> expression. Of the upstream genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, 6 DEGs corresponded to <italic>PAL</italic> pointing to a trend of overall reduction in the pathway during ripening.

The expression of <italic>MYB14</italic> and <italic>MYB15</italic> was shown to increase with ripening in Pinot Noir grapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and therefore delay in ripening mediated by CPPU may reduce their expression. <italic>MybA3</italic> was shown to be a truncated non-functional protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. <italic>MYB136, MYB137</italic>, and <italic>MYB139</italic> showed high expression in CPPU-treated berries, and it will be interesting to find out if they are targets for cytokinin signaling in plants and bona fide regulators of Vv<italic>STS</italic> genes.

Similar to the previous report, our data showed that some genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, e.g., <italic>PAL</italic>, <italic>4CL</italic>, and <italic>UFGT</italic> had lower expression following CPPU treatment as well as fatty acid biosynthesis genes, amino acid biosynthesis, and volatile-related processes. Higher expression was observed for carotenoid-related genes, fatty acid metabolism genes, and auxin-related genes. In hormonal signaling, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> identified three accessions for <italic>TIFY 5A</italic>, two of which had higher expression at CPPU application level of 5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> but with reduced expression at a level of 10&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> CPPU. This is consistent with our study where one of the <italic>TIFY 5A</italic> had increased expression at both 51 and 70&#x02009;d (Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Another set of affected hormone-signaling genes in our study was that of the cytokinin receptor genes, of which <italic>ARR-5</italic> was repressed by CPPU at the late stage (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). In contrast, in &#x02018;Shine Muscat&#x02019; these genes were induced by CPPU. With respect to the volatile profile, similar reduction in terpenoids was encountered following CPPU treatment with respect to our sampling at 51&#x02009;d (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Several volatile compounds that were reduced after CPPU treatment in our study are consistent with reductions reported in Shine Muscat by Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, i.e., &#x003b1;-terpineol, linalool, 2-hexenal (E) at 51&#x02009;d post treatment and <italic>cis</italic> geraniol at 70&#x02009;d post treatment. Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> also reported an increase in hexanol in &#x02018;Shine Muscat&#x02019; following CPPU treatment but this was not the case for &#x02018;Sable&#x02019; in our study (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Instead, we observed that CPPU increased other fatty acid derivatives such as decanal, 2-pentenal (E) and 2-hexen-1-ol at 70&#x02009;d (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Another important effect of CPPU in our study was the reduction in sesquiterpenes at 51&#x02009;d (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). However, the significance of this reduction is unclear given the fact that CPPU had no effect on the level of sesquiterpenes at 70&#x02009;d. The fact that GA increased the levels of rose oxide, &#x003b1;-terpineol, and methyl geranate can strengthen the fruity flavor of the berries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">Given the large number of genes affected by CPPU, it was of interest to further look at a subset of genes that were consistently affected by the treatment at both 51 and 70&#x02009;d after treatment and in the &#x02018;similar Brix&#x02019; group (51&#x02009;d control and 70&#x02009;d CPPU). Two main processes were observed: increases in stress-related DEGs with hypoxia as a potential driver and increases in cell wall-related processes potentially associated with cell expansion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). While there are no physiological studies to support it in our data, hypoxia has previously been associated with ripening and cell death in grape berries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and it can be hypothesized that induction of stress/hypoxia-related genes by CPPU can therefore delay ripening. Mitigation of oxidative stress was attributed to cytokinin by proteins such as glutaredoxin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. With respect to cell wall-related genes, induction of <italic>expansins</italic> was described as a hallmark of response to cytokinin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> in addition to <italic>laccases</italic> and pectin-modifying genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).</p><p id="Par32">There are multiple interactions among plant hormones and changes during ripening. When compared on the basis of similar Brix among the control and the CPPU treatment, it appears that there is repression of several key genes related to hormone signaling (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). For example, <italic>AUX/IAA</italic> genes are inhibitors of auxin signaling that is known to delay ripening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> while <italic>GID2</italic> inhibits <italic>DELLA</italic> activity and allows response to gibberellins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Other genes with reduced expression upon CPPU treatment were a <italic>BRI1</italic>-associated kinase that controls brassinosteroids signaling and <italic>JAZ</italic> that is a negative regulator of JA signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Understanding the complex interaction between external hormone treatment and internal hormone signaling modules requires integration of knowledge from model systems with well-defined genetic resources and physiological data from crop plants.</p><p id="Par33">At the scientific level, this study provides strong evidence for the induction of PA biosynthesis by cytokinin and to its effects on delay of ripening. On the other hand, GA is shown to influence berry size but it does not seem to have a major impact on metabolic and molecular processes including PA biosynthesis. At the practical level, information from this study can be used by growers to better understand how applications of PGRs can modulate berry size, taste, flavor, and color.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec19"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="41438_2021_488_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>ANOVA of volatile compounds.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="41438_2021_488_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Differentially expressed gene list.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="41438_2021_488_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>DEGs: Control vs. CPPU 51&#x02009;d.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM4"><media xlink:href="41438_2021_488_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>DEGs: Control vs. CPPU 70&#x02009;d.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM5"><media xlink:href="41438_2021_488_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>DEGs: Control 51 d vs. CPPU 70&#x02009;d.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM6"><media xlink:href="41438_2021_488_MOESM6_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary Information</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41438-021-00488-0.</p></sec><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund Grant (No. IS-4957-16R).
