Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Cytokinin and gibberellic acid (GA) are growth regulators used to increase berry size in seedless grapes and it is of interest to understand their effects on the phenylpropanoid pathway and on ripening processes. GA<sub>3</sub> and synthetic cytokinin forchlorfenuron (N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-Nâ€²-phenylurea, CPPU) and their combination were applied to 6â€‰mm diameter fruitlets of â€˜Sable Seedlessâ€™, and berries were sampled 51 and 70 days (d) following application. All treatments increased berry size and delayed sugar accumulation and acid degradation with a stronger effect of CPPU. CPPU, but not GA, reduced berry color and the levels of anthocyanins. While CPPU reduced the levels of anthocyanins by more than 50%, the combined treatment of GA+CPPU reduced the levels by about 25% at 51 d. CPPU treatment had minor effects on flavonols content but increased the levels of monomeric flavan-3-ols by more than two-fold. Phloroglucinol analysis using HPLC showed that proanthocyanidin content was significantly increased by CPPU, whereas mean degree of polymerization was reduced from 26 to 19. Volatile analysis by GC-MS showed changes in composition with CPPU or GA treatment with potential impact on flavor. RNA-seq analysis showed that GA had a minor overall effect on the transcriptome whereas CPPU had pronounced effects on gene expression at both 51 and 70 d. Comparing the control and CPPU at similar Brix of ca. 19.7Â°, a reduced expression of <i>stilbene synthases</i> (STSs) including their regulators <i>MYB14</i> and <i>MYB15</i>, and other phenylpropanoid-related genes was observed in CPPU-treated grapes. Overall, our study shows that CPPU had a major influence on the phenylpropanoid pathway and affected multiple ripening-related processes.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">Fruit development is mediated by plant growth regulators (PGRs) that control its major developmental processes<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. As grape berries develop, they exhibit a double sigmoid growth curve separated by veraison that marks the beginning of ripening<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. Cell division and expansion are the major events during the first phase and are accompanied by synthesis and accumulation of organic acids, methoxypyrazines, and phenolic compounds such as proanthocyanidins (PAs) and hydroxycinnamates. This phase of berry growth is under the control of auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins. Auxins and gibberellins are mostly produced by the seeds while the source of cytokinins in fruits is less established and it is likely to be imported from the plant<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. The number of seeds in the berry can determine berry size, and the lack of seeds or the presence of unfertilized ovules in sternospermocarpic (â€˜seedlessâ€™) berries can be partly complemented by external gibberellin<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. Schematic representation of the levels of PGRs during development suggests that auxin levels are high at berry set and decrease during phase 1 while cytokinins and gibberellins peak during phase 1<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. The second phase, verasion, marks the beginning of major processes in grapes ripening, berry softening and anthocyanins accumulation in colored varieties. There are reports of a small peak of ethylene preceded by a large peak of abscisic acid (ABA) which coincide with veraison<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. Brassinosteroids increase at veraison and participate in ripening, possibly by modulation of ethylene content<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. On the other hand, auxin treatments retard sugar and anthocyanin accumulation and prevent the decrease in acidity and chlorophyll concentration, and also cause a delay in the usual ripening-associated increase in the levels of ABA<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. The third phase in berry development is ripening which is characterized by accumulation of glucose and fructose, as well as a decrease in the levels of organic acids. Volatile compounds that are produced by grape berries during development and ripening include fatty acid derivatives that are the most abundant group, monoterpenes that are prominent flavor compounds in Muscat flavored grapes, sesquiterpenes, C<sub>13</sub> norisoprenoids, volatile sulfur compounds, and methoxypyrazines<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a>,<a href="#CR6">6</a>,<a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. Some volatile compound types such as methoxypyrazines and sesquiterpenes, C<sub>13</sub> norisoprenoids and volatile fatty acid derivatives accumulate in the berry before veraison while volatile monoterpenes and volatile sulfur compounds accumulate during ripening<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a>,<a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par3">Physiological studies on the role of PGRs in fruit development often rely on external applications of the hormones or their agonist followed by observations of the changes in fruit development. In table grapes there is a plethora of applicative studies aimed at increasing the berry size in â€˜seedlessâ€™ varieties and the color of red varieties grown in hot regions<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a></sup>. The effect of GA was studied from the late 1950s<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup> with timing and concentration being major factors. In â€˜seedlessâ€™ grapes, application of GA to increase berry size is performed at a fruitlet diameter of 4â€"6â€‰mm because earlier application can have negative impacts on fruit-set and berry shot (berry set too high and presence of very small berries) and later application is less effective. The effective concentration of GA can vary markedly according to sensitivity of the variety to the hormone. For example, â€˜Thompson Seedlessâ€™ requires multiple applications and large cumulative amounts of GA exceeding 100â€‰ppm, while a single application of 10â€‰ppm of GA can triple the size of â€˜Black Fingerâ€™ berries<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a></sup>. GA is also known to potentially delay maturity, increase pedicel thickness, and increase berry abscission depending on the application time. If applied on the whole vine on sensitive varieties, GA can also harm reproductive meristems and reduce subsequent yield. The molecular aspects of the synthesis, signal perception, and transduction of GA in grapes have been reported<sup><a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par4">The study of the effects of cytokinins on grape development focused largely on forchlorfenuron (N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-Nâ€²-phenylurea), a synthetic cytokinin known as CPPU, that has been tested and applied to regulate fruit-set, size, and shape in several fruit crops<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a>,<a href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. In grapes, CPPU was also reported to delay maturation and reduce berry skin color, increase berry pedicel thickness and rigidity, increase cuticle content, and reduce weight loss of the rachis<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a>â€"<a href="#CR18">18</a></sup>. CPPU is commercially applied at levels of 5â€‰ppm or lower due to its potential adverse effects on maturation and postharvest quality. The time frame for application of CPPU is usually similar to that of GA and often in combination with GA at reduced concentrations<sup><a href="#CR16">16</a></sup>. Other cytokinins such as benzyl adenine had similar effects but a concentration of 500â€"1000â€‰ppm was required to increase berry size<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par5">Phenylpropanoids are a large class of plant secondary metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine in most plants or tyrosine in some monocots. The main branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway include lignans and lignins, stilbenes, coumarins, isoflavonoids, flavonoids, and PAs<sup><a href="#CR20">20</a></sup>. The biosynthesis of PAs, anthocyanins, and flavonols share common steps in the flavonoid pathway<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. In grape berries, the first committed steps in PA biosynthesis are catalyzed by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) by converting anthocyanidins to flavan-3-ols such as (+)-catechin (C) and (âˆ’)-epicatechin (EC), respectively. The resulting (âˆ’)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin derivatives can be oxidized to quinones, which are polymerized. However, it is not clear whether this polymerization of the soluble precursors proceeds enzymatically by laccases or non-enzymatically<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a></sup>. The subunits of PA are derived from 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ols (i.e., (âˆ’)-epicatechin and (âˆ’)-epigallocatechin (EGC), as well as from 2,3-<i>trans</i>-flavan-3-ols (i.e., (+)-catechin and (+)-gallocatechin) and are most commonly linked via 4 Î²â€‰â†’â€‰8Câˆ’C bonds<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a></sup>. The PAs are oligomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols that can range in size from 2 to 30 or more subunits. The regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway was studied extensively in grapes with respect to anthocyanins, PAs, and other branches of the pathway with emphasis on the role of R2R3-MYB, bHLH, and WD40 transcription factors and their target genes<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a>,<a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par6">Our previous study demonstrated that CPPU causes a marked increase in tannin content of Thompson Seedless<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. Thompson Seedless is a major variety but it does not produce anthocyanins and is very low in volatile content. In the current study we presented the following questions: (1) how do CPPU and GA affect tannin accumulation in a variety that is rich in anthocyanins and volatile compounds; and (2) how are biological processes at ripening affected by the treatments. These questions were addressed at the phenological level, by the analysis of relevant metabolites from the phenylpropanoid pathway, by volatile composition, and by transcriptome analysis.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Sugrasixteen (SABLE SEEDLESS<sup>Â®</sup>) (Sun World, Bakersfield, CA) that will be referred as â€˜Sableâ€™. Vines of â€˜Sableâ€™ were grafted on Richter rootstock that was 7 year old and grown in Israel in the Lachish area (lat. 31Â°33â€², long. 34Â°51â€²). All viticulture practices were performed as describe previously<sup><a href="#CR23">23</a></sup>. The experimental plot comprised of four replications of three vines each, arranged in a randomized block design. Clusters were manually sprayed to full wetness with the growth regulators gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>, ProGibb 40, Valent BioScience, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) and forchlorfenuron (CPPU, a synthetic cytokinin, SKW, Wittenberg, Germany) in a concentration of 20 and 5â€‰ppm, respectively, with 0.025% Triton-X100 (Adama Agan, Ashdod, Israel) as a wetting agent. A combination of GA and CPPU (hereafter GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU) was also sprayed on the berry at the same concentrations. â€˜Sableâ€™ was treated on 14 May 2018 at the berry diameter of 6.0â€‰Â±â€‰0.08â€‰mm (E-L stage of 31)<sup><a href="#CR24">24</a></sup>. Phenological data for â€˜Sableâ€™ was collected at the time of treatment (i.e., day 0), and 7, 34, 51, and 70 days (d) post treatment (34, 51, and 70â€‰d corresponding to stages 35, 36â€"37, and 38 of the modified E-L scale, respectively). Sampling for metabolites, volatiles, and gene expression was carried out at 51 and 70â€‰d after treatment, the time points which represent the beginning and end of commercial harvest. Sampling at all time-points was of 90 berries pooled from 20 to 30 clusters randomly collected from the four vineyard replications. For metabolite and RNA-seq analysis, a disk of 14â€"16â€‰mm was removed along the longitudinal axis of each berry and was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The berry disks were homogenized in three replicates of 30 disks each using an IKA homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany) with liquid nitrogen and were stored at âˆ’80â€‰Â°C for further analysis. The remaining part of the berries was used for measurement of total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acidity (TA).</p> </div> <div class="measurementoftotalsolublesolids,titratableacidity,andtasting" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Effect of early GA and CPPU treatment on â€˜Sableâ€™ berry properties along development</div> <p id="Par16">Gibberellin and cytokinin applied at fruit-set are known to increase berry size, but due to the complexity of agricultural systems, the intensity of the response can vary among seasons. The PGR treatments were performed at a fruitlet size of 6.0â€‰Â±â€‰0.08â€‰mm on â€˜Sable Seedlessâ€™. Fruitlet diameter and weight increased significantly by application of both GA and CPPU measured 7â€‰d after treatment (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a, c</a>). Interestingly, at 34â€‰d post treatment, berry diameter and weight of CPPU-treated berries was smaller than the control but this trend was reversed at later time points. At 51 and 70â€‰d after the treatments, CPPU increased berry weight and diameter significantly with respect to the control and the GA treatment. The GA treatment increased berry size by 17.5% and 13.4% at 51 and 70â€‰d, respectively, but at a later time point, the difference was not statistically significant from the control. The diameter and weight of berries treated with the combined treatment of GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU was higher than that of CPPU alone at both 51 and 70â€‰d. Brix of the control grapes was higher at all time-points followed by GA and CPPU (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a>). At 34â€‰d, berries treated with GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU had higher Brix as compared to CPPU-treated berries, but at later time points there were no differences among the two treatments. CPPU had a major effect on TA that was much higher than the other treatments at 34â€‰d after treatment (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1d</a>). At both 34 and 51â€‰d, GA seemed to mitigate the effect of CPPU on TA. With respect to appearance of the berries 34â€‰d after the treatment, there was a clear delay in color development by CPPU and the treatment of GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1e</a>). Transverse sections of the berries showed that the epidermal layer was thicker either in both GA- and CPPU-treated berries or the combined treatment as compared to the untreated control (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1f, g</a>). Informal tasting done by experts indicated excellent taste rated as 8 with multiple aromatic notes for the control and GA treatments, while in berries from the CPPU treatment there was some astringency that reduced the score to 7.5 or 7.0 for the combined treatment. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

CPPU but not GA treatments alter the levels of flavonoid compounds</div> <p id="Par17">The cytokinin CPPU was shown to increase total tannins in Thompson Seedless that bears green berries<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. It was therefore of interest to determine what effect CPPU has on black berries and if GA has similar effects.

CPPU and GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU treatments reduced the levels of the majority of these compounds at both 51 and 70â€‰d as compared to the control. Quantitatively, CPPU reduced the levels of the anthocyanin glucosides by ca. 50% at both time points. The GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU treatment reduced the levels of the anthocyanin glucosides to ca. 75% and 53% at 51 and 70â€‰d, respectively, as compared to the control. At 51â€‰d post treatment, GA reduced the inhibitory effect of CPPU but this effect was not maintained at 70â€‰d (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Anthocyanin glucosides are the major form present in â€˜Sableâ€™ comprising 63â€"71% of the total anthocyanins and the remaining are acetylated and coumaroylated forms (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). Interestingly, CPPU reduced the proportion of the glucoside forms at both 51 and 70â€‰d and this decrease was accompanied by an increase in coumaroyl glucosides at both time points and acetylated glucosides at 70â€‰d. GA had an intermediate effect on the proportion of the anthocyanin forms. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span></a></div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

CPPU increases PA levels but shortens the polymer length in berries</div> <p id="Par20">To further investigate the effect of GA, CPPU, and GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU on PA composition, phloroglucinolysis was performed and differences were monitored using HPLC (Figs. <a href="#Fig2">2dâ€"f</a>, <a href="#MOESM1">S1</a>, and Table <a href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Phloroglucinolysis hydrolyzes the polymeric PAs generating terminal units (C, EC, and ECG (epicatechin gallate)) and extension units with phloroglucinol adduct (labeled by â€"P). CPPU increased the levels of C, EC, EC-P, and EGC-P. GA did not affect the levels of the PA monomers while the treatment with GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU reduced the levels of C, ECG, EC-P, and EGC-P only at 70â€‰d after the treatments (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Monomeric PAs did not change with ripening with the exception of ECG that was lower at 70â€‰d compared to the control treatment. The total PA level clearly shows the effect of CPPU and also shows that the combined treatment reduced the level of PAs at 70â€‰d in agreement with the data on the free monomers (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2c</a>). The treatments with GA or CPPU had minor effects on the % galloyl units but the combined treatment reduced their level.

Volatile compounds affected by the growth regulator treatments</div> <p id="Par21">To evaluate the effect of GA, CPPU, and GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU treatment at berry set on the volatiles composition, berries of â€˜Sableâ€™ were sampled 51 and 70â€‰d after the treatments. GC-MS analysis allowed identification of 58 (51â€‰d) and 67 (70â€‰d) volatile compounds with quantitative data calculated relative to the internal standard (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Analysis of the differences in volatile content by ANOVA showed that 62 of the 68 compounds present at both time points differed in content by treatments or time (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). PCA indicated strong separation of the volatile compounds according to the harvest time with PC1 at 49.6% (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3a</a>). PC2 contributed 26.5% of the total variance and reflected the effect of CPPU at 51â€‰d, but at 70â€‰d there was convergence of the variance and overall differences among the treatments seemed insignificant. VIP score analysis for the volatile compounds at 51â€‰d pointed to 15 compounds having significant scores (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3b</a>). CPPU suppressed the levels of the monoterpenes, Î±-terpineol, linalool, and limonene, as well as the carotenoid derivative, Î²-cyclocitral and the fatty acid derivative, hexanal. However, GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU increased the levels of these compounds. The levels of 2-hexenal (Z) and pentanal were higher in CPPU-treated berries while GA increased the level of methyl geranate. At 70â€‰d, CPPU increased and GA or GAâ€‰+â€‰CPPU decreased the levels of decanal and 5 other compounds (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3c</a>).

CPPU but not GA had long-term effects on gene expression in berries</div> <p id="Par22">PGRs may have multiple immediate effects on gene expression, but, in this study, we were interested in understanding the long-term effects of GA and CPPU on the berries at harvest. To this end, RNA-seq was carried out on â€˜Sableâ€™ berries at 51 and 70â€‰d after the treatments, the time points that can be defined as early and late ripening with respect to the untreated control. A total of 3801 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all treatments were identified (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S5</a>). Venn diagram analysis of control vs. GA showed that there were hardly any differences between the control and GA treatments either at the early or late ripening, but there were significant differences in gene expression among the ripening stages (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4a</a>). In contrast, the CPPU treatment imposed significant differences on gene expression at either the early or late stages of ripening (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4b</a>). Six main clusters representing gene expression patterns were identified (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4c</a>). KEGG pathway enrichment showed that only cluster 3 and cluster 4 contained significantly enriched pathways (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). Six out of the 13 processes related to cluster 3 were assigned to the phenylpropanoid pathway. The first process registered for cluster 3 was â€˜circadian rhythmsâ€™ but analysis of the relevant KEGG map suggested that all the 20 enriched genes in this bin were actually family members of <i>chalcone synthase</i> (<i>CHS</i>) which is a central flavonoid pathway. The â€˜ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesisâ€™ bin included <i>4CL</i>, <i>trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase</i>, and <i>isochorismate synthase</i>. Other bins of cluster 3, excluding the large unspecific bins of â€˜Biosynthesis of secondary metabolitesâ€™ and â€˜Metabolic pathwaysâ€™, will be discussed later. Cluster 4 contained 2 out of 5 bins assigned to â€˜photosynthesisâ€™ or â€˜photosynthesis â€" antenna proteinsâ€™. The genes in these bins belonged to photosystem I, photosystem II, cytochrome b6/F complex, and LHC1 and LHC2 complexes. In the â€˜Steroid biosynthesisâ€™ bin, genes included <i>squalene synthase</i>, <i>squalene monoxygenase, a</i>nd other sterol biosynthesis genes upstream of brassinosteroid biosynthesis. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 4</span></a></div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Comparison of the effects of CPPU on gene expression at similar Brix</div> <p id="Par23">Because GA did not contribute a significant number of genes to the DEG pool, it was eliminated from further analysis. There were major differences in ripening between the untreated grapes and grapes treated with CPPU, and this was also expressed in the number of DEGs at both early and late sampling. At the early and late sampling, there were 697 and 382 DEGs between the untreated and the CPPU-treated berries, respectively, and the reduction in the number of DEGs was mainly in the late sampling for genes with lower expression following CPPU treatment (Tables <a href="#MOESM1">S6</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). KEGG analysis of these two groups did not show any functional bin enrichment. In a separate analysis, the treatments were compared on the basis of similar Brix; this comparison was possible because the untreated berries reached a Brix of 19.8 at 51â€‰d while the CPPU-treated berries reached Brix of 19.6 at 70â€‰d. Comparing these two groups resulted in 313 and 589 DEGs with higher and lower expression from the untreated and CPPU-treated berries, respectively (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S8</a>). KEGG analysis demonstrated that in this â€˜similar Brixâ€™ group there was enrichment of 11 functional bins similar to those already present in cluster 3 (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).</p> <p id="Par24">A subset of 42 genes showed significant differences in three combinations: (1) Control vs. CPPU at 51â€‰d; (2) Control vs. CPPU at 70â€‰d; (3) Control at 51â€‰d vs. CPPU at 70â€‰d (similar Brix) (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Interestingly, very few DEGs had higher expression in the untreated berries at sampling of 51 and 70â€‰d. These genes were a <i>germin-like protein</i>, basic <i>7</i>â€‰<i>S globulin</i> (similar to <i>xylanase inhibitor</i> in Arabidopsis), protein P21 (similar to osmotin-like protein in Arabidopsis), <i>polyol transporter 5</i> (similar to SIMPT4 in tomato expressed in late stages of fruit development), <i>oleosin 1</i>, and <i>DMR6-like oxygenase 2</i> that functions in response to pathogens. The DEGs that had higher expression in response to CPPU could be assigned mainly to cell wall-related and stress-related functions. The cell wall-related DEGs included, in part, <i>expansins</i>, <i>pectinesterase</i>, <i>pectate lyases</i>, and <i>NST1</i> that is considered a regulator of secondary cell wall biosynthesis<sup><a href="#CR29">29</a></sup>. The stress-related DEGs included the chaperone <i>dnaJ 11</i>, <i>Nodulin-related protein 1</i>, a <i>metallothionein-like protein</i>, and the hypoxia-associated genes <i>LOB domain-containing protein 41</i> and a <i>2-nonaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol hydroxylase</i>.</p> <p id="Par25">The phenylpropanoid-related KEGG bins included <i>PAL</i>, <i>trans-cinnamate 4monooxygenase</i>, <i>4CL</i>, <i>caffeic acid O-methyltransferase</i>, and <i>cationic peroxidase</i> 1. The flavonoid bin included <i>chalcone synthase</i> (CHS) and the stilbenoid bin included <i>stilbene synthases</i> (STSs). The expression pattern of 56 DEGs related to the phenylpropanoid pathway that are significantly different among early control and late CPPU treatments (similar Brix group) is displayed in Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a</a>. Interestingly, among the regulatory MYB genes â€˜<i>MYB14, MYB15</i>, and <i>MYBA3</i>â€™ had lower expression following CPPU treatment, while three MYB genes â€˜<i>MYB136, MYB137</i>, and <i>MYB139</i>â€™ had higher expression in CPPU-treated at similar sugar levels. Of the WRKY family, 2 genes (<i>WRKY22</i> and <i>WRKY49</i>) had higher expression while 5 genes (<i>WRKY05, WRKY24, WRKY40, WRKY43</i>, and <i>WRKY51</i>) had lower expression in CPPU-treated berries (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S8</a>). Of the structural genes <i>PAL</i>, <i>C4H</i>, <i>4CL</i>, <i>CHS</i>, <i>UFGT</i>, and remarkably, 28 STS genes, had lower expression in CPPU-treated berries (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a</a>).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par27">Gibberellin has been used to enlarge seedless grape berries for many years<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. Some cultivars are very sensitive to the treatment while others have a modest response<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a></sup>. Sable Seedless can be assigned to the category of â€˜modest response to GAâ€™, with a significant effect on size at early sampling that is reduced at late harvest. The transcriptomic data for both 51 and 70â€‰d after the treatment, corresponding to early and late commercial harvest, suggest that GA did not have long-term effects on biological processes and this was also confirmed in the profile of phenylpropanoid metabolites. However, GA did delay maturity as expressed by lower TSS and TA (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b, d</a>), and also had an effect on volatile compounds (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). In addition, when combined with CPPU, GA had some additive effects on fruit weight but it mitigated the response to CPPU with respect to acidity and reduction in some phenylpropanoid metabolites (Figs. <a href="#Fig1">1d</a> and <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). It is likely that higher doses of GA than the concentration used in this study (20â€‰mgâ€‰L<sup>âˆ’1</sup>), but still considered in the range of commercial practice for this cultivar, or multiple applications, would further increase the size and delay the ripening as previously reported in many studies<sup><a href="#CR30">30</a></sup>. Our data and the literature support the notion that GA can trigger quantitative effects on berry size, but does not have a major impact on ripening processes under standard practice.</p> <p id="Par28">In contrast to GA, CPPU affected a wide range of phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular responses. Since the introduction of CPPU, there have been a number of studies in grapes reporting beneficial effects on fruit size, and delays in maturity, abscission, rachis browning, decay, cuticle formation, volatile profile and gene expression<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a>,<a href="#CR15">15</a>â€"<a href="#CR18">18</a>,<a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. Our study on the colorless cultivar â€˜Thompson Seedlessâ€™ pointed to the effect of CPPU on total tannin content resulting in higher astringency<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. It was therefore of interest to study how the interplay between the anthocyanin branch and the PA branch of the pathway is manifested in colored cultivars. Our data clearly shows that synthesis of PA is at the expense of anthocyanins with no particular effects on the type of anthocyanins produced (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2a</a> and Table <a href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). The fact that the level of flavonols was also reduced points to the possibility that either PA synthesis was induced by CPPU or that there was multiple repression of both the flavonol and anthocyanidin branches by genes such as <i>MybA1</i> and <i>MybF1</i><sup><a href="#CR32">32</a></sup>. One interesting trend was the increase of (âˆ’)-epicatechin during late ripening, both in the control and CPPU-treated berries (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2c</a>), in contrast to previous results showing that flavan-3-ols in the skins peak at 2â€"3 weeks after veraison<sup><a href="#CR33">33</a></sup>. This increase can result from degradation of PAs, but there was no evidence for this in the total PA levels and the only PA monomer that decreased in content during ripening was ECG (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Both flavan-3-ols, (+)-catechin and (âˆ’)-epicatechin, had higher concentration in CPPU-treated grapes and, thus, it can be hypothesized that there was a concomitant induction of their biosynthetic genes, <i>LAR</i> and <i>ANR</i> by TFs such as <i>MybPA1</i> and <i>MybPA2</i><sup><a href="#CR34">34</a>,<a href="#CR35">35</a></sup>. CPPU did not affect the expression level of <i>VvMybPA1</i> at 51â€‰d but the level of this gene was reduced at 70â€‰d post treatment (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). It is not known if the gene was actually induced by CPPU before veraison. It should however be noted that PAs are synthesized prior to veraison while anthocyanins are synthesized during or after veraison, bringing up the possibility that the decrease in anthocyanins may be due to deficiency in substrates in the berry rather than repression of the rate-limiting genes. In previous studies, cytokinins were shown to promote anthocyanin synthesis in shoots and leaves of <i>Arabidopsis</i> with concomitant transcriptional activation of the pathway<sup><a href="#CR36">36</a></sup>. Likewise, introduction of a bacterial <i>ipt</i> gene to tobacco leaves increased the level of phenolic compounds<sup><a href="#CR37">37</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par29">The inherent discrepancy of comparing gene expression by treatments that delay maturity was partially compensated by comparing differential expression of phenylpropanoid-related genes at similar Brix, i.e., control at 51â€‰d and CPPU at 70â€‰d after treatment (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4d</a>). There is a remarkable reduced expression of 28 STSs in CPPU-treated berries (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a</a>). The STS multigene family in grapes includes 48 annotated genes<sup><a href="#CR38">38</a></sup>. Expression maps of STS genes suggest induction of gene expression by multiple biotic stresses including ethylene and jasmonate, while abiotic stresses had both suppressive and inductive effects<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a></sup>. Therefore, according to our data cytokinin may contribute to long-term inhibition of Vv<i>STS</i> expression. Of the upstream genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, 6 DEGs corresponded to <i>PAL</i> pointing to a trend of overall reduction in the pathway during ripening. Other genes included <i>C4H, 4CL</i>, <i>CHS</i>, <i>UFGT</i> (2 DEGs each), and 9 other structural genes of the pathway. Of the related transcription factors, <i>MYB14</i> and <i>MYB15</i> are considered as activators of <i>STS</i> gene expression<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a>,<a href="#CR40">40</a></sup> and their low level is in agreement with the low expression of the <i>STS</i> genes. The expression of <i>MYB14</i> and <i>MYB15</i> was shown to increase with ripening in Pinot Noir grapes<sup><a href="#CR41">41</a></sup>, and therefore delay in ripening mediated by CPPU may reduce their expression. <i>MybA3</i> was shown to be a truncated non-functional protein<sup><a href="#CR42">42</a></sup>. <i>MYB136, MYB137</i>, and <i>MYB139</i> showed high expression in CPPU-treated berries, and it will be interesting to find out if they are targets for cytokinin signaling in plants and bona fide regulators of Vv<i>STS</i> genes. Of the WRKY genes, <i>WRKY24</i> and <i>WRKY43</i> are reported to be co-expressed with STS and MYB genes<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a></sup>. For example, <i>MYB14</i> and <i>MYB15</i> were co-expressed with <i>STS21, STS29, STS41</i>, and <i>STS48</i> in agreement with our data (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5a</a>). Like <i>MYB14</i> and <i>MYB15, WRKY24</i> alone was shown to interact directly with the promoter of <i>STS29</i>.</p> <p id="Par30">A previous study on the effect of CPPU in â€˜Shine Muscatâ€™ grapes focused on transcriptome changes 60â€‰d after the treatment and volatile profile changes 80â€‰d after the treatment (i.e., when the berries reached very high maturity)<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. Similar to the previous report, our data showed that some genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, e.g., <i>PAL</i>, <i>4CL</i>, and <i>UFGT</i> had lower expression following CPPU treatment as well as fatty acid biosynthesis genes, amino acid biosynthesis, and volatile-related processes. Higher expression was observed for carotenoid-related genes, fatty acid metabolism genes, and auxin-related genes. In hormonal signaling, Wang et al.<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a></sup> identified three accessions for <i>TIFY 5A</i>, two of which had higher expression at CPPU application level of 5â€‰mgâ€‰L<sup>âˆ’1</sup> but with reduced expression at a level of 10â€‰mgâ€‰L<sup>âˆ’1</sup> CPPU. This is consistent with our study where one of the <i>TIFY 5A</i> had increased expression at both 51 and 70â€‰d (Tables <a href="#MOESM1">S6</a> and <a href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). Another set of affected hormone-signaling genes in our study was that of the cytokinin receptor genes, of which <i>ARR-5</i> was repressed by CPPU at the late stage (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). In contrast, in â€˜Shine Muscatâ€™ these genes were induced by CPPU. With respect to the volatile profile, similar reduction in terpenoids was encountered following CPPU treatment with respect to our sampling at 51â€‰d (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Several volatile compounds that were reduced after CPPU treatment in our study are consistent with reductions reported in Shine Muscat by Wang et al.<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>, i.e., Î±-terpineol, linalool, 2-hexenal (E) at 51â€‰d post treatment and <i>cis</i> geraniol at 70â€‰d post treatment. Wang et al.<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a></sup> also reported an increase in hexanol in â€˜Shine Muscatâ€™ following CPPU treatment but this was not the case for â€˜Sableâ€™ in our study (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Instead, we observed that CPPU increased other fatty acid derivatives such as decanal, 2-pentenal (E) and 2-hexen-1-ol at 70â€‰d (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Another important effect of CPPU in our study was the reduction in sesquiterpenes at 51â€‰d (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). However, the significance of this reduction is unclear given the fact that CPPU had no effect on the level of sesquiterpenes at 70â€‰d. The fact that GA increased the levels of rose oxide, Î±-terpineol, and methyl geranate can strengthen the fruity flavor of the berries<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par31">Given the large number of genes affected by CPPU, it was of interest to further look at a subset of genes that were consistently affected by the treatment at both 51 and 70â€‰d after treatment and in the â€˜similar Brixâ€™ group (51â€‰d control and 70â€‰d CPPU). Two main processes were observed: increases in stress-related DEGs with hypoxia as a potential driver and increases in cell wall-related processes potentially associated with cell expansion (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4d</a>). While there are no physiological studies to support it in our data, hypoxia has previously been associated with ripening and cell death in grape berries<sup><a href="#CR43">43</a></sup> and it can be hypothesized that induction of stress/hypoxia-related genes by CPPU can therefore delay ripening. Mitigation of oxidative stress was attributed to cytokinin by proteins such as glutaredoxin (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4d</a>)<sup><a href="#CR44">44</a></sup>. With respect to cell wall-related genes, induction of <i>expansins</i> was described as a hallmark of response to cytokinin<sup><a href="#CR44">44</a></sup> in addition to <i>laccases</i> and pectin-modifying genes (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4d</a>).</p> <p id="Par32">There are multiple interactions among plant hormones and changes during ripening. When compared on the basis of similar Brix among the control and the CPPU treatment, it appears that there is repression of several key genes related to hormone signaling (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). For example, <i>AUX/IAA</i> genes are inhibitors of auxin signaling that is known to delay ripening<sup><a href="#CR45">45</a></sup> while <i>GID2</i> inhibits <i>DELLA</i> activity and allows response to gibberellins<sup><a href="#CR46">46</a></sup>. Other genes with reduced expression upon CPPU treatment were a <i>BRI1</i>-associated kinase that controls brassinosteroids signaling and <i>JAZ</i> that is a negative regulator of JA signaling<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. Understanding the complex interaction between external hormone treatment and internal hormone signaling modules requires integration of knowledge from model systems with well-defined genetic resources and physiological data from crop plants.</p> <p id="Par33">At the scientific level, this study provides strong evidence for the induction of PA biosynthesis by cytokinin and to its effects on delay of ripening. On the other hand, GA is shown to influence berry size but it does not seem to have a major impact on metabolic and molecular processes including PA biosynthesis. At the practical level, information from this study can be used by growers to better understand how applications of PGRs can modulate berry size, taste, flavor, and color.</p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
