    "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative disease for which an effective disease-modifying therapy is not available. Natural compounds derived from plants have been traditionally used in the clinic to treat OA. Over the years, many studies have explored the treatment of OA using natural extracts. Although various active natural extracts with broad application prospects have been discovered, single compounds are more important for clinical trials than total natural extracts. Moreover, although natural extracts exhibit minimal safety issues, the cytotoxicity and function of all single compounds in a total extract remain unclear. Therefore, understanding single compounds with the ability to inhibit catabolic factor expression is essential for developing therapeutic agents for OA. This review describes effective single compounds recently obtained from natural extracts and the possibility of developing therapeutic agents against OA using these compounds."
