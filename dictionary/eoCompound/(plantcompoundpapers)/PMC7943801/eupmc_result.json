    "Native Bacillus sp. strain D5 coded as (Bar D5) has been isolated from the saffron corm that showed plant growth promotion (PGP) properties and also inhibits the growth of corm rot causing Fusarium oxysporum R1 (Fox R1) in-vitro. Bar D5 was more efficient PGP bacterium in comparison to earlier reported native bio-formulations by our group. Pot assays and field evaluation of Bar D5 confirmed its in-vivo efficacy for PGP traits and biocontrol activity as well. Pot trials were followed by field trials at traditional (Kishtwar) and non-traditional (R.S Pura) saffron cultivation areas in Jammu and Kashmir. At both places, Bar D5 bio-formulation treatment led to the increase in root number & length, shoot number & length, flower number and number & weight of daughter corms. Additionally, it also decreased the corm rot disease incidence significantly. Priming of corms with bio-formulation resulted in the reduction of pathogenic fungal load by threeÂ fold at the depth of corm sowing from ground level. The shelf life/viability of Bar D5 based bio-formulation was found to be 52% (viable spores) for one year at room temperature. Draft genome sequence of Bar D5 revealed the presence of genes necessary for PGP and biocontrol activity. Further, confirmation of gene sequences and annotation was done by amplification, re-sequencing and mapping of PGP and biocontrol genes on draft genome. Bar D5 based bio-formulation can be provided to companies/researchers interested in saffron cultivation or bio-formulation production for commercial exploitation, since saffron is grown as revenue crop across continents. The present study bridges the gap between genomics and its field application."
