    "Microbial degradation as a treatment, with the combination of mixed inoculants of the Biofertilizer of <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp.<i>, Azo</i>spi<i>rillium</i> sp. and <i>Rhizobium</i> sp.<i>,</i> was employed for the remediation of Silk dyeing effluent. Remediating studies was undertaken to assess the feasibility of the mixed biofertilizer inoculant source for degradation of the Azodye effluent from the Silk dyeing Industry. The Green leafy vegetable (GLV), <i>Amaranthus tristis Linn</i> used as investigational prototypical plant species is selected for examining the phytochemicals, functional groups and its compounds grown in the effluent and biotreated environment and compared. The laboratory scale investigation showed that leaves, stem and root of the <i>Amaranthus tristis Linn</i> was qualitatively analysed for 20 phytochemicals which was grown in the different treatments of raw effluent and the biotreated effluent and the results showed the phytochemicals on the effluent's influence reduced from strong positive to trace amounts while recovered on the biotreated environment. The FTIR analysis of the GLV grown in effluent and biotreated environments on comparison resulted in the functional group Alkene rescued in the biotreated effluent environment compared to the effluent contaminated area. The HPLC analysis of methanolic extracts of <i>A. tristis</i> grown in fresh water has 6 peaks of retention time of 2.6, 3, 3.9, 4, 4.2, and 4.6 RT whereas GLV effluent had only one peak of retention time of 4.1 RT. In the GLV from biotreated environment have 4 peaks were found with the maximum percentage area of 95.2% which proves that the compounds are rescued in the biotreated environment and few active compounds were confirmed in GCMS analysis. The Soil analysis results also indicate that the biotreatment of mixed inoculant of biofertilizers in the biotreated soil had influence resulting in improved levels of Ca, N, P and K with 114, 213, 10.5, 268 kg/ha respectively in the mixed inoculant biotreated soil. Similarly the micronutrients suchas Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn ranges to 4.1, 20.22, 2.13, 1.13 ppm respectively in the mixed inoculant biotreated soil within the optimal range. The study revealed that mixed biofertilizer inoculant has the recovery effect on the Silk dyeing (Azodyes) effluents effective reducing the pollutant capacity thereby meeting the discharged standards."
