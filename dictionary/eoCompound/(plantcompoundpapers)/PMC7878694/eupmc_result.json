    "Candida infections and related mortality have become a challenge to global health. Nontoxic and natural bioactive compounds from plants are regarded as promising candidates to inhibit these multidrug resistant strains. In the present study, <i>in vitro</i> assays and <i>in silico</i> molecular docking approach was combined to evaluate the inhibitory effect of crude extracts from <i>Allium ampeloprasum</i> and its variety <i>A. porrum</i> on Candida pathogens. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids in higher quantity. Spectral studies of the extracts support the presence of phenols, flavonoids and organosulfur compounds. Aqueous extract of <i>A. ampeloprasum</i> showed a total antioxidant capacity of 68 ± 1.7 mg AAE/ g and an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.88 ± 2.1 mg/ml was obtained for DPPH radicals scavenging assay. <i>C. albicans</i> were highly susceptible (19.9 ± 1.1 mm) when treated with aqueous <i>A. ampeloprasum</i> extract. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were within the range of 19-40 μg/ml and the results were significant (p ≤ 0.05). <i>In silico</i> molecular docking studies demonstrated that bioactive phytocompounds of <i>A. ampeloprasum</i> and <i>A. porrum</i> efficiently interacted with the active site of Secreted aspartyl proteinase 2 enzyme that is responsible for the virulence of pathogenic yeasts. Rosmarinic acid and Myricetin exhibited low binding energies and higher number of hydrogen bond interactions with the protein target. Thus the study concludes that <i>A. ampeloprasum</i> and <i>A. porrum</i> that remain as underutilized vegetables in the <i>Allium</i> genus are potential anti-candida agents and their pharmacologically active compounds must be considered as competent candidates for drug discovery."
