    "<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i> (<i>Psa</i>), a bacterial pathogen, causes bacterial canker disease in kiwifruit. To elucidate the local and systemic influences of <i>Psa</i> infection on kiwifruit, comprehensive analyses were conducted by combining metabolomic and physiological approach under <i>Psa</i>-infected treatment and mock-inoculated control in leaves, stems, and bleeding saps. Our results show that <i>Psa</i> infection stimulated kiwifruit metabolic reprogramming. Levels of many sugars, fumarate, and malic acid were decreased in <i>Psa</i>-infected leaves and stems, accompanied by the increased level of amino acids (AAs), which implies the anaplerotic reaction to replenish the TCA cycle generating energy and intermediates for defense-related metabolic pathways, such as phenylpropanoid metabolism. The inconsistent results were observed in bleeding saps, which may be attributed to the induced phloem transport of carbon (C) out of leaves and such a transport benefits bacterium movement. Arg, Gln, and pyroglutamic acid systematically were accumulated in long-distance leaves, which probably confers to systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and <i>Psa</i> inoculation accelerated the nitrogen (N) cycling in kiwifruit. Moreover, <i>Psa</i> infection specifically affected the content of phenolic compounds and lignin. Phenolic compounds were negatively and lignin was positively related to kiwifruit <i>Psa</i> resistance, respectively. Our results first reveal that <i>Psa</i> enhances infection by manipulating C/N metabolism and sweet immunity, and that host lignin synthesis is a major physical barrier for restricting bacterial infection. This study provides an insight into the complex remodeling of plant metabolic response to <i>Psa</i> stress."
