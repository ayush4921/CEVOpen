    "Resistant cultivars have played important roles in controlling Fusarium wilt disease, but the roles of rhizosphere interactions among different levels of resistant cultivars are still unknown. Here, two phenotypes of cucumber, one resistant and one with increased susceptibility to <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f.sp. <i>cucumerinum</i> (Foc), were grown in the soil and hydroponically, and then 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nontargeted metabolomics techniques were used to investigate rhizosphere microflora and root exudate profiles. Relatively high microbial community evenness for the Foc-susceptible cultivar was detected, and the relative abundances of <i>Comamonadaceae</i> and <i>Xanthomonadaceae</i> were higher for the Foc-susceptible cultivar than for the other cultivar. FishTaco analysis revealed that specific functional traits, such as protein synthesis and secretion, bacterial chemotaxis, and small organic acid metabolism pathways, were significantly upregulated in the rhizobacterial community of the Foc-susceptible cultivar. A machine-learning approach in conjunction with FishTaco plus metabolic pathway analysis revealed that four organic acids (citric acid, pyruvate acid, succinic acid, and fumarate) were released at higher abundance by the Foc-susceptible cultivar compared with the resistant cultivar, which may be responsible for the recruitment of <i>Comamonadaceae</i>, a potential beneficial microbial group. Further validation demonstrated that <i>Comamonadaceae</i> can be \"cultured\" by these organic acids. Together, compared with the resistant cultivar, the susceptible cucumber tends to assemble beneficial microbes by secreting more organic acids."
