Here, two phenotypes of cucumber, one resistant and one with increased susceptibility to <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>cucumerinum</italic> (Foc), were grown in the soil and hydroponically, and then 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nontargeted metabolomics techniques were used to investigate rhizosphere microflora and root exudate profiles. Relatively high microbial community evenness for the Foc-susceptible cultivar was detected, and the relative abundances of <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> and <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic> were higher for the Foc-susceptible cultivar than for the other cultivar. FishTaco analysis revealed that specific functional traits, such as protein synthesis and secretion, bacterial chemotaxis, and small organic acid metabolism pathways, were significantly upregulated in the rhizobacterial community of the Foc-susceptible cultivar. A machine-learning approach in conjunction with FishTaco plus metabolic pathway analysis revealed that four organic acids (citric acid, pyruvate acid, succinic acid, and fumarate) were released at higher abundance by the Foc-susceptible cultivar compared with the resistant cultivar, which may be responsible for the recruitment of <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic>, a potential beneficial microbial group. Further validation demonstrated that <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> can be &#x0201c;cultured&#x0201d; by these organic acids.

For a long time, breeders have been developing many resistant varieties that generally express high levels of disease resistance genes and/or produce active proteins to defend against the <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> fungal pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In recent years, increasing numbers of studies have shown that certain beneficial microorganisms can be recruited by plants in their rhizosphere to resist the invasion of pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For example, Berendsen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> indicated that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> could recruit three bacterial species in the rhizosphere upon foliar pathogen infection; Kwak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> found that the tomato variety Hawaii 7996 could recruit members of the <italic>flavobacterium</italic> strain TRM1 to suppress disease. Natural disease-suppressive soils even formed via increases in the abundance of beneficial microorganisms (e.g., <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Bacillus</italic>) by monoculture during a long period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These beneficial microorganisms can produce secondary metabolites such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol to antagonize pathogens, thus improving the disease-suppressive ability of the soil. Other studies have shown that root exudates such as citric acid, malic acid and fumaric acid could recruit beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, it was recently shown that specialized triterpenes from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> could recruit and maintain an <italic>A. thaliana</italic>-specific microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Plant breeders have begun to consider the contribution of rhizosphere microbes in the development of resistant varieties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, including the regulation of the output of root exudates by controlling ABC transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and attempt to transfer microorganisms to the next generation by implanting microbes into flowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Since the interactions occurring in the rhizosphere between plants and microorganisms are relatively complex and variable, breeding work that encompasses the rhizosphere microbiome is progressing slowly.</p><p id="Par4">Due to the different root secretion patterns even within the same crop, the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community is variable. Interestingly, crops sensitive to pathogens tend to form disease-suppressive soils more easily than do resistant varieties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Further studies indicated that traditional susceptible cultivars tend to maintain stronger interactions between plant and beneficial soil microorganisms compared to those of modern resistant varieties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Karasov et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> found that the diversity of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in wild <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves was abundant. Recently, a study of domesticated plants seemed to reveal a relatively limited microbiota assembly compared to that of their wild counterparts. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of crop microbiota is likely reduced compared to that of wild plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Plant domestication probably alters root exudate profiles and thus impacts rhizosphere microbial community structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Whether rhizosphere microbial resistance can compensate for the weakness of plant resistance is relatively unknown. Moreover, which kinds of rhizospheric interactions occur during rhizosphere microbial resistance are unclear.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we grew two types of cucumber with contrasting phenotypes (resistant and highly susceptible to Fusarium wilt disease) in the soil and hydroponically to provide controlled and in situ experimental data on these cultivars&#x02019; exudates and their rhizobacterial communities.

Among the reported mechanisms, the evenness and richness of the rhizosphere microbiome are central players in providing stability and resilience to stress and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. High evenness was observed in the Foc-susceptible rhizosphere, which could be attributed to a relatively high variety of exudates supporting more microbial niches. If these niches are left nonstimulated/uninhabited in the Foc-resistant rhizosphere, this could provide a window for successful invasion by other pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study, the higher evenness found in the Foc-susceptible rhizosphere compared with the Foc-resistant rhizosphere may result from sufficient coevolution between the host plant and soil microbiome. In other words, the soil microbial metabolic capacity for the resources from FRC roots has not developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It has been shown that traditional cultivars tend to maintain relatively high evenness of rhizosphere microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and relatively strong interactions between plants and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. For instance, mycorrhizal associations have been shown to be increased in older wheat cultivars compared to modern landraces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Similarly, Germida et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> found that ancient landraces could recruit a more diverse rhizosphere bacterial community than could modern cultivars. We also found higher abundances of <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> and <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic> in the Foc-susceptible cultivar rhizosphere community than in the Foc-resistant one, both of whose members have been reported to be abundant in disease-suppressive soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic> genera falling within this family, such as <italic>Pseudoxanthomonas</italic>, <italic>Lysobacter</italic>, and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic>, have been used as biocontrol agents of several pathogens, including <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. It has been widely observed that fluorescent <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species produce the antifungal compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) to resist pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. All these beneficial genera were more abundant for the Foc-susceptible cultivar than for the Foc-resistant cultivar, and five strains of <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> (strains G11 and FM2), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (strains M8 and G2), and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> (strain G47) showed strong inhibitory effects on the growth of pathogens in vitro (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), which may contribute to the resistance of other pathogens and natural attenuation of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. Previous research has shown that crops sensitive to pathogens tend to form disease-suppressive soils more readily than do resistant varieties when under continuous pathogen attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>; this phenomenon was supported by our results, as more beneficial bacterial groups were recruited in the rhizosphere of the susceptible crop than in that of the resistant crop. However, some researchers have reported that, compared with susceptible varieties, resistant varieties can recruit more beneficial microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Recently, Mendes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> investigated the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community of common bean cultivars with different levels of resistance to the fungal pathogen <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and found that beneficial bacteria, such as <italic>Bacillaceae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic>, <italic>Solibacteraceae</italic>, and <italic>Cytophagaceae</italic>, were abundant in the rhizobacterial community of the FRC cultivar. On the other hand, our study showed that the FSC cultivar was more enriched in beneficial rhizosphere microbes. This is probably due to the different crops and cultivars used and the mechanism by which resistance breeding influences plant physiology. More work needs to be done with other crop species.</p><p id="Par16">Root exudates are important for regulating and controlling the composition and function of rhizosphere microorganisms. Previous research has shown that plant species, even different genotypes of the same species, may vary in terms of their rhizosphere microbiome composition and root exudates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In our experiment, the root exudate profiles varied between the FSC and FRC. Interestingly, four small-molecule organic acids (citric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, and pyruvic acid) were observed to be the main driving force for the separation of the two exudate patterns and were produced in higher quantities by the FSC compared with the FRC. These small-molecule organic acids reportedly impacted specific beneficial bacterial groups, such as crop growth-promoting rhizobacteria. For example, malic acid and citric acid could chemotactically attract <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> WCS365, which could competently colonize tomato roots. Infection of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> could induce root secretion of malic acid and thus promote colonization and biofilm formation on the root surface by strain FB17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Similarly, watermelon roots could secrete citric acid and malic acid to induce root colonization of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial strain <italic>Paenibacillus polymyxa</italic> SQR-21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In our experiment, the four small-molecule organic acids added to the soil enriched the relative abundance of <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic>, an important beneficial bacterial group, and <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> strain G43, whose sequence is the same as that of G11, showed a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Foc. These results showed that FSC enriched more beneficial bacteria by regulating root exudates.</p><p id="Par17">Indeed, plants employ complex defense strategies to protect themselves from infection by pathogens. Some physical structures and chemical components of plants show antidisease effects, such as cell wall keratin, wax deposition, lignin, special pores, water holes, and lenticels and induction of various pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, such as chitinase and glucanase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Additionally, defense responses are induced by plants; these responses mainly include the release of various reactive oxygen species, the expression of defense genes and the development of the hypersensitive response (HR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In recent years, a consensus has gradually been reached in which rhizosphere microorganisms help plants resist pathogens via the secretion of antimicrobial substances, forming biofilms, and via competition for space and nutrients by occupying pathogen niches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Direct and indirect (via microbial associations) plant pathogen defense strategies coexist. We divided the concept of plant responses to soil-borne pathogens into two aspects: (i) plant resistance, in which plants act as executors by improving physical structures and secreting various new chemical components; and (ii) rhizosphere resistance, in which rhizosphere microorganisms recruited by plants act as executors to confront pathogens by perceiving them, activating the plant immune system, and secreting various effective antimicrobial chemicals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In this study, two cucumber cultivars displaying different Fusarium wilt resistance were used to assess the level of these two different strategies. The fundamental data indicated that the FRC showed stronger disease resistance than did the FRC (&#x0003c;15% vs &#x0003e;60% of disease incidence), especially plant resistance (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>), while stronger rhizosphere resistance was found in the FSC than the FRC. In recent years, breeders have been focusing on the role of microorganisms in plant disease resistance. Owing to the complexity of microbial community-plant interactions and uncertain influences of root exudates on rhizosphere microorganisms, compared with strategy i, strategy ii has received less attention by plant breeders. However, improved tools and reduced costs associated with microbiome analyses can add new standards for plant breeding programs. For example, plant phenotypes that target beneficial rhizosphere microbiomes can be evaluated by profiling root exudates or by using community compositional profiles (i.e., diversity and evenness metrics) as criteria to evaluate a cultivar.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>The disease resistance of Fusarium wilt by crops is normally divided into two strategies: strategy i (green) and strategy ii (orange).</title><p>These strategies are illustrated here, and the resistance level of the two strategies in the Foc-resistant cucumber and Foc-susceptible cucumber (FSC) are shown.

The soil (0.5&#x02009;g) was mixed with 5&#x02009;mL of autoclaved water and placed on an orbital shaker for 30&#x02009;min, after which 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of soil suspension was used for dilution as described above.</p><p id="Par31">We selected plates with fewer than 100 single colonies, and there was a total of three plates used for each treatment. Then, single colonies were selected and purified twice. In total, 238 single colonies from the FSC rhizosphere and 238 from the FRC rhizosphere were isolated. Each of 189 single colonies was isolated from the SMOA-conditioned soil and that of the control treatment.</p><p id="Par32">DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing were performed as described by Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The sequences were quality filtered and demultiplexed according to their barcode, and the taxonomy of the sequences was classified using the Greengenes database (V.13.5) as described above.</p><p id="Par33">The antagonistic activity of the isolates against <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> was evaluated with the method reported by Bordoloi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Briefly, a 4-mm agar plug of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> was placed in the middle of a PDA plate, and the strain was inoculated between the edge of the plate and the plug. The zone of inhibition was measured after incubation at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5 days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par34">For downstream analyses after sequence processing, to describe the rhizosphere community structure, a minimum number of sequences was extracted randomly for each sample to calculate the Shannon index estimated via QIIME by the alpha_diversity.py script. A nonparametric <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine if the Shannon indices differed between the FRC and FSC. Before calculation of the beta diversity, the cumulative-sum scaling (CSS) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was used to standardize the OTU profiles by the normalize_table.py script, and Bray-Curtis similarity matrices were prepared using the beta_diversity.py script. Adonis was used to determine whether the beta diversity differed between the two cultivars. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots were generated from Bray&#x02013;Curtis similarity matrices created using the R package <italic>ggplot2</italic>. To determine the percent change in taxa, we used <italic>t</italic>-tests for all family- or genus-level taxa with relative abundances &#x0003e;0.001 to measure the significant difference in these abundances between the two cultivars, with the <italic>P</italic>-values corrected according to the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg method. For functional predictions, the UCLUST method was used to select closed-reference operational taxonomic units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> at 97% sequence similarity using the Greengenes database (V. 13.5). Functional inferences according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database were made using PICRUSt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Downstream FishTaco analyses were performed according to the methods of David et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Briefly, the top 99 phylotypes with the maximum relative abundance across our OTU table from PICRUSt and normalized with MUSICC were selected. Then, a precomputed OTU-KO table from the PICRUSt analysis, output from MUSICC, and OTU relative abundance table was prepared for input into the FishTaco frame. Multitaxon mode was selected for each pairwise comparison between two cultivar samples. Finally, the R package <italic>ggplot</italic> was used to visualize the function-contribution distribution.</p><p id="Par35">For root exudate analyses, principal component analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> was used to visualize the root exudate structure of the two cultivars using the R package <italic>vegan</italic>. The <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected by the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg FDR procedure for multiple comparisons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. To identify the exudate compounds with the greatest contribution to the classification, a random forest approach was applied, and the default parameters in the R implementation of the algorithm (R package <italic>RandomForest</italic>, ntree&#x02009;=&#x02009;1000) were used. Enrichment analysis of the metabolic pathways was performed and plotted using the online platform MetaboAnalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/faces/home.xhtml">http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/faces/home.xhtml</ext-link>).
