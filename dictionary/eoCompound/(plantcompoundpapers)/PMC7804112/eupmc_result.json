    "Hydrocarbons or crude oil contamination of soil is still a burning problem around the globe. The herbs competent that are to survive in hydrocarbons contaminated habitats have some adaptive advantages to cope up with the adverse situations prevailing in that environment. In the present study, the adaptive response of Cyperus brevifolius in the heavily polluted soil with crude oil has been investigated in terms of survivability, changes in productivity, antioxidants, phytochemicals and functional group pro files of the plant species. Besides, changes in enzymes, beneficial bacterial population and physico-chemical conditions of contaminated soil were also studied during 60Â days of experimental trials. The results showed significant enhancement in activities of soil dehydrogenase, urease, alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and amylase whereas reduction in cellulase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. There was a significant increase in nitrogen fixing, phosphate and potassium solubilizing bacterial population, improvement in physico-chemical conditions and a decrease in total oil and grease (TOG) levels. Besides there was significant variations in the productivity parameters and antioxidant profiles of Cyperus brevifolius in hydrocarbons stress condition suggesting enzymatic defense of the herb. The fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis indicated uptake and metabolism of some hydrocarbon components by the experimental plant from the hydrocarbons polluted soil."
