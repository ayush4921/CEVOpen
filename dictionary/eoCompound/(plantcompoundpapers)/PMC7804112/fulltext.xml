In the present study, the adaptive response of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in the heavily polluted soil with crude oil has been investigated in terms of survivability, changes in productivity, antioxidants, phytochemicals and functional group pro files of the plant species. Besides, changes in enzymes, beneficial bacterial population and physico-chemical conditions of contaminated soil were also studied during 60&#x000a0;days of experimental trials. The results showed significant enhancement in activities of soil dehydrogenase, urease, alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and amylase whereas reduction in cellulase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. There was a significant increase in nitrogen fixing, phosphate and potassium solubilizing bacterial population, improvement in physico-chemical conditions and a decrease in total oil and grease (TOG) levels. Besides there was significant variations in the productivity parameters and antioxidant profiles of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in hydrocarbons stress condition suggesting enzymatic defense of the herb.

This problem is likely to increase due to dependence on petroleum and other oil products as a prime source of energy all over the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The accidental release of oil/hydrocarbons causes pollution and alters the physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil. The uptake of oil/hydrocarbon pollutants by plants results in food chain contaminations while downward movement of these pollutants causes ground water pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As a whole this is very harmful for human health and environment.
</p><p id="Par3">The phytoremediation has been proven as an effective technique for remediation of crude oil contaminated soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It has also been reported as a green clean technology and is alternative to physical and chemical methods of remediation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, success of phytoremediation basically depends on the type of plants used in the process besides in most cases it is even site specific. Moreover, due to better adaptability as supported by their fibrous root systems; herbaceous and annual plants have been reported as suitable candidates for remediation of crude oil contaminated soils. It has been frequently reported that the herbaceous and/or annual plant species show better adaptive&#x000a0;response in polluted sites as compared to tree seedlings or saplings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These plants have the efficiency in cleaning up the polluted soils at the early stage of their growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Several works have highlighted the success of annual/perennial herbs for phytoremediation of oil-contaminated soil throughout the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The different species of <italic>Cyperus</italic> has been reported as an effective candidate for remediation of crude oil polluted soil due to their quick and proliferate growth in the contaminated environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. According to a report, extensive root systems support large number of microbial populations in oil contaminated soil systems leading to produce several enzymes for degradation of petroleum contaminants and evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The species of <italic>Cyperus</italic> are characterized by their fibrous root systems and do not need long term maintenance in the stress environment which make them a suitable candidate for being used in the phytoremediation process.&#x000a0;The efficacy of this herb species has been tested for removal of oil and grease and it can survive in 50&#x02013;80&#x000a0;g/kg of crude oil spiked soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Even, removal of hydrocarbons from an initial range of 65&#x02013;75&#x000a0;g/kg was also found feasible by&#x000a0;<italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in crude oil contaminated field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the study focusing on the response of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in heavily polluted soil with crude oil is still limited and need to be addressed adequately. Moreover, the success of any plant-based technique depends upon the survivability of plants in heavily contaminated soil under field condition. In this context, the understanding of plant&#x02019;s adaptive response as well as enzymatic defense mechanism during crude oil reclamation process is necessary and accordingly a planned study is required.</p><p id="Par5">The herb <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> has been reported to grow abundantly in the sites that are heavily contaminated with crude oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Hence, it is hypothised that this herb species has some adaptive advantages to cope up with the adverse situation that are prevailing in the oil contaminated habitats. Besides, it is also assumed that <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> have ability to exhibit strong enzymatic defense to avoid hydrocarbon associated abiotic stress and also improves soil condition by up taking/detoxifying the pollutants from the contaminated soil. Keeping this in mind, the present work was designed to investigate the enzymatic defense process of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in aged/heavily polluted soil with crude oil. During the study, the changes in soil enzyme activities and beneficial microbes that include the total population of nitrogen fixing, phosphate and potassium solubilizing bacteria were also investigated to know their relationship with soil as well as plant and to correlate the changes in NPK status in the contaminated soil. Besides, the survivability, productivity, phyto-chemical contents as well as changes in functional groups of the plant species, oil and grease contents and physico-chemical conditions of the contaminated soil have also been investigated during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Survivability of Cyperus brevifolius in crude oil polluted soil</title><p id="Par6">Initially ten individuals of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> was introduced separately in ten respective pots that contains crude oil polluted soils of oil field.

The spectrum of 1432&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> which may be due to C=C stretching of aromatics was apparent and distinct in the sample from T3.

The crude oil contamination clogged the soil pore spaces, holds the soil particles together and reduces soil porosity, aeration, water infiltration and increases the bulk densities which ultimately reduce water holding capacity and destroys the soil textures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Besides, lower soil porosity and water holding capacity are also associated with reduction in microbial population, poor mineralization and nutrients availabilities in the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there was improvement in soil physico-chemicals and biological conditions by end of the experimental trials. The shifting of soil pH from high to low acidic condition at the end of the study may be due to either microbial degradation of crude oil pollutants or because of increasing metabolic activities in the soil by plant growth and associated microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Again present findings for changes in electrical conductivity (EC) are an agreement with the previous works of Tanee and Akonye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> who have reported an&#x000a0;increased level of EC in the plant&#x02019;s treated contaminated soil.

The EC value within 0.11&#x02013;0.57&#x000a0;ms/cm is suitable for agricultural activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Similarly, there was enhancement in water holding capacity (WHC) in the contaminated soil after treatment by <italic>Cyperus brevifolius.</italic> The enhanced values of EC and WHC could be attributed to the plant&#x02013;microbe interactions which ultimately degrade the oily layer besides releasing some ions in the soil systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The reduction in sand and silt levels and simultaneous increase in clay contents as revealed in this study could be related with improved EC and WHC in the treated soil. This observation in changes of soil texture is corroborated with the findings of Baruah et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Besides, the loss of total organic carbon (TOC) contents from the contaminated soil found in this study may be due to the utilization of organic carbon by microorganisms as well as the release of carbon in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> during microbial respirations which become more accelerated in the presence of plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and thus there was higher loss of TOC in the soil where <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> was introduced. Similarly, better improvement in pH, EC and WHC levels in T3 where the contaminated soils was treated with <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> could be attributed to the synergistic actions of plant and associated microbial communities<italic>.</italic> It has been suggested that release of root exudates, hormones and other organic substances enhanced the microbial activities in the rhizosphere zone which in turn detoxify/reduce the intensities of crude oil pollutants and improves the soil physico-chemical conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The decrease in total KJELDHAL nitrogen (TKN) contents may be attributed to the utilization of nitrogen by microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants present in soil. Additionally, greater loss of nitrogen along with carbon may be due to carbon mineralization and hydrocarbon immobilization resulting in excessive microbial activities using carbon materials as an energy source and its attendant demand for more nitrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Different physiological and enzymatic processes in the soil systems help the plants to uptake nutrients. The increase in available phosphorus (AP) and total potassium (TK) may be related with poor uptake of these nutrients by plants. Moreover, the enhanced levels of AP and TK in the soil may also be related with the phosphate and potassium solubilizing microorganisms which are responsible for the increase in AP and TK although further planned study is needed to understand the reason.</p><p id="Par16">The reduction in total oil and grease (TOG) contents indicates the potential of experimental plant for removal of hydrocarbons from the contaminated soil. This finding agrees the previous works of Bordoloi et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> who have reported about the efficiency of <italic>Axonopus compressus</italic> for removal of oil and grease from the crude oil-contaminated soil.

The reduction in oil and grease contents may be associated with the microbial activities, growth of the plants more particularly effective penetration of the root systems in the contaminated soil. It has been suggested that root exudates which control the quality and quantity of microbial population in soil also alter plant metabolism during crude oil associated stress condition thereby promoting the degradation of hydrocarbons/oil in vegetated treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Nevertheless, reduction in TOG levels (17.36%) in the present study was found comparatively less as against the previous works which can be because of the time duration of the experiment (60&#x000a0;days), besides the high concentration levels of crude oil of the experimental soil.

High level of crude oil contamination in soil can suppress the expression of enzyme activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Soil enzymes are good indicator of soil health. These are considered as natural mediators and catalysts of several important soil processes such as process of decomposition of organic matter, soil humus formation, released of mineral nutrients to the soil and their supply to plants, fixation of molecular nitrogen and the flow of the chemical elements of the biochemical cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The enhanced level of enzyme activities of the present study could be corroborated with the previous work of Yenn et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, where the authors have reported about the higher level of dehydrogenase, urease and phosphatase activities during phytoremediation of crude oil contaminated soil. The introduction of plants probably accelerates the microbial activities in the contaminated soil which in turn enhanced the enzyme activities. Moreover, the rise in enzyme activities after the introduction of plants may be also linked with the higher level of oxygen in the rhizosphere zone which results in a higher population of aerobic microbes and this is even very true in case of enhanced catalase activity in soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Besides, it has been suggested that fluctuation in amylase activities in soil is correlated with the changes in water holding capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the decrease in polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activities in T3 samples could be attributed to the specific microbial group that was not flourished well in the soil system although further planned study is required to explore the proper reason. Similarly, it was reported that soil organic carbon levels is associated with changes in cellulase activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and thus marginal decrease in soil cellulase activities in T3 could be linked with the reduction in organic carbon contents after treatment by <italic>Cyperus brevifolius.</italic></p><p id="Par18">The increase in total population of nitrogen fixing, phosphate and potassium solubilizing bacteria has showed the conformity with earlier works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> where it was reported that 6.11&#x02013;11 folds increase in beneficial microbial population is possible in the contaminated soil after phytoremediation trials. Thus enhanced level of these beneficial bacterial populations in vegetated treatment i.e. T3 could be related with the release of plant&#x02019;s exudates, mineralization/addition of nutrients to the soil system besides degradation of hydrocarbons to different intermediates which may again act as the nutrients for the microbes. As reported by Abedi-koupai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> plants impart root exudates that are rich in carbon, energy, enzymes and even sometimes oxygen to support large number of microbial populations in soil. Further, increase in beneficial bacterial population in non-vegetated treatment i.e. T2 may be due to the evaporation of some volatile contaminants which may offer less toxic environment to the microbial community. Nevertheless, higher increase in total population of beneficial bacteria in T3 than T2 shows the conformity with the previous work of Bank et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> who have reported that presence of plants greatly influence microbial population in soil systems than unplanted one.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Changes in plant characteristics</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Plant productivity parameters</title><p id="Par19">Crude oil pollution creates unsuitable conditions in soil and adversely affects the productivity of plants.

The lower shoot dry biomass of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in T3 than T4 as found in this study could be related to the low availability of nutrients/minerals and acidic conditions in the contaminated soil. Besides, water deficiency conditions in crude oil contaminated soil inevitably reduced leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll contents of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in T3 resulting difficulty in transpiration and photosynthesis which in turn results in retarded plant growth and biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the greater dry biomass of root of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> in T3 is likely to be associated with the adaptive response of the plant under stress environment.

Crude oil pollutants create an oxidative stress condition in plants and to mitigate these, plants uses their antioxidant defense systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

The higher free radical-scavenging or the greater level of antioxidant activity in the plant samples obtained from T3 could be related with plant&#x02019;s defense mechanism in crude oil polluted soil. The increase in DPPH free radical scavenging activity is an index of inhibition in lipid peroxidation which indicates the oxidative stress conditions in plants. The reducing power, DPPH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> free radical and other antioxidant interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS) or high level of free radicals to constraint oxidative stress (OS) by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and improve strong resistance power by protecting potential cell injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore high antioxidant capacity of <italic>Cyperus brevifolius</italic> indicates that it possesses a strong defense against the stress condition to prevent lipid peroxidation.
