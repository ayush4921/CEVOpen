    "Various medicinal plant parts and extracts have been proven to be sources of biologically active compounds, many of which have been incorporated in the production of new pharmaceutical compounds. Thus, the aim of this study was to increase the antimicrobial properties of a glass ionomer cement (GIC) through its modification with a mixture of plant extracts, which were evaluated along with a 0.5% chlorohexidine-modified GIC (CHX-GIC) with regard to the water sorption, solubility, and flexural strength. <b>Methods:</b><i>Salvadora persica, Olea europaea</i>, and <i>Ficus carcia</i> leaves were prepared for extraction with ethyll alcohol using a Soxhlet extractor for 12 h. The plant extract mixture (PE) was added in three different concentrations to the water used for preparation of a conventional freeze-dried GIC (groups 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2). Specimens were then mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and tested against the unmodified GIC (control) and a GIC modified with 0.5% chlorhexidine. Water sorption and solubility were evaluated after 7 days of immersion in distilled water. Flexural strength was evaluated in a three-point bending test after 24 h using a universal material testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison between the groups. Tukey's post hoc test was used for pairwise comparison when the ANOVA test was significant. <b>Results:</b> There were no statistically significant differences between the control (M = 20.5%), CHX-GIC (M = 19.6%), 1:1 (M = 20.0%), 1:2 (M = 19.5%), and 2:1 (19.7%) groups with regard to the percentage of water sorption, while for water solubility the 2:1 (M = -0.39%) plant-modified group was significantly different from all of the other groups. Flexural strength test results showed that the 2:1 group (M = 26.1 MPa) recorded significantly higher mean values compared to all other tested groups. <b>Conclusion and clinical relevance:</b> The plant extracts did not negatively affect the water sorption and solubility of the GIC, while the flexural strength was improved by the addition of the plant extract at higher concentrations."
