    "<h4>Background and aim</h4>The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now become a worldwide pandemic bringing over 71 million confirmed cases, while the specific drugs and vaccines approved for this disease are still limited regarding their effectiveness and adverse events. Since virus incidences are still on rise, infectivity and mortality may also rise in the near future, natural products are highly considered to be valuable sources for the discovery of new antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. This present review aims to comprehensively summarize the up-to-date scientific literatures on biological activities of plant- and mushroom-derived compounds relevant to mechanistic targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory-associated pathogenesis, including viral entry, replication and release, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).<h4>Experimental procedure</h4>Data were retrieved from a literature search available on PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases and collected until the end of May 2020. The findings from <i>inÂ vitro</i> cell and non-cell based studies were considered, while the results of <i>in silico</i> studies were excluded.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>Based on the previous findings in SARS-CoV studies, except <i>in silico</i> molecular docking analysis, herein, we provide a total of 150 natural compounds as potential candidates for development of new anti-COVID-19 drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity than the existing therapeutic agents. Several natural compounds have showed their promising actions on multiple therapeutic targets, which should be further explored. Among them, quercetin, one of the most abundant of plant flavonoids, is proposed as a lead candidate with its ability on the virus side to inhibit SARS-CoV spike protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction, viral protease and helicase activities, as well as on the host cell side to inhibit ACE activity and increase intracellular zinc level."
