Analytical methods for cation localization with a high spatial resolution are thus required. Due to the high water content of growing plant tissue, restraining the diffusion of mobile ions and preserving tissue integrity remain a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Specific chemical or physical fixation methods of plant tissue structures for microscopic observations exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Cryo-techniques coupled to cryo-observation in large fields of view using fluorescent techniques are particularly suited to localize metallic cations and diffusible compounds at low concentrations. The cryogenic fixation of plant tissues for light microscopy, called cryo-observation, has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] but has been rarely used in the fluorescent mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This scarcity is most likely due to the difficulty in keeping the cold chain intact between sample cryo-fixation, cryo-sectioning and sample observation in frozen conditions. To that end, a method of fluorescence staining followed by cryo-fixation and cryo-observation by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was developed and applied to the apple fruit cortex and table grape berry as models of turgid plant organs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Staining approaches</title><p id="Par6">Staining of the sample with aqueous dye solutions must be completed prior to cryo-fixation. In the present case, it was achieved by the infusion or perfusion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) of fresh samples using acridine orange (AO), a fluorescent dye for the cell walls and anionic sites of cell organelles, DNA and RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Compared to the direct staining of fresh sample sections, AO infusion was efficient, while perfusion showed limited dye diffusion in the vicinity of the capillary and required an increase of the laser intensity to reveal probe fluorescence. Although less efficient, the latter method may be useful to study specific tissue locations with limited operation artefacts. Due to its efficiency and simplicity, infusion staining was chosen in the following study. Such a staining method that is used prior to fixation and cutting a section has already been reported to successfully stain potassium in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Staining methods by <bold>a</bold> infusion and <bold>b</bold> perfusion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2018_356_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cryo-fixation</title><p id="Par7">The freezing process impacts turgid tissue structure due to ice crystal formation. The different cryo-fixation methods of AO infused samples were compared with regard to the apparent integrity of cell walls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Observations at approximately &#x02212;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C revealed that slow freezing at &#x02212;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b), fast freezing in liquid nitrogen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d), and fast freezing in cold isopentane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f) impacted the overall tissue structure from most to least. These results agree with the impact of the rate of ice nucleation: the faster the freezing technique is, the less ice nucleation is present, and the better that structures are preserved. Slow-freezing under microwaves was also tested as an alternative to fast-freezing. Applying low-power microwaves during freezing drastically reduced the growth of ice nuclei and limited cell damage due to ice expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The fruit tissue cryo-fixed by this technique yielded remarkable results with regard to the preservation of its cell integrity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g, h). This was particularly the case for the grape berry, for which tissue integrity was the most difficult to preserve. However, this promising technique still needs development to optimize its parameters, such as microwave power, freezing temperature and processing time. The preservation of inner cells in apple and grape tissues was more efficient using cooled isopentane freezing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f) than using microwave freezing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g, h). This may be explained by the short processing time of isopentane freezing (60&#x000a0;s) compared to that of 3&#x000a0;h for the microwave technique due to the air blast freezer used. Furthermore, by avoiding the Leidenfrost effect, isopentane freezing was preferred over liquid nitrogen freezing. However, the measurement of cell wall thickness as a function of freezing conditions revealed an impact of the cooling rate on cell wall thickness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Congo Red-stained apple cell walls at approximately 200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m from the cuticle were 2.5-fold thicker in tissue frozen by cold isopentane than in fresh tissue (room temperature), while tissue frozen at &#x02212;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or by liquid nitrogen gave an intermediate average thickness.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Effect of cryo-fixation methods on the apple cortex and grape berry tissue structure: <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>b</bold> frozen samples at &#x02212;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C; <bold>c</bold>&#x02013;<bold>d</bold> fast-frozen samples in liquid nitrogen; <bold>e</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold> fast-frozen samples in cooled isopentane; and <bold>g</bold>&#x02013;<bold>h</bold> frozen samples at &#x02212;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C under microwaves.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Observation of diffusible compounds</title><p id="Par8">As an application of the entire process on turgid plant organs, calcium, potassium and flavonoid compounds were localized in apple fruit and table grape berry tissue. Samples were independently infused with the calcium probe Fluo-3, potassium probe PBFI, and flavonoid probe DPBA. The samples were then fast-frozen in cold isopentane, cryo-sectioned and observed by cryo-LCSM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a&#x02013;f). The results showed diffuse calcium staining in the cell wall, while fluorescence spots were observed within cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b). Potassium and flavonoids were distributed in the entire fruit tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c&#x02013;f), and specific locations appeared in the cytosol next to the cell walls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, f). As a comparison, the direct staining of fresh sections yielded weaker labelling mainly due to the absence of intracellular staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g&#x02013;l). These observations may be attributed to low compound concentrations resulting from their diffusion during staining and loss during washes as well as from the higher diffusion of quenchers inducing faster fluorescence bleaching at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Cryo-observation of apple <bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold>, <bold>e</bold> and grape <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, <bold>f</bold> tissues infused by Fluo-3 (calcium), PBFI (potassium), DPBA (flavonoid) dyes and cryo-fixed in cooled isopentane.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par9">The experimental setup presented here was developed to image metallic cations and phenolic compound distributions in in vivo-like fleshy fruit by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Particular care was paid to the issues related to the low concentration and highly diffusible properties of these components. The fruit region of interest was established at the epidermal areas of grape and apple fruit. To allow full cell observation (range of cell diameter i.e., 10&#x02013;100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], section thicknesses needed to be adapted according to the tissue. Despite the particular physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of samples, sections with thicknesses of 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m were achieved but required dexterity for their handling, particularly for grape tissue. In addition, the physical state of the sample is essential when studying diffusible components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For turgid plant organs such as fleshy fruit, water, which amounts to 80&#x02013;85% of their weight, determines the morphological, physiological and physical properties of tissues at room temperature or in frozen solid states. Cryo-fixation limits the diffusion and redistribution of highly diffusible components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] but has several drawbacks. First, it requires that the sample be stained before freezing, and second, it faces the issue of structural damage by ice crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We found that fresh tissue infusion remains the most efficient and user-friendly method. It is well adapted to turgid plant tissue due to its porosity and exchange properties. Applied to apple and grape tissues, labelling was observed up to the fifth or sixth cell layer from the exposed area (approximately 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m for each layer) after two hours of staining. To reduce tissue destruction by ice crystals, cryogenic techniques have been developed. Plunge freezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], jet freezing, or slam freezing in cryogenic fluid or high pressure freezing (HPF) transform liquid water to a vitreous solid phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Currently, HPF is recognized as the method of choice for cryopreservation and is well adapted for ultramicrotome sections. This fast freezing process (&#x02248;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;ms) allows cell preservation up to 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and is optimal for investigating small cells and objects by the cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous samples (CEMOVIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], cryo-correlative light transmission electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or cryo-correlative light scanning electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These techniques are suited for preparing samples for cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), which has a field of view of smaller than 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> and is thus not suitable for large sample sizes when a field of view of more than 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> is required. In that context, hand freezing at atmospheric pressure remains the simplest, fastest and most repeatable method of cryo-fixation, as samples are dipped in a cryogen, such as cold isopentane. The hand freezing method used here was inspired by the freezing step involved in the Tokuyasu method, with no sucrose infiltration, as fruit tissues are naturally rich in osmolytes that logically act as natural cryoprotectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Cryo-observation in light microscopy has already been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but to our knowledge, only a few commercial or homemade fluorescence microscopes equipped with a cryo-chamber cooled by liquid nitrogen are available. They are specifically used to observe vitrified ultrathin sections by fluorescence microscopy as a preliminary step prior to observation by cryo-TEM. In available cryo-fluorescence microscopy setups, dry lenses with relatively long working distances (WDs) and limited numerical apertures (NAs) are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Recently, a prototype of a LSCM stage and objective lens were described for the high-resolution cryo-observation of sub-cellular localization of animal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our setup, the inverted optic of the LSCM possesses a short WD that maximizes the NA. These are key factors determining the fluorescence sensitivity and spatial resolution required to localize compounds at low concentrations, such as metallic cations or phenolic compounds in fruit tissue, with a large field of view.</p><p id="Par10">The freezing of water-rich biological materials has been reported to affect cell contraction and the swelling of cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the present study, the cell wall thickness was observed to vary according to the apple cryo-fixation temperature. As postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the extracellular water medium freezes first and provokes an outward water flux from the cells to osmotically equilibrate intracellular and extracellular media. Water in biomaterials is also known to expand by almost 9% during freezing and develops transient stresses when the material is frozen from all sides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The cell wall swelling observed in relation to the freezing rate and temperature may be related to these mechanisms, but further studies are required to understand the water behaviour in the fruit cell wall during cryo-fixation. Although water flux and osmolyte redistribution may have occurred during sample cryo-fixation, which impacted the diffusible component distribution, these artefacts may have been limited. Indeed, the two types of calcium labelling distribution observed in both apple and grape tissues showing diffuse staining in cell walls and intense fluorescence spots in cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b) were in agreement with their reported presence in nuclei, vesicles and plant cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, the observation of potassium labelling in the apoplast and cell wall of fresh tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i, j) and in cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d) of frozen tissue was in agreement with its apoplastic, cytosolic and vacuolar location in fleshy fruit cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the literature, calcium and potassium were measured directly on isolated cells and organelles using a fluorescent probe. Lastly, flavonoid distribution mainly observed in the cytosol close to the cell wall supports their putative sites of synthesis. Conversely, their proposed accumulation in the vacuole was not dominant in the present observations in apple and grape, but such localization remains a matter of debate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, f) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The cellular localization of these different diffusible compounds in the two fleshy fruit parenchymal tissues demonstrated the benefit of the cryo-method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par11">The localization of highly diffusible and low concentrated components such as metallic cations and flavonoids was achieved in fluorescence mode by LSCM. The reduction of component mobility was realized by keeping samples in a frozen state during the entire preparation process and by the design and adaptation of a cryo-LSCM setup for the observation of frozen sections. The successful localization of calcium, potassium and flavonoids in apple and grape fruits as a model of turgid tissue illustrated the benefits of the cryo-approach. The results indicated that the freezing temperature and cooling rate remain key parameters in the preservation of hydrated tissue integrity and require further studies to better control the associated osmotic-related structural rearrangements. The extension of this approach to other highly diffusible compounds will benefit from the development of specific and sensitive diffusible fluorescent markers. This approach opens new opportunities for studies of small metabolites and ions in the plant sciences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par12">The fruit tissue nomenclature used in this study is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.
