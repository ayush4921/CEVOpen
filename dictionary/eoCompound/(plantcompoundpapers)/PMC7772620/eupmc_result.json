    "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing potentially fatal coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with a significant health and economic burden around the globe. Currently many clinical studies are undergoing but still there is no any specific approved therapy or drug established for effective treatment of COVID-19. This review aimed to analyses various clinical studies which have been registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov and http://www.chictr.org.cn were registered with natural plant-based medicines and Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for discovering effective treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Total 46 and 64 natural drug and TCM interventions were identified which mainly determined the preventive strategies and possible treatments for COVID-19 infection. We identified that most of the clinical trial undergoing on natural compound like heparin and vitamin C as therapeutic agents and immune boosters for against COVID-19. Traditional Chinese medicines and herbal medicines can be effectively used as a preventive therapy against COVID-19 and after successful clinical trials and these potential therapies can be promoted by countries around the world.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at (10.1007/s12088-020-00919-x)."
