    "We studied the polyphenol (phenolic compounds and flavonoids) composition and allelopathic effects of <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i> R. Br. aerial foliage aqueous extract (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) on the seedling growth and plant biomass of the general biotest species, lettuce <i>(Lactuca sativa</i>). Mean leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, root fresh weight and root dry weight were decreased following exposure to <i>Acacia</i> aerial foliage, flowers aqueous extract (AFE) and phyllodes aqueous extract (APE) after 6 days. The reduction in plant dry biomass was more than 50% following treatment with AFE. The decrease in mean root length was approximately 37.7% and 29.20% following treatment with <i>Acacia</i> flowers extract (AFE) at 75% and 100% concentration, respectively. Root dry weight of <i>L. sativa</i> was reduced by both flowers and phyllodes extract. The reduction of protein contents in lettuce leaves following <i>Acacia</i> foliage extract proved that both AFE and APE exhibit polyphenols that causes the toxicity which led to decrease in leaf protein contents. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the <i>A. melanoxylon</i> flowers and phyllodes. A total of 13 compounds (accounting for most abundant compounds in flowers and phyllodes) include different flavonoids and phenolic compounds. The phytochemical compounds detected were: Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid, <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid, syringic acid, <i>p</i>-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid. The major flavonoid compounds identified include rutin, luteolin, apigenin, and catechin. Allelopathic effects of flower and phyllodes extracts from <i>A. melanoxylon</i> may be due to the presence of above compounds identified by HPLC analysis."
