It was shown recently that several <italic>Lysobacter</italic> type strains produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which controlled the growth of <italic>Phytophthora infestans in vitro</italic> when the bacteria were grown on a protein rich medium. In the present study, <italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78 (AZ78) has been tested for its potential to produce VOCs that may contribute to the bioactivity against soilborne plant pathogens. To this end, split Petri dish assays of bacterial cultures have been combined with GC-MS measurements with the aim to reveal the identity of the VOCs which inhibit the growth of <italic>Pythium ultimum Rhizoctonia solani</italic>, and <italic>Sclerotinia minor</italic>. While AZ78 completely suppressed the growth of <italic>P. ultimum</italic> and <italic>S. minor</italic>, the growth of <italic>R. solani</italic> was still reduced significantly. The GC-MS analysis revealed 22 VOCs to be produced by AZ78, the majority of which were (putatively) identified as mono- and dialkylated methoxypyrazines. Based on additional cultivation and GC-MS experiments, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were selected as presumable bioactive compounds. Further bioassays employing indirect exposure to standard solutions (1&#x02013;10 mg per Petri dish) of the synthetic compounds via the gas phase, revealed that each of these pyrazines was able to suppress the growth of the pathogens under investigation. The results of this study highlight the possible future implementation of pyrazine derivatives in the control of soilborne plant diseases and further support the biocontrol potential of <italic>L. capsici</italic> AZ78.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78</kwd><kwd>VOC</kwd><kwd>GC-MS</kwd><kwd>pyrazine</kwd><kwd>biological control</kwd><kwd>soilborne plant pathogens</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">H2020 Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie Actions<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100010665</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">722642</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Amt der N&#x000d6; Landesregierung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100015053</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recent years, the scientific community is increasingly questioning the use of synthetic chemical pesticides in plant disease management, as their impact on human health and the environment are coming to surface (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alavanja et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;hler and Triebskorn, 2013</xref>). As a result, regulations become stricter and some synthetic chemical pesticides have been already banned, as in the case of methyl bromide (2011/120/EU). This pesticide was constantly used in soil fumigation for the control of the soilborne phytopathogenic microorganisms <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic>, <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> and <italic>Sclerotinia minor</italic>, responsible for a plethora of commercially significant plant diseases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ah-Fong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Verwaaijen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Crutcher et al., 2018</xref>). Considering their life cycle, it is undeniable that soil fumigation is an effective way for managing soilborne phytopathogenic microorganisms. However, as the use of several conventional chemical fumigants has been banned, alternative compounds are needed to be used in soil fumigation.</p><p>Recently, microbial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have come into the limelight as potential candidates to substitute the outlawed chemical fumigants (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">De Boer et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, their physiochemical characteristics such as low boiling point, high vapor pressure and low molecular weight (&#x0003c;300 Da) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Piechulla et al., 2017</xref>), their activity in both gas and liquid phases and ability to re-evaporate after diffusing through water-filled pores, allow microbial VOCs to move easily through the soil pores network (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Effmert et al., 2012</xref>). Another aspect is that microbial VOCs exhibit various biological properties beneficial for plant health, like enhancing plant growth, inducing resistance against abiotic and biotic stress and inhibiting spore germination and mycelial growth of plant pathogens (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bitas et al., 2013</xref>). All these properties and characteristics point to the exploitation of microbial VOCs in soil fumigation belowground.</p><p>A growing number of studies that bring attention to the practical application of bacterial VOCs in agriculture have emerged. Bacteria residing in agricultural soils release VOCs belonging to the classes of terpenes, pyrazines, sulfur compounds and other nitrogen containing metabolites that have been described to show antifungal activities (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tyc et al., 2017</xref>). VOCs such as dimethyl disulfide and 2,3-butanediol emitted from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. have for example been applied as soil treatments in open field and greenhouse experiments, that protected tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> D.) and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) plants against several pathogenic fungi (<italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, <italic>Colletotrichum heterostrophus</italic>, and <italic>Setosphaeria turcica</italic>) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, dimethyl disulfide, that has been widely studied for its positive effects on plant health (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Groenhagen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Popova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Giorgio et al., 2015</xref>), has already been commercialized as a soil pre-fumigant against diseases caused by nematodes and soilborne plant pathogens (Paladin, Arkema, Colombes, France).</p><p>The genus <italic>Lysobacter</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Cook, 1978</xref>) consists of bacteria isolated from various environments like freshwater, agricultural soils and plant rhizosphere (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Reichenbach, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Puopolo et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the occurrence of bacterial strains belonging to the species <italic>L. antibioticus</italic>, <italic>L. capsici</italic>, and <italic>L. gummosus</italic> in clay agricultural soils, was related to the disease suppressiveness against <italic>R. solani</italic> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Postma et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Several <italic>Lysobacter</italic> sp. have been employed as biocontrol agents, including <italic>L. capsici</italic> AZ78 (AZ78), which was isolated from the rhizosphere of tobacco and has been shown to produce a variety of soluble secondary metabolites with detrimental effects on several plant pathogens (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Puopolo et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). <italic>Lysobacter</italic> spp. may control phytopathogenic microorganisms using several other modes of actions such as lytic enzymes and by the ability to prey upon phytopathogenic microorganisms (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Folman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tomada et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of the release of bioactive VOCs in the ability of <italic>Lysobacter</italic> spp. to control soilborne phytopathogenic microorganisms did not receive particular attention so far. However, it was reported that VOCs produced by <italic>Lysobacter</italic> and other bacterial species were positively correlated to the natural ability of certain soils to suppress the growth of phytopathogenic fungi (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2007</xref>).

In all the experiments, AZ78 cell suspensions were prepared after 72 h growth at 27&#x000b0;C and by scraping the AZ78 colonies from the LBA surfaces using sterile 10 &#x003bc;L loops. Loopful of AZ78 cells were then thoroughly suspended in 10 mL of sterile NaCl solution (0.85%, w/v) and the absorbance was adjusted to an optical density of 0.1 at 600 nm (A<sub><italic>OD</italic></sub><sub>600</sub>) corresponding to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puopolo et al., 2016</xref>), using a spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).

In all the experiments, a plug (5 mm in diameter) was cut from the border of 7 days old fungal or oomycete colony using a sterile cork borer. Subsequently, the mycelium plugs were placed on PDA-containing side and the Petri dishes were incubated at 25&#x000b0;C in the dark. After 96 h post-inoculation (hpi), the mycelial growth of the tested pathogens was determined by measuring the mycelium colony diameter (mm) parallel to the separating barrier of the two compartments. It is worth noting that the 96 hpi time point of the measurements corresponded to a total AZ78 incubation time of 168 h, as AZ78 was incubated for 72 h prior to pathogens inoculation. Thus, 168 h was subsequently chosen as one of the sampling time points for the analysis of AZ78 VOCs profile described below. Four replicates (Petri dishes) were analyzed for each treatment and the experiment was carried out twice.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS3"><title>Headspace Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds Produced by <italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78</title><sec id="S2.SS3.SSS1"><title>Sample Preparation of Living Cultures for Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Headspace (HS) vials (20 mL, La-Pha-Pack, Langerwehe, Germany) were filled with 5 mL of NA and were placed in a slanted position under a laminar flow overnight.

Subsequently, a 50 &#x003bc;L aliquot of bacterial suspension (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL) was added to the HS vials, the bacteria were spread on the surface of the medium with the help of a sterile loop and the vials were left to dry under a laminar flow for 1 h at room temperature. The HS vials were then sealed with sterile metal caps containing 1.3 mm-silicone/PTFE septa (La-Pha-Pack) and incubated at 28&#x000b0;C for 120 h or 168 h before GC-MS measurement.

The GC-MS was additionally equipped with a multi-purpose autosampler (MPS 2XL, Gerstel, M&#x000fc;lheim an der Ruhr, Germany), a dynamic headspace system (DHS, Gerstel), a thermal desorption unit (TDU, Gerstel) and a cooled injection system (CIS, Gerstel) unit. After initial optimization of the parameters for extraction of VOCs, transfer of the analytes to the TDU, desorption and cold injection, the following settings were chosen for the DHS: samples were pre-incubated at 27&#x000b0;C for 15 min and simultaneously agitated at 1000 rpm. VOCs were then collected dynamically (N<sub>2</sub> purge flow 100 or 50 mL/min to a final volume of 500 mL) onto a 2 cm TENAX trap (Buchem, Apeldoorn, Netherlands) at 30&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the loaded trap was dried at 27&#x000b0;C in a N<sub>2</sub> gas stream (100 or 50 mL/min to a final volume of 800 mL) and transferred to the TDU. Thermal desorption of the analytes into the CIS (&#x02212;150&#x000b0;C) was achieved by heating from 30 to 230&#x000b0;C at a rate of 60&#x000b0;C/min (hold time 5 min). A liner-in-liner setup was operated with a transfer temperature of 250&#x000b0;C in splitless mode.

Split Petri dishes having filter paper treated with 20 &#x003bc;L ethanol were used as control. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm and incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 72 h to allow VOCs to evaporate into the gas phase of the Petri dish and to absorb into the PDA medium. Subsequently, each plant pathogen (5 mm plug) was inoculated on the PDA compartment (one pathogen per Petri dish) and dishes were sealed with Parafilm and incubated at 25&#x000b0;C. After 48 h incubation, the mycelium colony diameter was measured as reported above and the mycelial growth inhibition was calculated according to the following formula:</p><p>

Pyrazines clearly dominated the bacterial profiles at both time points, with structures of monoalkyl-methoxypyrazines and dialkyl-methoxypyrazines to be the most abundant. In total, five monoalkyl-methoxypyrazines (6, 9, 10, 13, and 14) were identified (C.L. 1) having methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, sec- butyl-, and isobutyl- substitutions, respectively.

Two more pyrazines, having a diisopropyl-methoxy structure (20 and 21) were annotated (C.L. 3), as well. One dialkylpyrazine was detected and identified (C.L. 1) as 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (4).

Indeed, (1) has been found in bacteria, yeast and endophytic fungi and inhibited the growth of various phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Strobel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Syed-Ab-Rahman et al., 2019</xref>).

Pyrazine derivatives exhibit several activities of pharmacological interest including antibacterial, antifungal, antidiabetic, anticancer, antiviral, and analgesic activity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dolezal and Zitko, 2015</xref>) and microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, represent a major source for biosynthesis of pyrazines (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rajini et al., 2011</xref>). Various mono- and dialkylpyrazines produced by soil bacteria significantly inhibited the growth of a wide variety of phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Haidar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;lner et al., 2019</xref>). Regarding their mode of action, studies testing the activity of 2,5-diisopropylpyrazine against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, showed that the compound caused DNA damage at high concentrations, while at lower levels, cell-wall damage was observed. Similar mechanisms could apply for phytopathogenic fungi, as the growth of <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic> and <italic>R. solani</italic> strains was also strongly attenuated by this pyrazine (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Janssens et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the type of pyrazines produced by AZ78, the methoxypyrazines with various mono- and dialkylated derivatives was the dominant group of VOCs. The monoalkyl-methoxypyrazines (6, 9, 10, 13, and 14) identified in the profile, are widely distributed metabolites of plants, insects, fungi and bacteria. For instance, they are known semiochemicals of ladybird beetle (<italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic>) and their occurrence in insects can be related to bacterial metabolism (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidtberg et al., 2019</xref>). Their biosynthesis in bacteria is proposed to originate from condensation of amino acids like valine or isoleucine with glycine (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bungert et al., 2001</xref>) and their production has been already described in <italic>Chondromyces crocatus</italic>, <italic>Halomonas venusta</italic>, and <italic>P. perolens</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bungert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>). AZ78 additionally produced several dialkyl-methoxypyrazines (12, 16, 18, 20, and 21) that are rarely reported in bacteria (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chatonnet et al., 2010</xref>). 3-Isobutyl-2-methoxy-6-methylpyrazine was for the first time reported as a natural product of <italic>Serratia odorifera</italic> VOC blend by <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gallois and Grimont (1985)</xref>, while 2-isobutyl-3-methoxy-5-methylpyrazine was formerly described for the myxobacterium <italic>C. crocatus</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat et al., 2005</xref>). The compound (18) found in AZ78 VOCs mixture was annotated as 3-isobutyl-2-methoxy-6-methylpyrazine. All other dialkyl-methoxypyrazines detected in the VOC profile of AZ78 were annotated based on the similarity of their mass spectra and RI values with the respective data reported in the two above studies. From the dialkylpyrazine group, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (4) was confirmed by authentic standards. This metabolite is widespread in nature and is produced by a vast number of bacteria (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schulz and Dickschat, 2007</xref>). Although it is also reported to be present in the media used for cultivation or formed during heating or autoclaving of growth media (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schulz and Dickschat, 2007</xref>), in our experiments it was either not detected in the medium, or at levels less than 1/10 compared to the bacterial samples.</p><p>A relevant number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies dedicated to the analysis of bacterial VOCs and their bioactivity, concentrate on the compounds emitted directly from the bacterial culture under investigation. We decided to go a step further and focused our attention on the VOCs accumulated on the growth medium which had been exposed to VOC mixtures produced by bacteria without direct contact to the bacterial culture itself. To achieve this, we analyzed the VOCs present above PDA medium, which was physically separated from the growing AZ78 cells, hypothesizing that these VOCs are more likely to contribute to AZ78 inhibitory activity.</p><p>Several compounds detected in the VOC profile of AZ78 were identified in the physically separated PDA medium of the same Petri dish. 2,5-Dimethylpyrazine (4), 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine (9), and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (10) were the compounds more consistently detected in PDA medium. We were able to determine the amounts of (4, 9, 10) by preparing standards of each VOC and measuring in parallel with the samples by GC-MS. Comparison of peak areas between standards and pyrazines in samples revealed that concentration levels corresponded to amounts of a few ng per sample of AZ78 cultures and PDA medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Based on these results, it is conceivable that AZ78 emits these VOCs and that they accumulate on the surface of PDA medium where they might get in physical contact with the cells of the plant pathogens tested.</p><p>As (4, 9, 10) were the most predominant VOCs found, they were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>ultimum</italic>, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solani</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>minor.</italic> Interestingly, these VOCs inhibited the mycelial growth of each of the plant pathogenic microorganisms at different concentrations. Overall, <italic>S. minor</italic> was the most sensitive pathogen, as it was the only one inhibited by more than 80% after application of 7.5 mg/Petri of both 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine (9) or 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (10) and by more than 50% with 7.5 mg/Petri of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (4). As these pathogens belong to different phyla, it may well be that morphological and biochemical differences are responsible for the different response to the pyrazine tested.</p><p>Regarding the tested VOCs, 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (10) showed the lowest activity against <italic>R. solani</italic> (about 10% inhibition) whereas 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine (9) was the most active compound, inhibiting the growth of all three pathogens by at least 30% at 2.5&#x02013;5.0 mg/Petri. This VOC was detected in high amounts at both time points of AZ78 VOC measurements and was the most abundant constituent of the profile at 168 h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence on the antimicrobial properties of this pyrazine. 2,5-Dimethylpyrazine (4), attenuated (&#x0003e; 30%) the growth of all plant pathogens at the dosage of 7.5 mg/Petri. This VOC may be produced by various soil bacteria and has been shown to inhibit the growth of several diverse plant pathogens (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Haidar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agisha et al., 2019</xref>). The broad distribution and activity indicate a possible role of this compound under environmental conditions. Accordingly, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chuankun et al. (2004)</xref> found that 2,5-dimethylpyrazine was specifically found in fungistatic soils, or soils that naturally inhibit fungal propagules growth. Thus, it is conceivable that this VOC possesses characteristics that might be exploited for the control of soilborne plant pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p>It is worth noting that the inhibition levels observed in bioassays with the synthetic compounds ranged below those exhibited by the VOC bouquet emitted by AZ78, as already reported in other studies (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Groenhagen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possible synergistic effect of the various constituents of AZ78 VOC blend on the inhibition of the soilborne plant pathogens and additionally consider the deviations of the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions from those observed in nature that may lead to differences in VOC production rates. Moreover, it should also be noted that due to the chosen GC-MS approach some volatiles with very low boiling points such as the inorganic NH<sub>3</sub> or HCN may have been missed during our analysis and therefore could not be considered in the interpretation of activity profiles.</p><p>Overall, the present study sheds light on the AZ78 ability to inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> the growth of soilborne plant pathogenic microorganisms through the emission of a VOC blend, where pyrazines are the most represented class of VOCs. As alkylated pyrazines have been applied in the food industry as disinfectants (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kusstatscher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000f6;ck et al., 2018</xref>) and, additionally, pyrazine derivatives are recognized as safe for human/animal consumption and the environment (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rychen et al., 2017</xref>), we feel that our results may support the possible development of selected pyrazines as active ingredients of novel biofumigants against soilborne plant pathogenic microorganisms. Our results suggest that additional compounds and/or factors are involved in the growth inhibition observed in the split Petri dish assays, most probably associated with compounds that cannot easily be measured by the presented DHS-TD-GC-MS approach. Future studies on the inhibitory mechanisms involved and on additional volatiles contributing to AZ78 activity will help to draw a more complete picture of AZ78 volatile-mediated inhibition of soilborne plant pathogenic microorganisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets presented in this study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AV, VL, MP, GP, and RS conceived the study.
