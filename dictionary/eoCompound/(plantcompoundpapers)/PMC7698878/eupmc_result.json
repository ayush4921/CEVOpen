    "There are 11 different varieties of <i>Beta vulgaris</i> L. that are used in the food industry, including sugar beets, beetroots, Swiss chard, and fodder beets. The typical red coloration of their tissues is caused by the indole-derived glycosides known as betalains that were analyzed in hypocotyl extracts by UV/Vis spectrophotometry to determine the content of betacyanins (betanin) and of betaxanthins (vulgaxanthin I) as constituents of the total betalain content. Fields of beet crops use to be also infested by wild beets, hybrids related to <i>B. vulgaris</i> subsp. <i>maritima</i> or <i>B. macrocarpa</i> Guss., which significantly decrease the quality and quantity of sugar beet yield; additionally, these plants produce betalains at an early stage. All tested <i>B. vulgaris</i> varieties could be distinguished from weed beets according to betacyanins, betaxanthins or total betalain content. The highest values of betacyanins were found in beetroots 'Monorubra' (9.69 mg/100 mL) and 'Libero' (8.42 mg/100 mL). Other beet varieties contained less betacyanins: Sugar beet 'Labonita' 0.11 mg/100 mL; Swiss chard 'Lucullus,' 0.09 mg/100 mL; fodder beet 'Monro' 0.15 mg/100 mL. In contrast with weed beets and beetroots, these varieties have a ratio of betacyanins to betaxanthins under 1.0, but the betaxanthin content was higher in beetcrops than in wild beet and can be used as an alternative to non-red varieties. Stability tests of selected varieties showed that storage at 22 °C for 6 h, or at 7 °C for 24 h, did not significantly reduce the betalain content in the samples."
