    "A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has caused a major outbreak in humans around the globe, and it became a severe threat to human healthcare than all other infectious diseases. Researchers were urged to discover and test various approaches to control and prevent such a deadly disease. Considering the emergency and necessity, we screened reported antiviral compounds present in the traditional Indian medicinal plants for the inhibition of SARS-CoV2 main protease. In this study, we used molecular docking to screen 41 reported antiviral compounds that exist in Indian medicinal plants and shown amentoflavone from the plant <i>Torreyanucifera</i> with a higher docking score. Furthermore, we performed a 40â€‰ns atomic molecular dynamics simulation and free binding energy calculations to explore the stability of the top five protein-ligand complexes. Through the article, we insist that the amentoflavone, hypericin and Torvoside H from the traditional Indian medicinal plants may be used as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 main protease and further biochemical experiments could shed light on understanding the mechanism of inhibition by these plant-derived antiviral compounds.
