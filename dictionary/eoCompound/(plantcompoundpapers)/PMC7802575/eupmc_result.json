    "In this work, the effect of processing stages including first soaking (FS), frying after first soaking (FFS), and second soaking (SS) on nonvolatile taste compounds of Shanghai smoked fish was investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and automatic amino acid analyzer. Results showed that the contents of free amino acids (FAAs) ranged from 396.94 to 585.79 mg/100 g and 5'-inosine monophosphate (IMP, as main umami nucleotide) from 215.91 to 284.56 mg/100 g in Shanghai smoked fish, respectively. Moreover, the contents of Glu and Gly as main umami amino acids ranged from 1.64 to 107.32 mg/100 g and 61.61 to 108.88 mg/100 g, respectively. TAV values of IMP, Asp, and Glu in Shanghai smoked fish reached 11.38, 2.73, and 21.46, respectively. The obvious difference could be observed using principal component analysis (PCA) in three processing stages of Shanghai smoked fish. Therefore, probing into the nonvolatile flavor of Shanghai smoked fish could not only enrich the theoretical basis of flavor chemistry in freshwater fish fields, but probe into the formation mechanisms of taste compounds in further study."
