    "Mauritius Island possesses unique plant biodiversity with a potential reservoir of biologically active compounds of pharmacological interest. In the current study, we investigated Mauritius endemic plant families Asteraceae, Ebenaceae, Sapotaceae, and Erythroxylaceae, for anti-cancer properties on T cell lymphoma and B16F10 Melanoma cells and immunomodulatory properties on primary T and B cells. The cytotoxicity of methanolic plant extracts at 1, 10, 25 µg/ml was determined. The most active plant species were evaluated for their apoptosis-inducing effects. The immunomodulatory properties of the plants were also studied, and preliminary phytochemical screening of selected plants was done by LC-MS analysis. Psiadia lithospermifolia (Lam.) Cordem (Asteraceae) at 25 µg/ml was the most cytotoxic on both EL4 and B16 cells and triggered apoptosis by the death receptor pathway, and at least in part, by the mitochondrial pathway. Most plant species from Asteraceae, Ebenaceae, Erythroxylaceae, and Sapotaceae inhibited the proliferation of activated T and B cells, although some promoted T cell proliferation. LC-MS profile of Asteraceae plants showed the presence of terpenes, terpenoids, fatty acids, and phenolic. Flavonoids and phenolic acid were also detected from Ebenaceae and Sapotaceae plants. Together, our study demonstrated that Mauritius endemic flora exhibit potential anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties worthy of further in-depth studies."
