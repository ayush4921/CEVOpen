    "This study aimed to investigate the impact of municipal waste landfill on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) release to the environment concerning groundwater flow directions. The contents of polychlorinated biphenyls in soils, plants and water were analysed at various distances from the landfill. Thanks to low solubility PCBs in water groundwater flow direction, under the landfill, have an influence on PCBs concentration in groundwater. Strong PCBs' sorption to organic matter caused that no affect groundwater flow directions on PCB content in soils and plants' tissues was observed. The largest PCBs deposition zone was located 50 m from the contamination source (landfill). Tri-CB and tetra-CB homologues were capable of migration deep into the soil profile, which could be related to the geological material from which the soils under study were developed, as well as to the properties of the PCB homologues."
