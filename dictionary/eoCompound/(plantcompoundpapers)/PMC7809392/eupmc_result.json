    "Lower nitrogen use efficiency is major crop productivity limiting factor in semi-arid regions due to its poor organic contents in the soil; our research work is considered to optimize crop productivity by soil and plant chem-biological correction. This study designed and aimed to use soil inoculation with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria of the genus <i>Azospirillum</i> and foiler application by humic preparations ALCRI-CropHelp and ALCRI-CropHelp-M compared with control and NPK fertilizer under wheat plants in arid regions of Egypt. Experimental data showed that biological correction contributed to a significant increase in wheat yield in the arid regions. The specific results for <i>Azospirillum,</i> ALCRI-CropHelp, and ALCRI-CropHelp-M were significantly increased wheat grain yield on 256, 267, and 278 % relative to the control, respectively. Simultaneously, water use efficiency has increased by more than 2.5 times, compared with control and NPK treatments. This effect was achieved due to multiple effects on the metabolism of agricultural plants, and applications of ALCRI-CropHelp and ALCRI-CropHelp-M treatments revealed an increase in the biological yield, spike length, harvest index compared with control and NPK treatments. In conclusion, this study has shown that the ALCRI-CropHelp Az and ALCRI-CropHelp-M foliar applications significantly (P < 0.05) increased grain yield status, N, P, and K in plants, plant growth rate, and plant productivity under growing wheat plant in arid regions. We recommended these treatments for the enhancement of wheat plant productivity in arid regions."
