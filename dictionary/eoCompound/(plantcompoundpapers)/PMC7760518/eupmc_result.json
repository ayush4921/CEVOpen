    "The composition and allelopathy to <i>Phytophthora nicotianae</i> (the causal agent of tobacco black shank disease) of root exudates from a resistant tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.) cultivar Gexin 3, a susceptible cultivar Xiaohuangjin 1025 and their reciprocal grafts were investigated. Grafting with disease-resistant rootstock could improve resistance to black shank; this is closely related to the allelopathy of root exudates. The root exudates from the resistant cultivar inhibited the growth of <i>P. nicotianae</i>, while those from the susceptible cultivar promoted the growth; the grafting varieties had intermediate properties. The root exudate composition differed among cultivars. Gexin 3 was rich in esters and fatty acids, while Xiaohuangjin 1025 contained more hydrocarbons and phenolic acids. The composition of root exudates of grafted cultivars as well as their allelopathy to <i>P. nicotianae</i> were altered, and tended to be close to the composition of cultivar used as rootstock. Eugenol, 4-tert-butylphenol, mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, dipropyl phthalate, and methyl myristate were identified as the main compounds contributing to inhibitory properties of root exudates. Sorbitol was suggested to play a role in disease induction. Overall, rootstock-scion interaction affected the composition of tobacco root exudates, which may be attributed to the different disease resistance among grafted plants, rootstock and scion."
