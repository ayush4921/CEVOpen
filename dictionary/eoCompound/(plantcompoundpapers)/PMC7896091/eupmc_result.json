    "The synthesis of phytol-derived γ-butyrolactones as well as their evaluation for deterrent activity towards peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae and antiproliferative activity against four selected cancer cell lines are reported. Products were obtained in good yields (19-96%) and their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic data (NMR, HRMS). Four synthesized δ-halo-γ-lactones (4-7) are new and have not been previously described in the literature. In the choice test phytol (1) appeared deterrent to M. persicae, whereas modifications of its structure did not cause the avoidance of the treated leaves by the aphids. In contrast, aphids were attracted to the leaves treated with the new trans-δ-chloro-γ-lactone (6). Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique applied to explore the aphid probing and feeding activity revealed that neither phytol nor lactone 6 affected aphid probing and the consumption of phloem sap, which means that both phytol and the lactone 6 might have acted as postingestive modifiers of aphid behavior. The results of in vitro antitumor assays showed that obtained phytol derivatives exhibit cytotoxic activity against studied cancer cell lines (leukemia, lung and colon carcinoma and its doxorubicin resistant subline). Halolactones 4-6 were identified as the compounds, which arrest cell cycle of leukemia cells mainly in G2/M and S phases."
