The predominant approach for vegetal decellularization remains serial chemical processing. However, this technique is time-consuming and requires harsh compounds which damage the resulting scaffolds. The current study presents an alternative solution using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>). Protocols testing various solvents were assessed and results found that scCO<sub>2</sub> in combination with 2% peracetic acid decellularized plant material in less than 4&#x000a0;h, while preserving plant microarchitecture and branching vascular network. The biophysical and biochemical cues of the scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularized spinach leaf scaffolds were then compared to chemically generated scaffolds. Data showed that the scaffolds had a similar Young&#x02019;s modulus, suggesting identical stiffness, and revealed that they contained the same elements, yet displayed disparate biochemical signatures as assessed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Finally, human fibroblast cells seeded on the spinach leaf surface were attached and alive after 14&#x000a0;days, demonstrating the biocompatibility of the scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularized scaffolds. Thus, scCO<sub>2</sub> was found to be an efficient method for plant material decellularization, scaffold structure preservation and recellularization with human cells, while performed in less time (36&#x000a0;h) than the standard chemical approach (170&#x000a0;h).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biomedical materials</kwd><kwd>Biomedical engineering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Center for Applied Nanobioscience and Medicine</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Valley Research Partnership</institution></funding-source><award-id>PI-4005</award-id><award-id>PI-4005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Ashlee F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lacombe</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008335</institution-id><institution>Arizona Biomedical Research Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADHSS17-0000403/45773</award-id><award-id>ADHSS17-0000403/45773</award-id><award-id>ADHSS17-0000403/45773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Ashlee F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lacombe</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name><name><surname>Zenhausern</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As the need for replacement organs and tissues increases, the field of tissue engineering has risen to meet this challenge by seeking original sources of biomaterial and alternative approaches for their generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In this perspective, scaffolds mimicking the in vivo tissue environment are sought to provide appropriate structural and biomechanical support to cells while simultaneously facilitating cell behavior and tissue development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The recent emergence of plant-based materials offers a promising opportunity to meet this need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Indeed, several studies have found that vegetal material could be decellularized to generate biocompatible scaffolds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Plants are a natural, renewable material source which are easily accessible and offer a low-cost alternative to animal tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. They are comprised primarily of cellulose, a biocompatible compound that has already been extensively used in the medical industry to dress wounds or create artificial skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Due to its inherent strength, porosity and water-retention properties, cellulose has been demonstrated as a viable choice from which to generate biomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Another advantage of plant-based biomaterials is their unique intrinsic structures, which offer a wide variety of microscale patterned constructs resembling the complex cellular microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, the natural branching fluid transport system found in plants is similar to a mammalian blood vessel network, with detailed definition and small-scale vessels that cannot be simply reproduced by the current 3D printers or microfluidic technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Upon re-cellularization, it has been demonstrated that human cells can attach, metabolize, proliferate and align to the surface microtopography of plant scaffolds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> while the inner plant vasculature can also be endothelialized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Interestingly, plant scaffolds have been tested in vivo and found to be pro-angiogenic, where blood vessels grew throughout the biomaterial demonstrating that the scaffold in vivo generates a low inflammatory response, while promoting cell invasion and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, the stiffness of decellularized plant tissue has also been shown to match the stiffness of specific human anatomical tissue sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The gold standard method to decellularize plant tissue is serial chemical treatment. Traditionally, an aqueous detergent (e.g. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)) is followed with a surfactant-bleach solution. While this approach has been effective, the scaffold preparation takes several days. The scaffolds must be washed numerous times to ensure harsh chemicals are removed and not depositing a toxic residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, in animal tissue, these chemicals have been shown to damage the scaffold during decellularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. For example, the use of SDS, a powerful cell lysing agent which disrupts protein configuration and native ultrastructure, has been shown to induce collagen compaction in decellularized heart valves or ECM fibrosis in lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This type of disruption can affect cell signaling, alignment and organization upon recellularization. While the effects on plant tissue are unexplored, novel processing methods are needed to perform efficient decellularization with shorter treatment times and without the use of harsh chemicals.</p><p id="Par6">Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>) offers an alternative and promising decellularization approach. In its supercritical phase, CO<sub>2</sub> requires high pressure yet low temperature. Once the fluid state is achieved, scCO<sub>2</sub> displays low viscosity and high diffusivity. With these gas-like transport properties, liquid-like density, and lack of surface tension, compressed carbon dioxide can penetrate dense material and act as a powerful solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. It is a green, non-toxic, low cost, and readily available technology with a low critical point (7.38&#x000a0;MPa, 31.1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) which is compatible with delicate biological tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, multiple studies looking for an alternative to chemical and enzymatic processes, recently showed that mammalian tissues can be successfully decellularized with scCO<sub>2</sub>, providing ECM scaffolds with improved mechanical properties that could be used to promote cell growth and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularization is a time-efficient approach, tissues were&#x000a0;processed in a matter of hours and simultaneously sterilized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, we hypothesized that the scCO<sub>2</sub> approach for decellularizing plant tissue could be a promising alternative to the standard method of chemical processing. Herein, we developed and evaluated the efficiency of scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularization protocols on baby spinach leaves. We assessed the biochemical and biophysical properties of the resulting scaffolds and compared our results to those of chemically treated leaves. Finally, normal human skin cells were seeded on the scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularized scaffolds to investigate biocompatibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effectiveness of spinach leaf decellularization by scCO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="Par8">Co-solvents have been&#x000a0;commonly used with scCO<sub>2</sub> to coax along the reaction and improve the decellularization efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Using scCO<sub>2</sub> parameters of 17.23&#x000a0;MPa at 33&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;h, 75% ethanol alone as a co-solvent was first assessed for its ability to remove vegetal content from spinach leaves. Results found that the remaining plant material was still very green in color (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), demonstrating an incomplete decellularization and confirmed by DNA and protein content analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Next, we tested commonly known chemical decellularization agents, including SDS and sodium hypochlorite. While successful with plant content removal in chemical decellularization, these compounds do not dissolve in scCO<sub>2</sub> and, not surprisingly, were found to be ineffective for enhancement of scCO<sub>2</sub> processing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, we investigated weak base co-solvents peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), both individually and in combination. These formulations were found to be visually more effective at removing plant content based on the lack of chlorophyll in the resulting scaffolds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). DNA and protein content analysis further confirmed this observation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Processing with 2% PAA in 75% ethanol was the most effective co-solvent, showing 10.67&#x000a0;ng of DNA and 1.51&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of protein per mg of plant tissue when compared to a fresh spinach leaf with 636.09&#x000a0;ng of DNA and 47.80&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of protein per mg of plant tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We also applied this scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularization processing to other plant tissues. Mint leaves (<italic>Mentha x suavis)</italic>, parsley stems (<italic>Petroselinum crispum)</italic> and celery stalks (<italic>Apium graveoleans)</italic> were each successfully decellularized suggesting widespread use of our technique for different type of vegetal material (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). As the most effective co-solvent, 2% PAA was selected to be used for all scCO<sub>2</sub> investigations performed in this study. Moreover, to remove the remaining scaffold debris and generate a clear scaffold for immunofluorescent imaging, an additional decoloring step with sodium hypochlorite was performed. The colorless scaffolds were used for assessment in our biophysical, biochemical and biocompatibility investigation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularization of spinach leaf.

Epidermal plant cell walls, guard cells of the stomata and tissue of vascular bundle structures, previously hidden by the fullness of the fresh leaf, became visible. Moreover, the scCO<sub>2</sub> treatment preserved the architecture and microtopographic features of plant scaffold, similar to results seen in chemically treated scaffolds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Cross-section SEM imaging further showed the extent of decellularization and the preservation of the internal porous structure with scaffold pores maintained their hierarchical shape and size, suggesting that scCO<sub>2</sub> treatment may not affect the porosity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). To confirm this assumption, the water retention properties of the two scaffolds were then compared (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) and results showed that the scCO<sub>2</sub> and chemically scaffolds can indeed retain a similar amount of water (14.81 and 14.50&#x000a0;mg of water per mg of plant tissue respectively).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Scaffold structure after decellularization.

In this study, we showed that scCO<sub>2</sub> is also a successful approach to decellularize plant material. Using moderate pressure and a PAA entrainer, the dissolving power of the fluid effectively removed plant cellular content to generate a biocompatible scaffold in mere hours. The gold standard chemical processing of plant material decellularization is time-consuming, taking several days (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

This process is followed by 1&#x02013;2 additional days of decoloring and sterilization in hypochlorite solution and followed by subsequent washes with DI water. Additional freeze-drying or sterilization steps can also be performed. scCO<sub>2</sub> processing streamlines this lengthy process and achieves the same result in less than 1/5 the time on average (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Time comparison of the scCO<sub>2</sub> and traditional chemical decellularization techniques. *device preparation and decompression time included.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_83250_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">Further, plant scaffolds must be sterilized before introduction to cell culture environments. Sodium hypochlorite, UV radiation or ethanol methods have been previously employed.

Similarly, PAA has long been used to disinfect medical equipment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Its low molecular weight allows PAA to rapidly dissolve into the compressed CO<sub>2</sub> and enhance the solvent power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. PAA rapidly degrades into acetic acid and water which eliminates the formation of a toxic residue. Interestingly, scCO<sub>2</sub> with PAA additives has also been shown to synergistically inactive bacterial spores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Therefore, our approach using scCO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;PAA may have the unique ability to simultaneously perform decellularization with sterilization. To demonstrate this capability on plant scaffolds, we aseptically opened our tubes containing scCO<sub>2</sub> processed leaf scaffolds and incubated them in various bacterial broths. After 72&#x000a0;h, bacterial growth was&#x000a0;not observed (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) compared to a fresh leaf which displayed high turbidity. While scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularization/sterilization of plant tissue should be validated using a variety of microorganisms, this technique shows great promise for one-step decellularization/sterilization.</p><p id="Par20">The hypothesis that scCO<sub>2</sub> achieves decellularization by high pressure bursting of cell membranes is not widely accepted and has been largely disproven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Instead, pressure allows CO<sub>2</sub> to dissolve into the liquid phase and facilitates the conditions for the fluid to penetrate the plant cell wall, through the cell membrane and, once inside of the cell, act as a powerful solvent. This mass transfer of scCO<sub>2</sub> lowers the intracellular pH by the formation of carbonic acid, enhanced in our case by the presence of PAA, leading to the disruption of cell metabolism and the removal of essential enzymes without compromising the overall scaffold structure. Evidence for this mechanism of action is seen in the preserved plant cell architecture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) where intact cell walls and vascular networks of scCO<sub>2</sub> scaffolds were visualized. Due to some leakage, the scCO<sub>2</sub> vascular preservation appears to be superior to the chemical scaffold. While this may vary from leaf to leaf, recall that ionic detergents like SDS are known to degrade proteins and damage scaffold ultrastructure. However, our AFM study of the microscale stiffness found that the scCO<sub>2</sub> processed scaffolds were less stiff than the chemically processed scaffolds. While this difference was not significant, AFM technology only represents nanomechanical measurements, and bulk mechanical properties of the scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularized scaffolds must also be investigated. With a limited dataset, we performed preliminary bulk tensile measurements and found that the tangent modulus and the ultimate tensile strength of scCO<sub>2</sub> decellularized scaffolds were lower than chemically treated scaffolds (data not shown). While these results require further validation, this may suggest that decellularized scaffolds are indeed softer after scCO<sub>2</sub> treatment and could be difficult to manipulate. However, we also hypothesize that this may vary from plant to plant and the decellularization method should be carefully selected according to the type of material, viscoelastic properties, desired use and measured outcome.</p><p id="Par21">In addition, UATR-FTIR was a highly sensitive technique used to demonstrate the biochemical differences between decellularized scaffolds. As expected, results showed the presence of common plant macromolecules in both scaffolds such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin or pectin, yet the presence of wax substances was unexpected. We hypothesized the outer wax cuticle was removed during decellularization. Moreover, within each group, a high variability was found. The source of such variability could be from the decellularization process or the result of plant variation. Indeed, plants display high inter- and intra-variation stemming from both genetic and environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.
