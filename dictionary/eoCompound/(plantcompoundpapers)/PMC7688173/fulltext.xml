Our investigations showed that GlcCer stimulates the early accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide radicals. In addition, the expression of PR-1 (pathogenesis-related 1, with suggested antifungal action), PR-2 (&#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase), PR-3 (Chitinase), PR-5 (Osmotin), PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), LOX (Lipoxygenase) and POX (Peroxidase) genes was highly induced after treatment of tobacco plants with GlcCer and induction levels remained high throughout a period of 6 to 120 hours.

Species belonging to the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> complex (FOSC) can affect a wide range of plants, including annual and perennial dicotyledons and monocotyledons [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242887.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Field losses associate to FOSC have a high impact and rank 5th in a list of the top 10 plant pathogens of scientific / economic importance [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Cerebrosides or monohexosylceramides (CMH) are neutral glycosphingolipids that contain a monosaccharide, usually glucose or galactose, in 1-ortho-betaglycosidic linkage with a ceramide. Studies show that cerebrosides are capable of conferring tolerance to injuries caused by cold in wheat roots by modulating the lipid composition of the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, Umemura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Naveen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] also report <italic>Fusarium</italic> cerebroside as an important elicitor, since it confers resistance to several plant species that are affected by fusariosis. Despite important discoveries by both groups, there are still few publications investigating the role of the cerebroside as an elicitor and none of them report an antiviral effect associate to it elicitation.</p><p>Systemic acquired resistance, known as SAR, is a broad-spectrum long-lasting defense where infection by a pathogen at a primary site can induce the defense of distal tissues against various types of pathogens. The inducible defense mechanisms that are activated upon pathogen attack include reinforcement of the cell wall involving callose deposition, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accumulation of secondary metabolites like, and phenolic compounds, and the production of so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Reimer-Michalski and Conrath [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] report that SAR is a great promise for sustainable agriculture because plant immune responses have broad-spectrum activity lasting for days or months and do not considerably affect plant fitness.</p><p><italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV), a notorious plant pathogen that caused serious economic losses worldwide, has a wide host range consisting of more than 885 plant species belonging to 65 families [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plants infected by TMV may present leaves mosaic or mottling, necrosis, stunting, leaf curling, and yellowing of plant tissues. The stunting is usually related to infection occurring early during the planting season and leads to great economic losses. TMV shows worldwide distribution in temperate and tropical regions. There are no known vectors and transmission occurs by mechanical contact. The virus can remain in plant residues, soil and water for long periods. A few effective antiviral agents against TMV and other plant viruses were described [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], despite intense research using synthetic and natural compounds looking for this goal [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Between 2012&#x02013;2015, around 264 compounds were tested aiming to achieve anti-TMV protection, including seven from fungi origin [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of GlcCer species isolated and purified from the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> cell wall on the induction of resistance against TMV infection in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> cv Xanthi plants.

Three molecular species of GlcCer were identified by mass spectrometry in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> with <italic>m/z</italic> 760, 776 and 790, containing the long chain base, 9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine, linked by amide bond to 2-hydroxyoctadecenoic acid (C18: 1 OH), 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (C18: OH) and 2-hydroxyeicosanoic acid (C20: OH), respectively. These structures are similar to those found in other fungi [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242887.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], such as <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>Scedosporium</italic> species, evidencing the conserved characteristic of this molecule in the different fungi studied. Long chain base (9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine) and hydroxylated fatty acids are present in all of these fungi and the difference between these molecules occurs in relation to the unsaturation and size of the fatty acid chain [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of this molecule in crucial processes for fungal cells, such as cell differentiation, growth and viability [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], what may explain why these glycosphingolipids are highly conserved among different species.</p><p>Research shows that other substances have already been used as inducers of resistance against TMV, as is the case of Munronin O, isolated from the <italic>Munronia henryi</italic> Harms plant, that presented curative, protective and inactivating activities of TMV greater than those of ningnanmycin [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Zhao and collaborators also showed that the application of fatty acids (oleic acid) can increase resistance against TMV and the antiviral activity can be attributed to activated expressions of a series of defense-related genes as performed in our work [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Umemura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] purified cerebroside C from various strains of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. This molecule corresponds to N-2'-hydroxyoctadecenoic-1-&#x003b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine described in our work. Here, however, we characterize also two more cerebroside, N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoic -1-&#x003b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-4-hydroxy- 4,8-sphingadienine and N-2'-hydroxyeicosanoyl-1-&#x003b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine. A 2-hydroxyeicosanoic acid (C20: OH) fatty acid is described for the first time in <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> GlcCer isolated in the present work.</p><p>Analyzing the impact of the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> cerebroside GlcCer species treatment in tobacco plants, we assessed the effect on the production of phenolic compounds. Our results indicated that GlcCer species can induce the production of phenolic compounds in tobacco plants in a time-dependent manner. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites synthesized along the phenylpropanoid pathway. Polyphenols are found abundantly in a wide variety of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, seeds and cereals, and in beverages, such as wine. They are currently a topic of great scientific attention due to the interest in their potential health benefits. In addition, the class of flavonoids and isoflavonoids can also act as phytoalexins due to their antifungal and antibacterial effect [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>According to Heller and Tudzynski [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], reactive oxygen species play a fundamental role in the interactions between pathogens and plants and it is one of the first events that occur in the recognition of a pathogen by the plant. Besides its direct antimicrobial effect, ROS generation is also involved in cell signaling associated with the expression of genes related to pathogenesis (PR), hypersensitivity response (HR) and also to the development of SAR [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242887.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In 2010, Kim and collaborators reported that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> plants that overexpressed the RCI3 gene, which encodes peroxidase, had an increase in the production of ROS in the roots when these plants had a low potassium availability [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, Choi and collaborators also demonstrated that the overexpression of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> CapO2 gene, which encodes an extracellular peroxidase in pepper, increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in response to infection by the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To investigate GlcCer species ability to induce ROS synthesis, we evaluated the generation of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase gene expression in tobacco plants. Treatment with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> GlcCer species was able to induce the production of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as detected by histochemical assays. The largest accumulation occurred after 6 h and coincides with the peak of POX expression, as shown by RT-qPCR.</p><p>Umemura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] demonstrated that treatment of lettuce, tomato, melon and sweet potato plants with a fungal cerebroside was able to induce the production of ROS and the expression of PR <italic>genes</italic> protecting these plants against <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> infection. In addition, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] demonstrated that the PeBA1 protein extracted from <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> was able to protect <italic>N</italic>. <italic>tabacum</italic> plants against TMV infection, demonstrating the activity of a molecule of bacterial origin against a viral disease. The results observed here show for the first time that a fungal GlcCer can act as possible antiviral agent in plants. GlcCer species treatment of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>tabacum</italic> cv Xanthi plants induced a minimum of 42.8% reduction in the number of necrotic lesions when compared to the control. A 75% reduction was detected in younger leaves, indicating the anti-viral potential of GlcCer species.</p><p>Elicitation of defense in plants generally is associated to the induction of SAR. Among the genes commonly induced during SAR establishment, increased PR1 expression is recognized as one of the main markers of SAR [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242887.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The silencing of PR1 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> led to a greater susceptibility to <italic>Phytophthora parasitic</italic> oomycete infection while <italic>N</italic>. <italic>tabacum</italic> plants that shown PR1 gene overexpression showed an increased resistance against <italic>Phytophthora parasitic</italic> and <italic>Peronospora tabacina</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242887.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here, it was possible to observe that the <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression is highly induced over various times tested, thus indicating the activation of SAR. The two genes encoding for enzymes with antifungal action such as <italic>PR3</italic> (chitinase) and <italic>PR2</italic> (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-(1,3) glucanase), presented a similar expression profile, with increased expression between 6 and 24 h.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the establishment of SAR is mediated by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) in tissues distal to the site of infection, and this accumulation is responsible for triggering the defense response pathway. In tobacco, the main pathway of salicylic acid synthesis is through the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is mediated by the action of the PAL enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The increased expression of this gene is associated with the rapid accumulation of SA [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our results showed that PAL activity increased rapidly in the treated plants. PAL is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the metabolism of phenylpropanoids. PAL activity reached its first peak in the first six hours, followed by a gradual increase with 24 and 96 hours after elicitation.</p><p>All plant defense related genes studied in this work showed a strong increase in their expression in the period of up to 6 h after GlcCer species treatment, with exception of the gene encoding peroxidase (<italic>POX</italic>), which had a significant increase earlier, after 3 h. These data suggest not only the establishment of SAR but also indicate the rapid development of this response.</p><p>The high expression of almost all genes tested, was detected following a period of basal expression or even repression. We hypothesize that these findings could be correlated with the circadian cycle. NPR1 protein plays an essential role in the transcription of genes related to the circadian cycle and is also involved in the development of plant defense responses and the establishment of SAR [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242887.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These dynamics between the expression of defense genes and the relationship with the circadian cycle may be related to the results reported above.</p><p>Our results are in agreement with those described by Naveen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], where the defense mechanisms of pepper plants (<italic>Capsicum annum</italic>) are induced after treatment with a cerebroside extracted from <italic>Colletotrichum capsici</italic>, a pepper phytopathogen. This molecule was able to induce the initial accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and increased the production of the enzymes PAL, POX and LOX. In addition, it was able to protect the plant against infection by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>capsici</italic>. Studies by Umemura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] also demonstrated that cerebrosides extracted from <italic>Magnaporthe grisea</italic> are involved in the production of phytoalexins and PR proteins in rice leaves. In field experiments, the cerebroside elicitors effectively protected rice plants against the rice blast fungus, an economically devastating agent of disease of rice in Japan. The cerebrosides also protected rice plants from other diseases. These compounds occur in a wide range of different phytopathogens and act as general elicitors in a wide variety of rice-pathogen interactions [<xref rid="pone.0242887.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>According to the results described in this work, it is possible to suggest that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>oxysporum</italic> glucosylceramide is a strong inducer of systemic acquired resistance witch consequently induces a high antiviral status in the treated plants. The protective effect observed after treatment is quite expressive and indicates that this treatment could induces tolerance for other plant infectious virus. New experiments must be performed to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0242887.s001"><label>S1 Raw images</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0242887.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Centro de Espectrometria de Massas de Biomol&#x000e9;culas (CEMBIO) from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro for ESI-MS analysis.
