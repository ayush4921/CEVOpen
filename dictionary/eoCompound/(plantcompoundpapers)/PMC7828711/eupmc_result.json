As a result of the joint application of these compounds, a higher photosynthetic rate, a higher accumulation of both photosynthesis-related compounds and pigments, total proteins, and a change in the status of nutrients were obtained. Particularly, the decrease in content of calcium, chloride and sulphate in plants under heat stress is ameliorated by the ammonium effect. Additionally, it is important to highlight that cauliflower waste contains a higher content of mineral nutrients than floret cauliflower. These effects were more marked in young leaves. Furthermore, a synergistic effect for coping with heat stress between the polyamine and the nutritional treatment was observed. For this, both the application of putrescine and the feeding of plants with a 50:50 NO<sub>3</sub>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <sup>-</sup>/NH<sub>4</sub>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <sup>+</sup> ratio before heat stress is proposed for the first time as an agricultural practice for increasing the thermotolerance of cauliflower cv Moonshine. On the other hand, due to the lower lipid peroxidation rate obtained in cauliflower leaves, these plants could be used for health purposes as ointments or other nutraceutical products, making the cultivation of this kind of cruciferous more sustainable."
