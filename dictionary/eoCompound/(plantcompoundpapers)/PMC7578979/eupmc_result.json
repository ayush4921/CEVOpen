    "PlantCrystals are obtained by milling plant material to sizes <10 µm. Due to the disruption of the plant cells, active compounds are easily released, rendering the PlantCrystal technology an effective and low-cost process for the production of environmentally friendly plant extracts. The extracts can be used to produce phytomedicines, nutritional supplements or cosmetic products. Previous studies could already demonstrate the use of PlantCrystals to improve the antimicrobial or antifungal activity of different plants. This study investigated whether PlantCrystal technology is suitable to produce plant derived formulations with high antioxidant capacity. The study also aimed to identify the most suitable production methods for this.<h4>Methods</h4>Various plant materials and parts of plants, i.e., seeds, leaves and flowers, and different methods were employed for the production. PlantCrystals were characterized regarding size, physical stability and antioxidant capacity (AOC).<h4>Results</h4>PlantCrystals with particles <1 µm were produced from the different plant materials. Both production methods, i.e., high-pressure homogenization, bead milling or the combination of both were suitable to obtain PlantCrystals. Nano milling of the plant material greatly affected their AOC and resulted in formulations with distinctly higher AOC when compared to classical extracts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rendering plant material into small sized particles is highly effective to obtain plant extracts with high biological efficacy."
