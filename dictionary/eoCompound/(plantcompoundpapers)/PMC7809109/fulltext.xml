We examined relationships between an endangered subspecies of the butterfly <italic>Euphydryas editha</italic> (Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot) and three host plant species. Two of the hosts (<italic>Castilleja hispida, Castilleja levisecta</italic>) were used ancestrally while the other, <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic>, is exotic and was adopted more recently. We measured oviposition preference, neonate preference, larval growth, and secondary chemical uptake on all three hosts. Adult females readily laid eggs on all hosts but favored <italic>Plantago</italic> and tended to avoid <italic>C. levisecta.</italic> Oviposition preference changed over time. Neonates had no preference among host species, but consistently chose bracts over leaves within both <italic>Castilleja</italic> species. Larvae developed successfully on all species and grew to similar size on all of them unless they ate only <italic>Castilleja</italic> leaves (rather than bracts) which limited their growth. Diet strongly influenced secondary chemical uptake by larvae. Larvae that ate <italic>Plantago</italic> or <italic>C. hispida</italic> leaves contained the highest concentrations of iridoid glycosides, and iridoid glycoside composition varied with host species and tissue type. Despite having largely switched to a novel exotic host and generally performing better on it, this population has retained breadth in preference and ability to use other hosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Community ecology</kwd><kwd>Conservation biology</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary ecology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>DEB 1556106</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The spread of exotic organisms results in novel species interactions that can produce evolutionary changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. One increasingly common set of interactions occurs when native herbivorous insects encounter and utilize exotic plant species. From the perspective of a specialist herbivore, there can be a range of ecological and evolutionary consequences for adopting a new host. These consequences can include changes to abundance, range, morphology, phenology, voltinism, diet preference, and even the development of new host-specific ecotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par3">Novel interactions between herbivores and plants, and their evolutionary consequences, can intersect with and complicate conservation efforts. Conservation of herbivorous insects, such as endangered butterflies, often hinges on understanding relationships with host plants, as host suitability varies within and among plant species and suitable hosts can be rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. When butterflies of conservation concern begin ovipositing on an exotic species, is the new resource an asset or a liability? Some studies have demonstrated an immediate risk of an ecological trap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, in which eggs are laid on the exotic species but survival is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Others have shown that the butterfly successfully adopts its new host, either by adapting to it or because of ecological fitting, as when the new host is suitable given the butterfly&#x02019;s previous adaptations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, when a new host is successfully adopted it can result in lost adaptation to ancestral hosts, both in terms of adult preference and larval ability to develop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In such circumstances, it is possible for a longer-term trap to arise in which a population adapts to selective pressure from the new host, but in so doing loses its ability to persist over the longer term because it becomes a poor fit for its former host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">An iconic group of organisms that exist at the intersection of these issues and exemplify their complexity are checkerspots in the genus <italic>Euphydryas</italic> (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Several taxa within this group have incorporated the exotic species <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic> into their diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Probably the best studied checkerspot in North America is Edith&#x02019;s checkerspot, <italic>E. editha</italic>, which is composed of multiple subspecies, several of which have declined and are listed under the US Endangered Species Act<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These butterflies and their relatives have been models for understanding population ecology, rapid evolution of host plant affiliations, and chemical ecology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Ironically, despite being heavily researched, these organisms can be perplexing to conserve; variability in host plant affiliations within and among subspecies and populations complicates recovery efforts.</p><p id="Par5">Checkerspots affiliate with several plant taxa that produce iridoid glycosides (hereafter IGs). At the species level, <italic>E. editha</italic> is not very host-specific and uses a wide range of IG-producing plants, but individual populations are often monophagous with host- and location-specific adaptations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Host plant preference in this species is heritable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and can evolve quickly in response to shifts in availability of host resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Divergent specialization can also occur within populations, such that subgroups within populations differ in adult oviposition preference for, and larval performance on, one host or another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The iridoid glycosides found in checkerspot host plants likely serve as an oviposition cue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and larvae sequester them in their hemolymph, making them unpalatable to predators through the adult stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Herbivores that sequester IGs from plants take up different sets of compounds, in varying concentrations, depending on which plant species they eat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> or according to the tissue type or ontogenetic stage consumed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These differences in what and how much they sequester can in turn influence their interactions with higher trophic levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot (<italic>Euphydryas editha taylori</italic>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B) is one of the endangered subspecies of <italic>E. editha</italic> and is endemic to grasslands of the Pacific Northwest in North America. It was listed under the US Endangered Species Act in 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Its interactions with host plants are poorly understood, with knowledge gaps delaying recovery efforts and hampering grassland conservation practices in the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Formerly quite common, Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot existed in metapopulations made up of dense, sedentary colonies occurring in grasslands. At the time of listing, it had declined to only 10 populations, mostly in Washington state, USA. Its decline is thought to be a result of habitat loss, disruption of historic fire regimes, and lost metapopulation dynamics as individual populations disappeared<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot (<bold>A</bold>) adult and (<bold>B</bold>) larvae, and host plants (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>Castilleja hispida,</italic> (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>Castilleja levisecta</italic>, and (<bold>E</bold>) <italic>Plantago lanceolata.</italic> (<bold>F</bold>) Closeup of <italic>C. hispida</italic> illustrating the contrast between leaf and bract tissues.

Most remaining Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot populations have incorporated <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic> (hereafter, <italic>Plantago</italic>; Plantaginaceae) into their diet (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). <italic>Plantago</italic> is thought to have been introduced to North America about 200&#x000a0;years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

While <italic>Plantago</italic> cannot have been an ancestral host plant for Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot<italic>,</italic> it was the first documented host and some populations used it as early as the late nineteenth century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">This study focuses on the last naturally occurring Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot population in lowland habitats of southwest Washington State, USA. The specific history of host plant use by this population is unknown, but when it was discovered in 2003 the butterflies were reliant on <italic>Plantago.</italic> A very small number of <italic>C. hispida</italic> were also present at the site and may have been used, but these were only sufficient for&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1% of the population to use for oviposition. In recent years, more <italic>C. hispida</italic> was introduced to the site in low densities and larvae now feed on both species (M. Linders, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, personal communication). Recovery efforts involve a captive rear-and-release program in which offspring of individuals sourced from this population are reared (on <italic>Plantago</italic>) and released at other potentially suitable sites in the region. These sites vary in several respects, including abundance of potential hosts (<italic>C. hispida, C. levisecta, Plantago</italic>), and therefore, from a conservation standpoint, it is important to know whether Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot has retained its ability to use other host species or whether it is now better adapted to <italic>Plantago</italic>.</p><p id="Par10">Host plant affinities are multidimensional and can include female decisions of where to oviposit, innate neonate preference for where to forage, and larval performance when feeding on one host plant or another. Previous work with this population suggests that females prefer to oviposit on either <italic>Castilleja</italic> species over <italic>Plantago</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, but that survival rates of early-instar larvae in the field are highest on <italic>Plantago,</italic> intermediate on <italic>C. hispida</italic>, and lowest on <italic>C. levisecta</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup><italic>. Plantago</italic> and <italic>Castilleja</italic> spp. also have contrasting architectures, leading to differences in resource distribution and larval feeding behavior: <italic>Plantago</italic> forms a low rosette, while both <italic>Castilleja</italic> species are oriented vertically with leaves toward the base and, later in the spring, flowers subtended by showy bracts toward the top (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). We have generally observed that Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot lay their eggs toward the base of <italic>Castilleja</italic> plants, but larvae move toward the apex and are often seen eating bracts and flowers rather than the lower leaves where eggs are placed (Haan, pers. obs.). The bracts and flowers are younger than the lower leaves and may also differ chemically; in other <italic>Castilleja</italic> species there are strong differences among tissues in the presence and abundance of IG compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">We used a laboratory study to examine how adopting a novel host may have influenced host plant preference and performance within this population of Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot. Although it has shifted largely to feeding on <italic>Plantago</italic>, we wanted to know if it has retained a preference for and ability to develop on its ancestral <italic>Castilleja</italic> hosts. We also tested for within-population differences in host plant specialization, which would be evidenced by correlations between maternal preference, neonate preference, and larval performance on a given species. Our specific objectives were to: (1) quantify oviposition preference among the three host species; (2) quantify neonate preference among the three host species and between bract and leaf tissue within each <italic>Castilleja</italic> species<italic>;</italic> (3) compare growth among larvae raised on each species and between larvae that fed on different <italic>Castilleja</italic> tissue types; (4) test if secondary chemical uptake depends on which species and/or tissue type larvae eat; (5) test for correlations between maternal and neonate preference for each host plant species and whether either type of preference for a given species is correlated with mass gain on that species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Butterfly collection and rearing</title><p id="Par12">Butterflies used in this study were second-generation captives originating from the last extant population of <italic>E. e. taylori</italic> in the South Puget Sound region, on an active artillery impact area at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, USA. At this site, butterflies oviposit and larvae feed primarily on <italic>Plantago,</italic> but occasionally on <italic>C. hispida</italic> as well. Butterflies were collected from the field in 2016 and allowed to oviposit in the lab; the eggs were then deployed for a field study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In late winter 2017, we collected surviving larvae from the field study after they emerged from diapause. These larvae fed on <italic>Plantago</italic> during early instars in the field, and we continued to feed them this species until pupation. In the lab, larvae were reared in containers with other members of their sibling group. After eclosion, male and female butterflies were separated, and females (one per sibling group) were mated to non-sibling males using methods described by Barclay et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Mesh was tented with bamboo stakes and held to the pot with a rubber band. The host plants were grown from seed in greenhouses at the University of Washington Center for Urban Horticulture the previous year, then stored outdoors over winter and transplanted so all three species shared a pot (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;42 pots) in spring 2017. The growing medium in each pot was covered in a layer of pea gravel. At the beginning of each choice trial, a mated female butterfly was placed on a cotton swab soaked in dilute honey solution and introduced to a screened-in pot while it was feeding, with the swab placed upright between the three plants. Pots were placed under full spectrum lighting in the lab, or when possible, in direct sunlight outdoors, until either one day had elapsed or we observed that the butterfly had laid eggs. At this point the butterfly was fed and introduced to a new enclosure using the same methods. After each choice trial, we inspected all leaves of all plants in the pot and removed leaves where eggs had been laid. Pots were re-cycled for trials with other individuals until&#x02009;~&#x02009;20% of leaves had been removed from a plant. In all, 122 oviposition choice trials were made (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.2 choices per individual, range&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02013;8). We quantified preference as the number of eggs laid. Checkerspots oviposit in clutches of varying size and preference can also be quantified in terms of number of egg clusters laid rather than individual eggs. We focus on number of eggs laid because we suspected the number of eggs per cluster would be confounded with plant species due to differences in architecture (<italic>Castilleja</italic> have smaller leaves which could lead butterflies to lay fewer eggs per cluster and more clusters overall). However, we also report the proportion of clusters laid on each species and results were qualitatively very similar (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x0201d;).</p><p id="Par14">Eggs were stored in 60&#x000a0;mL plastic containers lined with paper towel and with perforated lids until they neared hatching (indicated by darkening). At this time, clusters were separated into smaller groups with a fine-tipped paintbrush so they could be allocated to either neonate choice trials (Objective 2) or no-choice feeding trials (Objectives 3 and 4).</p><p id="Par15">We analyzed oviposition preference at both the population and individual level. For the population-level assessment, we assigned each butterfly to the host species it laid the most eggs on, and used a chi-square test to evaluate whether the number of individuals preferring each species differed. For the individual-level assessment, we began by visually comparing the data for overall oviposition patterns among matrilines and then tested if preference among hosts changed over time using binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with each oviposition trial as a replicate (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;122). We included random effects for the matriline and for the pot used in the trial since individuals made multiple choices and pots were re-cycled. We tested each plant species separately. For each species, the response was the number of eggs laid on that species compared to the other species. We carried out these and all other statistical analyses in R version 3.6.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and used the <italic>lme4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> package for all mixed models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objective 2: neonate choice trials</title><p id="Par16">Twenty-one of the 29 butterflies produced enough viable eggs to be used in neonate choice trials (3 sets of trials x minimum of 3 eggs per trial&#x02009;=&#x02009;9 eggs required).

We used groups of eggs rather than individual eggs because larvae are gregarious during early instars. We cut 6&#x000a0;mm diameter leaf discs from each plant species (field collected, see below) using an office hole puncher and arranged the discs around each cluster of eggs so that newly hatched larvae had equal access to all discs.

Checkerspots seem to illustrate ecological fitting, as they are broadly pre-adapted to <italic>Plantago</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Na&#x000ef;ve larvae are often immediately able to develop on it, although in at least some cases adults initially reject it as an oviposition plant and preference for it must evolve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A number of additional factors complement this close ecological fit and help explain why checkerspots repeatedly adopt <italic>Plantago</italic> and often perform well on it. <italic>Plantago</italic> can be very abundant in disturbed herbaceous habitats. In the case of Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot it is not only very easy to find but is also more phenologically available than native hosts because it senesces later<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Finally, the iridoid glycosides that <italic>Plantago</italic> produces, aucubin and catalpol, are already present in both <italic>Castilleja</italic> species investigated here, indicating that shifting from <italic>Castilleja</italic> to <italic>Plantago</italic> does not require metabolic adjustments as might be needed if a herbivore encountered a novel host containing new IG compounds. These two compounds are also common across other checkerspot hosts such as <italic>Chelone glabra</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, the ancestral host of <italic>E. phaeton</italic> in Eastern North America. Many populations of this butterfly have also adopted <italic>Plantago</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">Although successful adoption of novel host plants can result in loss of adaptation to ancestral ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, that was not the case here. The population we studied was almost entirely restricted to using <italic>Plantago</italic>, yet our results show that it has retained a breadth of oviposition and neonate feeding preferences. These findings contrast with outcomes for another <italic>E. editha</italic> population (subspecies <italic>monoensis</italic>) located about 900&#x000a0;km south of the one we studied, in Nevada, USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This population historically fed on <italic>Collinsia parviflora</italic> but switched to feeding entirely on <italic>Plantago</italic> over the course of three decades and lost the preference for its traditional host. The lost adaptation was this population&#x02019;s downfall; it went extinct when <italic>Plantago</italic> became unavailable due to changes in agricultural management, despite <italic>Collinsia</italic> remaining available for oviposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. There could be several plausible reasons why our study population did not lose adaptation to ancestral hosts. First, we do not know when our study population incorporated <italic>Plantago</italic> into its diet. This population could be derived partly or wholly from ancestors that adopted <italic>Plantago</italic> more than a century ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, or the switch could be very recent (there could also be a history of repeated switches). If the switch occurred recently, loss of adaptation to <italic>Castilleja</italic> could still be in progress. Second, when the now-extinct Nevada population switched from <italic>Collinsia</italic> to <italic>Plantago</italic> it did so in the face of an evolutionary tradeoff in which butterflies experienced higher fecundity but slower development on <italic>Plantago</italic>, making for a poorer phenological fit with <italic>Collinsia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup><italic>.</italic> We have not found evidence that Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot faces this sort of trade-off, so adding <italic>Plantago</italic> to its diet may not require losing adaptations to <italic>Castilleja</italic>. There is, however, some evidence that <italic>Plantago</italic> exerts selective pressure for larger clutch sizes, as larger sibling groups are more likely to survive to later instars on <italic>Plantago</italic> but not on <italic>Castilleja</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Variation in oviposition preference</title><p id="Par35">Oviposition preference varied considerably among individual butterflies. While some strongly preferred either <italic>Plantago</italic> or <italic>C. hispida</italic>, many spread their effort more evenly among all three species (i.e., the 8 individuals in the center section of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Oviposition preference also varied within individual butterflies over time, as the proportion of eggs laid on <italic>Plantago</italic> and <italic>C. hispida</italic> decreased and the proportion laid on <italic>C. levisecta</italic> increased. There are multiple potential explanations for this. First, ovipositing <italic>E. editha</italic> become less selective over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. However, if this was the only mechanism we would expect preference among the three species to become equal over time, and it did not. Second, butterflies may have innately avoided <italic>C. levisecta</italic> but learned and gradually accepted it over time&#x02014;although individuals of other <italic>E. editha</italic> subspecies do not appear to learn regarding oviposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Finally, the suitability and attractiveness of plants may have shifted over the course of the study, as we moved plants daily between full-spectrum artificial light and sunlight during the two-week oviposition period. IGs, nitrogen, and water content of <italic>Plantago</italic> can change over short time intervals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and relative attractiveness could also have changed over time as eggs were laid and leaves were removed, possibly inducing chemical responses in the plants. In light of these possibilities, we interpret oviposition patterns early in the study as being more indicative of preference in general. Field studies would be required to track oviposition over time and assess whether oviposition preference also varies in that context.</p><p id="Par36">Our findings regarding oviposition contrast with previous work in which the same population appeared to prefer either <italic>Castilleja</italic> species over <italic>Plantago</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This difference could be attributable to variation in host plant characteristics, to the smaller number of lineages used in the previous study (5), or to differences in methodology, as the earlier study used abdomen-curling behavior as a signal of host plant acceptance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> rather than quantifying oviposition per se.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Preference and performance</title><p id="Par37">We did not find evidence for links between adult oviposition preference and neonate feeding choices, and neither of these forms of preference predicted larval performance. We would have interpreted a significant correlation between preference for, and performance on, a given host species as evidence that subsets of the population had evolved different host plant specializations, but this possibility was not supported. However, the ordering of oviposition preference (<italic>Plantago</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>C. hispida</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>C. levisecta</italic>) <italic>did</italic> match the frequency of interaction Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot from this region probably had with these species over the last several decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and their survival rates on them in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In the field, both <italic>Castilleja</italic> species senesce before <italic>Plantago</italic> and early-instar larvae die in especially high numbers on <italic>C. levisecta</italic> as it begins to senesce in May and June<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In the present study we only fed non-senescent plants to larvae; the fact that they developed similarly on non-senescent <italic>C. levisecta</italic> as on other host species is more evidence that early senescence is the driving factor making <italic>C. levisecta</italic> less suitable in the field.</p><p id="Par38">Neonate choices were variable, but neonates did not express strong population-level preference among host species, and when they selected a certain species this did not correlate to better performance on that species by their siblings. However, they expressed strong preference between tissue types in <italic>Castilleja,</italic> choosing bracts over leaves. This choice appears adaptive since eating bracts resulted in higher mass gain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B). Neonates must choose which tissues to eat within a plant but are rarely required to choose among plant species (they typically remain on the natal plant until instar 2 or 3); this aligns with our finding that they strongly preferred the higher-quality tissue type within <italic>Castilleja</italic> but did not have strong preferences among species.</p><p id="Par39">In the field, eggs are typically laid on leaves toward the bottom of the stem, and larvae move to the plant apex by the second instar to feed on bract and flower tissues (although they still eat some lower leaves as well; Haan pers. obs.). It is counterintuitive that adults lay eggs on a tissue type that larvae avoid and that is nutritionally inferior, but they could be choosing oviposition sites to hide eggs from enemies, based on within-plant differences in secondary chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or based on abiotic conditions required for egg development.</p><p id="Par40">Larval growth varied among diets and over time. <italic>Castilleja</italic> bracts gave an early advantage to larvae, but by diapause, larvae that fed on <italic>Plantago</italic> had caught up and were similar in size (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B). This may have occurred because <italic>Castilleja</italic> bracts are soft and contain fewer trichomes (Haan pers. obs.), making them easy for early instars to eat quickly. We also noticed that larvae in the first and second instars ate entire <italic>Castilleja</italic> bracts but skeletonized the thicker <italic>Plantago</italic> leaves. However, during the third and fourth instars larvae were able to eat entire <italic>Plantago</italic> leaves rather than skeletonizing them and quickly made up for lost growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Iridoid glycoside uptake</title><p id="Par41">In general, overall IG concentrations in larvae were similar to those in previous studies of related taxa at similar ontogenetic stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Concentrations were highest when larvae ate <italic>Plantago</italic> or <italic>C. hispida</italic> leaves and lower if they ate <italic>C. hispida</italic> bracts or either tissue type of <italic>C. levisecta</italic>. This is consistent with data from individuals that fed on these species in a field setting: those that ate <italic>C. levisecta</italic> sequestered substantially less than those that ate the other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Since sequestered IGs are thought to deter natural enemies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, the reduced ability to sequester from <italic>C. levisecta</italic> could increase predation risk. Our results also indicate that intra-specific and intra-individual variation within <italic>C. hispida</italic> is important with respect to larval performance: larvae that fed only on <italic>C. hispida</italic> bracts grew larger but had lower IG concentrations than those that fed only on <italic>C. hispida</italic> leaves. In a field setting, larvae would be mobile and able to forage across both tissue types, perhaps optimizing larval performance and sequestration.</p><p id="Par42">Larvae carried distinct chemical fingerprints depending on their diet. If they ate <italic>Plantago,</italic> they contained aucubin and catalpol (the two IGs found in <italic>Plantago</italic>), while if they ate <italic>Castilleja</italic> they contained up to two additional compounds, macfadienoside and methyl shanziside (found in both <italic>Castilleja</italic> species). There were striking differences between larvae that ate different <italic>C. hispida</italic> tissues; they sequestered large amounts of macfadienoside when they ate leaves, but none if they ate bracts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). IGs can be spatially segregated among <italic>Castilleja</italic> tissues; for example, within <italic>Castilleja integra,</italic> macfadienoside is abundant throughout the plant but especially in leaves, methyl shanziside is much more common in leaves than in bracts or flowers, and catalpol dominates flowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">In previous work we found that greenhouse-grown <italic>C. levisecta</italic> produced largely aucubin, and <italic>E. editha</italic> larvae that ate it contained both aucubin and catalpol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>; this contrasts with our findings here. These differences in plant chemistry are likely because plants in the previous study were grown in the greenhouse, whereas plants used in the present study were field collected. Greenhouse grown plants are often lower in secondary compounds than those grown outside or collected from the wild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. It is also not known if the four compounds derived from <italic>Castilleja</italic> have different costs or benefits to specialist herbivores. Previous work with another IG specialist, the buckeye, <italic>Junonia coenia</italic> (Nymphalidae)<italic>,</italic> showed that aucubin and catalpol have positive synergistic effects on survival, growth, and sequestration rates but negative effects on immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The specific effects of macfadienoside and methyl shanziside on herbivores and their enemies have not been investigated. Given that amounts of these compounds in larvae differ sharply depending on host species and on tissue type eaten within <italic>Castilleja</italic> spp., they could have important implications for herbivore immune function and/or interactions with higher trophic levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Implications for conservation efforts</title><p id="Par44">Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot has been reduced to a very small number of populations that mostly rely on <italic>Plantago</italic>, and our data show that the population we studied prefers it and performs well on it. However, we also found that a preference for, and ability to develop on, other hosts continues to persist. While we did not directly assess genetic diversity, it seems that this relict population is well-suited for reintroductions to sites where host plant availability differs from the source site.</p><p id="Par45">Our results cast further doubt on the suitability of <italic>C. levisecta</italic> as a primary host plant for Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot in Washington lowlands<italic>.</italic> Although it was almost certainly an ancestral host, it is rare and may not have been used as frequently, at least during the last several decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Adults will oviposit on it but tend to favor other species and, although larvae do not innately avoid it, they have lower survival rates on it in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and sequester relatively lower concentrations of IGs from it. However, since <italic>C. levisecta</italic> does not appear to be especially attractive to ovipositing butterflies and larvae can successfully develop on it if needed, it could be acceptable as a secondary host plant and does not appear to pose undue risk to recovery efforts. Furthermore, given that <italic>E. editha</italic> host plant affiliations evolve rapidly, populations that are reintroduced where <italic>C. levisecta</italic> is the main available host might readily adapt to it.</p><p id="Par46">Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot host affiliations are not static; the patterns we documented in this study are likely to change in the future both for this population and for the reintroduced ones that are derived from it. While there may be uncertainty about relative suitability of host resources, the diversity in preference and performance we documented here is probably an asset. Management for Taylor&#x02019;s checkerspot should aim to maintain many populations using diverse host resources. Population-level differences in host specialization, if they occur, will help buffer against future changes and make recovery efforts more likely to succeed over the long term.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Victoria Fox and Alisha Orloff assisted with colony care and measurements; Adrian Carper and Megan Zabinski performed iridoid glycoside measurements.
