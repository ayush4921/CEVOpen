    "Kakadu plum (KP; <i>Terminalia ferdinandiana</i> Exell, Combretaceae) is an emergent indigenous fruit originating from Northern Australia, with valuable health and nutritional characteristics and properties (e.g., high levels of vitamin C and ellagic acid). In recent years, the utilization of handheld NIR instruments has allowed for the in situ quantification of a wide range of bioactive compounds in fruit and vegetables. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of a handheld NIR spectrophotometer to measure vitamin C and ellagic acid in wild harvested KP fruit samples. Whole and pureed fruit samples were collected from two locations in the Kimberley region (Western Australia, Australia) and were analysed using both reference and NIR methods. The standard error in cross validation (SECV) and the residual predictive deviation (RPD) values were 1.81% dry matter (DM) with an RPD of 2.1, and 3.8 mg g<sup>-1</sup> DM with an RPD of 1.9 for the prediction of vitamin C and ellagic acid, respectively, in whole KP fruit. The SECV and RPD values were 1.73% DM with an RPD of 2.2, and 5.6 mg g<sup>-1</sup> DM with an RPD of 1.3 for the prediction of vitamin C and ellagic acid, respectively, in powdered KP samples. The results of this study demonstrated the ability of a handheld NIR instrument to predict vitamin C and ellagic acid in whole and pureed KP fruit samples. Although the RPD values obtained were not considered adequate to quantify these bioactive compounds (e.g., analytical quantification), this technique can be used as a rapid tool to screen vitamin C in KP fruit samples for high and low quality vitamin C."
