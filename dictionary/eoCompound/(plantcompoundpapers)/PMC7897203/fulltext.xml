Population growth is leading to increased urbanization, and chronic disease prevalence associated with poor diet quality, malnutrition, and an aging population, among other factors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Human food and nutritional security are strongly dependent on sustainable crop production, food nutritional quality, and biodiversity, which in turn are reliant upon environmental health and adequate resources (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As the global climate changes, natural resources and biodiversity are declining (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This presents a challenge that requires evidence-based solutions to feed the growing global population, while meeting demands of changing environments and producing foods of high nutritional quality to support human health. Importantly, solutions should also be environmentally and economically sustainable.</p><p>Microgreens are an emerging horticultural food crop with potential to help address these challenges. They are the young and tender leafy greens of many vegetables, herbs, grains, and flowers from diverse plant families including Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Amaranthaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, and Lamiaceae (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). They contain the cotyledons (and hypocotyl if applicable), stems, and first true leaves and are harvested &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20 d after seedling emergence (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Research suggests they are of high nutritional quality, and can be sustainably produced and grown year-round in controlled environments with applications for urban agriculture, as well as in homes, restaurants, and schools (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Microgreens have gained popularity in culinary establishments as garnishes and are often referred to as &#x0201c;vegetable confetti&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;funfetti&#x0201d; due to their diverse colors, flavors, and textures. However, their potential for widespread application in agriculture, human health, and economic and environmental sustainability suggests that they can be viewed and utilized as a major vegetable food crop. We and others have demonstrated that microgreens are acceptable to consumers, but this is influenced by sensory perceptions, among other factors (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We also showed that although consumers are likely to purchase them, their intent was impacted by knowledge regarding microgreens including nutrition, availability/access, cost, and shelf-life/freshness (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Microgreens can be further integrated into the global food system to promote vegetable consumption, increase micronutrient and plant bioactive compound (or phytochemical) intake for the promotion of health, and to achieve specific health effects as functional foods. For this to occur, it is critical to elucidate and optimize their nutritional quality, confirm consumer acceptability, assess feasibility and tolerability of daily consumption, and evaluate impacts on human and population health, and economic and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Here, we report the metabolite and mineral contents of 6 microgreen species from 3 plant families (Brassicaceae: arugula, broccoli, and red cabbage; Amaranthaceae: red beet and red amaranth; and Fabaceae: pea). Metabolomics and ionomics were utilized to quantify differences in metabolites and minerals, respectively, among these microgreen species, and compared with their mature counterparts. Previous research evaluated micronutrient and bioactive compound contents (namely polyphenols and carotenoids) of various microgreen species. Some studies compared concentrations in microgreens with those in their mature counterparts, primarily through comparisons with concentrations provided in previous reports but with exceptions. To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive analysis of metabolites and minerals in these 6 microgreen species, with a direct comparison with their mature counterparts. Taken together, this research supports the high nutritional quality of microgreens including the extensive and diverse range of metabolites and minerals. This research also suggests the need for future work aimed at elucidating and optimizing their nutritional quality through agricultural practices, investigating the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of their nutrients and bioactive compounds, and exploring health effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Overview</title><p>This was a proof-of-concept study to test the hypothesis that microgreens have equivalent or higher metabolite (namely bioactive compounds) and mineral contents relative to their mature counterparts when grown in the same geographic location using conventional growing techniques. Botanically diverse species of commercial, human health, and consumer importance were investigated. The technical aspects of our experimental protocols are detailed in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Microgreen materials and growing conditions</title><p>Microgreens were grown at the Colorado State University (CSU) Horticulture Center in Fort Collins, CO, USA, as previously described (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The data from our ongoing microgreens research, including that of this present study, will inform future research aimed at evaluating the health impacts of microgreens. Therefore, we selected microgreen species based on previous research evaluating their consumer acceptance and sensory attributes, known nutritional characteristics, and potential for environmental sustainability and health impacts (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

Approximately 1.5-cm coir fiber (Botanicare COCOGRO) was used as the growing medium and layered in each standard 1020 black polystyrene germination tray (26.7 &#x000d7; 53 cm). Seeds were evenly sown at rates described in&#x000a0;<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, and trays were covered with black polyethylene sheets for 24&#x02013;48 h to increase the germination rate and maintain moisture. Seeds were irrigated twice each day with a hand pump spray and grown under light-emitting diode (LED) lamps (GreenPower LED production module; Philips). For each species, 8 replicates were grown and distributed in a randomized block design, where each tray represented 1 replication. Five of the most uniform trays were harvested 20 d after they were sown, except for peas, which were harvested after 10 d due to their faster growth rate. Each replicate was harvested with a sharp knife and its fresh weight was recorded. A total of 45 plant samples were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until processing.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Images of (A) arugula, (B) broccoli, (C) bull's blood beet; (D) red cabbage, (E) red garnet amaranth, and (F) tendril pea microgreens.

A total of 300 mg (&#x000b1;0.5 mg) of dry homogenized microgreen samples were weighed into 75-mL Teflon microwave vessels. Digestion was performed by adding 8 mL of redistilled concentrated nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) spiked with internal standard, indium (In, 562.5 ppb) followed by 2 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Ultrex, J.T.Baker; Avantor). Each vessel was left to react for 10 min prior to sealing to allow any prereactions to occur safely before being capped. Vessels were sealed with a vessel rupture disk and pressure seal and placed in a programmable Titan MPS microwave digestion system (PerkinElmer) and samples were digested following the program in <bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>. The Titan microwave digestion system can hold 16 samples and thus a blank sample was run with each batch. Upon completion of the digestion, all samples were diluted with MilliQ water (18.2 M&#x02126;) to a final volume of 15 mL. Samples were vortexed and subsequently 1 mL of sample was diluted to a final volume of 15 mL with MilliQ water.

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis and comparison of metabolites and minerals in these 6 microgreen species and their mature counterparts. Overall, the findings of this study support that microgreens have distinct metabolite and mineral profiles compared with one another and with their mature counterparts. Microgreens were found to have an extensive and diverse range of metabolites (including vitamins and bioactive compounds) and minerals, providing further evidence for their high nutritional quality. We found that several, but not all, metabolites and minerals were higher in microgreens compared with the mature counterparts. In fact, certain compounds were not different or lower in microgreens compared with their respective mature counterparts. We also found that each microgreen species had numerous metabolites that were unique to that species.</p><p>Increased concentrations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and &#x02265;2-fold higher) of metabolites in microgreens compared with mature counterparts were largely driven by compounds classified within the lipid and phenolic superclasses, followed by those in the alkaloid, organosulfur, vitamin, and amine superclasses, among others. In some cases, higher concentrations of compounds in microgreen species compared with the mature counterpart were paralleled by the compound being unique (modified <italic>z</italic>-score &#x0003e;1.96) to that specific microgreen species. For instance, arugula microgreens were uniquely high in numerous indoles, glucosinolates, prenylated xanthones, and certain flavonoids relative to other microgreens, and these were present in higher quantities in arugula microgreens compared with mature arugula. Glucosinolates are known to have bitter and acrid flavors (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Thus, these compounds are a likely contributor to our previous observation that consumers found arugula to be the least acceptable microgreen of the 6 studied (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and as having the highest intensity for astringency, bitterness, and sourness. Nonetheless, arugula microgreens were still considered acceptable among consumers, and high variability was noted in that study suggesting that many individuals liked arugula microgreens. This is favorable considering the beneficial health effects of glucosinolates (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), as well as other compounds in arugula like polyphenols (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Arugula was also found to be unique in containing vitamin K-1, but concentrations were not higher in the microgreens than mature arugula. Red cabbage microgreens were noted to be both unique in containing sinapine (hydrocinnamic acid/phenolic acid), and to contain higher concentrations of it than mature red cabbage. Sinapine has been reported to modulate circulating lipids, inflammation, and the gut microbiota in mice fed a high-fat diet (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and to attenuate mitochondrial oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), suggesting the potential of red cabbage microgreens to exert cardioprotective effects. Indeed, Huang et al. (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) demonstrated that red cabbage microgreens modulated circulating and liver lipids, and inflammatory cytokines in mice fed a high-fat diet. Here, we also found that red cabbage microgreens were higher than mature red cabbage in numerous health-promoting bioactive compounds including glucosinolates and their breakdown products (indoles and isothiocyanates), and various phenolics including flavonoid and nonflavonoid compounds. These compounds can protect against numerous chronic diseases including cardiovascular and metabolic disease and cancer, likely through diverse mechanisms including but not limited to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, ability to induce phase II detoxification enzymes, and/or modulation of the gut microbiome (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Pea microgreens were unique in containing kaempferol glycosides and trifolin, a kaempferol galactoside (both flavonols/flavonoid polyphenols), as well as numerous triterpene saponins, and also contained higher concentrations of these compounds than mature peas. Triterpene saponins have been shown to have numerous bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticarcinogenic, and cardiovascular-protective properties in preclinical models (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Saponins are often perceived as having bitter, astringent, and metallic sensory properties (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Despite this, we previously observed that pea microgreens were rated favorably by consumers for acceptability and sensory perceptions often associated with adverse flavor (i.e., lower intensity for astringency, bitterness, etc.), although variability among individuals was noted (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Here, peas were also found to be uniquely high in &#x003b1;-tocopherol (bioavailable vitamin E), compared with other microgreens, but concentrations were not higher in the pea microgreens than their mature counterparts. Vitamin E is an essential vitamin with several functions important to human health including its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Red beet microgreens also contained various triterpene saponin compounds that were both unique to the species and found in greater quantities in microgreens compared with their mature counterpart. We previously observed that red beet microgreens were perceived as being more bitter than pea microgreens, which also contain saponins, but were rated as acceptable to consumers (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Red beet microgreens were also unique in betanin (betacyanin/betalain), and in phenolic compounds including apigenin (flavone/flavonoid polyphenol) and salvianolic acid D. They were also noted to contain higher concentrations of several flavonoid glycoside compounds than the mature red beets. Red amaranth microgreens were found to be both uniquely high in various triterpene saponin compounds and coumaric acid esters (phenolic acids) relative to other microgreens, and to contain higher quantities of these compounds compared with mature red amaranth. Red amaranth microgreens were also noted to be unique in other health-promoting compounds such as amaranthin (betacyanin/betalain), lignan glycosides (nonflavonoid polyphenols), and oligosaccharides. Additionally, they contained certain vitamins (pantothenic acid/vitamin B-5, tocotrienols/vitamin E, and vitamin A) and flavonoid-3-<italic>O</italic>-glycosides (flavonoid polyphenols) in higher concentrations than mature red amaranth. Broccoli microgreens were noted to contain N1,N10-diferuloylspermidine (hydroxycinnamic acid derivative/phenolamide), which was both unique to that species, and in higher quantities compared with mature broccoli. This compound has been previously demonstrated to be a potent antioxidant, and phenolamides in general have been shown to have bioactivity in vivo including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardiovascular-protective effects, among others (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Broccoli was also uniquely high in a flavonoid-7-<italic>O</italic>-glycoside relative to other microgreens, and to contain higher concentrations of various flavonoid and nonflavonoid polyphenols, glucosinolates, tryptophanol (indole), sinapine, tocotrienols (vitamin E), linatine (vitamin B-6 antagonist/antinutrient), and ergosterols and derivatives (provitamin D-2) compared with mature broccoli.</p><p>The finding that microgreens contained numerous bioactive compounds that were significantly increased relative to mature counterparts is in line with previous reports. An initial study by Sun et al. (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) profiled 164 polyphenolic compounds in 5 <italic>Brassica</italic> microgreen species (mizuna, red cabbage, purple kohlrabi, red mustard, and purple mustard) and found that microgreens had more complex polyphenol profiles and more polyphenol varieties compared with their mature counterparts based on comparisons with previous reports. Huang et al. (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) determined polyphenol and glucosinolate contents in red cabbage microgreens and mature red cabbage and found that total concentrations of nonanthocyanin polyphenols were higher in the red cabbage microgreens than mature red cabbage, though total anthocyanin concentrations were lower in the microgreens than the mature counterpart. They also found that total glucosinolate concentrations were higher in red cabbage microgreens than mature red cabbage, which is also in line with our observation that numerous organosulfur compounds were significantly increased in red cabbage microgreens relative to mature red cabbage. Similarly, El-Nakhel et al. (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) directly compared bioactive compounds in green and red Salanova butterhead lettuce microgreens and found that polyphenols were more concentrated in the microgreens, and particularly in red pigmented lettuce microgreens, than mature lettuce. Conversely, de la Fuente et al. (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) found that broccoli, green curly kale, red mustard, and radish hydroponic microgreens contained similar amounts of total isothiocyanates and total polyphenols compared with their mature counterparts based on information from previous reports. Several of the studies above noted that the mature vegetables contained higher concentrations of carotenoids than the microgreens, which is in line with our observation that microgreens contained similar or lower concentrations of carotenoids compared with their mature counterparts. However, Xiao et al. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) studied 25 microgreen species and found that several, but not all, contained higher concentrations of carotenoids than their mature counterparts based on information found in the USDA national nutrient database. These findings support that microgreens are concentrated sources of various health-promoting bioactive compounds, but that variation exists within the literature potentially due to factors such as plant genotype, methods of metabolite detection, and/or growing conditions. More research is needed to elucidate the bioactive compound types and quantities in various microgreen species, and the influence of the above-mentioned factors.</p><p>The finding that microgreens are concentrated sources of metabolites, namely bioactive compounds, and in many cases more concentrated than the mature counterpart, is of relevance to human nutrition and health and necessitates further investigation. Microgreen consumption could increase plant bioactive compound intake beyond usual intake to achieve specific functional health effects. An important area of consideration is the bioaccessibility (the quantity or fraction released from the food matrix in the gastrointestinal tract for absorption) and bioavailability (the fraction of ingested nutrient/compound that reaches systemic circulation and is utilized) of the compounds (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and bioactive compounds including carotenoids, isothiocyanates, and polyphenols in Brassicaceae microgreens were shown to be bioaccessible through simulated gastrointestinal in vitro digestion, but this was significantly impacted by plant genotype (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). It is currently unknown whether microgreen bioactive compounds have the same bioaccessibility as their mature counterparts, which has implications for bioavailability and bioactivity of compounds in vivo. Additionally, previous research has demonstrated that modulation of microgreens&#x02019; growing conditions (e.g., LED lighting and nutrient solutions) can enhance the concentrations of various health-promoting compounds such as &#x003b2;-carotene (provitamin A), anthocyanins, and &#x003b1;-tocopherol (vitamin E) (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The impact that these enhancements have on bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and thus bioactivity of compounds should be evaluated, as should the impacts on consumer acceptability and sensory perceptions of microgreens.</p><p>With respect to minerals, microgreens contained various minerals important to human health, with some minerals higher in microgreens than mature counterparts, including selenium, copper, iron, zinc, and molybdenum. We also found that the concentrations of some minerals were lower in microgreens than mature counterparts (e.g., magnesium, calcium, and manganese in pea and red beet microgreens). The higher concentration of minerals in microgreens in some cases represents their potential in helping increase mineral intake, particularly for minerals where deficiency is more common globally (e.g. iron, zinc, and selenium) (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Paradiso et al. (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) evaluated the mineral contents of chicory, lettuce, and broccoli microgreens and compared them with those found in found in the USDA National Nutrient Database. Butterhead lettuce microgreens were higher in phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc than mature butterhead lettuce, whereas broccoli microgreens contained similar mineral compositions to mature broccoli but were higher in calcium. El-Nakhel et al. (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) found that green and red Salanova butterhead lettuce microgreens had higher concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and sodium, whereas the mature lettuce was higher in nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium. It should be noted that factors contributing to the differences between our study and previous reports might include genotype, and growing and postharvest conditions. Indeed, both studies by Paradiso et al. and El-Nakhel et al. fertilized the microgreens with nutrient solutions, whereas we did not apply a supplemental fertilizer in our study. Our findings, as well as the above-mentioned reports, also shed light on opportunities for enhancing the nutritional quality of microgreens with respect to minerals in general, and in cases where minerals were lower in microgreens than their mature counterpart. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated that the mineral contents of various microgreens can be modulated through biofortification [e.g., selenium and iodide (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>)] and different light spectra [e.g., potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>)]. Bioaccessibility and bioavailability are also important for prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Previous research using simulated gastrointestinal in vitro digestion (as a model of bioaccessibility), and mineral uptake in vitro (as a model of bioavailability), suggests that minerals (e.g., iron, potassium, magnesium, and zinc) in microgreens are bioaccessible and bioavailable, but with differences observed among plant species. Interestingly, differences in in vitro iron uptake between fenugreek microgreens and mature fenugreek were previously observed (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), where iron uptake was greater from microgreens and enhanced by ascorbic acid (vitamin C). These findings are promising with respect to bioaccessibility and bioavailability, but require confirmation and further investigation in vivo, particularly in humans. Additionally, bioaccessibility and bioavailability should be confirmed when enhancing the concentrations of minerals, as well as the consumer acceptance and sensory perceptions of the microgreens.</p><p>Overall, our findings support that the 6 microgreens studied contain a wide variety of nutrients and metabolites. We found that metabolite and mineral profiles of microgreens and their mature counterparts were more similar among themselves than each other (microgreens compared with mature counterparts). Further evaluation revealed microgreens are concentrated sources of some, but not all, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds, known to exert beneficial impacts on human health. We found that in some instances, the concentrations of health-promoting nutrients and bioactive compounds were lower in microgreens relative to their mature counterpart. This is an important consideration for dietary recommendations and intervention studies involving microgreens, but also represents an area for improvement through agricultural practices such as modulation of lighting and supplemental fertilizer for biofortification. Our data, and the variety of species available, suggest microgreens have potential to increase food and agricultural biodiversity necessary for sustainable food and agricultural systems, and thus human health (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). They also suggest the potential of microgreens to increase dietary diversity to promote a nutritionally adequate diet and reduce disease risk (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). It is important to note that because growing conditions for microgreens have been shown to impact their nutritional and phytochemical quality, our findings should not be extrapolated to microgreens grown in different conditions. Additionally, specific red cabbage anthocyanins could not be annotated in these data, likely because the metabolites were only detected in positive MS mode, and although this enables broad detection of many compounds, a limitation is the inability to discriminate cyanidin-based flavonoids from noncolored isomers (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Lastly, while we can evaluate relative differences of individual metabolites among samples, it is not appropriate to compare abundances of metabolites per se due to the inherent non-quantitative nature of mass spectrometry. Research of targeted metabolomics is necessary to compare absolute abundances of metabolites. Nonetheless, the <italic>z</italic> uniqueness scores are intended to provide insight into the metabolites most unique to each microgreens species relative to the other microgreens. Moving forward, research is warranted to better characterize nutritional and bioactive compound profiles in microgreens, and to understand potential impacts on human health including bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and bioactivity of the compounds. Research to improve the nutritional quality of microgreens should align with assessments and confirmation of consumer acceptability to promote translation of research to the global food system, including consumer markets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>nzaa180_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="nzaa180_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We acknowledge Dr Laura L Bellows for her contributions to funding acquisition and conceptualization of the research, and Natalie Yoder and Kimberley Freedman for their assistance with plant production.</p><p>The authors responsibilities were as follows&#x02014;SAJ, JEP, ALH, SEN, MEU, MB, MTF, HJT, and TLW: designed research; HI: contributed to research design; HI, JMC, HMO, and KAM: conducted research; JEP, ALH, JMC, and HMO: analyzed data; SAJ, JEP, ALH, and JMC: interpreted results; SAJ: wrote paper with contributions from JEP, ALH, SEN, MEU, and JMC; SAJ: had primary responsibility for final content; and all authors: commented on and edited subsequent drafts, and read and approved the final manuscript.</p></ack><notes id="nt1"><title>Notes</title><p>Supported by the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture, Hatch under 1016130 (SAJ, JEP, ALH, SEN, MEU, MB, MTF, HJT, TLW).</p><p>Author disclosures: The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p><p>Supplemental Tables 1&#x02013;8, Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Material are available from the &#x0201c;Supplementary data&#x0201d; link in the online posting of the article and from the same link in the online table of contents at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/cdn/">https://academic.oup.com/cdn/</ext-link>.</p><p>Abbreviations used: CSU, Colorado State University; DRC, dynamic reaction mode; FDR, false discovery rate; gdw, gram dry weight; LED, light-emitting diode; LOQ, limits of quantification; MeOH, methanol; MTBE, methyl-<italic>tert</italic>-butyl-ether; PCA, principal component analysis; QC, quality control; Q-TOF, quadrupole time-of-flight; UHPLC-MS, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</p></notes><ref-list id="ref1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
