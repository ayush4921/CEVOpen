When different plant mutualists are using the same type of cues, such as volatile compounds, attraction of parasitoids and pollinators may trade off. To explore this, we compared volatile emission of <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> plants in response to single or dual attack on their inflorescences. Additionally, we recorded flower visitation by pollinators and the attraction of parasitoids in the greenhouse and/or field. <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> were exposed in the flowering stage to one or two of the following three attackers: <italic>Brevicoryne brassicae</italic> aphids, <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> caterpillars, and <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. <italic>raphani</italic> bacteria. We found that single attack by caterpillars, and dual attack by caterpillars plus aphids, induced the strongest changes in plant volatile emission. The caterpillars&#x02019; parasitoid <italic>C. glomerata</italic> did not exhibit preference for plants exposed to caterpillars only vs. plants exposed to caterpillars plus aphids or plus bacteria. However, the composition of the pollinator community associated with flowers of <italic>B. nigra</italic> was affected by plant exposure to the attackers, but the total number of pollinators visiting the plants did not change upon attack. We conclude that, when <italic>B. nigra</italic> were exposed to single or dual attack on their inflorescences, the plants maintained interactions with natural enemies of the insect attackers and with pollinators. We discuss how chemical diversity may contribute to plant resilience upon attack.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at (10.1007/s10886-020-01239-6).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (Brassicaceae)</kwd><kwd>Flowering plants</kwd><kwd>Indirect resistance</kwd><kwd>Multiple attack</kwd><kwd>Plant volatiles</kwd><kwd>Pollination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004409</institution-id><institution>Minist&#x000e8;re de l&#x02019;Enseignement Sup&#x000e9;rieur, de la Recherche Scientifique et des Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009469</institution-id><institution>Conseil R&#x000e9;gional du Centre-Val de Loire</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Cooperation in Science and Technology ()</institution></funding-source><award-id>FA1405</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Spinoza award</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Outcrossing plants in the flowering stage need to protect themselves from attack while maintaining pollination in order to ensure their reproduction. Plant volatile emissions play a key role in these processes by mediating mutualistic interactions with natural enemies of herbivorous insects (indirect resistance) and with pollinators (Dudareva et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Junker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>; Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Muhlemann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Schiestl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). While the attraction of pollinators has an evident direct advantage for the reproductive success of most outcrossing plant species, there is increasing evidence that also indirect resistance can benefit plants (Fritzsche-Hoballah &#x00026; Turlings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Gols et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Kessler &#x00026; Baldwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>; Schuman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2012</xref>; van Loon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2000</xref>). The attraction of pollinators likely selects for a reliable blend that can be associated with reward quality and quantity (Schiestl &#x00026; Johnson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013</xref>; Wright &#x00026; Schiestl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2009</xref>). However, changes in volatiles emitted by plants upon attack provide essential cues to insectivores to find herbivorous attackers (Kessler &#x00026; Baldwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>). Therefore, the attraction of pollinators and natural enemies of herbivores may trade off when plants face attackers while in the flowering stage (Bruinsma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>; Kessler &#x00026; Halitschke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The emission of plant odours can vary qualitatively and quantitatively upon attack (Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>; Rost&#x000e1;s et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2006</xref>). The induction of specific signal-transduction pathways in response to insect or pathogen attack generally results in specific changes in plant volatile emission, which can subsequently influence the attraction of natural enemies of the plant attackers (Dicke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>; Dicke &#x00026; Baldwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Hilker &#x00026; Meiners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>; Turlings &#x00026; Erb, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2018</xref>). Plants face multiple attackers in nature, and, for example, simultaneous attack by multiple herbivores or herbivores plus plant pathogens can interfere with the attraction of parasitoids to their host (Blubaugh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>; Kroes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>; Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2009</xref>). Other studies, however, showed parasitoid host-finding behaviour to be more robust than expected when considering changes in volatile blends (Erb et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>; Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2014</xref>; Rost&#x000e1;s et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Although indirect resistance of plants in the vegetative stage has been extensively addressed (Stam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2014</xref>; Turlings &#x00026; Erb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2018</xref>), studies investigating indirect resistance of plants in the flowering stage are scarce, especially when considering florivores. For example, cowpea flowers damaged by <italic>Maruca vitrata</italic> caterpillars emit volatiles that attract parasitoids of these herbivores (Dannon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). Plant response to single attack by a florivore may interfere with plant response to another attacker on inflorescences. Dual attack of inflorescences of <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> by combinations of aphids, caterpillars and bacteria induced increased levels of jasmonates (JAs) in the inflorescences compared to plants exposed to single attack (Chr&#x000e9;tien et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Moreover, the jasmonate content of inflorescences changed in a specific manner depending on the combination of attackers (Chr&#x000e9;tien et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Jasmonates are involved in the production of floral scent (Stitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>), and changes in floral levels of jasmonates may translate into different volatile emissions, among other traits. Jasmonates can, for example, regulate the production of the volatile (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b1;-bergamotene, which is known to mediate indirect resistance of <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017a</xref>). Interference with the attraction of carnivores upon multiple attack could have strong negative impacts considering the direct damage they inflict on flowers.</p><p id="Par5">Herbivore-induced plant traits that mediate indirect resistance of plants can also influence pollinator behaviour, and consequently, affect the pollination success of a plant attacked in the flowering stage (Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Krupnick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1999</xref>; Lehtila &#x00026; Strauss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1997</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>). Among those traits, herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) seem to be important type of cues (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). For example, florivory by the parsnip webworm on wild parsnip induced an increased emission of octyl esters that could be linked to altered pollination success in the field (Zangerl &#x00026; Berenbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>). Herbivory on plants in the flowering stage leads to a wide array of consequences for pollinators, ranging from enhanced attraction (Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) to deterrence (Bruinsma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Kessler &#x00026; Halitschke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>; Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>), although herbivory sometimes does not affect pollinator attraction (Pareja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). Herbivory can also lead to changes in the time a pollinator spends on a flower, or the number of flower visits by a pollinator (Bruinsma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). Such effects of herbivory on pollinator recruitment, and the consequences for seed production by the plants, are dependent on the insect species (Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>), and can be specific to the feeding guild of the herbivorous insect (Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>), and to the feeding site on the plant (Kessler &#x00026; Halitschke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>). When considering florivores, their feeding damage can directly alter flower numbers and traits, and indirectly induce changes in flower traits via inducible responses in plants (Irwin &#x00026; Adler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>; McCall &#x00026; Irwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>; Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019b</xref>; Zangerl &#x00026; Berenbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The conflict between maintaining floral traits attractive to pollinators while changing traits that attract carnivores may result in a trade-off between indirect resistance and reproduction (Lucas-Barbosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; McCall &#x00026; Irwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>). <italic>Sinapis alba</italic>, for instance, maintains interactions with both pollinators and parasitoids upon single attack to leaves by aphids (Pareja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). <italic>Brassica rapa,</italic> however<italic>,</italic> prioritizes the recruitment of pollinators over the recruitment of parasitoids upon folivory by caterpillars (Desurmont et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). To understand how herbivory influences pollinators and parasitoids, assessing the effects of herbivory on their attraction to herbivore-infested plants is needed. To date, little is known about the effects of attack of inflorescences on the attraction of parasitoids as well as pollinators in the same system (Lucas-Barbosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Pareja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). The aim of this study was to explore whether and how multiple attack by an aphid and a caterpillar that mostly florivorous, and by a phytopathogenic bacterium, affects the recruitment of pollinators and natural enemies by a plant in the flowering stage. We investigated the role of plant VOCs as a potential mediator of these two mutualistic interactions. To address this question, we analysed volatiles from the headspace of flowering <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants that had been exposed to single or dual attack, and investigated the behavioural responses of parasitoids and pollinators in greenhouse experiments and in the field. To assess the consequences for plant fitness, we quantified seed set of the plants in the field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study System</title><p id="Par7">The black mustard <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (Brassicales: Brassicaceae) is a common native plant in The Netherlands that grows in dense patches. This annual species relies on pollinating insects for reproduction (Conner &#x00026; Neumeier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1995</xref>), although some selfing can occur as well (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). Pollinators of <italic>B. nigra</italic> belong to different insect orders, especially the Hymenoptera and Diptera, but also the Lepidoptera. <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> is commonly colonized by the cabbage aphid <italic>Brevicoryne brassicae</italic> (Hemiptera: Aphididae), which is a phloem feeder specialized on brassicaceous plants. This aphid species develops large colonies on inflorescences of <italic>B. nigra</italic>, whereas the development on leaves is limited (Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019a</xref>). The main parasitoid of <italic>B. brassicae</italic> is the solitary wasp <italic>Diaeretiella rapae</italic> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Bahana &#x00026; Karuhize, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1986</xref>; Hafez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1961</xref>; Vaughn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1996</xref>) that preferably oviposits in late-instar <italic>B. brassicae</italic> nymphs (Hafez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1961</xref>), and prefers flower-feeding aphids to leaf-feeding aphids (LTS Chr&#x000e9;tien, pers. obs.). The gregarious caterpillars of <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) are specialist herbivores of brassicaceous plants and use <italic>B. nigra</italic> as one of their host plants (Feltwell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1982</xref>). The butterflies lay eggs on leaves (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>) and upon hatching, the first-instar (L1) larvae feed on these leaves. The second instar (L2) larvae migrate to the inflorescence and become exclusively florivorous (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). In The Netherlands, caterpillars of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> are often parasitized by the gregarious parasitoid <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) which lays a few dozens of eggs in first or second-instar caterpillars of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> (Karowe &#x00026; Schoonhoven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1992</xref>; Mattiacci &#x00026; Dicke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1995</xref>). Bacteria, such as <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pathovar <italic>raphani</italic> (<italic>Xcr</italic>), can infect <italic>B. nigra</italic>. Xcr causes so-called leaf spot disease that mainly affects plants in the Brassicaceae but rarely kills the plants (Machmud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1982</xref>; Vicente et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2006</xref>). The bacteria can be found in seeds of plants initially infected on the leaves (Machmud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1982</xref>). Xcr causes 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;mm large necrotic spots on the infected leaf (Machmud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1982</xref>) and <italic>B nigra</italic> shows relatively high resistance to Xcr (McCulloch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1929</xref>; Ponzio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>; Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>; Vicente et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Plant Culture</title><p id="Par8">We grew plants from seeds collected from 25 maternal <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants.

At day 9, caterpillars were at the L2/L3 stage and had been feeding from flowers for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days; plants mainly had flowers and buds. At day 16, caterpillars were in the L5 stage and had been feeding from flowers for 8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;days; plants had flowers and unripe siliques. The two observation time points were determined based on the number of days that plants were exposed to caterpillar feeding because caterpillars hatched from the eggs within a time window of 12 to 16&#x000a0;days after egg deposition, irrespective of the treatments. Plots with no caterpillars as treatment were observed based on the caterpillar-treated plots of the same planting date.</p><p id="Par27">Each plot was observed for 10&#x000a0;min, using a handheld computer (Psion Workabout Pro TM3, London, UK) and the Observer software (version 10, Noldus Information Technology b.v., Wageningen, The Netherlands; Noldus 1991). Observations were performed between 9&#x000a0;am and 6&#x000a0;pm, when the wind condition was low and there was no rain. The temperature ranged from about 15 to 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

When this happened, we observed at least one replicate of each treatment per day.</p><p id="Par28">To investigate the effect of single and dual attack on the attractiveness of flowers, we recorded the number and identity of pollinators visiting a given plot of plants. Pollinator identity was classified into four groups: 1) bees, 2) bumblebees, 3) flies, 4) butterflies, and we identified the most abundant flower visitors to the species level. We distinguished honey bees (<italic>Apis melifera</italic>) and solitary bees within &#x0201c;bees&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Bumblebees&#x0201d; included <italic>Bombus lapidarius</italic>, <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>, and other bumblebees visiting the flowers. &#x0201c;Flies&#x0201d; included the syrphid <italic>Eristalis tenax</italic> and other fly species. &#x0201c;Butterflies&#x0201d; included <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> and other butterflies visiting the flowers. We also recorded the time spent between the moment a pollinator first arrived to the flowers of the plot until the moment it left the plot&#x02019;s plants, and we counted the number of flowers visited over this time period. Thus, we could calculate the time a pollinator spent on average per flower. Once the visitor had left, we would start following a new one, and repeated this over the 10&#x000a0;min of observation. We cannot exclude the possibility that the same pollinator returned to the plot after having left, and if so, its visit was recorded as a new visitation.</p><p id="Par29">Effect of treatment on the total number of pollinators was analysed with an LMM, data were normally distributed and met the assumption of equal variances. We used a GLMM based on a normal distribution with identity as a link function to test the effect of treatments on time spent per flower by honeybees and flies, and for the number of flowers that&#x000a0;honeybees visited. For the number of flowers that flies visited, we used a GLMM based on a negative binomial distribution, with logit as a link function. Data of one individual honeybee (Aphid plus bacteria treatment, day 9) was excluded; this insect spent 10 times more time on a flower than average and was considered as an outlier. For all LMM and GLMM analyses, the main effect of treatment was set as fixed factor and the intercept was included; in addition, the date when the plot was observed (observation date), which was confounded with weather conditions, was set as a random factor. Total number of pollinators at day 9 and day 16 were compared with a <italic>G-test</italic>. Effect of treatment on the assemblage of the pollinator community was tested with a <italic>Chi-square test</italic> at each time point.

The significance level was set to &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10886_2020_1239_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par43">Our study shows that flowering <italic>B. nigra</italic> exposed to single attack with three different attackers, or to dual combinations of these, remained attractive to parasitoids and pollinators despite the fact that treatments affected the volatile blend emitted by the plants. Caterpillars, in single attack or dual attack in combination with another attacker, were the main inducers of changes in plant volatile emission, and 50% of the 59 VOCs emitted by flowering <italic>B. nigra</italic> contributed to the changes. Both natural enemies and pollinators rely on several cues, such as olfactory and visual cues, and their interaction with the plant might be affected when the plant cues change upon herbivory. In our study, parasitoid preference was resilient to the changes in volatile emission, and plant exposure to non-host attackers neither affected choices of parasitoids in the greenhouse nor parasitism in the field. Similarly, we found that plant exposure to attackers did not impact the number of pollinators visiting flowers within the time frame of our observations, although attack to the inflorescences of <italic>B. nigra</italic> can alter the composition of the pollinator community. <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> interacts with over 10 different pollinator species from at least three insect orders, and negative effects of induced changes in floral traits to a subset of the community may be buffered by the attraction of other pollinator species. Interacting with diverse mutualists likely supports the maintenance of pollination and indirect resistance upon multiple attack.</p><p id="Par44">Our data show that there were treatment-specific changes in volatile emission when plants were exposed to attack on their inflorescences. Data from our previous study show that inflorescences of <italic>B. nigra</italic> exposed to <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, <italic>B. brassicae</italic> or <italic>Xcr</italic>, or to dual infestations by combinations of these attackers had distinct phytohormonal profiles, and that caterpillars in particular induced the active forms of JA in inflorescence tissues (Chr&#x000e9;tien et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Effect of treatments on volatile emission seems to be in line with these patterns in phytohormonal induction upon attack. We detected differences in plant volatile emission when comparing plants exposed to either caterpillars only, caterpillars plus aphids, or caterpillars plus bacteria, whereas no difference was detected when comparing volatile emission of plants exposed either to aphids only, aphids plus caterpillars, or aphids plus bacteria. Thus, attack by the caterpillars (alone or in combination with another attacker) seems to drive the strongest changes in plant volatile emission, compared to aphid treatments (alone or in combination with another attacker). Moreover, the volatile blend of plants exposed to caterpillars more specifically differed from the volatile blend of plants exposed to caterpillars plus bacteria. The inducible emission of volatiles by plants in the flowering stage has so far mainly been explored for single attack, and most studies focused on plant responses to folivory (Bruinsma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Pareja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>; but see Rusman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019b</xref>) for effect of florivory). The attacker-specific changes in volatile emission observed here suggest that plants in the flowering stage are also able to perceive, recognize and respond to different types of attack on their inflorescences, and JA and its derivatives are the likely orchestrators of plant response to florivory (Chr&#x000e9;tien et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>; Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>). Besides the role of JA in the induction of HIPVs (Kessler &#x00026; Baldwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2002</xref>), an increase in JA levels can also lead to reduced nectar production (Bruinsma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). Recent studies have also demonstrated that flower colour and flower shape are as well affected when flowering <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants are exposed to different attackers (Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019b</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">Herbivore-induced plant responses can be specifically perceived and exploited by multiple members of the plant community that can all influence plant fitness, in a negative or positive manner (Kessler &#x00026; Halitschke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>). We found that at both time points, plants exposed to caterpillars plus aphids harboured a different pollinator community than the other treatments; however, the total number of pollinators visiting the plant did not change. Plants may buffer detrimental effects of attack on some of their pollinators by attracting other ones. Such ecological plasticity is especially an option for flowers that are not pollinator limited and interact with a diverse range of pollinators (Lucas-Barbosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). Inflorescences of <italic>B. nigra</italic> recruited on average one to two pollinators per minute, which visited several flowers in a row. This abundance of pollinators probably explains why the total number of pollinators attracted to the plants was not affected by plant exposure to the attackers. Different pollinators harvest different types of rewards and can exploit different flower traits. As a consequence, changes in some flower traits in response to herbivory or pathogen attack may affect only a subset of the pollinator community (Junker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Schiestl &#x00026; Johnson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013</xref>). <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> interacted with over 10 species of flower visitors belonging to three different orders: Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera. In our study, most community changes were due to fewer flower visitations by syrphid flies, a pattern that has also been observed by Rusman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). If attack results in changes in a flower trait that interfere with pollinator attraction, this may be compensated by an increase in visitation by other types of pollinators. Thus, generalist flowers may benefit from ecological plasticity upon attack.</p><p id="Par46">Despite the chemical changes induced by dual attack in flowering <italic>B. nigra,</italic> the co-occurrence of two distinct attackers did not affect the attraction and oviposition preference of the parasitoids. For plants in the vegetative stage, some studies highlighted HIPV-driven changes in parasitoid behavior in the presence of non-hosts (Dicke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>). For <italic>B. nigra</italic> in the vegetative stage, however, co-infestation by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars with <italic>B. brassicae</italic> aphids<italic>,</italic> eggs of <italic>P. brassicae,</italic> or Xcr bacteria induced changes in the volatile emission of the blend, but the parasitoid <italic>C. glomerata</italic> could still locate its host in two-choice assays with plants exposed to the host caterpillar vs. plants exposed to the host and a non-host (Cusumano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>; Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2014</xref>). Similarly, <italic>D. rapae</italic> and other aphid parasitoids tend to maintain their ability to locate their host upon multiple attack on <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> (da Silva et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). Cabbage HIPV blends are complex and changes cannot be linked to parasitoid attraction in a straightforward way (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017b</xref>; Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2014</xref>). The HIPV emission that we measured represents the full sampled headspace and is likely broader than the subset of volatiles that is used by the parasitoids (Ponzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2014</xref>). In flowering <italic>B. nigra</italic>, we detected as many as 59 compounds that belong to at least seven classes of compounds; thus, we can consider <italic>B. nigra</italic>&#x02019;s odour as a complex blend (Dudareva et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>). Among the blend components, 50% contributed most to the separation of the blends upon attack in the multivariate analysis, the others having little or no contribution to the differences between the blends. It is, thus, possible that the subset of HIPVs perceived and used by the parasitoid was little affected upon dual attack. Therefore, complex HIPV blends may provide a certain chemical plasticity to attacked plants.</p><p id="Par47">Plants may benefit from the attraction of a diverse community of specialist and generalist insectivores that can be resilient to changes in plant cues used by insectivores when plants are attacked by multiple organisms. Natural enemies of herbivores are diverse and abundant on brassicaceous plants (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>; Stam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2018</xref>). These insectivores are an important component of the resistance strategy of plants in the flowering stage (Gols et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Knauer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>). On <italic>B. nigra</italic>, mortality of herbivores on the plants was caused by parasitoids and predators, with few of the caterpillars surviving until the adult stage. Like pollinators, insectivores are known to use a wide array of cues to find their prey or host for oviposition, and these cues can be olfactory, visual, or gustatory (Kessler &#x00026; Halitschke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>; Stam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2014</xref>). The diversity of insectivores encountered on aboveground parts of <italic>B. nigra</italic> is presumably large leading to nearly 100% mortality of caterpillars. Insectivores mainly belonged to six orders: Hymenoptera, Diptera, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Aranea, and Acarina (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>), (L.T.S. Chr&#x000e9;tien and D. Lucas-Barbosa, pers. obs). Thus, abundance and diversity of natural enemies may provide <italic>B. nigra</italic> with a flexible means to indirectly resist multiple attack by florivores.</p><p id="Par48">The ontogenetic stage in which plants are infested can influence the effects of attack on plant seed set (Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>). In our field experiments, plants were exposed to attackers at the onset of flowering, and although the initial attack may have been minor for the plant, the attackers that settle on the flowering plant may multiply or develop to more voracious developmental stages while altering patterns of plant phenotypic responses. These attackers can potentially impact the composition of the inflorescence-associated community and seed production (Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>; Pashalidou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>; Rusman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019b</xref>; Stam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2018</xref>). When exposed to single or simultaneous dual attack by <italic>B. brassicae</italic> aphids, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars and Xcr bacteria, which mostly attacked inflorescences, <italic>B. nigra</italic> plants produced similar numbers of seeds as control plants, which indicates that the plants compensated for damage and possible interference with mutualistic associations. Plants maintained interactions with both carnivores and pollinators despite changes in plant traits when exposed to single and dual attack to the inflorescences. Our results suggest that the resilience to attack of <italic>B. nigra</italic> may be supported by the chemical diversity that supports various mutualistic interactions of the plant (Gols et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Lucas-Barbosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>). Complex VOC blends of flowering plants likely evolved under selection pressure of both pollinators and herbivores, and may limit pleiotropic effects (Schiestl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2015</xref>; Schiestl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). We can expect to observe such flexibility for plants that exploit interactions with diverse community members, and compensation in seed production upon folivory and florivory seems to be common in the Brassicaceae (Lucas-Barbosa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>). Moreover, exploring the physiological and ecological plasticity of plants will bring complementary insights on the strategies developed by plants to cope with insect and pathogen attack, and on the evolution of plant chemical traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec27"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10886_2020_1239_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 783&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Alexandre Villela for fruitful discussions on chemical analyses, and Marcela Arag&#x000f3;n-G&#x000f3;mez and John Venegas-Molina for their contribution to preliminary assays on <italic>D. rapae</italic> behaviour.
