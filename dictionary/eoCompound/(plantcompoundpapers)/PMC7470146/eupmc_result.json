    "<h4>Context</h4><i>Kalanchoe</i> species (Crassulaceae) are widely used in traditional medicine as remedies in infectious diseases and cancer treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>Cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of <i>Kalanchoe daigremontiana</i> Raym.-Hamet & H. Perrier, <i>K. pinnata</i> (Lam.) Pers., and <i>K. blossfeldiana</i> Poelln. extracts were determined. The relationship between biological activities and the extracts bufadienolides content was also investigated.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Fresh leaves of <i>Kalanchoe</i> species were macerated with 95% ethanol or water. The quantitative analysis of bufadienolides in the extracts was carried out with mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity tests were performed on human cancer cell lines - HeLa, SKOV-3, MCF-7, and A375 by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and Real-Time Cell Analysis system. The microbiological study was done using a few bacteria strains (β-hemolytic <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Enterococcus hirae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>) and <i>Candida albicans</i>.<h4>Results</h4>The <i>K. blossfeldiana</i> ethanol extract and <i>K. daigremontiana</i> water extract exhibited the most potent cytotoxic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 19 µg/mL for HeLa and SKOV-3 cells). The strongest antibacterial effects showed ethanol extract of <i>K. blossfeldiana</i> and <i>K. pinnata</i> (MIC values were 8.45, 8.45, 0.25 and <33.75 µg/mL for <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>S. epidermidis</i>, and <i>E. hirae,</i> respectively). The highest total amount of bufadienolides was in <i>K. daigremontiana</i> ethanol extract. In contrast, <i>K. blossfeldiana</i> ethanol extract did not show the presence of these compounds.<h4>Conclusions</h4><i>Kalanchoe blossfeldiana</i> ethanol extract is a potential candidate for cancer and bacterial infection treatment. Additionally, the biological effects of <i>Kalanchoe</i> extracts are not dependent on the presence and amount of bufadienolides in the plant extracts."
