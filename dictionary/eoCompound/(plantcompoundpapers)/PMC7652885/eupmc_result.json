    "The aim of the research has been to determine the role of phenolic compounds in the processes of transformations of organic matter in meadow soils, leading to the formation of humic substances. The research has been performed based on the plant material and soil sampled from Europe's unique complex of permanent grasslands irrigated continuously for 150 years applying the slope-and-flooding system, the Czerskie Meadows. Phenolic compounds were isolated from the plant material samples (hay, sward and roots) and soils (horizon A, AE and Bsv) and from the fraction of humic and fulvic acids. It was found that the contents of phenolic compounds decrease in the following order: hay > sward > roots > A horizon soil > AE horizon soil > Bsv horizon soil > A horizon fulvic acids > AE horizon fulvic acids > Bsv horizon fulvic acids > A horizon fulvic acids > AE horizon fulvic acids > Bsv horizon fulvic acids. A significantly higher share of cinnamyl than vanillyl and syringyl compounds in the extracts of fulvic acids and slightly higher in the hydrolysates of humic acids confirms the effect of the chemical composition of the plant material undergoing decomposition on the properties of the emerging humic substances."
