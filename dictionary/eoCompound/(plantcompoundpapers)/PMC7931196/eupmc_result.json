    "Although <i>Cannabis sativa</i> synthesizes a wide range of phytochemicals, much attention has been primarily given to two phytocannabinoids, Î”<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), due to their distinctive activities in humans. These bioactivities can be further enhanced through the interaction of THC and CBD with other phytocannabinoids or non-phytocannabinoid chemicals, such as terpenes and flavonoids, a phenomenon that is termed the entourage effect. Flavonoid metabolism in <i>C. sativa</i> and the entourage effect are currently understudied. This mini-review examines recent advances in the biosynthesis and bioactivities of cannflavins, which are prenylated (C5) and geranylated (C10) flavones that are relatively unique to <i>C. sativa</i>. We also discuss the rapidly developing omics tools that enable discoveries in flavonoid metabolism in <i>C. sativa</i> and manipulation of flavonoid production through biotechnology. These advances set the stage for interrogating the health benefits of <i>C. sativa</i> flavonoids, deciphering the contribution of flavonoids to the entourage effect, and developing drugs."
