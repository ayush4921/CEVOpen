    "<i>Selaginella</i> P. Beauv. is a group of vascular plants in the family Selaginellaceae Willk., found worldwide and numbering more than 700 species, with some used as foods and medicines. The aim of this paper was to compare methanolic (MeOH) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of eight <i>Selaginella</i> species on the basis of their composition and biological activities. Six of these <i>Selaginella</i> species are underinvestigated. Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) analysis, we identified a total of 193 compounds among the tested <i>Selaginella</i> species, with flavonoids predominating. MeOH extracts recovered more constituents that were detected, including selaginellins, the occurrence of which is only typical for this plant genus. Of all the tested species, <i>Selaginella</i>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <i>apoda</i> contained the highest number of identified selaginellins.

Substantial cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines was demonstrated by the MeOH extract of <i>S. apoda</i>, where the ratio of the IC<sub>50</sub> HEK (human embryonic kidney) to IC<sub>50</sub> HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) was 7.9 ± 0.2. MeOH extracts inhibited the production of nitrate oxide and cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, <i>S. biformis</i> halved the production of NO, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6 at the following concentrations: 105 ± 9, 11 ± 1, and 10 ± 1 mg/L, respectively. Our data confirmed that extracts from <i>Selaginella</i> species exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines and AChE inhibition. The activity observed in <i>S. apoda</i> was the most promising and is worth further exploration."
