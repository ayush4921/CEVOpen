    "Five new cyclic diarylheptanoids (platycary A-E, compounds <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>) and three previously identified analogues (i.e., phttyearynol (compound <b>6</b>), myricatomentogenin (compound <b>7</b>), and juglanin D (compound <b>8</b>)) were isolated from the stem bark of <i>Platycarya strobilacea</i>. The structures of these compounds were determined using NMR, HRESIMS, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data. The cytotoxicity of compounds <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and their ability to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as protect against the corticosterone-induced apoptosis of Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, were evaluated in vitro using the appropriate bioassays. Compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> significantly inhibited the corticosterone-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells at a concentration of 20 μΜ."
