    "Recently, there have been efforts to use ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) as a biotechnological tool in greenhouses. Leafy <i>Brassica</i> species are mainly considered for their ability to synthesize glucosinolates and are valued as baby salads. They also have a remarkable concentration of chemically diverse flavonoid glycosides. In this study, the effect of short-term UV-B radiation at the end of the production cycle was investigated without affecting plant growth. The aim was to verify which exposure and adaptation time was suitable and needs to be further investigated to use UV as a biotechnological tool in greenhouse production of <i>Brassica</i> species. It is possible to modify the flavonoid glycoside profile of leafy <i>Brassica</i> species by increasing compounds that appear to have potentially high antioxidant activity. Exemplarily, the present experiment shows that kaempferol glycosides may be preferred over quercetin glycosides in response to UV-B in <i>Brassica rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i>, for example, whereas other species appear to prefer quercetin glycosides over kaempferol glycosides, such as <i>Brassica oleracea</i> var. <i>sabellica</i> or <i>Brassica carinata</i>. However, the response to short-term UV-B treatment is species-specific and conclusions on exposure and adaptation time cannot be unified but must be drawn separately for each species."
