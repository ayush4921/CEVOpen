Introduction</title><p>Plants serve as an important source of natural products or chemical substances called phytochemicals. They are biologically active and play important roles in preventive and therapeutic medicines, protect plant cells from environmental hazards and pathogenic attacks, and contribute to their aroma and flavor. They can be accumulated in different parts of plants, and their concentration varies across different tissues and species [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. </p><p>Phytochemicals are a powerful group of compounds representing secondary metabolites of plants and including a diverse range of chemicals such as phenolic compounds, steroidal saponins, organosulphur compounds, and vitamins [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The multidirectional beneficial impact of phytochemicals on the human body is particularly important, thus investigations of a wide range of different plants as potential sources of antioxidants have become increasingly popular. At present, it is essential to preserve the biological balance in ecosystems; therefore, the use of invasive plants for this purpose seems particularly interesting. </p><p><italic>Stratiotes aloides</italic> L. (also called the water soldier) is now common in many water bodies where they often dominate. The water soldier plays a significant role in small aquatic ecosystems, being a rapid colonizer and a highly productive, most expansive aquatic macrophyte forming dense floating carpets. In Europe, a number of lakes and ponds throughout the UK have seen an invasion of the water soldier. <italic>S. aloides</italic> is indicated as a high impact (HI) species in the Norwegian Black List [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It occurs from east Europe through west Siberia and the Caucasus to northern Kazakhstan [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This plant is found in waters in the whole lowland area in Poland [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to its expansive character and high productivity, the plant may strongly affect the functioning of a water body and other macrophytes [<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>S. aloides</italic> is not usually regarded as a crop plant. Nonetheless, in northwestern parts of the former Soviet Union and in Poland, it is harvested both for fertilization of fields and market gardens and as a component in fodder for cattle or pigs, given the high phosphorus and potassium content of this green manure [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It appears to have a negligible history of use as human food; it was reported from a few locations in Poland immediately after World War II when near-famine conditions existed. Although it occurs over a large area of Poland, <italic>S. aloides</italic> was an important famine plant in central Poland, where it was commonly collected from the bottom of lakes and cooked until the turn of the 20th century [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>As reported by [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic>S. aloides</italic> is effective against St. Anthony&#x02019;s Fire and alleviates swelling and inflammations in wounds. An ointment containing the plant has been found to heal wounds effectively. The author also reported its effective use to cure &#x02018;bruised&#x02019; kidneys. In the past, it had the reputation of being an unfailing cure for all wounds made by iron weapons. Studies of the biological activity of <italic>S. aloides</italic> show that this plant can be used as a new potential source of active compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-gout effects [<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the phenolic profile in the leaves and roots of <italic>S. aloides</italic> as well as their antioxidant potential and ability to inhibit lipoxygenase (LOX) in the light of their potential bioaccessibility. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-05065"><title>2. Results</title><p>The leaves of <italic>S. aloides</italic> were shown to be a rich source of flavonoid derivatives (especially luteolin and chrysoeriol). Luteolin-7-O-hexoside-glucuronide was the dominant compound in the leaves, whereas chrysoeriol-7-O-hexoside-glucuronide was the dominant root component (<xref rid="molecules-25-05065-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>The infusion from leaves, roots, and their mixture 1:1 (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) contained compounds with strong antiradical activity (measured against 2,2&#x02032;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid; ABTS free radicals). The activity of leaves and all plant (MIX) was comparable (EC<sub>50</sub> about 11.8 mg dw/mL). Unfortunately, the activity of potentially bioaccessible compounds from all samples was significantly lower. This tendency was especially visible in the case of the leaves and the mixture. The relatively high activity of the mixture may suggest synergistic action between compounds derived from the leaves and roots. Most importantly, the highest activity was determined for samples obtained after simulated absorption, which may suggest their high bioavailability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The BAC (antioxidant bioaccessibility index) value clearly indicated that the compounds present in the infusions were poorly bioaccessible in vitro. The lowest bioaccessibility was determined for the roots and the mixture (BAC values of 0.18 and 0.20, respectively). Most importantly, the free radical scavengers released during simulated digestion were highly bioavailable in vitro. This fact was confirmed by the BAV (antioxidant bioavailability index) values (10.69 for the leaves and approx. 7.5 for the roots and mixture). Most importantly, the BAF (antioxidant bioefficiency index) values indicated that compounds that were able to permeate the dialysis membrane were more active (ca. 30% for the leaves and roots and 54% for the mixture) than compounds present in the initial infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p><italic>S. aloides</italic> is a good source of water-extractable compounds with strong reducing potential. Especially valuable were the leaves of this plant. Unfortunately, the conditions prevailing in the simulated gastrointestinal system resulted in a significant decrease in their activity, especially in the case of the leaves. Additionally, potential synergism between compounds contained in the leaves and roots was observed in this case. Potentially bioavailable compounds demonstrated significantly higher activity (compared to the gastrointestinally digested samples, GDI), which may suggest their potential nutraceutical value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The activity of the reductive phytochemicals present in the infusions drastically declined after the simulated digestion. The lowest BAC value (0.07) was determined in the case of the leaf extract. However, the active compounds were able to permeate the dialysis membrane, which suggests their high bioavailability (BAV value of approx. 5.3). Unfortunately, the reductive compounds derived from the roots and the mix were poorly bioavailable in vitro. In general, the simulated digestion and absorption caused a significant decrease in the reducing power of all samples (compared to the infusions), which points to their poor bioavailability, not exceeding 40% (BAF values from 0.36 for the leaves to 0.18 for the mix) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Interesting results were obtained by determination of the ability to protect lipids against oxidation (LPO). The leaves of <italic>S. aloides</italic> were the best source of compounds with this activity. Importantly, the compounds contained in the leaves were potentially bioaccessible and bioavailable. Based on these results, it can be assumed that the water-extractable and potentially bioaccessible active phytochemicals from the leaves and roots acted synergistically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The BAC values indicated quite poor bioaccessibility of the lipid protectors, especially in the case of the mix (0.35). The BAV index analysis suggested that the active compounds released during the simulated digestion from the leaves and roots were bioavailable in vitro (BAV values of 1.89 and 1.24, respectively); in turn, poor bioavailability was determined in the case of MIX (BAV = 0.63). Compared to the initial infusions, relatively low bioavailability was determined for the leaves and roots (BAF value of ca. 0.8), while the lowest BAF value was found in the case of MIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p><p>In contrast to LPO, the roots of <italic>S. aloides</italic> contained very active hydrophilic compounds able to chelate metal ions. Unfortunately, their potential bioaccessibility was relatively low, probably due to interactions with other compounds released from the matrix (e.g., proteins and/or starch). Most importantly, the active compounds were highly bioavailable in vitro, which confirms their hydrophilicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The leaves from the analyzed plant were also a good source of potentially bioavailable compounds with strong chelating power. Importantly, the compounds with the ability to protect lipids contained in the leaves seemed to be highly bioaccessible and bioavailable in vitro (BAC value of ca. 2.07; BAF value of 6.76). The BAV index indicates that compounds released during simulated gastrointestinal digestion interact with active components, probably creating inactive combinations (complexes); however, this activity increased significantly after dialysis (simulating passive absorption). This is probably related to the fact that large molecules (matrix components) are unable to penetrate through the semi-permeable membrane. This situation is clearly visible in the case of the roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). </p><p>One of most effective endogenous sources of free radicals is xanthine oxidase (XO). The hydrophilic compounds from the leaves were the most effective XO inhibitors (EC<sub>50</sub> = 8.91 mg DW/mL). Unfortunately, their activity decreased during gastrointestinal digestion and the active compounds seemed to be poorly bioavailable. These observations were confirmed by the low BAC index value (0.41, 0.69, and 0.29 for the leaves, roots, and mixture, respectively). Most importantly, compounds with an ability to inhibit XO activity were poorly bioavailable in vitro (see the BAF values) and in this case, the interactions with other matrix components (released during the in vitro digestion) had a rather positive effect, especially in the case of the leaves and MIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>INF&#x02014;infusions, GDI&#x02014;gastrointestinally digested extracts, GDA&#x02014;samples after simulated absorption; BAC&#x02014;the antioxidant bioaccessibility index, BAV&#x02014;the antioxidant bioavailability index, BEF&#x02014;the antioxidant bioefficiency index.

Additionally, the phytochemicals from the roots were poorly bioaccessible in vitro. Most importantly, the LOX inhibitors from the leaves and roots were highly bioavailable in vitro. This fact was confirmed by the BAF values. It should be underlined that, as indicated by the BAV index values, compounds with high molecular weight interact negatively with LOX inhibitors. They seem to be low molecular weight compounds, as they were able to permeate the dialysis membrane (see BAV values) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f003">Figure 3</xref>). </p><p>The water-extractable compounds derived from the leaves and roots acted as uncompetitive LOX inhibitors, whereas the infusion from MIX inhibited LOX in a competitive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Compounds released during the simulated gastrointestinal digestion acted as uncompetitive LOX inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), whereas the potentially bioavailable compounds demonstrated a competitive mode of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05065-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). </p><p>Importantly, as demonstrated by our research, the whole plant exhibits activity and can therefore be used in its entirety without the cumbersome and time-consuming separation of leaves from roots. The interaction factors (IF) coefficient reflecting the interactions between the biologically active components of the extracts was determined to confirm this thesis. It was found that the water-extractable compounds with an ability to inhibit XO activity and protect lipids against oxidation acted synergistically. Moderate synergism was found in the case of the LOX inhibitors and reductive compounds. The antiradical phytochemicals acted nearly additively, whereas moderate antagonism was determined for the metal ion chelating compounds (<xref rid="molecules-25-05065-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The conditions prevailing in the simulated gastrointestinal system changed the interactions between the biologically active compounds contained in <italic>S. aloides</italic>. Strong synergism was determined for the potentially bioaccessible compounds with a reducing capacity, while phytochemicals protecting lipids against oxidation and LPO and scavenging free ABTS radicals acted synergistically. In turn, nearly additive interactions were determined for the potentially bioaccessible compounds with an ability to chelate metal ions and for the LOX inhibitors. Moderate antagonism was found only in the case of XO inhibitors. The samples after simulated absorption (GDA) extracts contained small hydrophilic molecules able to permeate the dialysis membrane. Among them, antiradical compounds and those with chelating power acted synergistically. Taking into account the potentially bioavailable compounds, moderate synergism was found for the antiradical and chelating compounds. Phytochemicals with reducing power and XO acted additively. Antagonism was determined for the LOX inhibitors, whereas moderate antagonism was found for compounds that were able to protect lipids against oxidation (<xref rid="molecules-25-05065-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-25-05065"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>The first phytochemical analysis of the aquatic macrophyte <italic>S. aloides</italic> conducted by [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] revealed the presence of two new flavonoid glucuronides: luteolin 7-O-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1f2)-D-glucopyranoside and chrysoeriol 7-O-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1f2)-D-glucopyranoside. Additionally, new compounds 2-(2-hydroxypentyl)-5-carboxy-7-methoxychromone, chrysoeriol 7-O-(6-O-malonyl) glucopyranoside, and a flavonoid glycoside luteolin 7-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucopyranoside were isolated. Recent investigations have shown that antioxidants of plant origin may have great importance as therapeutic agents in several diseases caused by oxidative stress [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Many synthetic antioxidant compounds have shown toxic and/or mutagenic effects, which have stimulated the interest of many investigators to search for natural antioxidants [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. According to WHO, 80% of the world&#x02019;s population are estimated to use some form of herbal medicine in their health care. It was also reported that approximately one quarter of prescribed drugs contain plant extracts or active ingredients obtained from plants. To prove this, a number of researchers have done extensive work on various plants [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The multidirectional antioxidant effect of <italic>S. aloides</italic> extracts is the result of their unique composition. As presented in <xref rid="molecules-25-05065-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, both the leaves and roots of <italic>S. aloides</italic> contain a large amount of flavonoids, especially luteolin, apigenin, and chrysoeriol derivatives. Flavonoids are the largest group of naturally occurring polyphenols characterized by broad in vitro and in vivo biological activities. These compounds act as multidirectional antioxidants exerting anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects. Most flavonoids are potent metal chelators and possess strong antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. They are also known to be potent inhibitors for several enzymes, such as xanthine oxidase, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Luteolin exerts specific anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects connected with its antioxidant and free radical scavenging capacities. It was found to inhibit tumor cell proliferation with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 3 and 50 &#x003bc;M in vitro and in vivo administered at the dose from 5 to 10 mg/kg i.p., via intragastric application of 0.1&#x02013;0.3 mg/kg/d, or as a food additive at concentrations from 50 to 200 ppm. It was effective in 10 cancer types, with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> for carcinoma of the stomach (25 &#x003bc;M), cervix (27 &#x003bc;M), lung (41 &#x003bc;M), and bladder (68 &#x003bc;M) [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Luteolin has received increasing attention due to its various biological activities and pharmacological effects and has been widely applied in medicine and production of functional foods [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Apigenin is one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in the plant kingdom. It is present principally in a glycosylated form in a significant amount of vegetables, fruits, herbs, and plant-based beverages. The two main commonly known sources of apigenin are parsley (<italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic>) and peppers (<italic>Piper nigrum</italic>) containing 13.526 mg/100 g and 4.98 mg/100 g of the compound, respectively [<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The data presented in <xref rid="molecules-25-05065-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that the leaves and roots of <italic>S. aloides</italic> are a very rich source of this compound (0.219 and 0.071 mg/g dw, respectively). </p><p>Chrysoeriol, i.e., a flavonoid found mainly in tropical plants, deserves special mention. The presence of derivatives of this compound has also been shown in celery leaves and seeds [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there are only a few reports in the literature on its antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Chrysoeriol isolated from peanut hulls inhibited lipid peroxidation in low-density lipoprotein induced by Cu<sup>2+/</sup>O<sub>2</sub> with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.6 mM. Chrysoeriol isolated from the aerial part of the gaiyou exhibited antimutagenic activity in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA98 [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In turn, chrysoeriol isolated from <italic>Morinda morindoides</italic> leaves has been found to be ineffective towards superoxide radicals generated from xanthine and xanthine oxidase [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>It has been demonstrated that XO inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents for hyperuricemia that causes gout, renal stones, myocardial ischemia, and ROS-induced diseases. Regrettably, all these medications (including allopurinol, i.e., a potent XO inhibitor clinically used for gout treatment) are associated with some side effects such as skin rashes, hepatitis, fever, Stevens&#x02013;Johnson syndrome, nephropathy, fatal liver necrosis, and allergic reactions [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As shown by [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], apigenin had a comparable inhibitory effect to that of allopurinol. Genistein was a weaker inhibitor than quercetin and myricetin with a Ki value of 3.23 &#x003bc;M. Results obtained by Dong et al. indicated that luteolin and a luteolin&#x02013;manganese(II) complex acted as competitive XO inhibitors with good radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activities [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As reported by Nguyen et al., luteolin, apigenin, and chrysoeriol derived from the <italic>Chrysanthemum sinese</italic> flower exhibited strong XO inhibitory activities (IC<sub>50</sub>: 1.24, 0.13, and 0.20 &#x003bc;M, respectively) [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. </p><p>Several reports have indicated that flavonoids were able to inhibit XO activity [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Thus, the content and activity of low-molecular antioxidants may play a crucial role in the pro-health properties of plant-derived food; however, equally important is the limitation of the generation of ROS by endogenous factors, which include e.g., lipoxygenases (LOXs) [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>LOXs are dioxygenases catalyzing the formation of corresponding hydroperoxides from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and arachidonic acids. LOX enzymes are expressed in immune, epithelial, and tumor cells that display a variety of physiological functions, including inflammation, skin disorder, and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Because human lipoxygenase isoenzymes (5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases) are extremely unstable at normal physiological temperatures in the cell-free lipoxygenase assay, the physiological temperature-stable and commercially available plant LOX derived from <italic>Glycine max</italic> is an appropriate model for the LOX inhibitory assay [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>LOX is not only involved in oxidation of lipids but also production of leukotriene, which mediates the occurrence of inflammation, which is painful and can lead to diseases that pose a threat to public health. Inhibition of LOX activity is a prospective method for treatment of inflammation; hence, many specific compounds have been designed and synthesized as LOX inhibitors [<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>There are mainly two types of anti-leukotriene drugs, i.e., cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists and leukotriene synthesis inhibitors (5-LOX inhibitors): zileuton, ZD-2138, BayX 1005, and MK-0591. Treatment with oral montelukast, zafirlukast, or zileuton significantly improves many clinical outcomes. Given the danger of liver disruption, zileuton is not commonly used (it is unlicensed in Poland) [<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ability of extracts from vegetables, medicinal plants, some spices, and cereals to inhibit LOX has already been studied [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, in the recent literature, there is no information about LOX inhibition by <italic>S. aloides</italic> components. The study of the interaction of flavonoids with LOX is of great interest, as this enzyme may be considered a target for the health beneficial effect of flavonoids. It is known that mammalian LOX is inhibited by flavan-3-ols and that low-density lipoprotein oxidation induced by 15-LOX is inhibited by quercetin and epicatechin. It has also been reported that epicatechin and its related oligomers, i.e., procyanidins, inhibit human 5-LOX contributing to an anti-inflammatory effect [<xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05065" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-25-05065"><title>4.

A cellulose filter (Dionex Corp.) together with 1 g of LiChroprep RP-18 (40&#x02013;63 &#x000b5;m) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was placed at the bottom of the extraction cell to facilitate chlorophyll removal. Three static extraction cycles, 5 min each, were applied&#x02014;first, the cells were filled with extraction solvent (80% methanol in water, <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>), pressurized at 1500 psi, and heated at 120 &#x000b0;C for 5 min to ensure that samples reached thermal equilibrium. After extraction, cells were rinsed with fresh solvent (50% of the cell volume) and purged with a flow of nitrogen for 100 s. The extracts (25 mL each) were collected into the 40 mL glass vials, evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator at 40 &#x000b0;C, suspended in 1 mL of 80% methanol, and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C until required. Phenolic constituents of <italic>S. aloides</italic> were analyzed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), comprising of a binary pump system, sample manager, column manager, and PDA detector (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA).

Most importantly, the active compounds were potentially bioaccessible and bioavailable. The results indicate a possibility of using this plant to produce preparations with health-promoting properties (nutraceuticals, functional food supplements).
