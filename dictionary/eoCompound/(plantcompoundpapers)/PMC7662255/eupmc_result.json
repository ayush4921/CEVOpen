    "<i>Stratiotes aloides</i> L. is common water plant in central Poland. Due to its expansive character, <i>S. aloides</i> L. can strongly affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. <i>S. aloides</i> L. was an important famine plant in central Poland. This plant was commonly collected and cooked until the turn of the 20th century. It has also been used to heal wounds, especially when these are made by an iron implement. The objective of the present work was to study the phenolic profile in the leaves and roots of <i>S. aloides</i> as well as their antioxidant potential and ability to inhibit lipoxygenase (LOX) in the light of their potential bioaccessibility. The dominant compound in its leaves was luteolin-7-O-hexoside-glucuronide (5.84 mg/g DW), whereas the dominant root component was chrysoeriol-7-O-hexoside-glucuronide (0.83 mg/g DW). Infusions from leaves, roots, and their 1:1 (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) mixture contained potentially bioaccessible antiradical compounds. <i>S. aloides</i> is a good source of water-extractable reductive compounds. Especially valuable are the leaves of this plant. The roots of <i>S. aloides</i> contained very active hydrophilic compounds able to chelate metal ions. However, their potential bioaccessibility was relatively low. The hydrophilic compounds from the leaves were the most effective XO inhibitors (EC<sub>50</sub> = 9.91 mg DW/mL). The water-extractable compounds derived from the leaves and roots acted as uncompetitive LOX inhibitors."
