Major cancer treatment strategies include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, and in some cases, joint strategies have shown the best results for improving cancer survival. However, due to the high heterogeneity of cancer cells, it is extremely difficult to predict which cells will respond to treatment, indicating that resistance to treatment is a major problem for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Multidrug resistance (MDR) for cancer cells limits the therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs and is a major barrier to cancer treatment. Multidrug-resistant cells involve complex steps that target different metabolic pathways for tumor development. One of the most classic MDR resistance mechanisms is increased levels of detoxification enzymes, changes in drug uptake and flow, and deactivation of apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]&#x000a0;.</p><p id="Par16">Glutathione transferase (GST) is a family of enzymes that catalyze the glutathione (GSH)&#x000a0;-dependent detoxification of various chemotherapeutic drugs to reduce their cytotoxic effects. GST catalyzes the conjugation of GSH&#x000a0;with anticancer drugs to prevent direct drug activity; this conjugation reduces the ability of anticancer drugs to penetrate the cell and to attack cellular DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This activity appears to occur preferably via isoform (GSTP1-1); GSTP actually interacts with a number of small molecules and cellular proteins that produce regulatory effects across the main signaling and transcription pathways (identified as the &#x0201c;GSTP regulatory interactome&#x0201d;). Many human cancers have been shown to express high levels of GSTP1-1 and their expression has been correlated with both disease progression and chemotherapy resistance. Drugs targeting GSTs are tested in clinical trials as adjuvant therapies with anticancer agents to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Inhibiting GST activity can inhibit the function of the C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal regulator and thus improving&#x000a0;cell signaling pathways in cancer cells and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Polyphenols of plant origin or their synthetic derivatives have been identified as redox-active molecules with relatively low toxicity. They have a wide range of beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, and anti-carcinogenic actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Phenolic compounds have been categorized by source, biological function, and chemical structure. They can be subdivided into two main classes, flavonoid and non-flavonoid (for example, phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, and tannins) based on the number of aromatic rings and their binding affinity to different compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Flavonoids may be divided into different subclasses depending on the degree of oxidation of the heterocyclic ring as: anthocyanins, flavonols, flavans, flavanol, flavones, and isoflavones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds have the potential to modulate the activity and/or expression of GSTs. This impact on GSTs depends heavily on the composition, concentration, length of administration, as well as on GST isoform and origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some phenolic compounds have the ability to inhibit GST activity such as chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin, curcumin, tannins, and stilbene, which has been seen as a promising target to overcome MDR&#x000a0;and increase the efficacy of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Phenolic compounds may have a pro-oxidant and cytotoxic effect. The pro-oxidant properties of such compounds depend on a variety of variables, including the phenolic class, the presence of oxygen or transition metal ions, alkaline pH, their concentration, and solubility characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, in most studies conducted on phenolic pro-oxidant behavior, copper is considered to be a potent catalyst for oxidative reactions. Phenolic pro-oxidant activity can cause cellular lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par20">The pro-oxidant potential of certain polyphenols (e.g., quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate) has been established as chemotherapeutic adjuvants as they selectively promote the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and play an important role in the prevention of some forms of cancer based on their ability to selectively destroy cancer cells without influencing normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par21"><italic>Tamarindus indica L</italic>.

The first step in the use of phytochemicals is the extraction of bioactive compounds from plant materials. Phenolic solubility depends on the chemical composition and physical properties of the plant sample, the polarity of the solvents used, the time of extraction, the temperature, and the solvent ratio of the sample. The phenolic composition of plants ranges from simple (e.g., phenolic acids) to strongly polymerized compounds (e.g., tannins) in various amounts.

To assess whether inhibition of GSTP1-1 by the most potent inhibitory <italic>n</italic>-butanol extract of <italic>T. indica</italic> was competitive or non-competitive, Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots were drawn for the non-inhibited and partly inhibited enzyme.</p><p id="Par73">Kinetic studies with purified GST P1-1 show differences in the specific activity of GSH and CDNB substrates, the value of <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> may be increased or decreased depending on the type of GST isoform and the nature of the inhibitor. <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for GSH described seem to be lower than 1&#x02009;mM. However, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values of CDNB differ 100 or more fold depending on the GST isoform.

The inhibitor has an affinity to the active site of the enzyme, to which the substrate also binds. This form of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate, which is out competing the inhibitor. However, uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at the same time as the substrate of the enzyme. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate and vice versa. Such form of inhibition cannot be reversed, but can be decreased by increasing the concentration of the substrate. The inhibitor typically has an allosteric effect where it binds to an enzyme site other than the substrate. This binding to the allosteric site shifts the conformation of the enzyme to decrease the affinity of the substrate to the active site.</p><p id="Par76">The catalytic efficacy of the reaction decreased as the concentration of inhibitors increased due to reduced enzyme activity. This trend has been noted for <italic>T. indica</italic> extract for inhibition of G-sites (GSH). However, the inhibition of the catalytic efficiency of the reaction at H-sites (CDNB) does not change, whereas the apparent affinity of the substrate to the binding site is decreased as the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value increases. This means that the binding affinity to the enzyme is reduced, but can be resolved by increasing the concentration of the substrate.</p><p id="Par77">Most polyphenolic compounds exhibit mixed (non-competitive) or uncompetitive inhibition of GSTs to GSH and CDNB substrates due to binding of the compounds to the GST binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

Cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastases are affected by certain tumor microenvironmental compounds (cytokines) that interact with cells and regulate complex signaling pathways. The direct effect of these compounds on cancer cells is a controversial topic and reports of both tumor and anti-tumor effects have been reported.

Sadly, many patients with breast cancer have developed resistance to tamoxifen therapy along with tumor progression. Numerous molecular mechanisms for endocrine resistance have been suggested, including alteration of the signal transduction pathway for the estrogen receptor, modification of the signal that regulates the cell cycle and ability to survive, and activation of escape pathways who provide tumors with alternative reproductive and survival stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">New strategies for reducing the required dose of anticancer drugs would be beneficial.

Natural anticancer agents, like phenolic compounds, produce considerably less toxicity, are safe and readily accessible; thus, combination therapy using natural anticancer drugs should be encouraged alongside commercially approved anticancer drugs in order to reduce limitations in the treatment of advanced cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">The combination of herbs and drugs has been shown to be effective in most medical practices; however, findings from some studies have suggested adverse reactions.

This example of vitamin E-tamoxifen interaction was considered to have a negative effect interaction. Another example of a negative effect is the potential induction of CYP450 isoenzymes by valerian (<italic>Valeriana officinalis</italic>), a sleep aid plant, which can adversely affect the effectiveness of anticancer drugs.
