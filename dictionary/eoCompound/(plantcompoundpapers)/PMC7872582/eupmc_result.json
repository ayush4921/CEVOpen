    "<i>Curculigo orchioides</i> Gaertn. distributed in subtropical regions of Asia including southern China and India. The plant is used as a traditional medicine in China for the treatment of menorrhagia, osteoporosis, and other gynecological problems. The complete chloroplast genome was reported in this study using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. The whole genome of this species was 157,472 bp in length, with a total GC content of 37.44%. The large single copy (LSC) was 86,507 bp, the small single copy (SSC) was 16,867 bp, and both of the two inverted repeats (IRs) were 27,049 bp, respectively. A total of 132 unique genes were identified, among which are 86 protein-coding genes, 38 tRNA genes and 8 rRNA genes. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>C. orchioides</i> was highly clustered with <i>C. capitulata</i>. Our study will provide useful fundamental data for further phylogenetic and evolutionary studies of <i>C. orchioides</i>."
