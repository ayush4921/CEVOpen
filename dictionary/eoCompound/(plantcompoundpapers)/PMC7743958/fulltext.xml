One of these plants is the trumpet creeper <italic>Campsis radicans</italic>: in a previous study the majority of all wasps collected from this plant were parasitized and focused their foraging activity on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> buds. The unexpected prevalence and unusual feeding strategy prompted us to investigate the influence of this plant on wasp behavior and physiology through a multidisciplinary approach. First, in a series of laboratory bioassays, we observed that parasitized wasps spent more time than non-parasitized ones on fresh <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> buds, rich of extra-floral nectaries (EFNs), while the same wasps ignored treated buds that lacked nectar drops. Then, we described the structure and ultra-structure of EFNs secreting cells, compatible with the synthesis of phenolic compounds. Subsequently, we analysed extracts from different bud tissues by HPLC-DAD-MS and found that verbascoside was the most abundant bioactive molecule in those tissues rich in EFNs. Finally, we tested the immune-stimulant properties of verbascoside, as the biochemical nature of this compound indicates it might function as an antibacterial and antioxidant. We measured bacterial clearance in wasps, as a proxy for overall immune competence, and observed that it was enhanced after administration of verbascoside&#x02014;even more so if the wasp was parasitized. We hypothesize that the parasite manipulates wasp behavior to preferentially feed on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> EFNs, since the bioactive properties of verbascoside likely increase host survival and thus the parasite own fitness.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Firenze (IT)</institution></funding-source><award-id>ex-60%</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beani</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Financial support to LB was provided by the University of Florence.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/jfvm2/quickfiles">https://osf.io/jfvm2/quickfiles</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Data are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/jfvm2/quickfiles">https://osf.io/jfvm2/quickfiles</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>A parasite can deeply change the life-history of its host. If parasite-induced changes improve the transmission of the parasite, they can be considered as adaptive manipulation rather than a mere by-product of pathology [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Different altered behaviors have been described in the extended phenotype paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], object of a lively debate [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The outcome of the manipulative efforts is not necessarily a novel and bizarre behavior, but can rather be the altered expression of usual behavioral patterns of the host [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], for example subtle changes in feeding preference [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or the modulation of core biological functions such as nervous and immune systems [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One example of a complex manipulation is the interaction between the endoparasitic insect <italic>Xenos vesparum</italic> (Rossi)(Strepsiptera, Xenidae) [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and its host, the primitively eusocial wasp <italic>Polistes dominula</italic> (Christ)(Hymenoptera, Vespidae). If parasitized, putative workers are castrated, do not participate in colony tasks, and desert the nest to form aggregations on nearby plants, where <italic>X</italic>. <italic>vesparum</italic> completes its life cycle by mating and releasing infective larvae [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The behavior of parasitized wasps has some features that remind the non-reproductive phase of future queens: they are in ovary diapause, do not perform any colony task and overwinter in sheltered aggregations [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a matter of fact, parasitized wasps are often found together with future queens in overwintering aggregations and in a previous study Geffre et al. [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that the parasite manipulates the behaviour of the host to make it more queen-like by specifically shifting the expression of caste-related genes [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In a long-term study, Beani et al. [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] described the strong attraction of parasitized wasps towards <italic>Campsis radicans</italic> (L.)(Bureau)(Bignoniaceae), a perennial plant commonly known as &#x0201c;trumpet creeper&#x0201d;. This plant is highly attractive for pollinators both in its North America native range and in Europe, where it has been introduced [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Two thirds of all wasps that were sampled on trumpet creepers were parasitized, whereas the parasite prevalence was much lower (only 6%) in the broader study area. Parasitized wasps aggregated on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radic</italic>ans and fed on the calyx of buds, touching the sepals with antennae and scraping their surface with mandibles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242486.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242486.s003">S1 Video</xref>). Long patrols and aggressive response towards any approaching wasp or other insect were more frequent on buds than on leaves and flowers [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The unusual high number of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) on calyx, corolla, petiole and fruit has been interpreted as an advanced strategy of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> to attract ants as bodyguards for defence against herbivore insects [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, previous research has shown that nectar secondary metabolites, produced by EFNs, are able to manipulate the behavior of ants [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, very little is known on feeding behavior focused on EFNs in other insects, like wasps [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0242486.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0242486.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title><italic>Parasitized P</italic>. <italic>dominula on C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic>.</title><p>A <italic>P</italic>. <italic>dominula</italic> wasp, parasitized by one male <italic>X</italic>. <italic>vesparum</italic> (arrow: See the tergite lifted by the parasite&#x02019;s <italic>puparium</italic>), is feeding on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> buds.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0242486.g001"/></fig><p>In this study, we characterize the complex interaction that links wasps, parasites and trumpet creepers using a step-by-step empirical and multidisciplinary approach, that is often missing in studies on parasite manipulation [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We first performed a series of laboratory bioassays to evaluate the feeding preference of wasps (in the presence or absence of the parasite) towards fresh buds, rich of secreting EFNs, or treated buds, deprived of these secretions. Second, to assess whether peculiar traits of the EFNs may explain wasps&#x02019; attraction towards trumpet creepers, we explored the distribution, the structure and the ultrastructure of EFNs secreting cells covering the calyx of fresh buds by means of optic and scanning electron microscopy and histochemical analysis. Then, using HPLC-DAD-MS, we analysed the content of the secondary metabolites obtained from the extracts of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> buds at different stages of growth, with and without secreting EFNs. Finally, we tested whether the administration of verbascoside, the most abundant phenolic compound found in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> extracts of sepals rich of EFNs, can act as an immunostimulant in parasitized and non-parasitized wasps: this investigation was motivated by the fact that verbascoside is known for its bioactive properties. We hypothesize a scenario of parasite manipulation, where the selective feeding behavior of parasitized wasps, focused on EFNs, activates their immune system through the intake of verbascoside.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample collection and rearing</title><p>In June 2018 we collected 25 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>dominula</italic> females parasitized by <italic>X</italic>. <italic>vesparum</italic> (13 infected by one male, 12 by one female) and 20 non-parasitized wasps, from 3 flowering bushes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> in the plain of Sesto Fiorentino (Florence, Italy: 43&#x000b0; 50&#x02019; 7&#x0201d; N, 11&#x000b0; 11&#x02019; 46&#x0201d; E). A second set of wasps emerged in captivity from 16 colonies collected in the same area: these were 24 parasitized wasps (13 infected by one male, 11 by one female) and 24 non-parasitized wasps. Wasps (93 in all) were housed in glass boxes (15x15x15 cm) at room temperature (26 &#x000b1; 2 C<sup>&#x02218;</sup>), with water and sugar ad libitum. The head-width of wasps was measured with a dial caliper to the nearest 0.05 mm as proxy for body size [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This was used to unveil any possible effect of parasitism on host size that could affect feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Preference bioassays</title><p>To investigate the attractive features of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> buds, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>dominula</italic> wasps were subjected to feeding preference tests in relation to parasite (parasitized or non-parasitized), rearing environment (emerged in the field or in the laboratory), bud&#x02019;s (fresh or treated) and different bud&#x02019;s treatments. We presented wasps with 3 binary choices: an untreated fresh bud, collected just before the test, versus a treated bud: (trial 1) a withered bud, detached from the plant 24 h before; (trial 2) a fresh bud washed for 5 min in a mixture of ethanol:water 1:1 or (trial 3) hexane:water 1:1, in order to remove potentially attractive polar and apolar components. The experimental apparatus consisted in a glass box (15x15x15 cm) with two circular holes at the opposite corners of the top panel, where two 3 cm long buds protruded from 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for half their size. Following each trial, tubes and buds were replaced and the apparatus was carefully washed with 96% ethanol.</p><p>A single wasp was introduced in the apparatus and tested only once. Trials were performed on three different days between 11.00 and 16.00 hours, when wasps are more active. Sugar was removed from the home cage 24 h before the trial, in order to promote foraging activity. Ten out of 93 wasps (5 parasitized and 5 non-parasitized) were inactive and did not approach any bud; these subjects were therefore excluded from the analysis. One observer, blind to the experimental conditions, recorded directly for how long the wasp rubbed the tips of its antennae (i.e. &#x0201c;antennation&#x0201d;, to detect chemical cues from the substrate) and scratched the surface of the buds with its jaws, moving rhythmically its abdomen during ingestion (i.e. &#x0201c;feeding&#x0201d;). The duration of antennation and sucking were clumped together as &#x0201c;time spent on buds&#x0201d;; we used these temporal data as usual proxy for wasp&#x02019;s choice index [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since the time spent on buds did not last more than 30 sec, we opted to measure 0&#x02013;30 sec from the first contact to each stimulus bud.

However, when the content of verbascoside was expressed as mg per bud, the difference was minimal: 0.76 mg<sub>verb</sub> for large buds and 0.79 mg<sub>verb</sub> for small buds.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0242486.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0242486.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Content of verbascoside expressed as mg of verbascoside per gram of tissue and as mg of verbascoside per bud.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0242486.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0242486.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Sample</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">mg/g</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">mg/bud</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Calyx with secretory EFNs</bold></td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.45</td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Calyx without secretory EFNs</bold></td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.03</td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Small buds</bold></td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.78</td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.79</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Large buds</bold></td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.13</td><td align="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.76</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Immunocompetence assays</title><p>Wasps treated with extracts of verbascoside, both parasitized and non-parasitized, showed a significant reduction of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> loads compared to wasps fed with sugar or maltodextrin solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242486.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

We investigated this unusual feeding behavior by means of a combined approach of structural and chemical analyses, and preference and immune assays. We present four main experimental results: (1) wasps show a marked preference for fresh untreated buds of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic>, covered with EFNs, than for treated buds, deprived of nectar drops and, when parasitized, they spend more time foraging on fresh buds than non-parasitized wasps; (2) fresh buds of trumpet creepers are rich in EFNs, whose histochemical and structural features denote the secretion of phenolic compounds; (3) the most abundant compound in these secretions is verbascoside, a bio-active molecule known in traditional medicine for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antineoplastic and antifungal properties [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; (4) ingestion of verbascoside enhances wasps&#x02019; ability to clear a bacterial infection, especially when parasitized.</p><p>The marked attraction of parasitized wasps to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> flowering bushes, here confirmed by preference assays, is intriguing. Wasps preferred to forage on fresh untreated buds, regardless of parasite or treatment. Thus, visual cues alone, i.e. the bright orange colour of buds, retained also by buds withered or washed with solvents, were not the main driver for wasps&#x02019; choice compared to chemical cues. Interestingly, parasitized wasps spent more time than non-parasitized wasps on untreated fresh buds. The result clearly suggests that the presence of the parasite <italic>X</italic>. <italic>vesparum</italic> influences the wasp&#x02019;s attraction for fresh buds, especially in field-collected wasps, probably due to their previous foraging experience on trumpet creepers. Parasite sex did not affect the time that the host spent foraging on fresh buds. However, our observations were performed during an early phase of the foraging season (summer), while later on the scenario might change due to different energetic demands of wasps infected by female versus male parasites. In fact, only female-infected wasps can overwinter, due to their large fat bodies, while wasps parasitized by males have scanty lipid storage and will die at the end of summer [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The abundance of EFNs on fresh buds of trumpet creeper [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], secreting sucrose, fructose and glucose, has been documented in Bignoniaceae [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], as well as the secretion of verbascoside and further phenylpropanoid glycosides in the genus <italic>Campsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The peculiarity of trumpet creepers is the high concentration of a single compound, verbascoside, in their fresh floral buds, an unexpected result. Thanks to our in-depth electron microscopy approach we were able to reveal the specialized glandular structure of EFNs supporting the secretion of high amounts of phenolic compounds. Verbascoside is a disaccharide caffeoyl ester and a secondary metabolite, displaying important antibacterial and antioxidant effects. This compound has been detected in more than 200 plant species worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and is thought to be produced by the plant as a defence mechanism against parasites and foliage-feeding caterpillars, but its oral toxicity is dose-dependent in insects [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], as well as in other organisms (e.g. vertebrates) [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Our study shows that the intake of a low dosage of verbascoside, consistent with a scenario where wasps feeds on buds and are exposed to natural EFNs concentrations, enhances the wasp&#x02019;s immune response. If we combine this observation with the longer time spent on EFNs by parasitized wasps with respect to non-parasitized ones, other major finding of this study, it becomes natural to hypothesize a parasitic adaptive manipulation of host feeding behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is a subtle strategy operated by several parasites [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] like Strepsiptera that are able to consume host resources without seriously compromising host development [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In line with the parasite manipulation hypothesis, the consumption of verbascoside might increase the survival of the host, which is the vehicle of the infection, by boosting its immune response against a range of possible pathogens, including bacteria. This can be achieved in several ways, for example by increasing the number of circulating hemocytes, by mounting a stronger antibacterial response or by increasing the expression of the immune genes like <italic>defensin</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>An alternative explanation for the attraction of parasitized wasps to trumpet creepers is that they are in poor health conditions and might seek plant secretions simply to feed on the sugary solutions that they contain. However, this explanation seems unlikely, since when the wasp emerges as an adult the parasite stops draining host resources [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Moreover, in the laboratory the hourly frequency of foraging for sugar cubes did not differ between parasitized and non-parasitized wasps, regardless of the parasite&#x02019;s sex [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and field observations showed that parasitized wasps did not visit indiscriminately any flowering bushes but they gathered preferentially on trumpet creepers [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and other selected plants [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that are rich in EFNs and possibly in bioactive compounds (i.e., <italic>Morus</italic>, <italic>Vitis</italic>, <italic>Hedera</italic>, <italic>Cynara</italic>, <italic>Populus</italic> spp). As a third possible explanation for the phenomenon we observed in this study, the consumption of EFN secretions containing verbascoside might be interpreted as an example of self-medication against parasites and infections [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Nevertheless, this altered feeding behaviour does not appear to have any detrimental effect neither for the strepsipterans nor for non-parasitized wasps, as one would expect in a traditional scenario of therapeutic self-medication [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. On the contrary, the immune response of both non-parasitized and parasitized wasps was enhanced by verbascoside with respect to controls.</p><p>In conclusion, we hypothesize that the presence of the parasite and the administration of verbascoside have a synergistic effect against pathogenic infection and may lengthen host lifespan: a critical feature for parasite transmission [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242486.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Moreover, it is possible that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic>, thanks to EFNs secretions, enhances wasps&#x02019; foraging behavior and therefore gains defence against insect pests also attracted to trumpet creepers. More studies in the future must be undertaken to explore the relevant role of wasps in plant defence, a topic that has started to be investigated only recently [<xref rid="pone.0242486.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. If <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic> offers, besides nutrients and shelter, also additive therapeutic extra-floral secretions to wasps in change of anti-herbivore defence, then it would be fascinating to hypothesize the existence of a three-way interaction between wasps, parasites and medical plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0242486.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Preference bioassays.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0242486.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0242486.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Verbascoside and chromatographic profiles at different wavelengths.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0242486.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0242486.s003"><label>S1 Video</label><caption><title>Parasitized <italic>P</italic>. <italic>dominula</italic> wasps feeding and defending the buds of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>radicans</italic>.</title><p>(AVI)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0242486.s003.avi"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Rita Cervo, Stefano Turillazzi and the members of the Florence Group for the Study of Social Wasps, first of all to Irene Pepiciello, for their assistance during this study, both in the field and in the laboratory.

The manuscript uses and interesting approach combining laboratory bioassays, chemical analysis HPLC-DAD-MS and testing the immunocompetence of one of the compounds found in abundance in extra-floral nectarines. I found this manuscript interesting and rich in details.</p><p>I have just a couple of questions and suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>At Ln 81, the authors suggest that the investigations motivated by the fact that verbascoside is known for its bioactive properties. Although I see that maybe this was maybe the most important compound found by the authors, I would like to see the identification and quantification of the other big compounds, because it would justify the choice of only test verbascoside (Fig S3).</p><p>Response &#x02013; Following the reviewer suggestion, we clarified this point. The figure reported as Fig. S3 was a 100-times zoom in the range 7-19 minutes of the original chromatographic profile of the extract. To make this more clear for the reader, the original profile is now reported together with the zoom in the figure S3. As it clearly appears with this new figure, there are no big compounds other than verbascoside. However, among the minor peaks, the biggest two (retention time about 12.0 and 12.6 minutes) have been identified as verbascoside related compounds (according to the very similar UV-vis spectra) with mass spectra that indicate a molecular weight of 638 Da and 668 Da. With these data, these compounds can be tentatively identified as ethyl-&#x003b2;-OH-acteoside (668 Da) and eukovoside (638 Da). The amount of the two peaks is below 5% of verbascoside content, consequently, we only quantified verbascoside (see Alipieva et al. 2014 for conflicting reports regarding the designation of verbascoside).</p><p>Furthermore, by MS analysis some compounds present in trace amount have been identified as the verboascoside related compounds &#x003b2;-OH-acteoside isomer 1 and &#x003b2;-OH-acteoside isomer 2, and the flavonol rutin. This information was added to supplementary materials (lines 78-90).</p><p>Another question is, if mostly parasitized wasps are found in the plant, how the compound could increase the immune system by the intake of verbascoside? Although during parasite host manipulation, the parasite Xenus vesparum would manipulate the host to be somehow healthier? Did the authors expect this outcome? </p><p>Response - In accordance with the reviewer, we hypothesized that the parasite manipulates the feeding behaviour of the host prompting the wasp to search for Campsis bushes to feed on EFNs. Since verbascoside was the most abundant compound found in EFNs&#x02019;extracts, and given its antioxidant and antibacterial properties, we hypothesized that the ingestion of verbascoside would enhance the host&#x02019;s ability to clear a bacterial infection. Preference bioassays and Immunecompetence assays, with a marked preference of parasitized wasps for fresh buds and a higher degree of bacterial clearance in wasps treated with verbascoside are consistent with this hypothesis. </p><p>What is the explanation to the fact that small buds have more compounds?</p><p>Response - The number of EFNs, covering bud surface, is higher in 7 small buds than in 3 large buds, thus the content of verbascoside expressed as mg of verbascoside per gram of tissue is double in small buds in comparison to large buds, while the concentration is similar if we consider mg of verbascoside per bud (lines 287-292 and Table 2). We hypothesized that the function of elevated concentration of verbascoside (especially in younger, developing buds) is to defend the extrafloral nectaries from consumers (florivores) (lines 290-291). The higher concentration of secondary metabolites in younger/developing plant tissues as reported in:</p><p>Achakzai, A. K. K., Achakzai, P., Masood, A., Kayani, S. A., &#x00026; Tareen, R. B.

Impact of various factors responsible for fluctuation in plant secondary metabolites. Journal of Applied Research on Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, 2(4), 105-113.</p><p>Small comments:</p><p>Ln 170: The immune challenge was performed 7 days after the first administration. Why is that?</p><p>Response &#x02013; The immune challenge was performed the 7th day after the first administration because we administered our verbascoside doses on three different times: day 1, 3 and 5, to avoid a high dose in a single feeding event and to simulate a natural foraging, while on day 2, 4 and 6 we left the wasps undisturbed, then on day 7 we performed our immune challenge.</p><p>Ln 172 Delete: (Schmid-Hempel 2005; Charlen and Killian 2015)</p><p>Response - the correction was made.</p><p>Change letters of figures to capital.</p><p>Response &#x02013; the corrections were made.</p><p>About Figure S3, what are those two peaks on the sides of verbascoside?
