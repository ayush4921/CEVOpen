    "Phytochemical research based on ethnopharmacology is gaining interest in industries such as functional food, nutraceuticals, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Plants and plant extracts are a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites. These compounds are often involved in plant protection against biotic or abiotic stresses. The exploitation of available technologies should be oriented and intensified to extend and enhance the continued usefulness of the plants as renewable sources of chemicals, especially medicinal compounds. This current contribution is focused on extraction and analytical techniques for their isolation from the oregano species, their characterization and their potential antioxidative, as well as their antimicrobial, antifungal and anticarcinogenic properties. The work is structured rendering to the different steps involved in the research; starting with extraction and sample preparation, followed by discussing the analytical techniques employed for the isolation and identification of compound/s responsible for the biological activity and methods and techniques for biological activity assessment."
