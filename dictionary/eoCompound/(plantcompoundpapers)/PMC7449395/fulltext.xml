Plasmids able to transfer by CT often encode beneficial traits for bacterial survival under specific environmental conditions. <italic>Rhizobium etli</italic> CFN42 is a Gram-negative bacterium of agricultural relevance due to its symbiotic association with <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> through the formation of Nitrogen-fixing nodules. The genome of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> CFN42 consists of one chromosome and six large plasmids. Among these, pRet42a has been identified as a conjugative plasmid. The expression of the transfer genes is regulated by a <italic>quorum sensing</italic> (QS) system that includes a <italic>traI</italic> gene, which encodes an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase and two transcriptional regulators (TraR and CinR). Recently, we have shown that pRet42a can perform CT on the root surface and inside nodules. The aim of this work was to determine the role of plant-related compounds in the CT of pRet42a. We found that bean root exudates or root and nodule extracts induce the CT of pRet42a in the plant rhizosphere. One possibility is that these compounds are used as nutrients, allowing the bacteria to increase their growth rate and reach the population density leading to the activation of the QS system in a shorter time. We tested if <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> compounds could substitute the bacterial AHL synthesized by TraI, to activate the conjugation machinery. The results showed that the transfer of pRet42a in the presence of the plant is dependent on the bacterial QS system, which cannot be substituted by plant compounds. Additionally, individual compounds of the plant exudates were evaluated; among these, some increased and others decreased the CT. With these results, we suggest that the plant could participate at different levels to modulate the CT, and that some compounds could be activating genes in the conjugation machinery.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>PAPIIT, DGAPA, UNAM</institution></funding-source><award-id>IN212920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5560-6283</contrib-id><name><surname>Brom</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>ANPCYT</institution></funding-source><award-id>PICT2016-0210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2508-0292</contrib-id><name><surname>Torres Tejerizo</surname><given-names>Gonzalo A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>CONICET</institution></funding-source><award-id>PIP 2014-0420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2508-0292</contrib-id><name><surname>Torres Tejerizo</surname><given-names>Gonzalo A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship 384814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1887-0317</contrib-id><name><surname>Ba&#x000f1;uelos-Vazquez</surname><given-names>Luis Alfredo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grant IN212920 from PAPIIT, DGAPA, UNAM to SB and grants PICT2016-0210 and PIP 2014-0420 to GTT.

Conjugation is considered as the main mechanism of DNA exchange between bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which may belong to the same or different species. CT even occurs between organisms from different kingdoms [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The molecular mechanism of CT has been described and usually involves several proteins that participate in DNA processing and in the assembly of the conjugative pore; consequently, activation of CT results in an expensive metabolic burden that has to be tightly regulated [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different mechanisms have evolved to regulate the synthesis of the proteins that are needed for CT. Molecules from the environment or synthetized by diverse organisms have been pointed out as regulators of the CT machinery: antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], peptides [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], plant molecules [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], metals [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] act directly or indirectly with transcriptional activators/repressors.</p><p>Rhizobia are bacteria that grow in soils and interact with plants. Many of them have properties that improve the plant growth, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. they are able to convert the atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia in a specific-developed organ, the nodule, generated on the plant roots. Due to this property, rhizobia are used as bioinoculants, providing a cheaper and ecological friendly procedure for plant fertilization [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the nodule formation and the establishment of the symbiosis, the plant secretes flavonoids under low nitrogen conditions, which in the proper rhizobia induce the production of <underline>n</underline>odulation <underline>f</underline>actors (NFs). NFs start a complex signaling pathway in the plant, that includes duplication of the cells in the legume roots and several biochemical changes that prepare the plant for the rhizobial infection and finish with the nodules formation [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Commonly, rhizobia harbor one or more (mega) plasmids, which differ in their sizes (from a few Kbp to Mbp) [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In some cases, these plasmids carry determinants needed for the nitrogen fixation functions, among others. Transfer of rhizobial plasmids through conjugation has been described for different species belonging to the <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic>. In 2009, Ding et al. [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] classified the plasmids of rhizobia into different groups; those that are regulated by quorum-sensing (QS) -Group I-, by the <italic>rctA-rctB</italic> genes -Group II- and a third and fourth groups were proposed, whose regulation is still fuzzy -Groups III and IV- [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This classification was based on the phylogenetic analysis of the relaxase (<italic>traA</italic>). The plasmids regulated by QS, generally have a master transcriptional regulator, TraR (LuxR family regulators), which usually binds a specific AHL to activate the transcription of the genes needed for CT. These genes process and prepare the DNA for transfer (DTR) or encode components for the mating pair formation (MPF) structure. It has been recently described that in the plasmids belonging to Group I, regulated by QS, the phylogenetic analysis of TraR shows four different subgroups [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Group I-A is mainly composed by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> plasmids, where plant signals and AHLs are needed for the activation of transfer [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The regulation of most plasmids from group I-B is based on AHLs [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The regulation of plasmids from group I-C does not rely on QS, nevertheless, it depends on a TraR regulator and on the genomic background [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Also, plasmid pRL8JI from group I-C was described to respond to homoserine, a compound found in peas exudates [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There are no evidences yet about regulation of plasmids belonging to group I-D.</p><p>Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs), similarly to plasmids, can be transferred between bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ICEs from rhizobia, also known as Symbiotic Islands (SI), usually harbor genes needed for nodule formation and nitrogen fixation [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ICE<italic>Ml</italic>sym<sup>R7A</sup> from <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> and ICE<sup><italic>Ac</italic></sup> from <italic>Azorhizobium caulinodans</italic> are the most studied SIs [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These SIs can be transferred and, remarkably, their transfer mechanism can be regulated by QS [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or by plant compounds [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The transfer of ICE<italic>Ml</italic>sym<sup>R7A</sup> relies on a QS mechanism that involves a LuxRI system and hypothetical genes that regulate the excision and transfer of the element [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It was recently demonstrated that the flavanone naringenin enhances the conjugative transfer of the SI of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>caulinodans</italic> in the rhizosphere of <italic>Sesbania rostrata</italic>, through a mechanism that involves a <italic>lysR-</italic>like gene, homologous to one of the master regulators of the induction of NFs production in the rhizobia, <italic>nodD</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Plasmid pRet42a, from <italic>Rhizobium etli</italic> CFN42, harbors a complete DTR and MPF region of genes and a QS-regulation, dependent on AHLs [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, new regulators of CT were identified on this plasmid [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

This phenomenon led us to consider that a set of plant molecules could be involved in the modulation of CT of pRet42a. To address this question, we performed CT experiments in presence and absence of bean plants (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>). Seedlings of two days post germination (dpg) were introduced in tubes with nitrogen- free F&#x000e5;hraeus nutrient solution [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Tubes were inoculated with CFNX559 as a donor and CFN2001 as a recipient strain, and the CT frequencies were evaluated in the medium of the tubes (with or without plant), and on the root surface. CFNX559, the donor strain, has the red fluorescent protein marker (RFP) inserted into the chromosome and the green fluorescent protein marker (GFP) in pRet42a. Therefore, these cells have both fluorescences. When transferring the plasmid to the recipient cells that do not have any fluorescent marker, the transconjugants only express the GFP, allowing differential detection. The frequencies were evaluated at 1, 10- and 20-days-post-inoculation (dpi). The values of CT frequency obtained for the media with and without plants were very similar at 1 or 10 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, there were no transconjugants at 20 dpi in absence of plants, while there were CT events in the media from tubes containing plants. It is worth to mention that when comparing the number of donor and recipient bacteria at 10 dpi and 20 dpi, there were <italic>ca</italic>. 2&#x02013;4 million less CFU at 20 dpi. On the root surface, the CT frequencies at 10 and 20 dpi were relatively high and similar to that of media with plants. Nevertheless, CT was not observed in the rhizoplane at one dpi. A possible explanation is that 24 hours is not enough time for the bacteria to reach the root, attach and conjugate. The lack of transconjugants at 20 dpi and the decrease in donor and recipient bacteria in the plant-free media allows us to consider the possibility that this may be caused by a nutrient limitation in the absence of plants. Therefore, a similar experiment was made with the medium supplemented with N and C sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Addition of the N and C sources led to an increase of the CT in presence of bean plants at all time-points. Also, the CT frequency in the absence of plants at 1 and 10 dpi increased, but CT could still not be observed at 20 dpi. Moreover, we compared the conjugation frequency with two other plants: <italic>Zea mays</italic> (non-legume) and <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> (non-host-legume). CT evaluated in the medium where the plants were placed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) showed that, at one dpi the CT frequency in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mays</italic> was higher than in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic>, but at 10 and 20 days the CT was very similar among the three plants. This suggests that compounds released by <italic>Zea mays</italic> at the early times after inoculation may be more abundant, resulting in a richer medium for bacteria to reproduce and reach the QS threshold for conjugation in a shorter lapse. In addition, the bacteria that adhered to the root surface were analyzed. The results showed that there was no significant difference at 10 and 20 dpi, while CT was not observed at one dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). All these results taken together suggest that plants play an important role in the CT of pRet42a.</p><fig id="pone.0238218.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0238218.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>CT frequency in response to presence of different plants and conditions.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Evaluation of CT frequencies of pRet42a in presence or absence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> and on the root surface, in media without C and N sources. <bold>B.</bold> Evaluation of CT frequencies of pRet42a in presence or absence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>, and on the root surface, in media supplemented with C and N. <bold>C.</bold> Evaluation of CT frequencies of pRet42a in media, in presence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mays</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic>. <bold>D.</bold> Evaluation of CT frequencies of pRet42a on the roots of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mays</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic>.

Conjugation assays were performed in presence of three different concentrations of seven flavonoids: naringenin, genistein, quercetin, acetosyringone, luteolin, apigenin and gallic acid. At a 2 &#x003bc;M concentration, two compounds enhanced CT, naringenin and apigenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). At concentrations of 20 &#x003bc;M, none of the flavonoids showed significant differences compared to the control, although naringenin showed a tendency to higher values than the other molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

It should be noted that a mixture of the seven flavonoids did not show differences with control values, at any concentration, indicating that a specific proportion of the different molecules is needed.

Specifically, three conditions of the rhizosphere or inside the nodules were evaluated. First, experiments were performed to evaluate plasmid transfer in response to a reduced oxygen condition, similar to that observed inside the nodule. We obtained higher conjugation frequency values in a low O<sub>2</sub> environment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">materials and methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting that this condition inside the nodule may be partially responsible for the CT induction observed in our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, we compared plasmid transfer between two different media; minimal and enriched media. We found that in an enriched media, conjugation is remarkably higher than in minimal media, suggesting that the nutrients provided by the plant to the nodule could also contribute to enhance conjugation in the rhizosphere and inside the nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

CT requires a set of proteins that have to recognize the origin of transfer, make a cleavage on it and couple the DNA strand to the system that will transfer it, mainly through a T4SS, which is also known as MPF. During the whole process, several proteins are needed, thus, it is an energetically expensive process. To avoid draining the cellular energy, several mechanisms of CT regulation have been found. In rhizobia, there are mainly two mechanisms, (QS and <italic>rctA/B</italic>, see introduction for details; [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]), but recently, molecules from the environment have been described as inductors of CT. Flavonoids produced by <italic>Sesbania rostrata</italic>, induce the transfer of an 87.6-kb ICE [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, we have described that plasmid pRet42a from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> CFN42 is transferred at high rates inside the nodules developed by <italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> and on the root surface [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. With the goal of extending the knowledge, and understanding the high rates of CT observed during the symbiotic process, we characterized the response of the CT of pRet42a to compounds produced by different plants and to some environmental conditions.</p><p>Our first strategy was to perform conjugations in presence and absence of distinct plants (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic>) at different times. This strategy is also supported by previous works, which described that homoserine, a compound secreted by pea plants induces CT of pRL8JI [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our results showed that the sole presence of the plant plays an important role in increasing the conjugation frequency. This phenomenon could be due to secretion of signals that can be involved in regulation of CT, secretion of metabolites that the bacteria could use as energy supplies or as a support where the bacteria can adhere and conjugate. Moreover, the lack of transconjugants (and the reduction of donor and recipient bacteria) at 20 dpi in absence of plants was remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This result suggests that plants could also be important for long-term bacterial survival. Plants secrete a wide spectrum of molecules, including sugars, aminoacids, phenolic compounds, lipids and even nucleotides [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. All these molecules could directly enhance CT or also be used as nutrients, supporting the hypothesis that they may be involved in survival of the bacteria.</p><p>Following this research line, we evaluated if the exudates or the compounds secreted by the plant affected the CT. The results indicate that exudates from the native host plant, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic>, and also from non-native host plants as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>mays</italic>, can act as conjugative transfer inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g002">Fig 2</xref>). It has been described that the composition of exudates differs from one plant to another [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the CT could be changing according to the composition and quantity of the molecules present in the different exudates. Another possibility is that differences in the proportion of molecules in the two exudates are responsible for the levels of CT induction, since certain specific compounds can increase CT while others limit it. Nodule and root extracts were also evaluated as inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The values obtained were also above the control. Thus, some molecules present both in roots and nodules may modulate the CT. Based on the non-additive effect of both fractions, the molecules involved could be very similar or act through the same molecular mechanism. This induction could explain the high frequency obtained inside the nodules [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Flavonoids are key molecules in rhizobia-legume symbiosis. The specificity of their response determines the outcome of the symbiotic relationship [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The bacteria induce the expression of <italic>nod</italic> genes in response to some flavonoids. For these reasons, the role of flavonoids was evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Naringenin and apigenin showed induction of CT while quercetin showed, at high concentrations, a negative effect on CT rates. Apigenin shows a higher induction of CT when present in concentrations of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;M, while induction with naringenin seems to be constant at different concentrations. It has been described that the transfer of the SIs of <italic>Azorhizobium caulinodans</italic> is induced by plant-secreted flavonoids through AhaR, a LysR-family protein homolog of NodD [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In <italic>Rhizobium tropici</italic> CIAT 899, an AraC-type regulator protein named OnfD was recently described [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. OnfD is involved in the synthesis of NFs and may form heterodimers with NodD, thus playing a role in the transcriptional activation of the <italic>nod</italic> genes. A possible explanation for our results is that, in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> CFN42, flavonoids (or other plants compounds) interact either with an unknown regulator from the LysR-family (<italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> CFN42 has 69 annotated proteins from the LysR-family of proteins) or with NodD (<italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> CFN42 has three copies of NodD), to form a complex, which may modulate (indirectly or directly) the expression of genes involved in CT. Further experiments are needed to resolve which are the genes and targets involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g006">Fig 6</xref>). To gain insight about the genes and molecules involved in this signaling, two strategies could be performed. In a first approach, induction of CT by plant compounds could be studied in plasmid-cured derivatives of CFN42, to determine if genes present in these replicons are needed for induction of CT, similar to the strategy performed by Yost et al [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Another alternative could be to use transcriptional fusions of the regulatory regions of <italic>tra</italic> genes and evaluate, in an extensive way, the effect of other compounds [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It cannot be disregarded that regulators with XRE-domains (helix-turn-helix domain) could be involved in the detection of plant molecules. XRE regulators have been described in pRet42a of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>etli</italic> CFN42 as RHE_PA00165 [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], in pRleVF39b of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>leguminosarum</italic> VF39SM as <italic>trbR</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and in ICE<italic>Ml</italic>SymR7A of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>loti</italic> as <italic>qseC</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. RHE_PA00165 is needed by pRet42a for its transfer from genomic backgrounds different than the wild-type. In <italic>R</italic>. <italic>leguminosarum</italic> VF39SM, a mutation in <italic>trbR</italic> leads to an increase in pRleVF39b CT.

Despite that transfer responds to different AHLs, the interaction between AHLs produced by TraI and TraR/CinR regulators is essential for pRet42a transfer. In the Modulatory System (Bottom), we propose a mechanism for the effect of flavonoids, other plant compounds and environmental signals as low oxygen conditions. For flavonoids and other plant compounds (triangles), we propose an interaction with pRet42d encoded NodD regulators, or with other LysR-like regulators present in other replicons. Since NodD-flavonoids triggers Nod Factors expression, a similar mechanism could be involved in the modulation of CT of pRet42a. For the other signals, as O<sub>2</sub> concentration, an unknown protein (star) could sense the signal and then modulate transfer genes expression. These &#x0201c;star&#x0201d; proteins might be the hypothetical proteins located between Dtr and Mpf genes. The dotted line indicates that the contained replicons could produce AHLs (Top) or LysR-like proteins (Bottom). Green arrows indicate activation or production; red arrows indicate repression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0238218.g006"/></fig><p>QS signal mimics produced by plants have been described to interfere with the QS communication between bacteria; this appears to be particularly prevalent among nodulating plants [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A mutation in <italic>traI</italic> abolishes transfer of pRet42a under laboratory conditions [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To find out if some of the flavonoids or other compound from the plant could be acting through the QS system, we evaluated if the presence of the plant could replace the AHL of pRet42a. The results showed that the <italic>traI</italic> mutant was unable to transfer in presence of the plant, indicating that plant secreted compounds could not substitute the bacterial AHL for CT activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Even if plant compounds could form a complex to modulate CT, the regulatory circuit between AHLs and TraR is indispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the effect of some environmental conditions was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Usually, CT of rhizobial plasmids is evaluated on plates with solid medium. Nevertheless, some reports show that a non-rhizobial plasmid (RP4) is transferred from a rhizobia strain in liquid medium [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We observed that pRet42a was able to conjugate well in liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238218.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To our knowledge, there is no other published evidence of conjugation of rhizobial plasmids in liquid media. These findings may imply that the Mpf genes of pRet42a encode a flexible pilus [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0238218.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The CT rates in rich media were higher than in minimal media, suggesting that nutrient availability, and thus cellular energy content, positively affects conjugation. In a low O<sub>2</sub> environment (emulating the conditions inside the nodule), CT frequencies were slightly higher. These results could explain that this condition inside the nodule may be partially responsible for the plasmid behavior observed in our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0238218.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], where the CT was high inside the nodules.</p><p>Transfer of plasmids via conjugation and the mechanisms involved in the molecular regulation of this phenomenon are still under study. Here, the role of environmental conditions and diverse compounds produced by the plant were evaluated. These results showed that CT may be modulated by different molecules, where alternative regulatory mechanisms could be involved. Thus, the panorama gets more complex, including more (new) actors that should be analyzed in the near future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>LGC and AL are fellows of CONICET.

The current work seeks to address the nature of the effect of the plant on transfer. Different plants were examined (Corn, Alfalfa and Bean) and all promoted transfer, perhaps due to nutritional effects. Exudates from seeds/roots of alfalfa and bean were compared and there was a stronger effect of the host plant, bean. Known plant compounds were tested for stimulatory effects on conjugation, and an effect of two nodulation inducers, apigenin and naringenin, was noted. In all cases, transfer by conjugation required the AHL type QS system previously shown to be involved in transfer of this plasmid.</p><p>Overall this is a very well organized piece of work that adds to the story. It is very well written and easy to follow. I do not have too much to criticize except for minor editorial things (see below), but do have some suggestions for improving the paper or directing future work. Some of this might go in the discussion.</p><p>1) It should probably be cited that conjugation of the plasmid pRL8JI (also a type I conjugation system) is stimulated by homoserine, a non-protein amino acid that is present in high concentration in pea root exudates (Vanderlinde et al. 2014, Environ Microbiol 16: 205-217).</p><p>2) Some speculation as to other compounds that might be specific to beans or legumes in general would not be a bad idea. It is a little disappointing to look only at nod gene inducers.</p><p>3) Do the effects of naringenin and apigenin depend on the presence of a functional nodD gene ? This could be assayed fairly easily in a pSym cured derivative of CFN42, like your recipient, once it has acquired the p42a.</p><p>4) Ways of getting at what the particular compounds in exudates might be could be discussed. In this context the method used in Rosenblueth et al. (1998, MGG, 258:587) and Yost et al. (2004, Microbiology, 152:2061) could be mentioned. I.e. depletion of nutrients in exudates by plasmid cured strains to see what is left over and still has the ability to induce transfer.</p><p>5) More could be made of the fact that genes encoding Xre-type regulators have been found in conjugation systems, including the one from pRetCFN42a, strongly suggesting additional effector molecules that have an input into regulation of transfer. It has always been a strong possibility that some plant produced compounds could be the effectors that interact with these regulators.</p><p>Many experts in the field don't like the use of the word "conjugal" and much prefer conjugative.

Obtained results indicate that quorum sensing system is playing the main role in the regulation, but also that compounds in plant root exudates may modulate the extent of conjugal transfer.</p><p>The results are interesting and novel, tough not conclusive over a mechanistic interpretation of the phenomenon. Consequently, the paper is mainly descriptive, though opening the way to several future experiments. A key experiment for a more mechanistic report could be the used of a nodD gene mutant strain (see point 6 below).</p><p>However, there are many points which need to be clarified and additional details reported to allow readers to better understand the results and let reproduce the experiments shown. Possible simple additional experiments could also be performed (see below).</p><p>1. Line 144. Please indicate the OD600 or the number of cells used.</p><p>2. Line 146.

Why at at 20 dpi there were not transconjugants? This is really surprising since you observe transconjugants at 10 dpi. Were rhizobial cells titres comparable between 10 dpi and 20 dpi? Or rhizobial cells died after 10 dpi? This point strongly needs a clarification and hypotheses driven by possible additional control experiments, to support your sentence on line 352.</p><p>5. Line 232. Experiment with plant root exudates must be clarified. In particular to allow proper data reproducibility the amount of root exudates (in terms of key compounds or total carbon for instance) must be reported and normalization of treatments among root exudates with respect to for instance total C must be performed. Otherwise we cannot appreciate if differences among root exudates may relate to different chemical composition (i.e. presence of elicitors) or to nutrient supplementation. This would be an additional proof of what authors later clarified with synthetic medium.</p><p>6. Line 301. A figure with this hypothesis could be appreciated, where authors suggest the level where the interaction between plant compounds and QS system may occur.

It is a little disappointing to look only at nod gene inducers.</p><p>Response: Yes, we had not mentioned specific compounds, but in the discussion, we mentioned in lines 356-360: &#x0201c;Our results showed that the sole presence of the plant plays an important role in increasing the conjugation frequency. This phenomenon could be due to secretion of signals that can be involved in regulation of CT, secretion of metabolites that the bacteria could use as energy supplies or as a support where the bacteria can adhere and conjugate&#x0201d;. Now we have re-enforced these ideas in the Discussion (lines 362-366).</p><p>3) Do the effects of naringenin and apigenin depend on the presence of a functional nodD gene ? This could be assayed fairly easily in a pSym cured derivative of CFN42, like your recipient, once it has acquired the p42a.</p><p>Response: We do not know if the effect is mediated directly by a functional nodD, but we have to point out that CFN42 has three copies of nodD. We think, with evidence provided by Ling et al (2016), that it could be a LysR-like transcriptional activator (actually, there are 69 in the genome of R. etli CFN42), including the nodD genes, but also other proteins. Also, Ling et al found that AhaR is a LysR-like transcriptional activator that detects flavonoids. By BLASTp we found some proteins similar to AhaR in CFN42. Of course, this question needs to be addressed in the future and the assay suggested, using a pSym- cured derivative of CFN42, could be achieved when we are able (hopefully soon) to return to work in the lab. We included an appropriate discussion of this issue in the discussion of the manuscript (Lines 387-398).</p><p>4) Ways of getting at what the particular compounds in exudates might be could be discussed. In this context the method used in Rosenblueth et al. (1998, MGG, 258:587) and Yost et al. (2004, Microbiology, 152:2061) could be mentioned. I.e. depletion of nutrients in exudates by plasmid cured strains to see what is left over and still has the ability to induce transfer.</p><p>Response: Yes, the reviewer is right. Those papers describe strategies to search which molecules induce certain genes (using transcriptional fusions) or which replicon is needed to employ certain sugars. We discuss about these strategies and will direct some future work (Lines 398-404) </p><p>5) More could be made of the fact that genes encoding Xre-type regulators have been found in conjugation systems, including the one from pRetCFN42a, strongly suggesting additional effector molecules that have an input into regulation of transfer. It has always been a strong possibility that some plant produced compounds could be the effectors that interact with these regulators.</p><p>Response: We included this in the discussion (Lines 404-411). Regulators with Xre-domains (helix-turn-helix domain similar to that of the Lambda Cro and CI proteins) are regulators that have been described in pRet42a of R. etli CFN42 as RHE_PA00165 (Lopez-Fuentes et al., 2015), in pRleVF39b of R. leguminosarum VF39SM as trbR (Ding et al., 2013) and in ICEMlSymR7A of M. loti as qseC (Ramsay et al., 2013). RHE_PA00165 is needed by pRet42a to transfer from genomic backgrounds different from that of the wild-type. A mutation in trbR leads to a 1000-fold increase in pRleVF39b transfer. qseC modulates the excision and conjugative transfer of ICEMlSymR7A (Ramsay et al., 2013).</p><p>Many experts in the field don't like the use of the word "conjugal" and much prefer conjugative.

Lines 138-141: &#x0201c;Conjugations between the strains were done biparentally, using overnight cultures grown to stationary phase, ca. 1.2 OD600nm [25]. Conjugations in liquid medium were done as follows: donor and recipient strains were mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio in 5 ml of PY or MM medium at a final OD600nm of 0.05 and incubated at 30 &#x000ba;C overnight at 200 rpm.&#x0201d;</p><p>2.

The plant assay must be described in detail. For instance, the volume used and the number of plants and root lengths. The number of planted cells (did you perform dilutions? Which volume of plant medium was taken?)</p><p>Response: The Material and methods section was rewritten and the requested details were included. </p><p>Lines 142-148: &#x0201c; Conjugations with exudates and extracts of roots and nodules were done in liquid medium by mixing 2.5 ml of Fahraeus containing the exudates or extracts (or nitrogen-free Fahraeus nutrient solution as control), 2.5 ml of PY medium, 0.25 ml of donor and 0.25 ml recipient (each ca. 1.2 OD600nm). The mixtures were incubated at 30 &#x000ba;C overnight, and then centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 2 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 10 mM MgSO4 0.01% Tween 40 (vol/vol).&#x0201d;</p><p>Lines 158-174: &#x0201c;Seeds from P. vulgaris cv Negro Jamapa were sterilized and germinated as previously described by Ba&#x000f1;uelos-Vazquez et al [32]. Seedlings of two dpg (3-4 cm in length) were introduced in tubes with 40 ml of nitrogen-free Fahraeus nutrient solution [38] and in the indicated experiments, also supplemented with a carbon (succinic acid 0.01M) and nitrogen source (ammonium chloride 0.01M) [38]. Tubes were inoculated with donor and recipient strains adjusted at a final 0.05 OD600nm, in a 1:1 ratio. The conjugation frequency was measured at 1, 10 and 20 dpi. For each experiment, samples of three plants from medium in presence or absence of plants were collected. The 40 ml of medium from the tubes were centrifugated at 5000 rpm, supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mM MgSO4 0.01% Tween 40 (vol/vol). Serial dilutions were plated on the selective media supplemented with the corresponding antibiotics. Root samples were introduced in Falcon tubes with 30 ml of nitrogen-free Fahraeus nutrient solution and subjected to ultrasound for 20 min in a Branson 200 ultrasonic cleaner. Then, the roots were taken out and the medium was centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm, at 4 &#x000ba;C to recover the bacteria removed from the root's surface. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mM MgSO4 0.01% Tween 40 (vol/vol). Serial dilutions were plated on the selective media supplemented with the corresponding antibiotics. All experiments were repeated at least three times.&#x0201d;</p><p>4. Line 195-205. Why at at 20 dpi there were not transconjugants? This is really surprising since you observe transconjugants at 10 dpi. Were rhizobial cells titres comparable between 10 dpi and 20 dpi? Or rhizobial cells died after 10 dpi? This point strongly needs a clarification and hypotheses driven by possible additional control experiments, to support your sentence on line 352.</p><p>Response: Bacteria were plated 20 dpi, but when plants are not present, transconjugants did not grow. Donor and recipient titres were lower, indicating that a fraction of bacteria died. That is the reason that we suggest in (now line 361) &#x0201c;This result suggests that plants could also be important for long-term bacterial survival". </p><p>We modified the following sentences to clarify:</p><p>Line 202-204: &#x0201c;It is worth to mention that comparison of the number of donor and recipient bacteria at 10 dpi and 20 dpi, showed that there were ca. 2-4 million less UFC at 20 dpi.&#x0201d; </p><p>Line 207-210: &#x0201c;The lack of transconjugants at 20 dpi and the decrease in donor and recipient bacteria in the plant-free media allows us to consider the possibility that this may be caused by a nutrient limitation in the absence of plants&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 360-361: &#x0201c;Moreover, the lack of transconjugants (and the reduction of donor and recipient bacteria) at 20 dpi in absence of plants was remarkable&#x0201d;</p><p>5. Line 232. Experiment with plant root exudates must be clarified. In particular to allow proper data reproducibility the amount of root exudates (in terms of key compounds or total carbon for instance) must be reported and normalization of treatments among root exudates with respect to for instance total C must be performed. Otherwise we cannot appreciate if differences among root exudates may relate to different chemical composition (i.e. presence of elicitors) or to nutrient supplementation. This would be an additional proof of what authors later clarified with synthetic medium.</p><p>Response: As stated in response to query number 3, we modified Material and methods to provide the details and clarify the experiments. As the reviewer mentioned &#x0201c;we cannot appreciate if differences among root exudates may relate to different chemical composition or to nutrient supplementation&#x0201d;, we want to reinforce that exudates and extracts were only prepared in nitrogen-free Fahraeus nutrient solution. Thus, the differences observed among control and extracts or exudates, are due the presence of the molecules secreted by the plant, not by any nutrient supplementation.</p><p>We did not measure key compounds or total carbon in either exudates or extracts. Plant extracts and exudates could contain several hundreds of different compounds (Tawaraya et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2019) (we included some discussion about this in the discussion section). We think that not all the compounds will be used (or even detected) by the bacteria, thus, the amount of total carbon would not give much information and the chemical composition of the extracts and exudates are not the scope of the manuscript. Moreover, the molecules that regulate CT usually work at low concentrations, so the C contents could not reflect its potential as CT enhancer. Of course, it will be a future aim when we are able to go back to the laboratory, to identify the secreted molecules that are actually increasing the conjugative transfer.</p><p>6. Line 301. A figure with this hypothesis could be appreciated, where authors suggest the level where the interaction between plant compounds and QS system may occur. An additional experiment with null mutants of the flavonoid receptor could allow to better define the molecular level of interaction (see line 375).</p><p>Response: We do not know if the effect is mediated directly by a functional nodD, but we have to point out that CFN42 has three copies of nodD. We think, with evidence provided by Ling et al. (2016), it could be a LysR-like transcriptional activator (actually, there are 69 in the genome of R. etli CFN42: 46 in the chromosome, 6 in pRet42f, 8 in pRet42e, 5 in pRet42d -3 (nodD are included), 3 in pRet42c and 1 in pRet42b), this includes nodD genes, but also other proteins. We cannot disregard that the bioinformatics annotation could miss some others. Also, Ling et al. (2016) found that AhaR is a LysR-like transcriptional activator that detects flavonoids. By BLASTp we found some proteins similar to AhaR in CFN42. Thus, making a null mutant of flavonoid receptors would include at least a triple mutant and, nevertheless, many LysR-like genes would still be available in the genome. This question needs to be addressed in the future, when we are able to return to work in the lab. We have included an appropriate discussion of this issue in the manuscript and also a figure with our hypothesis (Lines 387-398).</p><p>Ding H, Yip CB &#x00026; Hynes MF (2013) Genetic characterization of a novel rhizobial plasmid conjugation system in R. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain VF39SM.

One very small issue that remains is that I don't think they quite grasped what I meant when I suggested using growth cured strains (or strains with mutations in given genes) to deplete the plant exudates and/or extracts of most the metaboliites. leaving behind only those that might induce transfer for the missing plasmid (this could indeed be assayed using fusions as they suggest). Such an approach would narrow down the number of compounds in exudates that might need to be screened. Not a big deal.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manuscript has been revised by authors and amended following the suggestions from the previous reviewing assessment.
