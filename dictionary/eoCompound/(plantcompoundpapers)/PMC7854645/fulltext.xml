Similarly, a number of secondary metabolites constituting chemical and structural defense, including flavonoids, hydroxycinnamates, stilbenoids, coumarins and lignins, showed greater accumulation while other resource-competing metabolite pathways were depleted. High soluble sugar generation, efficient sugar utilization, and suppression or remobilization of resource-competing metabolites potentially contributed to curb the tradeoff between the carbon and energy demanding processes induced by <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic>-Broccoli interaction. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive and integrated view of the temporal changes in plant metabolome associated with rhizobacteria-mediated plant growth promotion and induced resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biochemistry</kwd><kwd>Chemical biology</kwd><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Microbiology</kwd><kwd>Plant sciences</kwd><kwd>Systems biology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Plants allocate their photoassimilates for growth, storage, and defense, but they also release them into the rhizosphere feeding the microbial community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Such changes in plant secondary metabolism have costs associated with the biosynthesis, transport and storage of these molecules and with the competition for primary metabolites and energy needed for plant growth. The biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites depend on common precursors and have a trade-off at the biochemical level. Intriguingly, rhizobacteria are able to orchestrate balanced plant growth, plant defense and secondary metabolite production. Hence, investigation of how rhizobacteria influence plant primary and secondary metabolism can provide a road map of key metabolite targets that play a balancing act between plant growth and defense. Recent developments in metabolomics approaches provide valuable tools to assess the influence of rhizobacteria on the dynamics of primary and secondary metabolism and to identify key metabolite classes that have a broader impact on host plant growth and defense.</p><p id="Par4">In the present study, we investigated the effects of root-colonizing strains of three <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species on the phenotypes of two Broccoli cultivars, in particular on growth and defense against the bacterial leaf pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>.

Percent change in biomass was used as a measure to assess the growth-promoting effects of the <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species in the two Broccoli cultivars. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess the influence of the two independent variables (strains of <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species and Broccoli cultivars) on both shoot and root biomass. The <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species included three levels (<italic>Pbg</italic>, <italic>Pbh, Pbt</italic>) and the Broccoli cultivars consisted of two levels (Coronado, Malibu).

The <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> strains exerted a substantial impact on primary and secondary metabolism at both early and later stages of Broccoli seedling growth. Their biggest impact on primary metabolism was reflected in the generation and utilization of soluble sugars, and both parameters showed significant variation across the strains of the <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species-Broccoli cultivar combinations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). All combinations, except <italic>Pbt</italic>-Malibu, resulted in an effective partnership, i.e. plant growth promotion. These effective partnerships showed high soluble sugar generation at the early stage of seedling growth and high sugar utilization at the later stage of seedling growth, whereas the ineffective partnership between Malibu and <italic>Pbt</italic> showed a lower sugar generation and utilization. Soluble sugars are fuel for plant growth and for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites involved in defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Hence, the enhancement of the levels of plant soluble sugars such as sorbose and fructose by beneficial <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> strains can be considered as one of the metabolic signatures of an effective partnership. Furthermore, under effective partnership, there was significant depletion (&#x0003e;&#x02009;11-fold) of PEP, a key substrate for the TCA cycle and the shikimate pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), whereas PEP depletion was only about twofold in the ineffective partnership. Furthermore, greater depletion of GABA under the effective partnership suggests catabolism of GABA to succinyl semialdehyde followed by its conversion to succinate to feed the greater demand of pyruvate in the TCA cycle. Key intermediates in the TCA cycle such as citric acid and malic acid showed increased abundance under effective partnerships. In the TCA cycle, citrate is converted to malate and used in the mitochondria for energy production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

This suggests that the effects of elevated levels of soluble sugars might not only be limited to plant growth but also extended to secondary metabolites biosynthesis. For example, fructose is the primary substrate for fructose-6-phospate, a key substrate for the biosynthesis of both PEP and erythros-4-phosphate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The latter two intermediates are channeled to the shikimate pathway that bridges carbohydrate metabolism to biosynthesis of aromatic primary and secondary metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The shikimate pathway provides all the important precursors for the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds including hydroxycinnamates, flavonoids, stilbenoids, coumarins and lignins, that all showed significant accumulation in plants treated with <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

Another study, on quinoa cotyledons, also showed accumulation of both fructose (~&#x02009;tenfold) and flavonoids in response to UV-B radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Considering our results and these previous findings by others, we postulate that one of the key mechanisms by which rhizobacteria modulate host secondary metabolism is by soluble sugar generation.
</p><p id="Par23">In addition to enhancement of key precursors for growth and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, treatment of Broccoli roots with <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> also induced metabolite remobilization. The metabolite re-direction involved both suppression of resource competing metabolite pathways, such as amino acids, and rechanneling of existing primary metabolite-derivatives and other secondary metabolites to other metabolite pathways. For example, aromatic glucosinolates, amino acids and their derivatives, and some terpenoids showed more depletion under effective partnerships (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b2, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

The phenolic pathway in leaves appears to be the central target by the <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species and was altered more in Malibu than in Coronado (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

However, we could not trace metabolites that are specifically induced or reduced in Coronado cultivar that is primed with <italic>Pbg</italic> and <italic>Pbh</italic>. Priming is a complex process that alters various components of the plant immune system, including key plant hormones with a role in defence signalling (such as SA, JA and Ethylene), pathogenesis-related proteins and phytoalexins. Priming might have resulted in broad-spectrum/cross resistance or compromised resistance that is effective only against certain group of microbes/herbivores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Hence, the case of Coronado cultivar primed with <italic>Pbh</italic> and <italic>Pbg</italic> might fall under compromised resistance, and perhaps those plants might be resistant against other fungal/bacterial pathogens. Moreover, induced resistance against a pathogen might not exclusively be explained by the associated change in the metabolome as priming alters wide ranges of components of the plant immune machinery. Even the combined untargeted metabolite profiling used in our study does not cover all the metabolites that are produced during the interaction of the plants with the rhizobacteria. For example, metabolites of paramount importance in plant&#x02013;microbe interactions, such as phospholipids, other non-polar metabolites and volatile organic compounds were not analysed in our study. Profiling of such a wider array of metabolite groups could provide other metabolite signatures of induced disease susceptibility.
</p><p id="Par25">Defense priming is not a low-cost defensive measure but could cost substantial amounts of energy and carbon resources. This is shown by the massive accumulation of phenolics and other defensive compounds in plants treated with the strains of the <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species even before the plants were challenged with the bacterial leaf pathogens. The integrated primary and secondary metabolome profiling of primed plants suggests that rhizobacteria could avert the negative impact of defense priming on the host fitness by generating substantial amounts of soluble sugars and remobilizing other metabolites to accommodate for the high energy and carbon skeleton demand associated with growth and defense priming. This suggests that defense costs can be regulated, if resources are not limiting. This hypothesis aligns with studies that showed that the inevitability of growth-defense trade-off occurs primarily under resource-limiting conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">It should be noted that the physiological state of the plants grown on MS media in our experimental design may be different from that of Broccoli plants grown in agricultural fields.

Further extensive transcriptional and mutational analyses of the bacterial strains and its host plant as well as greenhouse and field trials will be the next steps for understanding of the functional importance of the specific changes in phenotype and metabolome induced by these rhizobacteria. These elaborate analyses also involving the model Brassica plant species Arabidopsis could lay a blueprint for a new microbiome-based plant breeding strategy to produce crops in which high yielding and stress-resilience go hand in hand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p id="Par27">The epiphytic rhizobacterial strains <italic>Paraburkholderia graminis</italic> PHS1 (<italic>Pbg</italic>), <italic>P. hospita</italic> mHSR1(<italic>Pbh</italic>), and <italic>P. terricola</italic> mHS1 (<italic>Pbt</italic>) used in this study were originally isolated from rhizospheric soil of <italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> grown in <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> suppressive soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.
