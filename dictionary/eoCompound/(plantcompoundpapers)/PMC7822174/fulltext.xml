Plants can also absorb and transform external organic compounds (xenobiotics). Currently there are only a few studies concerning the effects of xenobiotics and their transformation products on plant metabolites using a mass spectrometric untargeted screening strategy. This study was designed to investigate the changes of the <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> metabolome following/after diclofenac or carbamazepine incubation, using a serial coupling of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) combined with accurate high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). An untargeted screening strategy of metabolic fingerprints was developed to purposefully compare samples from differently treated <italic>P. australis</italic> plants, revealing that <italic>P. australis</italic> responded to each drug differently. When solvents with significantly different polarities were used, the metabolic profiles of <italic>P. australis</italic> were found to change significantly. For instance, the production of polyphenols (such as quercetin) in the plant increased after diclofenac incubation. Moreover, the pathway of unsaturated organic acids became more prominent, eventually as a reaction to protect the cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hence, <italic>P. australis</italic> exhibited an adaptive mechanism to cope with each drug.

Introduction</title><p>Throughout human history, plants have been the most important source for pioneering medicines, flavors and industrial materials. Plants produce up to 200,000 natural products with a vast chemical diversity using a wide range of enzymes and substrates [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among them, primary metabolites are relatively few and are defined as fundamental to plant physiology. In contrast, secondary metabolites (specialized metabolites) are essentially diverse. The high diversity of specialized metabolites leads to functional variation. Specialized metabolites play important roles in the interactions between the plant and its environment since they are involved in protection against environmental stress, competition or pollinator attraction and some are involved in vegetative or floral development. Furthermore, they play a vital role in the conception of environmental signals and their translation in biography traits. Therefore, they may play major roles in allowing the organism to sustain environmental constraints.</p><p>Among many other uses, plants have been used to restore environmental quality via adsorption and accumulation of organic xenobiotics (such as pesticides, dyes, drugs, etc.) inside their tissues. In the process of phytoremediation, plants can degrade these external compounds through a specific enzymatic scaffold consisting of three phases [<xref rid="B2-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this process, they utilize enzymes like cytochromes P450 or peroxidases to activate the xenobiotics in phase I and conjugating enzymes as glucosyl-transferases, malonyl-transferases or glutathione S-transferases in phase II for detoxification [<xref rid="B4-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Diclofenac (DCF) and carbamazepine (CBZ) belong to the problematic xenobiotics in European wastewater treatment plants since they can harm the ecotoxicological equilibrium. They have not only been detected in wastewater but also in biosolids and wastewater effluents [<xref rid="B6-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, the maximal measured concentrations of DCF and CBZ in municipal wastewater has ranged between 440 and 7100&#x02009;ng &#x000b7; L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1075&#x02013;6300 ng &#x000b7; L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of, respectively [<xref rid="B9-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DCF is one of the most commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, while CBZ has been used widely as an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer since the 1970s. Both DCF and CBZ are taken up and translocated into the aerial parts of plants, where they can be accumulated or metabolized into more or less toxic products [<xref rid="B7-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>One of these species is <italic>P. australis</italic>, known as &#x0201c;common reed&#x0201d;. <italic>P. australis</italic> belongs to the Poaceae family and is an invasive plant that spreads worldwide [<xref rid="B12-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been used for a long time in wetlands to remove pollutants, reduce nitrogen loads and provide oxygen to the rhizosphere [<xref rid="B5-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it is used as a resource for traditional crafts and fodder. In some regions like Northern China, it is grown as a crop and its leaves are used in the treatment of bronchitis and cholera [<xref rid="B12-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The chemical diversity (such as polarity, stability, reactivity or ionization) of plant molecules prohibits investigation of the metabolites&#x000b4; full picture and understanding changes in their occurrence. The analysis purpose and chemical nature of plant metabolites determine the analytical technique. Also, the untargeted concept demands an analytical device, which can separate different classes of metabolites with a wide range of polarities. For untargeted metabolite analysis, several analytical techniques are available. These approaches apply liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [<xref rid="B15-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [<xref rid="B16-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to analyze a large number of different chemical metabolites classes within one single analysis. NMR has analytical reproducibility and a non-destructive nature; however, it has relatively low sensitivity compared to MS. Besides, a mass spectrometric untargeted screening strategy can identify a large number of molecules independently to provide a preferably holistic picture of the plant&#x02019;s metabolome. Also, the thermal stability of the stationary phase, metabolites and their derivatives, which might introduce artifacts, limit the metabolome coverage derived by GC-MS. Thus, the usage of LC-MS has expanded rapidly over the past ten years in untargeted metabolomics analysis [<xref rid="B17-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The serial coupling of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is often used to separate compounds with differing polarities in a single run [<xref rid="B18-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further, connecting the serial RPLC-HILIC coupling with an accurate high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HRMS) provides the detection of a wide range of metabolites.</p><p>Recently, the awareness of untargeted metabolomics analysis has increased due to its capabilities in the assessment of xenobiotics exposure/specific biomarkers and the risk of contaminants to living organisms. For example, the metabolic fingerprints of <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic> showed various chemical changes as a response to different stresses [<xref rid="B19-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic fingerprinting experiments aim to determine relative differences between two or more systems elucidating a biological relationship. Therefore, statistical strategies are typically used in a chemometrics style.

Results</title><p>Diclofenac and carbamazepine are considered problematic environmental pollutants because they can be found in surface waters (mainly in wastewater treatment plant effluents) in high concentrations. Several plant species have been found capable of absorbing and detoxifying them. Despite this, the effects of diclofenac and carbamazepine and their transformation products on plant metabolic profiles need more investigation. Consequently, <italic>P. australis</italic> was incubated with 10 and 100 &#x000b5;M DCF and with 10 and 50 &#x000b5;M CBZ, respectively. Each plant (i.e., leaves, rhizomes and roots, respectively) was extracted with four different solvents. The different samples were injected into a robust and reproducible serial coupling RPLC-HILIC in hyphenation with electron spray ionization- time of flight- mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF-MS). Both robustness and reproducibility of the analytical system was checked and proven with a mixture of 13 reference standards (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00002">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). The statistical evaluation discriminated between the different extraction solvents, plant parts and incubation. Moreover, the statistical analysis was enabled to assign the changes in <italic>P. australis</italic> metabolic profiles and the differentiating metabolic profiles (DMF) between the control and incubated samples. Furthermore, different DCF and CBZ transformation products could be identified or suspected. Thus, changes in <italic>P. australis</italic> biosynthetic pathways could be predicted.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-metabolites-11-00002"><title>2.1.

The results of the standard mixture proved the accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility of the analytical system. Mass and RT of the standards during the experiment showed an acceptable deviation of less than 8 ppm (with a ToF system from the year 2012) and % RSD less than 2 except for gabapentin, carbetamid and sotalol.

The obtained mass spectrometric total ion chromatograms (TICs) were interpreted to extract the feature (extracted masses, RT and signal abundance) according to the parameters mentioned in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot6dot1-metabolites-11-00002">Section 4.6.1</xref>. Background signals (i.e., all the peaks detected in the corresponding blank) were deleted to avoid false positives. The Retention Time (RT)/Mass plots of the different background were presented in (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00002">Figure S1</xref>). Lastly, the features found in the triplicate injections were considered for further analysis. Exemplarily, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f001">Figure 1</xref> represents (RT)/Mass plots for 100% MeOH extracts of <italic>P. australis</italic> leaf, rhizome and root in positive ion mode. The highly polar to polar compounds eluted at RT &#x0003c; 15 min, with logD values below zero (HILIC part). The nonpolar compounds were eluted at RT &#x0003e; 15 min, with logD values above zero (RPLC part). The differences in chromatographic fingerprints reflected the variability in metabolite profiles (and composition) in the leaf, rhizome and root samples. Detailed information and a description of data analysis have already been discussed in previous publications [<xref rid="B18-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B26-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-metabolites-11-00002"><title>2.2. Different Extracts of Phragmites australis&#x02019;s Metabolic Fingerprints</title><p>Untargeted metabolomics analysis demands minimal pretreatment methods to allow the detection of almost all the sample metabolites. Different leaf, rhizome and root samples were extracted with the described four solvents (i.e., 100% MeOH, acidic 90% MeOH, 50% MeOH and 100% H<sub>2</sub>O), individually, which ensured the extraction of a wide range of metabolites from nonpolar to highly polar metabolites relative to the solvents, which were used in the extraction process. All the extracts were analyzed along a metabolites&#x02019; fingerprint strategy. In orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), the variables were <italic>P. australis</italic> metabolites, which were plotted in the loading score plot (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The OPLS-DA model described the variables according to the solvents of the extraction class. Of the data variations, 18.3% (R<sup>2</sup>X(cum)) are responsible to distinguish between the classes that were previously established based on solvents. The rest of the variation (orthogonal components) describes the variation within the solvent classes. The high value of those parameters indicates that the OPLS-DA model had a good classification and prediction efficiency to distinguish between different extracts, even though it described one variation (i.e., solvent type). This is owing to the accuracy of variables, which were separated with a robust and reproducible LC-system. In (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), the samples are distributed according to t1 (predicative component) and t2 (orthogonal component). The predictive component (t1) separated the samples into two groups, the first group (negative side) contained the acidic 90% MeOH extracts and the second group (positive side) consisted of 100% MeOH, 50% MeOH and 100% H<sub>2</sub>O extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Moreover, the orthogonal component (t2) described the differences within the group. Consequently, it separated the second group into 100%MeOH and 50%MeOH in the positive part and the 100% H<sub>2</sub>O extracts in the negative part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Further, in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f002">Figure 2</xref>c), good separation was reached according to the cumulative goodness of fit and the cross-validation parameters of each variable R<sup>2</sup> and Q<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

This step was performed to improve the statistical significance of the dataset through additional cross-validation. Also, the OPLS-DA analysis was conducted to investigate the structure of the data.

OPLS-DA analysis showed the identified and unidentified metabolites, which distinguished the different clusters according to the characteristic change of control or incubated samples metabolite profiles.

The relative high goodness of fit indicated the good separation of different incubation groups of <italic>P. australis</italic> R<sup>2</sup> and Q<sup>2</sup>, respectively, (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00002">Figure S2B</xref>). To facilitate the interpretation and visualization of OPLS-DA, the S-plot was drawn to illustrate the model&#x02019;s influence with accuracy in the search for differentiating metabolic profile (DMF).

The DMF was extracted from S-plots, which were marked in red color.

The contribution plot summarized the changing trends in the metabolites in the pairwise groups (i.e., control and incubated samples) through expressing the fold change of the metabolites between the control and incubated samples.

Discussion</title><p><italic>P. australis</italic> metabolic profiles were investigated in different samples with RPLC-HILIC-ESI-TOF-MS. The system accuracy and reproducibility were checked using a mixture of 13 reference standards. The results of the quality control mixture revealed that the serial coupling produces robust and reproducible data, which was used for further statistical analysis. <italic>P.australis</italic> metabolomics&#x02019; statistical analysis of the four different extracts reveals that the 90% acidic MeOH extracts are very different from the other extracts of various <italic>P. australis</italic> leaf, rhizome and root samples. However, the 100% MeOH, 50% MeOH and 100% H<sub>2</sub>O extracts are more related to each other. 100% MeOH was generally located in the middle between 50% MeOH and 100% H<sub>2</sub>O extracts, however, representing a similar solution behavior to all three extract types. A large t2 range value was observed mostly in acidic 90% MeOH extracts, that is, a value far above the critical limits in the score space. Hence, this is likely to be an outlying observation. The elimination of acidic 90% MeOH extracts might improve the model. Also, most of the metabolites extracted with acidic 90% MeOH have been detected in three other solvents. The same observation was made for <italic>Lemna minor</italic> extracts and can be described with the different occurrence of charged molecules caused by different pH values [<xref rid="B26-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The statistical software allowed cross-validation between the datasets. Furthermore, an additional step of cross-validation of the data was done through the differentiation between the x (metabolites) and the plant parts. The results reveal the significance of the data organization. Hence, the compounds extracted from roots and rhizomes are more correlated than compounds in leaves, which supports the physiological similarities between them [<xref rid="B29-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. After the additional cross-validation step, the OPLS-DA model was built to assign the variables, which differentiate between control and incubated samples. OPLS-DA is a supervised approach that tends to improve the separation between (two or more) groups of samples. For this reason, it is widely used for classification purposes and biomarker identification and/or differentiating metabolic profiles (DMF) in metabolomics studies [<xref rid="B21-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The DMF of <italic>P. australis</italic> was extracted. Further, the fold change of the different variables in the control and incubated samples show an increase in quercetin in DCF incubation; however, in this case of CBZ, it was found to decrease significantly. <italic>P. australis</italic> responds to the incubation with different classes of compounds, with the potential to protect it against ROS, such as polyphenols and flavonoids. Also, it might be that CBZ does not cause oxidative stress to the same extent as DCF. Furthermore, succinic acid (DM_4), propane-1,2,3-triol (DM_6) and 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (DM_7) appeared significant in the positive part of the plot with VIP &#x0003e; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f004">Figure 4</xref>c).

Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide is considered a main transformed product of carbamazepine in plants (compound <bold>3</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f004">Figure 4</xref>d).

It has been reported that formation of hydroxylated metabolites is the first step in the detoxification of diclofenac in the plant. These results reveal that P450 monooxygenases or peroxidases were involved to detoxify diclofenac [<xref rid="B11-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In CBZ incubation, different transformation products were identified, which originated from different metabolism pathways (PCM). The 10,11-diOH pathway (PCM) has been investigated comprehensively in plants like cucumber, tomato, sweet potato, lettuce, carrot and horseradish [<xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

This is the first oxidation step, which was observed in different organisms from bacteria and fungi to mammals. It was conducted by cytochrome P450 and/or peroxidases, leading to different sub-pathways (PCM).</p><p>The first sub-pathway (PCM) started with cleavage of the epoxide bond and the hydroxylation to form 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine. This step is catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase enzymes [<xref rid="B33-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A recent study reported further metabolism of 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine through hydroxylation of the benzene ring [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine was identified in root and rhizome extracts in both incubation concentrations, as shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00002">Table S3</xref>. However, 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-carbamazepine was identified in leaf extracts in the 50 &#x000b5;M carbamazepine. It seems that the 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine was transferred to rhizome and leaf for further metabolism. This explains why it reaches the leaves in high concentration from the highly loaded rhizome tissue. Thus, <italic>P. australis</italic> can degrade carbamazepine through a 10,11-diOH pathway (PCM), initiated in the root and completed in leaf and rhizome.</p><p>Further, <italic>P. australis</italic> metabolized the carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide into 9-acridine carboxaldehyde, which is analogous to other studies [<xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The 9-acridine carboxaldehyde is a reactive compound that was identified in leaf, rhizome and root extracts of plants exposed to 10 and 50 &#x000b5;M carbamazepine. Further metabolites downstream from 9-acridine carboxaldehyde could not be detected. 9-acridine carboxaldehyde is typically transformed into acridone, which is a non-toxic compound with the formation of the two intermediates acridine and 9-hydroxy acridine [<xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our conditions, they were below the detectable limit or did not arise. Because 9-acridine carboxaldehyde was identified in leaf, rhizome and root extracts in both concentrations, it may be assumed that there are further steps in the acridine metabolic pathway (PCM) that could be detected, like in lettuce, with longer incubation periods [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The last sub-pathway (PCM) is similar to the 10, 11-diOH pathway in the first steps. It includes a consecutive oxidation reaction on the aromatic group. Carbamazepine was metabolized to 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxy-carbamazepine which comprises two steps with the participation of a cytochrome P450 or a peroxidase and an epoxide hydrolase [<xref rid="B33-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxy-carbamazepine was identified in the <italic>P. australis</italic> rhizome and root in both incubation levels. However, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxy-carbamazepine was not detectable in leaf extracts. It is moreover possible that the leaf metabolizes CBZ to 4-hydroxy-carbamazepine as in the leaves of the tomato plant. It was identified formerly in lettuce after 4 days of exposure; however, the researchers spiked the lettuce with 1 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> carbamazepine [<xref rid="B30-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Thus, it is possible that <italic>P. australis</italic> takes up and metabolizes carbamazepine in different mechanisms. Still, all the metabolites resemble phase I metabolism in plant metabolism and not the glycosylated transformation products (phase II) [<xref rid="B3-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The mummichog algorithm of the DMF between control and incubated samples shows an induction in the eleven and twelve pathways due to incubation with DCF or CBZ, respectively. They were identified as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, glutathione metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism in DCF incubation.</p><p>After CBZ incubation, the pentose phosphate pathway, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, &#x003b2;-Alanine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and folate biosynthesis pathways were induced after the incubation of CBZ.</p><p>The glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway provides the plant with defense compounds against biting insects and worms.

The decline in sugars after plant exposure to DCF and CBZ indicates an increase in energy consumption [<xref rid="B35-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Pyrimidine metabolism could be proposed to be a result of glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway alteration, which up-regulates the biosynthesis of other stress-induced pathways [<xref rid="B36-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Pyrimidine metabolism is enhanced and leads to products that could be used in the case of salvage, that is, recovery of infections and subsequent synthesis of secondary products with specific functions in defense mechanisms. Additionally, pyrimidine metabolism provides a source of &#x003b2;-alanine or &#x003b2;-aminobutyrate, which might be an important source for the pantothenate of coenzyme A [<xref rid="B37-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, fatty acid biosynthesis and the related pyruvate metabolism were induced after incubation of <italic>P. australis</italic> with DCF and CBZ. After incubation with DCF, <italic>P. australis</italic> exhibits some responses differently from incubation with CBZ, since it showed an increase in phenylalanine metabolism which aligned with the increase of quercetin content. The flavonoid 3&#x02032;-monooxygenase and the flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase enzymes responsible for the conversion of kaempferol to quercetin are cytochrome P450 plant types, which are triggered after incubation with DCF. However, the quercetin levels were lower after CBZ incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f004">Figure 4</xref>d).</p><p>Glutathione metabolism was affected in DCF incubation but not under the influence of CBZ. Glutathione metabolism is a central part of the antioxidative ascorbate&#x02013;glutathione cycle. Further, glutathione is critical for the detoxification of xenobiotics, environmental stress tolerance and, in the form of phytochelatins, also the retention of heavy metals [<xref rid="B38-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Upon DCF incubation, succinic acid formed from the degradation of diclofenac might have fueled the TCA cycle, which has been detected significantly in extracts incubated with DCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00002-f004">Figure 4</xref>c).</p><p>In 2019, Sivaram and coworkers reported a high impact on the TCA cycle in maize leaves exposed to pyrene [<xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Consequently, the &#x003b3;-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt bypasses two steps of the TCA cycle. Moreover, it has an important pathway under stress conditions and it is associated with numerous physiological responses, including the regulation of cytosolic pH, carbon fluxes into the TCA cycle, nitrogen metabolism, osmoregulation and plant-pathogen interaction. Increased GABA levels also occur in response to changing environmental conditions and represent another adaptive mechanism in the attempt to maintain the rate of respiration under certain harmful conditions (Ara&#x000fa;jo et al., 2012) [<xref rid="B40-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The same result was observed in lettuce crops, which were exposed to different contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) concentrations [<xref rid="B35-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, it was reported that aromatic hydrocarbons altered the osmotic balance in maize [<xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The alteration of previously mentioned biosynthetic pathways enhances the <italic>P. australis</italic> defense mechanisms.

Hence, <italic>P. australis</italic> responded differently to the DCF and CBZ through changing its metabolic pathway regardless of the type of drug to some extent. Consequently, specific changes in several common metabolic pathways can be considered as a marker for pollutant exposure in <italic>P. australis</italic>. However, each drug has fingerprints of the alteration of distinct metabolic pathways, which might be connected to its metabolites and the enzymes involved in metabolism. Therefore, the induced or changed pathways could be used as indicators for the exposure of the plant to DCF or CBZ.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-metabolites-11-00002"><title>4.

The LC-system was used to perform reversed-phase and zwitterion hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in its serial coupling. The reversed-phase separation column was a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (50.0 &#x000d7; 3.0 mm, 2.7 &#x003bc;m, Agilent Technologies Waldbronn, Germany). The HILIC column was a ZIC-HILIC column (150 &#x000d7; 2.1 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m, 200 &#x000c5;, Merck Sequant, Umea, Sweden). Columns were coupled through a T-piece (Upchurch, IDEX Europe GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). The third port of the T-piece was connected to the HILIC flow pump. The injection volume was 10 &#x003bc;L.

The metabolites were identified and suspected (when analytical standards were not available) after RPLC-HILIC-ESI-TOF-MS separation in the suspect analysis. (Suspects screening typically is performed with accurate and high-resolution mass spectrometers to observe the empirical formula of each molecule present and/or with tandem-mass spectrometry to observe specific fragment spectra). A local database was built using MassHunter PCDL Manager B.04.00 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Further, the logD (pH7) was the third parameter used to certify the identity of metabolites. The highly polar to polar compounds eluted from the HILIC column at RT &#x0003c; 15 min, with logD values below zero. The nonpolar compounds were eluted from the RP column at RT &#x0003e; 15 min, with logD values above zero.

Statistical Data Analysis</title><p>Data statistical analyses were conducted with SIMCA 16 software (Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden). Further analysis and data evaluation were performed with Microsoft Access and Excel 2016 (Redmond, Washington, WA, USA) and OriginPro 2019, Origin Lab cooperation, Northampton, MA, USA.</p><p>The preprocessed data is a matrix. The rows are the exact masses, retention times (RTs) and abundances of each sample, which were listed in a Microsoft Excel Sheet. For statistical analysis, it is common to handle the data matrices with rows as observations and columns as compounds [<xref rid="B36-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, the data was organized in the Microsoft Access Database file (DBF), which was exclusively built to be suitable for SIMCA 16. The main advantage of the data matrix is the inherent support to align quantitative data (plant part, plant number, extraction solvent and drug incubation) along with related metadata (i.e., feature annotations/abundance as columns and sample annotations as rows). In DBF, the RTs, masses and abundances were connected to the corresponding plant part (i.e., leaf, rhizome and root), plant number (i.e., plants 1 and 2), extraction solvent and drug incubation. Once the matrix was built, comprehensive statistical analyses could be performed by using the vast range of functions provided by the software. The matrix consisted of 432 observations (i.e., the incubation with/without DCF or CBZ) and 11,442 variables (features). Furthermore, the plant part, plant number and extraction solvent were used as secondary observations. The data was not transformed and centered; however, it was scaled. The data was analyzed according to the following two strategies, considering the statistical analyses in untargeted metabolomics. Further information about the data setup can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00002">supplementary material</xref>. By default, SIMCA provides an algorithm called &#x0201c;cross-validation&#x0201d; to get the most valid model by calculating the adequate number of principal components to prevent overfitting of the data in the model. Furthermore, the software provides a large number of visual diagrams (score plots (with Hotelling&#x02019;s ellipse), DModX (Distant to Model) and statistic tables to assess the quality of the model in addition to the R<sup>2</sup> and Q<sup>2</sup>.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Metabolite fingerprinting was used to capture metabolite patterns across metabolite profiles. They are characterized without further identification steps (i.e., without need for standard reference material). Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares regression-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to relate sets of X-variables (such as plant part, plant number, extraction solvent and drug incubation) to the metabolites matrix. SIMCA 16 has a tool called Multiblock Orthogonal Component Analysis (MOCA). MOCA&#x02019;s concept is used to accomplish a fast and accurate analysis of multiple blocks of data (variables) registered for the same set of observations. MOCA aims at extracting the information in complex multi-block data analytics. Furthermore, it will extract two sets of components: the joint and the unique components. The quality of the models is described by R<sup>2</sup> and Q<sup>2</sup> values, where R<sup>2</sup> is the proportion of variance in the data explained by the models and indicates the goodness of fit and Q<sup>2</sup> is the proportion of variance in the data predictable by the model and expresses predictability [<xref rid="B41-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Metabolite profiling which uses sets of predefined metabolites were studied in different samples of <italic>P. australis</italic> and differences in metabolites were usually related to the incubation with DCF or CBZ. Metabolite/variable selection was conducted to observe only the most significant metabolite candidates that explain the differences between the samples using S- and contribution-plots. The statistical models were built with confidence limits at 95%. Also, the differentiating metabolic profile (DMF) was chosen based on their contribution to the variation and correlation within the data sets. The related metabolic pathways were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Moreover, their contributions and biological clarifications were described based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The KEGG pathway analysis tool was used by the Arabidopsis thaliana database. The pathway analysis module combines the enrichment analysis and topology analysis based on KEGG.

The <italic>p</italic> value was equal to 0.05, which indicates the fundamental connection of the identified metabolite with their respective metabolite and not due to the random chance [<xref rid="B42-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-metabolites-11-00002" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-metabolites-11-00002"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Metabolites of <italic>P. australis</italic> influenced by pharmaceuticals were investigated using RPLC-HILIC-ESI-TOF-MS. The experimental data and the statistical analysis revealed a change in the metabolites&#x02019; fingerprint between the different extracts, different plant parts and upon incubation with DCF and CBZ. The PLS and OPLS-DA identified the statistically significant clusters between the different groups. Further, significant DMF was determined in <italic>P. australis</italic> after the incubation with DCF or CBZ, individually. Different metabolic pathways were predicted from the statically identified DMF. These pathways were related mainly to the defense of the plant against stressful environmental conditions. <italic>P. australis</italic> adapted to each drug differently. <italic>P. australis</italic> could putatively use the glutathione metabolism pathway and unsaturated fatty acid pathway to protect itself during the incubation with DCF and CBZ, respectively. The results reveal insights into the metabolic profile of the species&#x000b4; adaptation to different pollutants. This study may set a cornerstone for understanding the changes in the plant metabolism after incubation with DCF and CBZ. Also, the mass spectrometric untargeted metabolomics strategy has a substantial role in investigating the biochemical changes and metabolic adaptation of plants in xenobiotics exposure cases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was assisted by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the scope of the Open Access Publishing Program.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-metabolites-11-00002"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The supplementary materials are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/1/2/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/11/1/2/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Retention time (RT)/Mass plot of the background was analyzed by RPLC-HILIC-ESI-TOF-MS in positive electrospray ionization mode, Figure S2: The Q<sup>2</sup>/ R<sup>2</sup> Overview plot displays the individual cumulative R<sup>2</sup> (green columns) and Q<sup>2</sup> (blue columns) and Q<sup>2</sup> for the goodness of fits and cross-validation parameters (a) <italic>P. australis</italic> different parts.
