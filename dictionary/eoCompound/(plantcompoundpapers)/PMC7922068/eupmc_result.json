    "Honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i> L.) are the most effective pollinators for different crops and wild flowering plants, thus maintaining numerous ecosystems in the world. However, honey bee colonies often suffer from stress or even death due to various pests and diseases. Among the latter, nosemosis is considered to be one of the most common diseases, causing serious damage to beekeeping every year. Here, we present, for the first time, the effects from the application of the herbal supplements NOZEMAT HERB<sup>速</sup> (NH) and NOZEMAT HERB PLUS<sup>速</sup> (NHP) for treating <i>N. ceranae</i> infection and positively influencing the general development of honey bee colonies. To achieve this, in autumn 2019, 45 colonies were selected based on the presence of <i>N. ceranae</i> infections. The treatment was carried out for 11 months (August 2019-June 2020). All colonies were sampled pre- and post-treatment for the presence of <i>N. ceranae</i> by means of light microscopy and PCR analysis. The honey bee colonies' performance and health were evaluated pre- and post-treatment. The obtained results have shown that both supplements have exhibited statistically significant biological activity against <i>N. ceranae</i> in infected apiaries. Considerable enhancement in the strength of honey bee colonies and the amount of sealed workers was observed just one month after the application of NH and NHP. Although the mechanisms of action of NH and NHP against <i>N. ceranae</i> infection are yet to be completely elucidated, our results suggest a new holistic approach as an alternative therapy to control nosemosis and to improve honey bee colonies' performance and health."
