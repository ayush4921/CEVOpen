    "The parasitic weed, <i>Orobanche crenata</i>, is one of the most devastating constraint for faba bean production in Mediterranean regions. Plant host defense induction was reported as one of the most appropriate control methods in many crops. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) on the induction of faba bean resistance to <i>O. crenata</i> under the field and controlled experimental conditions. Both hormones were tested on two contrasting faba bean genotypes: Giza 843 (partially resistant to <i>O. crenata</i>) and Lobab (susceptible) at three different application methods (seed soaking, foliar spray, and the combination of both seed soaking and foliar spray). Soaking seeds in SA or IAA provided the highest protection levels reaching ~75% compared to the untreated control plants. Both elicitors limited the chlorophyll content decrease caused by <i>O. crenata</i> infestation and increased phenolic compound production in host plants. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase activities were stimulated in the host plant roots especially in the susceptible genotype Lobab. The magnitude of induction was more obvious in infested than in non-infested plants. Histological study revealed that both SA and IAA decreased the number of attached <i>O. crenata</i> spikes which could be related to specific defense responses in the host plant roots."
