Specifically, the polymerization of PPO-derived quinones that cause explant browning of walnut is not well understood. This study investigated explants of &#x02018;Zanmei&#x02019; walnut shoot apices cultured in agar (A) or vermiculite (V) media, and the survival percentage, changes in phenolic content, POD and PPO activity, and <italic>JrPPO</italic> expression in explants were studied to determine the role of PPO in the browning of walnut explants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The results showed that the V media greatly reduced the death rate of explants, and 89.9 and 38.7% of the explants cultured in V media and A media survived, respectively. Compared with that of explants at 0&#x02009;h, the PPO of explants cultured in A was highly active throughout the culture, but activity in those cultured in V remained low. The phenolic level of explants cultured in A increased significantly at 72&#x02009;h but subsequently declined, and the content in the explants cultured in V increased to a high level only at 144&#x02009;h. The POD in explants cultured in V showed high activity that did not cause browning. Gene expression assays showed that the expression of <italic>JrPPO1</italic> was downregulated in explants cultured in both A and V. However, the expression of <italic>JrPPO2</italic> was upregulated in explants cultured in A throughout the culture and upregulated in V at 144&#x02009;h. <italic>JrPPO</italic> expression analyses in different tissues showed that <italic>JrPPO1</italic> was highly expressed in stems, young leaves, mature leaves, catkins, pistils, and hulls, and <italic>JrPPO2</italic> was highly expressed in mature leaves and pistils. Moreover, browning assays showed that both explants in A and leaf tissue exhibited high JrPPO2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The rapid increase in phenolic content caused the browning and death of explants.

Owing to its strong wood and nutritious nuts, this plant species is widely distributed in all parts of the world except Antarctica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In recent years, with the development of improved cultivars, seedlings of excellent cultivars have become increasingly popular with farmers. However, the traditional low-efficiency method of grafting to generate seedlings has greatly limited the propagation and popularization of superior cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Over the past several years, tissue culture has become an effective method for rapid breeding of seedlings and improving production efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, explant browning is one of the key factors limiting tissue culture of walnut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Various methods have been used to reduce the occurrence of tissue browning in walnut explants, but the effects have been less than ideal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Enzymatic browning is the principal cause of explant browning in plant tissue culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In generally, polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) and peroxidase (POD) are the main enzymes responsible for this browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cells are damaged when explants are cut, and phenols are released and oxidized to quinones by enzymes, which results in enzymatic browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, quinones formed by enzymatic reactions can form cross-links with proteins or can polymerize in tissues through a series of complex biochemical reactions, such as dehydration and polymerization, generating dark-colored melanin compounds, disrupting tissue metabolism, inhibiting growth, and, ultimately, causing browning and death of explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. PPOs are the main enzymes leading to the oxidation of phenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Phenolic compounds are oxidized by PPOs to their quinone derivatives and further oxidized to form the pigment melanin, which is found in organisms and is responsible for browning reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. PPOs are a group of copper-containing enzymes that can catalyze the <italic>o</italic>-hydroxylation of monophenols to <italic>o</italic>-diphenols (tyrosinase activity) as well as the oxidation of <italic>o</italic>-diphenols to quinones (catecholase activity) in the presence of oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. PPOs have several well-defined roles in animals, including skin/exoskeleton pigmentation and cuticle sclerotization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Unlike animal and fungal PPOs, many plant PPOs lack monophenol oxidase activity. However, PPOs display rather high monophenolase activity in walnut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In vivo, PPO activity is typically associated with senescent, wounded, or damaged plant tissues in which cellular compartmentalization is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, the physiological role of PPOs in plants remains unclear, and most relate plant studies have focused primarily on the role of PPOs in postharvest browning, in which cut or damaged plant tissues turn brown due to the polymerization of PPO-generated quinones, which generates phytomelanin compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Walnut branches and leaves are rich in phenolic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which leads to increased susceptibility to browning of generated from these tissues explants during culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Explant browning has been a difficult problem associated with walnut tissue culture for the past several decades. PPO transcription and activity play a key role in explant browning and survival. Shi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported that the survival percentage of walnut scions was closely related to phenolic content and PPO activity during grafting. Araji et al. concluded that PPO plays a novel and fundamental role in secondary metabolism and acts as an indirect regulator of cell death in <italic>J. regia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previously, PPO was described as a single gene (<italic>JrPPO1</italic>) that encodes a protein with mono- and diphenolase activity in <italic>J. regia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; compared with the diphenolase activity only of PPO enzymes in other plant species, the activity of PPO in walnut is a unique feature. For many years, researchers have believed that walnut PPO activity is regulated by only a single <italic>JrPPO1</italic> gene, rendering it an ideal model to study enzymatic browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>JrPPO1</italic> appears to be constitutively expressed at a high level in all green tissues and is not responsive to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that walnut-bacterial blight interactions induced <italic>JrPPO1</italic> expression and PPO activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Using a novel purification method, Zekiri et al. purified two isoforms of JrPPO from <italic>J. regia</italic> leaves; these isoforms differed by a single amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A second homolog of <italic>PPO</italic> (<italic>JrPPO2</italic>) was discovered on the basis of the <italic>J. regia</italic> genome sequence, but its mechanism of action is substantially less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Panis reported that, compared with JrPPO2, JrPPO1 exhibited a greater activity towards monophenols, whereas JrPPO2 was more active towards <italic>o</italic>-diphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In the process of tissue culture, the browning rate can be reduced by optimizing the medium type and improving the culture conditions, both of which have been the focus of tissue culture research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been proposed that fluid-based media, such as liquid media and semisolid media, can effectively reduce explant browning because the harmful substances in media with good fluidity can diffuse over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, other studies have shown that increasing the agar (A) concentration and decreasing the fluidity can reduce explant browning, which may be related to the specific materials used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this work, walnut explants were cultured in two different types of media, namely, low-permeability agar and high-permeability vermiculite. <italic>JrPPO</italic> expression and phenolic content levels were determined in explants to elucidate the relationship between explant browning and <italic>JrPPO</italic>s and to provide new methods and theories for walnut tissue culture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Survival percentage of explants in different media</title><p id="Par12">After 72&#x02009;h of culture, the explants cultured in A exhibited severe browning, but less browning was observed the explants cultured in V. After 144&#x02009;h, the green coloration of explants cultured in A diminished, and most of the media was brown; however, the explants cultured in V showed less browning, and the petioles beside several buds fell off, which indicates that the buds began to burst (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After 7&#x02009;days of culture, the two treatment explants were transferred to fresh A-media and cultured for another 7&#x02009;days to calculate the survival percentage. Compared with the those cultured in V media, the explants cultured in A, exhibited multiple areas of browning, and some buds of explants cultured in V burst and developed normally (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The survival percentage of explants in A was only 38.7%, which was significantly lower than in V (89.9%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Taken together, these results showed that initial culture in V significantly reduced the percentage of explant death and improved the survival.

In the early stage of culture, the phenolic content in explants cultured in A was significantly greater than that in V, but the phenolic content in explants cultured in A decreased rapidly over time and became lower than that in V. The former sterilization treatment and incision injury caused a high level of phenolic production in explants in both V and A, but the V media delayed the rapid accumulation of phenolic content. The decrease in phenolic content in A may be due to the browning-related death of explants and the decrease in metabolic activity.

Walnut explants experience stress under the environmental conditions associated with the using of cuttings and sterilization and when water and salt are present in the media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Plants have established a series of defense and protection systems involving cell metabolism, hormone regulation and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the phenolic content increases to resist the impact of harsh environmental conditions, but a high accumulation of phenolic compounds leads to increased production of quinones, resulting in severe browning. In this study, walnut explants were cultured in A or V media, and a large number of phenolic compounds accumulated in the early stage, which might have been caused by damage and stress during the process of collection and sterilization. The permeability and fluidity of the media are very important to reduce explant browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The permeability and fluidity of A are low, and the harmful substances secreted by the explants during the later stage cannot be dispersed rapidly and therefore accumulate in the explants; these toxic effects result in severe browning. V is a granular and adsorptive cation-exchanger that has good permeability and fluidity; the harmful substances produced by explants can spread rapidly in V, so the browning-related death rate is low. Therefore, initial culture in V can effectively reduce the browning of walnut explants.</p><p id="Par21">Plants can adapt to adversity through active and reversible regulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Browning is a phenomenon caused by PPO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and POD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the levels of PPO and POD synthesis increase during plant defense responses following mechanical damage and abiotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. PPO oxidizes phenolics to form quinones and further polymerizes quinones to form melanin compounds. However, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, POD also oxidizes phenolics and formed pigments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations are very low in normal plant tissues, and there is less involvement of POD compared with PPO in browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The results of the present study showed that the POD activity of the explants cultured in V was significantly greater than that in A at 72&#x02009;h, and the phenolic content in the explants cultured in V was also significantly lower than that in A. Mechanical damage to explants can induce the release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at an early stage; especially under conditions of waterlogging stress in A. PAL activity promotes the synthesis of phenols and increases wound-induced toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. High levels of POD enzymes rapidly degrade PAL activity caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release following mechanical damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The decreased PAL activity slowed the accumulation of phenolics in explants cultured in V. However, POD activity was lower at the early stage in explants cultured in A, which led to increased phenol production. Under the catalysis of highly active PPO, the phenols formed a large number of quinones, which autopolymerized to form brown-colored pigments. Therefore, the explants cultured in A were browner than the explants cultured in V. POD activity and the phenolic content in explants were greater and PPO activity was lower in V at 144&#x02009;h, which caused a minimal browning of explants. Therefore, compared with POD, PPO may be the main factor that leads to the browning in walnut explants.</p><p id="Par22">Plastid-localized PPO is physically separated from its phenolic substrates in intact plant cells and is distributed primarily in the vacuole. Cell damage disrupts membrane structure, and PPO oxidizes phenols to form quinones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The results of Wei and Ronald showed that browning of <italic>Pinus virginiana</italic> Mill. inhibited callus growth, bud differentiation and rooting and was related to the accumulation of PPO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The PPO activity of calli induced by buds in Scots pine (<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.) was significantly greater than that in immature embryos without browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which suggests that the high PPO activity of calli induced from mature tissue led to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and that the increase in PPO activity in browning tissue was a response to mechanical damage and abiotic stress in these callus cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. After the explants were cut and sterilized in the present study, they were placed in A or V media, which caused further stress, and the subsequent phenolic compound content and PPO activity in the explants were significantly greater than those on the day of collection. Notably, the A media caused an increased accumulation of phenolic compounds near the wound and accelerated the browning reactions, and the activity of PPO increased continuously in the later period. The A media had poor permeability and fluidity; high levels of phenolic compounds were produced at the initial stage, and high expression of <italic>JrPPO2</italic> led to increased JrPPO2 activity, which resulted in the production of a large number of quinones. The metabolism in the plant tissue was disrupted, and gene expression was downregulated or abolished, which was also the reason for the high browning-related death rate of explants cultured in A media. The accumulation of phenolic compounds in the early stage was relatively low in the explants cultured in V, and <italic>JrPPOs</italic> expression was slowly upregulated, so these explants effectively repaired the damage during this time. Although the phenolic compound content in the explants and the expression of <italic>JrPPO</italic> in the later stage increased, at this time, the explants had gradually adapted to the external environment, so the browning death rate was low.</p><p id="Par23">There are two <italic>PPO</italic> genes in apple that exhibit unique expression pattern and are associated with tissues and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. <italic>APO5</italic> transcripts are detected only at the late stage of flower development, whereas <italic>MD-PPO2</italic> transcripts were was detected at all stages of flower development.

In addition, the expression patterns of <italic>JrPPO1</italic> and <italic>JrPPO2</italic> were opposite, and the change in expression of <italic>JrPPO2</italic> was similar to the change in PPO activity. It was thus inferred that JrPPO2 plays a key role in the oxidation of phenolic compounds.

It is speculated that motif 10 may function during tissue browning, but its function needs to be further studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">The rapid increase in phenolic content caused the browning and death of explants, and V media delayed the rapid accumulation of phenolic compounds in walnut explants in the short term.
