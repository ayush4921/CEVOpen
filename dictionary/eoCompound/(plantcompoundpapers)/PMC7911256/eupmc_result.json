    "Callus initiation, shoot formation and plant regeneration were established for <i>Artemisia spicigera</i>, a traditional medicinal plant growing in Armenia, Middle-Anatolia and Iran, and producing valuable volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are mostly represented by monoterpenoids. Optimal callus initiation and shoot production were obtained by culture of hypocotyl and cotyledon explants on MS medium comprising 0.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 0.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> 6-benzyladenine (BA). Consequently, the shoots were transferred onto the MS media supplemented with 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of NAA. Both types of auxin induced root formation on the shoots and the resulting plantlets were successfully grown in pots. The production of VOCs in callus tissues and regenerated plantlets was studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Although the potential of undifferentiated callus to produce VOCs was very low, an increased content of bioactive volatile components was observed at the beginning of shoot primordia differentiation. Intriguingly, the volatiles obtained from in vitro plantlets showed quantitative and qualitative variation depending on the type of auxins used for the rooting process. The acquired quantities based on total ion current (TIC) showed that the regenerated plantlets using 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> NAA produced higher amounts of oxygenated monoterpenes such as camphor (30.29%), <i>cis</i>-thujone (7.07%), and 1,8-cineole (6.71%) and sesquiterpene derivatives, namely germacrene D (8.75%), bicyclogermacrene (4.0%) and spathulenol (1.49%) compared with the intact plant. According to these findings, in vitro generation of volatile organic compounds in <i>A. spicigera</i> depends on the developmental stages of tissues and may enhance with the formation of shoot primordia and regeneration of plantlets."
