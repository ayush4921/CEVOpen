    "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are increasing due to the abuse and misuse of antibiotics, and nosocomial infections by MDR bacteria are also increasing. The aim of this study was to identify new substances that can target MDR bacteria among 12 plant extracts that are known to have antibacterial effects. The experiments were performed by the disk diffusion test and microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). By screening against methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MSSA), grapefruit seed extract (GSE) was selected from 12 plant extracts for subsequent experiments. GSE showed antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (VRSA) in the disk diffusion test. Even at the lowest concentration, GSE showed antibacterial activity in the microdilution MIC test. As a result, we can conclude that GSE is a naturally derived antibacterial substance that exhibits a favorable antibacterial effect even at a very low concentration, so it is a good candidate for a natural substance that can be used to prevent or reduce nosocomial infections as coating for materials used in medical contexts or by mixing a small amount with other materials."
