The aim of this study was to identify new substances that can target MDR bacteria among 12 plant extracts that are known to have antibacterial effects. The experiments were performed by the disk diffusion test and microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). By screening against methicillin-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA), grapefruit seed extract (GSE) was selected from 12 plant extracts for subsequent experiments. GSE showed antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (VRSA) in the disk diffusion test. Even at the lowest concentration, GSE showed antibacterial activity in the microdilution MIC test. As a result, we can conclude that GSE is a naturally derived antibacterial substance that exhibits a favorable antibacterial effect even at a very low concentration, so it is a good candidate for a natural substance that can be used to prevent or reduce nosocomial infections as coating for materials used in medical contexts or by mixing a small amount with other materials.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>multidrug-resistant bacteria</kwd><kwd>nosocomial infection</kwd><kwd>plant extract</kwd><kwd>grapefruit seed extract</kwd><kwd>antibacterial activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The number of bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics continues to increase due to the misuse and abuse of antibiotics. Among these, bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics are called multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. For example, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), which was first identified in the early 1960s [<xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], is resistant to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including those in the penicillin class and cephalosporin class, in addition to methicillin [<xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. MDR bacteria constitute the leading cause of nosocomial infection, and outcomes in patients infected with MDR bacteria tend to be worse than for those infected by more sensitive organisms [<xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, the mortality rate from MDR bacteria such as MRSA is significantly higher than for susceptible strains [<xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, efforts to discover new substances that can target MDR bacteria have become increasingly important.</p><p>Antibacterial effects are being studied in various fields, such as tissue engineering [<xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and many experiments have been conducted to identify new substances that can target antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recently, antimicrobial activity experiments using nanoparticles (NPs) have been actively conducted. The antibacterial effects of nanoparticles such as silver, gold, and ZnO have already been confirmed for over a decade and are still actively being studied [<xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, these nanoparticles have also shown antibacterial effects against MDR bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE) and MRSA [<xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to nanoparticles, interest in natural products as substitutes for traditional antibiotics to fight multidrug-resistant pathogens has greatly increased [<xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The antibacterial effect of honeydew honey and the antibacterial effects of plant extracts such as black pepper extract, grapefruit seed extract (GSE), and coral <italic>Hibiscus</italic> extract have been proven in many papers [<xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Natural products have long been used as the basis for treatment [<xref rid="B28-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Most of the drugs on the market today are natural-based products or their derivatives [<xref rid="B29-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggesting that natural-based products may be better accepted by the body and more successful than synthetic chemicals [<xref rid="B30-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on natural products, especially plant extracts.</p><p>In this study, 12 plant extracts known for having antibacterial activity were analyzed by disk diffusion test against MSSA. From this screening test, only GSE showed antibacterial effect. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of GSE against MDR bacteria such as MRSA and VRSA, which cause serious problems through nosocomial infection, and investigate the cause of the antibacterial effect of GSE.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>2.

The cultured bacteria were diluted using PBS to obtain bacterial cell densities of approximately 1~2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU (colony forming unit)/mL, and then the diluted bacterial suspensions were spread using sterilized cotton swabs on TSA plates (100 mm &#x000d7; 15 mm). Bacterial concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer. The actual number of colonies was confirmed by diluting the bacterial culture solution that was diluted to the desired concentration to 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL, dropping 100 &#x000b5;L on an MHA plate, spreading and incubating. After allowing the surface of each medium to dry for 3&#x02013;5 min, ADVANTEC paper disks (8 mm/0.7 mm) that had been sterilized with ethylene gas were placed on TSA plates and pressed with forceps to ensure complete contact with each agar surface. For the screening test, 20 &#x000b5;L of plant extract and linezolid (1.5 mg/mL) were loaded onto paper disks on agar plates spread with <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC6538 (MSSA).

Microdilution MIC Test</title><p>The MICs of GSE, 76% G, pH 76% G, pH 76% G with naringin (1.7 mg/mL), and antimicrobial agents were determined using the twofold microdilution broth method. Naringin was dissolved in DMSO first and then diluted with pH 76% G, and all other test compounds were diluted with DW. GSE, 76% G, pH 76% G, and pH 76% G with naringin (1.7 mg/mL) were diluted to yield 10 concentrations from undiluted solution to 1/512, and antimicrobial agents were diluted to yield 10 concentrations from 64 &#x000b5;g to 0.125 &#x000b5;g/mL.

Antibacterial Effect of GSE in Disk Diffusion Test</title><p>Among the commercially available plant extracts, 12 types of extracts that are known to have antibacterial effects were purchased, and the antibacterial activities of 12 extracts (specified as numbers in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00085">Table S1</xref>) were analyzed against MSSA ATCC6538 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00085">Figure S1</xref>) by the disk diffusion test. The disk diffusion test is a standard method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and is an experimental method that can quickly and easily evaluate the antibacterial activity of many compounds [<xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. If an extract exerts an antibacterial effect, an inhibition zone will form around the paper disk where the extract was dropped. A highly effective antibacterial agent produces a wide ring without bacterial growth, whereas an ineffective antibacterial agent shows no change in the concentration of bacteria around it. Except for GSE, the other plant extracts showed no antibacterial effects against MSSA in the disk diffusion test. For subsequent experiments, therefore, only GSE was used. GSE showed inhibition zones against MDR bacteria (MRSA and VRSA) as well as MSSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The inhibition zones of GSE against MSSA, MRSA 33591, MRSA 3795, and VRSA48 were 18.3 &#x000b1; 0.6 mm, 16.8 &#x000b1; 0.6 mm, 18.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm, and 16.4 &#x000b1; 0.4 mm, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 3). In the experiment with VRSA48, there were two circles surrounding the GSE paper disk. One was a small circle (real inhibition zone), and the other was a larger circle (zone of incomplete inhibition of bacterial growth). Therefore, the smaller circle was measured as the inhibition zone. GSE showed antibacterial effects against all tested bacteria. The inhibition zones of LZD, which was used as a control, against MSSA, MRSA 33591, MRSA 3795, and VRSA48, were 28.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm, 29.3 &#x000b1; 0.6 mm, 24.6 &#x000b1; 0.5 mm, and 25.7 &#x000b1; 0.4 mm, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 3). These diameter values were illustrated with bar graphs. All tested bacteria were susceptible to LZD, according to the CLSI guidelines (&#x02265;21 mm for <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp.) [<xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the inhibition zone for GSE was smaller than that of LZD, the antibacterial effect of GSE was confirmed through a disk diffusion test. In the next experiment, the pH and percentage of the solvent of the GSE were measured because the antibacterial effect of GSE may occur due to the solvent in which the GSE was dissolved or the acidic properties of the GSE itself.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>3.2. GSE Characterization</title><p>As the pH or solvent of GSE solutions could affect bacterial growth, the pH of the GSE and the percentage solvent were measured with a pH meter (inoLab pH 7110, Germany) and an LC-MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. Glycerol was analyzed quantitatively because we had received information from HERBFLORA (Seoul, Korea) that the GSE extract was dissolved in glycerol that is highly effective for obtaining phenolic compounds [<xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It was confirmed that the pH of GSE was 2.90 &#x000b1; 0.04 (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and that the GSE extract was dissolved in 76% glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these results, 76% glycerol (76% G throughout the paper) was prepared, and pH-adjusted 76% glycerol (pH 76% G throughout the paper) was prepared from 76% G using acetic acid. The pH of 76% G and pH 76% G were measured using a pH meter (inoLab pH 7110, Germany) and showed pH values of 4.37 &#x000b1; 0.06 and 2.94 &#x000b1; 0.01, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 3). The pH 76% G was prepared carefully without any significant difference from the pH of GSE. The antibacterial effect of GSE is already known, and since it is known that GSE contains flavonoids with antimicrobial effects, flavonoids were also analyzed by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS in addition to glycerol [<xref rid="B25-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. GSE is known to contain relatively large amounts of the flavonoid naringin, so naringin was quantitatively analyzed. Glycerol and naringin were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and the other flavonoids hesperidin, eriocitrin, poncirin, and quercetin were analyzed by LC-MS. To measure the concentration of glycerol and naringin in GSE, reference compounds glycerol (&#x02265;99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and naringin (&#x02265;95.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were purchased. These reagents dissolved in DW were measured by LC-MS/MS, and then compared with GSE analysis results. Glycerol concentration was measured at 762.544 mg/mL (it was considered to be 760 mg/mL, 76%) at 0.63 min, and naringin concentration was determined as 1.726 mg/mL (it was considered to be 1.7 mg/mL) at 3.64 min. From the LC-MS results, quercetin and hesperidin were identified at 0.74 min and 3.70 min, respectively, in GSE (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00085">Figure S2</xref>). However, because the quercetin and hesperidin concentrations were very low, no peaks were seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f002">Figure 2</xref>B. Eriocitrin and poncirin were not detected in GSE.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>3.3. Antibacterial Effects of Solvent and pH of GSE in Disk Diffusion Tests</title><p>GSE dissolved in 76% G was analyzed, and it also had a low pH value. Because high concentrations of glycerol and low pH can affect bacterial growth [<xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the antimicrobial activity of 76% G and pH 76% G was evaluated along with GSE and LZD. In disk diffusion tests, GSE and LZD showed effects almost identical to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f001">Figure 1</xref>, but 76% G and pH 76% G did not show any inhibition zones against any tested bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, 76% G and pH 76% G were marked as N.D. (not detected) in bar graphs. In the experiment with VRSA48, it appeared that an inhibition zone formed in the glycerol group, but bacterial growth was checked inside the circle which resembled an inhibition zone. From disk diffusion tests, we found that glycerol and the pH of GSE have little effect on the antibacterial effect of GSE.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>3.4. Antibacterial Effects of Solvent and pH of GSE in Microdilution MIC Test</title><p>To further investigate whether glycerol or the pH of GSE influenced the antimicrobial activity of GSE, microdilution MIC tests were performed. The MIC test is also a standard method described by the CLSI. This method is more detailed than the disk diffusion test because it shows antibacterial effects according to various concentrations. In the 96-well plate figures, the MICs of pH 76% G and 76% G are indicated by red arrows and the MICs of antibiotics by blue arrows. The MIC of GSE and the MIC for &#x0003e;32 &#x000b5;g/mL antibiotic are not indicated. In MIC tests, GSE showed potent antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria. Even at a concentration of 1/1024, the growth of all tested bacteria was suppressed. The red dots that resemble bacterial colonies at the 1/64 and 1/128 concentrations and the turbidity seen in the other concentration groups were the result of the influence of the GSE itself (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00085">Figure S3</xref>), and it was confirmed that bacteria did not grow in the 1/2 through the 1/1024 concentrations by checking values of CFU (data not shown). The 76% G and pH 76% G treatments showed slight antibacterial effects in MIC tests. pH 76% G showed a MIC value one level lower (1/4 concentration) than that for 76% G (1/2 concentration), except for MRSA. For MRSA, both 76% G and pH 76% G showed a MIC value at 1/2 concentration. Antibiotics were used as controls to check if the experiment was performed properly, and they were also used to check MRSA and VRSA. MSSA and MRSA can be distinguished through the OXA MIC value (&#x02265;4 &#x003bc;g/mL, MRSA), and VRSA can be identified through the VAN MIC value (&#x02265;16 &#x003bc;g/mL, VRSA) [<xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. VAN, OXA, and LZD showed MIC values of 1 &#x003bc;g/mL, 0.25 &#x003bc;g/mL, and 2 &#x003bc;g/mL against MSSA, respectively. VAN, OXA, and LZD showed MIC values of 1 &#x003bc;g/mL, &#x0003e;32 &#x003bc;g/mL, and 1 &#x003bc;g/mL against MRSA 33591, respectively. VAN, OXA, and LZD showed MIC values of 1 &#x003bc;g/mL, &#x0003e;32 &#x003bc;g/mL, and 1 &#x003bc;g/mL against MRSA 3795, respectively. VAN, OXA, and LZD showed MIC values of &#x0003e;32 &#x003bc;g/mL, &#x0003e;32 &#x003bc;g/mL, and 4 &#x003bc;g/mL against VRSA48, respectively. These results are illustrated as bar graphs. The MICs of GSE, pH 76% G, and 76% G can be read as values of the left <italic>y</italic>-axis (red arrow), and MICs of antibiotics can be read as values of the right <italic>y</italic>-axis (blue arrow). GSE was expressed as &#x0003c;1/1024, as bacteria did not grow even at 1/1024 concentration in any experimental groups. For antibiotics, MIC was expressed as &#x0003e;32 if the growth of bacteria was not inhibited even at a concentration of 32 &#x003bc;g/mL. Based on these antibiotic MIC values, MSSA, MRSA, and VRSA could be identified, and the reliability of the experiment was confirmed. As the MIC test was performed by finding the MIC values of the antibiotics for each bacterial strain several times, each MIC test including that for GSE was completed in one experiment. In disk diffusion tests and MIC tests, it was confirmed that the pH and glycerol did not significantly affect the antimicrobial activity of GSE. This result signifies that there are substances that affect the antibacterial activity of GSE in addition to the pH and solvent of GSE. Several articles related to the antibacterial activity of GSE or other plants have indicated that flavonoids have antibacterial activity [<xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. GSE contained a large amount of the flavonoid naringin, so the following experiment was conducted by focusing on naringin.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>3.5. Antibacterial Effect of Naringin</title><p>The antimicrobial activity of naringin against several bacterial species, including <italic>S. aureus</italic>, has already been confirmed in several papers [<xref rid="B39-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The experiment was conducted after preparing a pH 76% G solution containing 1.7 mg/mL naringin. It is indicated as &#x0201c;pH 76% G (naringin)&#x0201d; in figures. In the 96-well plate figures, the MICs of pH 76% G and 76% G are indicated by red arrows, and antibiotic MICs are indicated by blue arrows. The MIC of GSE and the MICs for &#x0003e;32 &#x000b5;g/mL antibiotic are not indicated. In the bar graphs, the MICs of GSE and pH 76% G (naringin) can be read as values of the left <italic>y</italic>-axis (red arrow), and MICs of antibiotics can be read as values of the right <italic>y</italic>-axis (blue arrow). Compared to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f004">Figure 4</xref>, GSE and antibiotics showed identical MIC values. The pH 76% G (naringin) also showed the same effects as pH 76% G without naringin against MSSA, MRSA 33591, MRSA 3795, and VRSA48. From the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00085-f005">Figure 5</xref>, we knew that naringin did not play an important role in the antibacterial activity of GSE. The antibacterial effect of GSE can be exhibited by benzethonium chloride, a preservative commonly used in commercial GSE [<xref rid="B44-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but the GSE used in this experiment was confirmed by the manufacturer to be free of benzethonium chloride. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect of GSE may result from synergistic effects of flavonoids [<xref rid="B45-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, because the concentrations of flavonoids other than naringin are quite small, the probability of a synergistic effect is very low. These our experiments and results can indirectly support the claim that the other phenolic compounds other than flavonoids in GSE contribute to the antimicrobial effects of GSE [<xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00085" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted without removing the solvent (glycerol) to find out the concentration of glycerol and to eliminate the potential risk that the filter to make concentrated GSE could filter out substances with antibacterial activity. Therefore, an experiment to analyze concentrated GSE is required, and then additional experiments to confirm the antibacterial activity of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds are required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-antibiotics-10-00085"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>There are many papers on the antibacterial activity of GSE. They have shown antibacterial activity of GSE against MDR bacteria such as MRSA and VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci). However, the antibacterial effect of GSE on VRSA was first mentioned in this paper. GSE showed antibacterial activity against MSSA, MRSA, and VRSA in disk diffusion and microdilution MIC tests. The experiments were conducted with glycerol, acidic conditions, and naringin, which were expected to have antimicrobial activity, but the antibacterial effect of GSE was not sufficiently explained. Nevertheless, since GSE exerts favorable antimicrobial activity against not only MSSA but also MDR bacteria, it can be a valuable natural substance for preventing or reducing nosocomial infection, and further analysis is likely to be needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2019R1C1C1002490 and 2020R1A2C1005867), by the Global Research Development Center Program (2018K1A4A3A01064257) and by the Priority Research Center Program provided by the Ministry of Education (2019R1A6A1A11034536).
