    "Allium is one of the well-known genera of the Amaryllidaceae family, which contains over 780 species. Onions, garlic, leeks, and shallots are the most important species of this genus. Allium hirtifolium (shallot) is a rich source of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and bioactive compounds such as organic sulfur compounds with an expansive range of biological activities and medicinal attributes. To identify the putative compounds and genes involved in the organic sulfur pathway, we applied GC-MS and RNA-seq techniques for the bulb, stem, and flower tissues of A. hirtifolium. The essential oil analysis revealed the maximum amount of sulfur compounds in stem against flower and bulb tissues. Transcriptome profiling showed 6155, 6494, and 4259 DEGs for bulb vs. flower, bulb vs. stem, and flower vs. stem, respectively. Overall, more genes were identified as being up-regulated rather than down-regulated in flower tissue compared to the stem and bulb tissues. Our findings in accordance with other results from different papers, suggest that carbohydrates are vital to bulb formation and development because a high number of identified DEGs (586 genes) were mapped to carbohydrate metabolism. This study has detected the genes in the organic sulfur pathway and indicated that the alliinase gene shows a high variability among different tissues. In general, this study formed a useful genomic resource data to explore tissue-specific sulfur pathway in A. hirtifolium, which is helpful for functional breeding."
