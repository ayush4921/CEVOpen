    "<h4>Background</h4>Mosquito control programme using synthetic insecticides has been facing the challenges of resistance development. However, synergistic combinations of plant essential oils (EOs) having different modes of actions and potent lethal toxicity may further negate the concern of resistance development.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, the toxicity of 28 EOs and the two synthetic insecticides, Temephos and Malathion were evaluated individually and based on the performance, binary combinations of effective EOs were prepared and tested against the larval and adult stages of <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>. Mixtures were prepared by blending LC10 or LD10 concentration/doses of candidates at different volume ratios.<h4>Results</h4>Results demonstrated that among 155 numbers of combinations of different volume ratios, 1:1 ratio of <i>A. sativum</i> (bulbs) L.+<i>C. paradisi</i> (peels) Macfd. (AsB + CpP) was found to be the most potent against adults, whereas, 1:1 volume ratio of <i>Allium sativum</i> (bulbs)+ <i>Citrus paradisi</i> (leaves) (AsB + CpL) was found to possess highest activity against larvae after considering its dose and synergistic interaction. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of diallyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, beta-citronellol, ocimene as major constituents of AsB + CpP combination and diallyl disulfide, linalool, citronellal, caryophyllene oxide etc. in AsB + CpL combination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Therefore, the said mixtures of the plant essential oils and or mixtures of the constituent compounds can be used as effective control agents for the control of the filarial vector, <i>C. quinquefasciatus</i>."
