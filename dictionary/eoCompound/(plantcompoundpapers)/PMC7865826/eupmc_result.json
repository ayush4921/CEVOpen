    "Mass spectrometry-based molecular imaging has been utilized to map the spatial distribution of target metabolites in various matrixes. Among the diverse mass spectrometry techniques, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is the most popular for molecular imaging due to its powerful spatial resolution. This unparalleled high resolution, however, can paradoxically act as a bottleneck when the bio-imaging of large areas, such as a whole plant, is required. To address this issue and provide a more versatile tool for large scale bio-imaging, direct analysis in real-time-time of flight-mass spectrometry (DART-TOF-MS), an ambient ionization MS, was applied to whole plant bio-imaging of a medicinal plant, Ephedrae Herba. The whole aerial part of the plant was cut into 10-20 cm long pieces, and each part was further cut longitudinally to compare the contents of major ephedra alkaloids between the outer surface and inner part of the stem. Using optimized DART-TOF-MS conditions, molecular imaging of major ephedra alkaloids of the whole aerial part of a single plant was successfully achieved. The concentration of alkaloids analyzed in this study was found to be higher on the inner section than the outer surface of stems. Moreover, side branches, which are used in traditional medicine, represented a far higher concentration of alkaloids than the main stem. In terms of the spatial metabolic distribution, the contents of alkaloids gradually decreased towards the end of branch tips. In this study, a fast and simple macro-scale MS imaging of the whole plant was successfully developed using DART-TOF-MS. This application on the localization of secondary metabolites in whole plants can provide an area of new research using ambient ionization mass spectroscopy and an unprecedented macro-scale view of the biosynthesis and distribution of active components in medicinal plants."
