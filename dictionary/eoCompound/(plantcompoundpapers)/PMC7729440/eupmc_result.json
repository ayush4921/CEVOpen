    "Phytochemical investigations of <i>Matricaria chamomilla</i> L. (Asteraceae) stated the presence of several compounds with an established therapeutic and antioxidant potential. The chamomile non-enzymatic antioxidant system includes low molecular mass compounds, mainly polyphenols such as cinnamic, hydroxybenzoic and chlorogenic acids, flavonoids and coumarins. The objective of this work was to evaluate the role of the non-enzymatic antioxidant system after stimulation by ethylene in tetraploid chamomile plants. Seven days of ethylene treatment significantly increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which influenced the biosynthesis of protective polyphenols in the first step of their biosynthetic pathway. Subsequently, considerable enhanced levels of phenolic metabolites with a substantial antioxidant effect (syringic, vanillic and caffeic acid, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercetin, luteolin, daphnin, and herniarin) were determined by HPLC-DAD-MS. The minimal information on the chlorogenic acids function in chamomile led to the isolation and identification of 5-<i>O</i>-feruloylquinic acid. It is accumulated during normal conditions, but after the excessive effect of abiotic stress, its level significantly decreases and levels of other caffeoylquinic acids enhance. Our results suggest that ethephon may act as a stimulant of the production of pharmaceutically important non-enzymatic antioxidants in chamomile leaves and thus, lead to an overall change in phytochemical content and therapeutic effects of chamomile plants, as well."
