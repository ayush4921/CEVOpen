Adaptation to the chemical environment of the xylem is essential for bacterial growth and progression of infection. Grapevine xylem sap contains a range of plant secondary metabolites such as phenolics, which fluctuate in response to pathogen infection and plant physiological state. Phenolic compounds are often involved in host-pathogen interactions and influence infection dynamics through signaling activity, antimicrobial properties, and alteration of bacterial phenotypes. The effect of biologically relevant concentrations of phenolic compounds coumaric acid, gallic acid, epicatechin, and resveratrol on growth of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> was assessed in vitro. None of these compounds inhibited bacterial growth, but epicatechin and gallic acid reduced cell-surface adhesion. Cell-cell aggregation decreased with resveratrol treatment, but the other phenolic compounds tested had minimal effect on aggregation. Expression of attachment (<italic>xadA</italic>) and aggregation (<italic>fimA</italic>) related genes were altered by presence of the phenolic compounds, consistent with observed phenotypes. All four of the phenolic compounds bound to purified <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell-surface component. Information regarding the impact of chemical environment on pathogen colonization in plants is important for understanding the infection process and factors associated with host susceptibility.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007917</institution-id><institution>Agricultural Research Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2034-22000-010-00D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9614-1259</contrib-id><name><surname>Burbank</surname><given-names>Lindsey P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding for this work was from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service appropriated project 2034-22000-010-00D.

Restricted to the xylem tissue of plants, <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> is transmitted to grapevine by xylem-feeding insects, including sharpshooters, leafhoppers, and spittlebugs [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The transition between colonization of the insect vector and plant host is a highly regulated process, which relies on quorum sensing to transition between an adhesive biofilm state and systemic motility dependent on type IV pili [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cell-cell aggregation mediated by fimbrial adhesins is an essential part of early biofilm formation in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Encoded by the <italic>fim</italic> operon (<italic>fimACDEF</italic>, <italic>edcD</italic>) which is expressed in planta, fimbrial type I pili are located at the cell poles and are distinct from the type IV pili used for twitching motility [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Binding of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> to solid surfaces also requires outer membrane adhesin proteins including XadA and hemagglutinin proteins HxfA and HxfB [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In planta, adhesion to xylem walls is modulated by formation of outer membrane vesicles which block immediate binding of bacterial cells. This process promotes dispersive movement throughout the vascular tissue prior to initiation of the adhesive phenotype important for insect acquisition which occurs when bacterial cells reach high density [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition to cell-density regulated changes, <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> adaptation to the plant environment is enabled by evasion of initial recognition by the host, and protection against reactive oxygen species produced by plant metabolism and defense responses [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the prominent bacterial cell surface components that often triggers immune recognition by plant cells [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic>, the external O-antigen portion of the LPS molecule affects cell-surface adhesion dynamics and biofilm formation, in addition to playing an important role in delaying immune recognition by the plant [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The chemical environment in plant tissues contributes to both physical adhesion interactions, and bacterial gene expression. Accordingly, plant metabolites and disease-induced changes in chemical environment in the xylem can have a significant impact on virulence associated phenotypes. Plants infected with <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> had elevated concentrations of calcium, which promoted cell-cell aggregation and biofilm formation, and increased surface adhesion forces [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a study conducted in olive trees, several lipid compounds produced by trees infected with <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> inhibited biofilm formation and increased planktonic cell growth [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Differences in plant chemistry are also associated with <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> resistant versus susceptible grapevine and olive varieties [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Xylem sap of grapevine (<italic>Vitis</italic> sp.) although relatively nutrient poor, contains low concentrations of mineral ions, amino acids, and secondary metabolites, which change according to disease status, cultivar, and plant growth conditions [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Secondary metabolites found in grapevine xylem sap include phenolic compounds such as stilbenoids, tannins, catechins, and coumaric acid derivatives [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Many of these phenolic compounds are associated with plant disease and host defense responses. The stilbenoid compound resveratrol is well-studied for its antioxidant properties [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and also has a role in grapevine defense against fungal pathogens such as <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, possibly through direct inhibition of pathogen growth [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although present in xylem sap at lower concentrations than in other plant tissues, resveratrol is well studied in plant disease response. High amounts of resveratrol are produced during grapevine trunk disease caused by necrotrophic fungal pathogens, in addition to other phenolics such as epicatechin, and gallic acid [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Gallic acid accumulation in grape callus tissue is also associated with resistance to downy mildew (<italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Phenolic compounds are equally important in bacterial-plant interactions, both in establishing symbioses and in pathogenesis. In <italic>Rhizobium</italic> nodule formation and in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> pathogenesis, phenolics act as signaling molecules that alter bacterial gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. On the plant side, in <italic>Brassica</italic> species the phenolic compound p-coumaric acid induces plant resistance to <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> through the jasmonic acid signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Total concentration of phenolic compounds in grapevine xylem sap increases in response to <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> infection, but consequences for the pathogen are not known [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous work investigating the effects of phenolic compounds including resveratrol, catechin, coumaric acid, and gallic acid on <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> growth in vitro focused on antimicrobial properties of the chemicals in high doses [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As the naturally occurring concentrations of these chemicals in grapevine xylem sap are well below the level required for direct inhibition of bacterial growth, the role of phenolics in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic>-grapevine interactions is likely more complex [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study we evaluate the effect of resveratrol, epicatechin, gallic acid, and coumaric acid, in concentrations that would naturally occur in grapevine xylem sap, on <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> growth, surface adhesion, and cell-cell aggregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Phenolic compounds inhibit cell-surface attachment and aggregation</title><p>Cell-surface attachment of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> strain Temecula-1 was quantified by crystal violet staining after growth in liquid medium supplemented with gallic acid (500, 1000, 2000 &#x003bc;g/ml), epicatechin (100, 200, 400 &#x003bc;g/ml), resveratrol (7.5, 15, 30 &#x003bc;g/ml), and coumaric acid (30, 60, 120 &#x003bc;g/ml)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240101.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Tannins, a chemical class including catechin compounds, not only disrupted biofilm formation of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, but also suppressed other virulence associated traits such as exopolysaccharide production and antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In this study, grapevine-associated phenolic compounds epicatechin, and gallic acid inhibited <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> cell-surface attachment in vitro. Resveratrol at concentrations found in xylem sap did not significantly impact cell surface attachment overall, but reduced auto-aggregation which is essential for the early stages of biofilm formation in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic>. Cells cultivated in the presence of resveratrol also did not form as much of a characteristic biofilm ring at the air-liquid interface, likely because deficiency in cell-cell aggregation interferes with proper biofilm structure formation [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The phenolic concentrations in this study were in the range of those found in grapevine xylem sap and were not high enough to inhibit bacterial growth. However, influence on attachment and aggregation phenotypes suggest an important role of phytochemicals in the <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> infection process in grapevine. Not all phenolic compounds present in grapevine xylem sap showed this effect, as coumaric acid did not alter cell attachment or aggregation when present in biologically relevant concentrations. Similar phenotypic changes were seen with olive pathogenic strains of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> exposed to phytochemicals (lipid compounds) present in infected olive tissue, suggesting a broad role of plant produced compounds in progression of disease caused by this pathogen in different host plants [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Cell-surface attachment and cell-cell aggregation are part of the complex biofilm development process of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> that involves widespread transcriptional changes.

Expression of <italic>xadA</italic> in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> was reduced when growth medium was supplemented with gallic acid, epicatechin, or resveratrol, which may have contributed to the reduction in surface attachment in gallic acid and epicatechin treated cells. Although resveratrol treated cells did not show significantly reduced attachment, expression of <italic>xadA</italic> alone likely does not provide the whole picture. Other afimbrial adhesins such as the hemagglutinins are also important for <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> surface attachment and could play a compensatory role under some growth conditions [<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0240101.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In addition to adhesins, initial stages of biofilm development in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> require cell-cell aggregation mediated by fimbrial type I pili.

That said, all four of the phenolic compounds bound to purified <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> LPS, suggesting that a significant depletion from the growth medium may occur through direct binding to the bacterial cell surface.
