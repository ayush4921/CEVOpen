It once was a popular laboratory method for purification of organic compounds but has become obsolete by vacuity distillation. Steam distillation still important in certain industrial sectors(Fahlbusch et al., 2003). Steam distillation is one of ancient and official approved methods for isolation of essential oils from plant materials. The plant materials charged in the alembic are subjected to the steam without maceration in water. The injected steam passes through the plants from the base of the alembic to the top. Steam distillation is a method where steam flows through the material as shown in Figure 3. This steam functions as agents that break up the pores of the raw material and release the essential oil from it. The system yields a mixture of a vapor and desired essential oil. This vapor is then condensed further and the essential oil is collected (Rai R. and Suresh B., 2004). The principle of this technique is that the combined vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure at about 100 C so that the volatile components with the boiling points ranging from 150 to 300 C can be evaporated at a temperature close to that of water. Furthermore, this technique can be also carried out under pressure depending on the essential oils extraction difficulty."/><entry DAVEid="DAVE.extractionID.02" term="vacuity distillation" acronym="" wikidataid="Q1648382" apparatus="rotary evaporator" description="Vacuum distillation is distillation performed under reduced pressure, which allows the purification of compounds not readily distilled at ambient pressures or simply to save time or energy.

Cold pressed method is one of the best methods to extract essential oils. This process is used for most carrier oils and many essential oils. This process ensures that the resulting oil is 100% pure and retains all the properties of the plant. It is a method of mechanical extraction where heat is reduced and minimized throughout the batching of the raw material. The cold pressed method is also known as scarification method. Cold pressed method is mainly used for extracting essential oils from plants, flower, seeds, lemon, tangerine oils (Arnould et al., 1981).

A Soxhlet extractor is a piece of laboratory apparatus ( Harwood, Laurence M. and Moody, Christopher J, 1989) invented in 1879 by Franz von Soxhlet. (Soxhlet et al., 1879) It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material (Figure 5 ). Typically, a Soxhlet extraction is used when the desired compound has a limited solubility in a solvent, and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent. It allows for unmonitored and unmanaged operation while efficiently recycling a small amount of solvent to dissolve a larger amount of material. Soxhlet extraction involves solid-liquid contact for the removal of one or several compounds from a solid by dissolution into a refluxing liquid phase. In a conventional soxhlet device, the solid matrix is placed in a cavity that is gradually filled with the extracting liquid phase by condensation of vapors from a distillation flask. When the liquid reaches a preset level, a siphon pulls the contents of the cavity back into the distillation flask, thus carrying the extracted analytes into the bulk liquid (Schantz et al., 1998). This procedure is repeated until virtually complete extraction is achieved. There are several advantages of Soxhlet extraction. The most important are that the sample is repeatedly brought into contact with fresh portions of the solvent. This procedure prevents the possibility of the solvent becoming saturated with extractable material and enhances the removal of the analyte from the matrix. Moreover, the temperature of the system is close to the boiling point of the solvent. This excess energy in the form of heat helps to increase the extraction kinetics of the system. Soxhlet extraction has several disadvantages, including it requires several hours or days to perform; the sample is diluted in large volumes of solvent, and due to the heating of the distillation flask losses due to thermal degradation and volatilization have been observed."/><entry DAVEid="DAVE.extractionID.13" term="expeller pressing" acronym="" wikidataid="Q2963433" apparatus="expeller" description="Expeller pressing (also called oil pressing) is a mechanical method for extracting oil from raw materials.

Spinning band distillation takes this concept one step further by using a spinning helical band made of an inert material such as metal or Teflon to push the rising vapors and descending condensate to the sides of the column, coming into close contact with each other.

This keeps the product closer to retaining more of the plant's valuable offerings.The ideal plant material to be infused will be harvested so that it is as dry as possible, as any plant moisture will cause the oil to become rancid and will encourage microbial growth. Adding 5% of Vitamin E oil or Wheatgerm oil (which is high in Vitamin E) will prevent rancidity. MACERATION PROCESS: Plant material is finely cut, crushed, or ground into moderately coarse powder. Plant material is placed in a closed vessel. Solvent (Menstruum) is added. The mixture is allowed to stand for 1 week and is shaken occasionally. The liquid is strained. Solid residue (Marc) is pressed to recover any remaining liquid. Strained and expressed liquids are mixed. Liquids are clarified through filtration or subsidence. When the maceration process is complete, the base oil will likely have changed color. The final maceration should be filtered of its plant material and poured into an airtight container to be stored in a cool, dry place for up to 12 months.

In this method, the material is completely immersed in water, which is boiled by applying heat by direct fire, steam jacket, closed steam jacket, closed steam coil or open steam coil. The main characteristic of this process is that there is direct contact between boiling water and plant material (unlike hydrodistillation, where the plant material is not immersed in the water). The conventional method for the extraction of essential oils is hydrodistillation (HD), in which the essential oils are evaporated by heating a mixture of water or other solvent and plant materials followed by the liquefaction of the vapors in a condenser.The setup comprises also a condenser and a decanter to collect the condensate and to separate essential oils from water, respectively. The principle of extraction is based on the isotropic distillation. In fact, at atmospheric pressure and during extraction process (heating), water or other solvent and oils molecules. Hydro-distillation (HD) is a variant of steam distillation, which is bespoke by the French Pharmacopoeia for the extraction of Essential oils from dried plants and the quality control of essential oils in the lab. There are three types of hydrodistillation: with water immersion, with direct vapor injection and with water immersion and vapor injection.

The fruits are rotated against the abrasive shell by a slow-moving Archimedian screw whose surface rasps the fruit surfaces causing some of the essential oil cavities on the peel to burst and release their oil-water emulsion. This screw further transports the fruit into a hopper in which rollers covered with abrasive spikes burst the remaining oil cavities. The oil and water emulsion is washed away from the fruit by a fine spray of water. The emulsion next passes through a separator where any solids are removed, after which it passes through two centrifugal separators working in series to yield the pure oil. Most bergamot oil and some lemon oil are produced this way in Italy."/><entry DAVEid="DAVE.extractionID.61" term="sfumatrice Process" acronym="" wikidataid="Q87193222" apparatus="sfumatrice " description="The Sfumatrice Method is the process of pressing the citrus oil from previously juiced peels. It is part of a total juicing process (aka Birillatrice) where citrus fruits are sliced in half and individually juiced with a rotating cone-shaped reamer. The sfumatrice equipment consists of a metallic chain that is drawn by two horizontal ribbed rollers. The peels are conveyed through these rollers during which time they are pressed and bent to release their oil. As in pelatrice, the oil is washed away from the sfumatrice rollers by fi ne sprays of water. Again, the oil is initially passed through a separator prior to being sent to two centrifuges in series, so that purified oil can be produced. At one time, sfumatrice was the most popular process for citrus oil isolation in Italy; however, today the pelatrice method appears more popular."/><entry DAVEid="DAVE.extractionID.62" term="stir-bar sorptive extraction" acronym="SBSE" wikidataid="Q87193341" apparatus="" description="Stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) is an extraction technique for enrichment of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds from aqueous and gaseous media.

The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils."/><entry DAVEid="DAVE.extractionID.72" term="scratch" acronym="" wikidataid="" apparatus="" description="For natural rubber, workers called tappers cut a shallow groove in the bark of a tree and collect the drops of latex in a cup.
