can be altered by plant invasion into wetland
ecosystems and comprise an important linkage between phosphorus (P)
availability and soil carbon (C) chemistry; however, the intrinsic
mechanisms of P and C transformation associated with microbial community
and function are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this study,
we used a sequential fractionation method and <sup>13</sup>C nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to capture the changes in soil
P pools and C chemical composition with bare flats (BF), native <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>(PA), and invasive <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic>(SA), respectively. The responses
of the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)
profiling and function indicated by nine enzyme activities associated
with C, nitrogen (N), and P cycles were also investigated. Compared
to PA and BF, SA invasion significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05)
changed P pools and mainly increased the available P by 17.5 and 37.0%,
respectively. The presence of the plants (SA and PA) significantly
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) altered the soil C chemical composition
mainly by affecting the aliphatic functional groups, resulting in
a lower alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio value. Compared to BF and SA, PA significantly
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
(AMF) abundance. Soil enzyme activity, especially for the P and C
cycle enzymes, was also affected by plant species with the highest
geometric mean enzyme and hydrolase activity for the PA zone. We also
found that soil C compositions and P pools were associated with microbial
community structure and enzyme activity, respectively. However, little
interaction between C and P was found on either soil microbial composition
or soil enzyme activity variation. Further, microbial community composition
was tightly correlated with the soil P compared to soil C chemistry,
while enzyme activity showed more response with soil C chemistry compared
to soil P pool changes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c06161</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c06161</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Wetlands
form a critical interface between uplands and adjacent
water bodies, and act as transition and buffer zones between terrestrial
and marine ecosystems, due to their special position in the landscape.
These ecosystems are complex but fragile as they are easily invaded
by exotic plant species, which threaten native plants and change ecosystem
functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup><italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> (SA), which is native to North America, was introduced to eastern
China for coastal protection and sediment stabilization in 1979.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Since then, the SA population has expanded rapidly,
invading bare flat (BF) land and displacing native plants. Thus, SA
has become one of the dominant invasive species found in the coastal
wetlands of eastern China and is most widely distributed on the Jiangsu
coast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup></p><p>The spatial and temporal
distribution characteristics of phosphorus
are important indicators of the eutrophication risks, productivity,
and functions of wetland ecosystems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Thus,
soil P transformation and transportation in wetland soils have received
considerable attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup><italic>S. alterniflora</italic> invasion would definitely affect P cycles in the wetland ecosystem.
The dynamics of phosphorus concentrations and fractions is thought
to be extremely complex, due to the intermittent flooding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and the diversity of plant species,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and also involves plant&#x02013;microbe interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However, soil P transformation was observed to
be tightly linked with C cycles. Firstly, the anaerobic condition
in the tide period could release more available P since iron and manganese
minerals are sensitive to redox changes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> while this redox condition also usually impedes the decomposition
of soil organic carbon (SOC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Secondly,
SA has greater biomass and a more developed root system than native
plants such as <italic>Suaeda salsa</italic> and <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>(PA). Thus, SA invasion could
result in a different P utilization efficiency, but also might provide
a higher input of plant resides with a slower decomposition rate of
SOC. Further, microbial communities and functions have been shown
to provide a different feedback on nutrient availability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> although SOC is an important regulator of the
soil microbial community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Fungi are able
to utilize recalcitrant organic matter when the soil organic matter
decomposition rates and nutrient (i.e., P) availability are low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> For example, Huang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> reported that
the increased C input induced by vegetation in coastal wetland soils
significantly affects phosphatase activity, which is a key factor
for soil P mineralization. Gao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> illustrated that plant type and distribution can also alter tidal
hydrodynamics and the lateral transportation of sediments, which further
affects the soil C and P cycle.</p><p>There is a large body of reports
on soil organic C sequestration,
and their relationships with microbial community composition under
SA invasion, since wetland ecosystems accumulate 20&#x02013;30% of
global soil carbon storage in 5&#x02013;8% of the land area and have
the highest productivity per unit area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Importantly, changes in soil conditions induced by SA invasion could
simultaneously trigger fluctuations in the transformation of P and
C, and subsequently impact microbial community structure; then, their
feedback on the P and C dynamics would largely change the P and C
cycles in wetland systems. However, the linkage between P and C transformations
and microbial community composition and function, and their interacting
mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p><p>In the present study, we
investigated the forms and availability
of P and C composition in the soil from three wetland communities
in northern China. The samples were taken from the wetland invaded
by SA, occupied by the dominant emergent species <italic>Phragmites
australis</italic> (PA), and the bare flat (BF) land nearby.
We hypothesized that (i) SA invasion would increase soil P availability;
(ii) SA invasion would repress SOC decomposition, resulting in lower
C recalcitrance under anaerobic conditions; and (iii) C chemistry
interaction with changes in P pools would alter microbial community
and function.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Changes in Soil P Fractionation</title><p>The

with the higher alkyl C component in SA samples, led to a higher value
of A/O-A in SA samples than in PA samples. Additionally, the aromaticity

fractionation of soil P and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy
were employed to illustrate the alteration in soil P pools and C chemical
forms after the invasion of SA. Primary P (HCl-P) was the dominant
form of P in all three vegetation cover soils (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>), which may be related to the high pH and
salinity of coastal wetlands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> The little
variation of primary P among the samples demonstrated that HCl-P originated
from soil minerals rather than plant residues. Soil P fractions that
display obvious fluctuations can be characterized as mobilizable P
pools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In the present study, SA invasion
significantly increased the amounts of soil-available P compared to
PA and BF samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). The increase in soil-available P may be attributed to the
well-developed root tissue of SA and its exudates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Microbial decomposers can mobilize P as a nutrient for
their growth. The increase in soil-available P may be caused by the
microbial decomposers associated with plant roots, as a result of
the observation that PLFAs and P concentrations were tightly linked
(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>). <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> is mainly located in the intertidal
zone, where the periodic floods and low tides result in alternating
periods of wetting and drying. The distribution of secondary mineral
P (Fe/Al-P) is sensitive to oscillations in redox potential caused
by the alternation of dry and wet conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Compared to BF, SA increased secondary mineral P concentrations,
which indicated that the growth environment of SA favors the formation
of Fe/Al-P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>The results from the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy indicated
that O-alkyl C was the dominant form of C in the coastal wetlands,
accounting for more than 40% of the soil C relative intensity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Among the soil
samples, the PA samples had the highest proportion of O-alkyl C and
the lowest A/O-A ratio values, indicating that PA may have the highest
decomposition potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Further, SA
had a higher HI ratio compared to PA, which is an indicator of the
stability of the combination of soil C and aggregation; the larger
the ratio value, the higher the soil C stability resulting from aggregation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Taken together, the results seemly showed that
SA invasion elevates the degree of SOM recalcitrance in the soil compared
to that in soils occupied by native plants (<italic>P. australis</italic>). However, we observed no significant differences between SA and
PA in SOC contents (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c06161/suppl_file/ao0c06161_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). This demonstrated
two different SOC stabilization mechanisms between SA and PA. Compared
to the elevated SOC recalcitrance for SOM originated from SA, C protection
mechanisms for PA may be related to the chemical protection of mineral-related
C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Here, BF with the highest A/O-A ratio
and HI value indicated that the labile C had been largely consumed,
thus resulting in high stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p><p>The microbial community structure based on PLFAs and a series of
hydrolase and oxidoreductase activities related to soil nutrient cycling
were also observed. In detail, soil PPO, CL, SC, and &#x003b2;-GC were
carbon-related enzymes, NE and NR were nitrogen-related enzymes, and
ACP and ALP were phosphorus-related enzymes. The soil enzyme activity
differed among the soils occupied by different plants, while the microbial
community composition did not appear to vary using the PLFA approach
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Compared with the BF samples, the presence of
plants promoted the activities of ALP, CL, and PPO, but reduced the
activity of NR. Further, compared to SA and BF, PA induced a higher
GH activity but a lower GOR activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). This might be due to a higher demand of
P for SA; thus, more GOR enzymes were released to decompose SOC to
acquire more P, since P is the limiting factor for microbial growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p><p>The linkages between soil C forms, P fractions and soil PLFAs,
and enzyme activity were further explored through RDA and Pearson
correlation analyses. We found that soil C composition and P together
could explain 94.2 and 99.6% of the shift in microbial community composition
and functions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>d,h). Unexpectedly, little interaction existed between these two
factors and microbial community composition or function. Further,
more than soil C, soil P composition explained the soil microbial
community structure change; however, this was the opposite for soil
enzyme activity. This phenomenon might be ascribed to the fact that
P was the relatively limited factor for microbial growth compared
to C, and thus a greater SOC decomposition is needed to fulfill the
P demand in addition to energy, as mentioned above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> According to the Pearson correlation analysis, the bacterial
and G<sup>&#x02013;</sup> biomass had negative effects on soil Po.
Parallel results have previously been found in the Yeyahu Wetland,
where bacteria have a crucial function in soil P transformation and
are involved in feedback on various P fractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> In accordance with the observation reported by Teng et
al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> we also observed that bacterial PLFAs
dominated the soil microbial community in the bare mudflats as well
as in the soils inhabited by native and invasive plants. Gram-negative
bacteria may promote the production of phosphatase and further increase
the availability of soil P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> In the present
study, compared to BF, SA invasion facilitated the growth of bacteria
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>) and then
resulted in higher Po concentrations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>), although the increase in magnitude is
not significant.</p><p>The relative intensities of aliphatic functional
groups were the
most significant impact factors and mainly regulated the activities
of CL, SC, ACP, NR, CAT, and ALP. CL had a positive effect on O-alkyl
C, and an inverse relationship with alkyl C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). CL catalyzes
the degradation of cellulose, which can be characterized by O-alkyl
C. In other words, a greater abundance of O-alkyl C, as indicated
by higher relative intensity, can promote the activity of CL. It is
worth noting that aromatic C had a progressively increasing effect
on F/B. It has been reported that fungi prefer to decompose recalcitrant
organic matter under conditions of low nutrient availability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Unexpectedly, in the present research, no significant differences
were found among the three treatments in either the F/B ratio or the
soil aromatic C intensity. Microbial community might prefer aliphatic
functional groups to aromatic C based on reduced energy cost associated
with their decomposition.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>S. alterniflora</italic> invasion significantly
enhanced available P concentrations in the soil (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), while native plants (<italic>P. australis</italic>) had no significant effect on soil P fractionation. The presence
of the plants mainly affected the C chemical composition mainly observed
with aliphatic functional groups. Compared to the native plants, <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> invasion led to higher A/O-A ratio
values and elevated the recalcitrance of the SOC. Furthermore, changes
in soil C and P pools affected soil microbial community structure
and enzyme activity. Soil P pools accounted for a greater proportion
of the changes in soil microbial community structure than did soil
C forms, however, which was the opposite for soil enzyme activity.
The present results unveil a new viewpoint for understanding different
soil P and C pools in combination with variations in enzyme activities
and microbial communities in wetland ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Materials

addition of deionized water with one resin strip (Sinopharm Chemical

with low utilization by plants. HCl-P indicates the primary mineral
P pool that binds calcium and is released by the weathering process.
Moreover, residual-P represents the occluded P pool, which is least
likely to be taken up by crops due to its particularly low solubility.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><label>5.3</label><title>Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
