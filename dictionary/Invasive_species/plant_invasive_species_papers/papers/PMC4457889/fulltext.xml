Understanding the impacts of disturbances on species invasion is therefore crucial for invasive species management. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to explore the influence of land-use history and distance to roads on the occurrence and abundance of two invasive plant species (<italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> and <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic>) in a 900-ha deciduous forest in the eastern U.S.A., the Powdermill Nature Reserve. Although much of the reserve has been continuously forested since at least 1939, aerial photos revealed a variety of land-uses since then including agriculture, mining, logging, and development. By 2008, both <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic> were widespread throughout the reserve (occurring in 24% and 13% of 4417 10-m diameter regularly-placed vegetation plots, respectively) with occurrence and abundance of each varying significantly with land-use history. <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> was more likely to occur in historically farmed, mined, logged or developed plots than in plots that remained forested, (log odds of 1.8 to 3.0); <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> was more likely to occur in plots with agricultural, mining, or logging history than in plots without disturbance (log odds of 1.4 to 2.1). Mining, logging, and agriculture increased the probability that <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> had &#x0003e;10% cover while only past agriculture was related to cover of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic>. Proximity to roads was positively correlated with the occurrence of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> (a 0.26 increase in the log odds for every 1-m closer) but not <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic>, and roads had no impact on the abundance of either species. Our results indicated that a wide variety of disturbances may aid the introduction of invasive species into new habitats, while high-impact disturbances such as agriculture and mining increase the likelihood of high abundance post-introduction.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The vegetation survey was made possible through a grant from the Heinz Endowment, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heinz.org/">http://www.heinz.org/</ext-link>.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>A variety of factors determine whether a biological community is particularly susceptible to invasion, including soil nutrients, light levels, disturbance regime, and land-use history [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, some questions remain as to how these factors interact and, in particular, how both the ability of a species to invade and its population abundance once it establishes are influenced by land-use history. The effects of some types of land use on invasive species establishment and spread have been studied in greater detail than others and most studies do not include the effects of distance to road or consider the combined effects of past and current land use.</p><p>Several studies have implicated past land use as a major factor in the establishment and spread of invasive plant species [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Changes in land use, such as clearing land for agriculture and then subsequent reforestation, often create &#x0201c;windows of opportunity&#x0201d; for invasive species to establish in these disturbed areas [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Agriculture, logging, and residential or commercial development all typically increase the distribution of invasive plants, although this depends on the species in question and land use seems to have more of an effect on occurrence than on abundance [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, past land use is more predictive of invasive occurrence and abundance than present land use [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but the best predictor of distribution may be found by combining past and present land use into a single metric of land-use change [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which is rarely done.</p><p>Furthermore, the effects of some past land uses are less well studied, despite their high prevalence in the landscape. For example, the effects of agriculture and logging on invasive spread have been extensively studied, whereas the effects of mining have not been studied as extensively or in the same ways. Over 400,000 hectares of forest have been lost to mining since 1973 in the eastern United States alone and coal mining is currently the leading cause of forest loss in the Allegheny Plateau ecoregion that contains our study site, Powdermill Nature Reserve [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given that mining destroys vegetation, disrupts soils, and alters microbial communities [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it seems likely that mining would enhance the spread of invasive organisms by also creating &#x0201c;windows of opportunity&#x0201d; in a similar manner to how agriculture enhances the spread of invasive species. This situation appears likely, but studies of mining impacts have generally focused on the prevalence of invasive species over the course of succession or on the effects of planting invasive species as part of the mine reclamation process on subsequent invasive species prevalence [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous studies have not compared the occurrence and spread of invasive species in historically mined areas to those that were historically forest or compared the effects of mining to the effects of other land uses.</p><p>Roads may also aid the spread of invasive species, even in areas that have historically been forested [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Roads provide suitable habitats for invasive species as well as corridors for the dispersal of invasive species [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, only a few studies have combined models of invasive species presence and distance to roads with land-use history to examine whether roads continue to be important predictors of invasive spread when land use is included in the model and <italic>vice versa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is important to include both land use and distance to roads in models because the land use history and roads could potentially have interacting effects. For instance, a road close to a disturbed site could increase propagule pressure in that site [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The handful of studies that have made this comparison have found inconsistent results [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], potentially due to species-specific differences in the effects of roads on the occurrence and spread of invasive species [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this exploratory study, we examined patterns of occurrence and abundance of two invasive plant species in a deciduous forest ecosystem in eastern North America as a function of roughly 70 years of land-use history and of distance to roads to ask the following questions: (1) How do patterns of land-use change including surface mining for coal, logging, agriculture, and development affect the occurrence and abundance of invasive species? (2) How does the distance to a road affect the occurrence and abundance of invasive species? (3) Is land-use change still a significant predictor of invasive occurrence and abundance once distance to road is accounted for and <italic>vice versa</italic>?</p><p>Multiflora rose (<italic>Rosa multiflora</italic>) and Japanese barberry (<italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic>) were the only invasive species in our study site that were present in large enough numbers to examine their distribution patterns individually. We predicted that historical land use change would have greater effects on occurrence of invasive species than abundance for both species in accordance with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We also expected that mining would have equal, or greater effects, than agriculture on the occurrence and abundance of these species, given that the effects of mining on the environment tend to be more long-lasting and severe than the effects of agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lastly, we expected to observe species-specific differences in the effect of roads on invasive species occurrence and abundance, potentially with distance to road having greater effects on <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic> than on <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic>, as was seen in previous research, although that study did not include the effects of land-use change in their model [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study Site</title><p>To examine the impacts of land-use history on invasive species, we analyzed an extensive vegetation survey from Powdermill Nature Reserve (PNR; 40&#x000b0;09&#x02019;S, 79&#x000b0;16&#x02019;W), currently private property maintained as a research field station by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA. PNR covers nearly 900 hectares of temperate deciduous forest in southwestern Pennsylvania (U.S.A), where the predominant tree taxa are maple (<italic>Acer</italic>), oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>), hickory (<italic>Carya</italic>), and tulip poplar (<italic>Liriodendron</italic>, [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for more information on native species in PNR).</p><p>Although PNR is currently predominantly forested, the region has experienced a variety of anthropogenic disturbances. As with most forests in the eastern U.S., much of the reserve was logged in the 1800s. The majority of the reserve returned to forest afterward although a small fraction of the reserve experienced more recent clear cutting in the 1960s and became forested later. Following logging, parts of the property were used for agriculture until the early to mid-1900s. In addition, surface mining for coal occurred during the 1940s. Little development (e.g., building) has taken place since PNR was designated as a nature reserve and became a part of Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1956. At present, most of the PNR remains forested and undisturbed with its east boundary connected to the 200-ha Laurel Mountain State Park. However, a high level of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., residential areas and highways) has occurred to the west side of the reserve, which could have accelerated the introduction and establishment of invasive species. No special permission was required to measure woody plants on private property and no protected species were involved in the survey. This study was approved by the Director of Powdermill Nature Reserve and by the Director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Data Collection</title><p>During the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, a continuous 120m x 120m grid was mapped across PNR (for a total of 647 'blocks'). Within each block, nine circular vegetation plots (10m in radius, ~314 m<sup>2</sup> in area, total area = 2827 m<sup>2</sup>) were established in a square around the center of each block. Within each vegetation plot, all trees, shrubs, and herbs were surveyed. Shrub and herb abundance was assessed as percent cover (&#x0201c;cover class&#x0201d; hereafter) and assigned a numeric value between 0 and 6 (0, trace = 1, 1&#x02013;10% = 2, 11&#x02013;25% = 3, 26&#x02013;50% = 4, 51&#x02013;75% = 5, and &#x0003e;75% = 6). Based on cover class assignments, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic> cover in each plot was binned into a &#x0201c;low cover&#x0201d; category (trace-10% cover, hereafter &#x0201c;low abundance&#x0201d;) and a &#x0201c;high cover&#x0201d; category (&#x0003e;10% cover, hereafter &#x0201c;high abundance).</p><p>To document the various anthropogenic disturbances that have occurred at PNR, we used historical aerial images to assign land-use history categories to each vegetation plot. Aerial images were available from 1939, 1957, 1967, 1993, and 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We classified types of land-use history using the standard national land cover database classification system [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which includes forest land, shrub land, planted/cultivated, and barren (including surface mining). Historical mining activities inside the property were matched with the aerial imaging. We ultimately classified each plot into one of the following six categories based on previous anthropogenic disturbances and current conditions (as suggested by Mosher et al. 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]): always forested (since at least 1939), agriculture to forest, mined to forest (all mining was surface mining for coal), logged to forest, developed to forest, and always developed (<xref rid="pone.0128161.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>).

<italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> Thunb. is a thorny shrub, originally introduced to the U.S.A. as rootstock in 1866 from Eastern Asia [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and it was later planted for erosion control and as fences and highway strips.

Besides seed dispersal by birds, vegetative spread is also common. <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> is tolerant to various soils, moisture and light conditions, and can be found in open woodlands, forest edges and areas that have experienced disturbance. <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> was introduced to Pennsylvania as rootstock during the 1930s through the 1960s [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> DC. is a dense spiny shrub that was introduced from Japan as an ornamental plant in 1875 [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but it did not become feral in the Northeast U.S.A. until the 1910s [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals, although expansion through vegetative growth is also common. <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> can tolerate both shade and drought; therefore, it could adapt to various environmental conditions, including wooded habitats, wetland and disturbed areas [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>We evaluated the effects of land-use history (a six-level categorical variable) and distance to road (continuous, meters) on the occurrence and abundance of the two most abundant invasive plant species at PNR, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic>, using generalized linear mixed effects models from the lme4 package [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in the statistical software R [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>First, to predict the occurrence of invasive plants, we ran a separate logistic regression for each species (one for <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic>, one for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic>) to model occurrence (presence/absence) as a function of land-use and distance to roads.

In this case, we divided invasive plant abundance into two classes, low and high, based on percent cover assigned in the field, as stated above. Low abundance sites had trace-10% cover of the invasive plant; high abundance sites had &#x0003e;10% cover. All models of invasive species occurrence and abundance used a binomial error structure and a logit link function. Finally, to predict the number of invasive plant species, we ran a generalized linear model with a Poisson error structure, to model the number of invasive plant species as a function of land-use history and distance to roads. All models used a Type III sum of square errors.</p><p>For all models, we assigned the least disturbed &#x0201c;always forested&#x0201d; land-use category as the reference group against which all other land-use categories were compared. Distance to road (meters) was log transformed prior to analyses to normalize the data.</p><p>To account for potential spatial autocorrelation (or similarity between plots due to their proximity to each other) in invasive plant occurrence and abundance because of the vegetation sampling methods (blocks of nine 10m radius plots centered in each cell of a 120x120 m grid (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>/Data Collection), all models included block as a random effect.

Plots that are closer than 50 meters to each other are within the same 120x120m block, so it is reasonable that addition of block as a random effect would not account for all spatial autocorrelation at smaller scales (Moran&#x02019;s I, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Figures A&#x02013;B in <xref rid="pone.0128161.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).

Thus, our study is unique in contributing to our limited understanding of both the temporal sequence of land-use change and the effects of present and historic development.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Roads</title><p>We found that <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> was more likely to occur in plots closer to a road, even when land-use history was accounted for in the model. However, there was no difference in the probability of high abundance of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> with differing proximity to roads and the occurrence and abundance of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic> were not affected by distance to roads. Roads are important in the spread of invasive species as they provide corridors for their spread. Roads also provide suitable habitat for invasive species as the disturbance created by roads often leads to fewer competitors and increased nutrient, moisture, and light availability [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, roads are hypothesized to increase propagule pressure of invasive species thereby increasing the success of invasion into surrounding forest [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The effects of roads on the occurrence and abundance of invasive species tend to vary among studies depending on which species are examined and which other variables are included in the model. For instance, Flory and Clay [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] examined the impacts of proximity to roads on abundance of seven invasive species. Four of the seven species studied, including <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic>, increased in abundance closer to roads, whereas the abundance of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> and two others was not significantly related to distance to roads. However, that study did not include land-use in its models. Models such as ours that include both land-use history and proximity to roads as drivers of invasive species occurrence and abundance are essential. Simultaneously testing the effects of land-use and road proximity allows the effects of each to be assessed independently as our models include variation accounted for by all other terms when assessing the significance of each variable in the model. Thus, factors like external propagule pressures associated with proximity to roads do not confound our estimates of invasive species occurrence and abundance in plots with differing land-use histories. Of the three studies that have included land-use history in their models, one found no effect of proximity to roads on invasive species occurrence or abundance [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], whereas the other two found that proximity to roads affected abundance, but not occurrence of invasive species, opposite to our findings [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, all three of these analyses pooled results from multiple invasive species, with one study using data from 95 species, so effects on individual species may have been masked in these analyses. Given that our findings and those of Flory and Clay [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] both showed species-specific effects of proximity to roads, we suggest that individual analyses of invasive species are most appropriate for assessment of disturbance and land-use impacts on occurrence and abundance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the importance of historic land-use for informing predictions of invasion. A history of mining, agriculture, logging, development, and proximity to roads all increased the probability that at least one of the invasive species that we studied would occur in a particular plot. In contrast, fewer land uses were associated with increased probability of high abundance in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>multiflora</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thunbergii</italic> or with higher total number of invasive plant species, though the most disturbing land uses of mining and agriculture were associated with these variables. We are not the first study to note that invasive species abundance may be driven by different environmental and anthropogenic factors than occurrence of these species [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, since the abundance, rather than occurrence, of invasive species is related to decreases in community diversity [<xref rid="pone.0128161.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], our research suggests it may be important to focus our invasive species eradication efforts in areas with previous agriculture or mining.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128161.s001"><label>S1 Figs</label><caption><title>Analysis of Spatial Autocorrelation.</title><p>
