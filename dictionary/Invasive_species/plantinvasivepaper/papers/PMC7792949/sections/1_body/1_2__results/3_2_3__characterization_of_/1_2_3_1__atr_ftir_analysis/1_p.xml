<p>The ATR-FTIR spectra of the studied materials, CM and multi-functionalized cellulose microfibers (MFCM), are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00033-f001">Figure 1</xref>. According to Danial (2015) [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the lack of the C=O band in both spectra that should have been observed at the wave number ≈1733 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> highlights the successful removal of hemicelluloses. The complete removal of lignin was given by the lack of bands at ≈1509 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and ≈1592 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, bands attributed to the aromatic C=C vibrations in the plane as well as the lack of the band located at 1264 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which would have been assigned C–O–C specific to ether bonds from lignin. The C–C band breathing rings (≈1158 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and the C–O–C glycosidic ether band (≈1100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) were attributed to the presence of cellulose. The band at ≈2900 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, observed in all samples, corresponded to the C–H stretching vibration that reflects the organic content in general [
