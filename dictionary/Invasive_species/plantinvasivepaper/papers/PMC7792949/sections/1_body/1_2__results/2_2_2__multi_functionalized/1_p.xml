 <italic>G. triachantos</italic> pods were ground into powder (to pass through a 100 mesh sieve) with a structure characterized by ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance—Fourier Transform Infrared) to highlight the specific bands of the three major components (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3dot1-ijms-22-00033">Section 2.3.1</xref>), which are hemi-cellulose (39.07% ± 1.49%), cellulose (29.78% ± 1.28%), and lignin (27.71% ± 0.75%) [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Then, the wood powder was subjected to purification by successive extractions to remove the extractable substances, hemicellulose (toluene and ethanol), and lignin. The lignocellulosic material required six cycles of delignification. The sample was taken from each cycle to quantify the total lignin content by a similar protocol to that used to determine the hydroxycinnamic acid content. The delignification process was continued for two more cycles after the lignin content was below the detection limit. After the last delignification cycle, the aqueous suspension of the obtained cellulose fibers was washed until no chloride ions were found, quantified by the Mohr titrimetric method. After extraction, the freeze-dried cellulosic material was characterized to highlight the lack of lignin content and compared to CM functionalized with phenolic compounds extracted from the leaves of the same species.
