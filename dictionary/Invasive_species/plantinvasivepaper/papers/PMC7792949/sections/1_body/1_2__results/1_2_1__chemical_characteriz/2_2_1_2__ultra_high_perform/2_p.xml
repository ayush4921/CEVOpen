<p>The main phenolic compounds identified in the alcoholic extract of G. triachantos were vanillic acid (773.88 µg/L), 4-hydroxy benzoic acid (570.37 µg/L), ferulic acid (319.81 µg/L), catechin (34,271.15 µg/L), quercetin (3,007.89 µg/L), and epicatechin (1,431.47 µg/L). The extract was rich in chlorogenic acid (11,984.43 µg/L), cinnamic acid (2,736.42 µg/L, an acid that lacks phenolic groups but is still usually included in the phenolic compounds class), and rutin (1,302.31 µg/L). The following compounds were also evidenced by UHPLC–DAD-ESI/MS: abscisic acid (16.10 µg/L), a sesquiterpenoid plant hormone, and ellagic acid (165.13 µg/L), a dimer of gallic acid. </p>
