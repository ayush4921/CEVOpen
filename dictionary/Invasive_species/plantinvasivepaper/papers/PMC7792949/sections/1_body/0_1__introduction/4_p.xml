<p>Thus, the therapeutic valorization of these species could be both an ecological solution to stop their uncontrolled spreading and an economic solution, providing low costs raw materials. The purpose of the study was to obtain cellulose microfibers (CM) from the reproductive organs of 
 <italic>Gleditsia triachantos</italic> and functionalize them with active principles (phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>G. triachantos</italic> leaves) with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity in order to obtain functional wound dressings with improved performance in preventing wound infections, therefore, accelerating the wound healing process.
