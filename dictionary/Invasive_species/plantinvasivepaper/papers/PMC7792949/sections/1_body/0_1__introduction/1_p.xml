<p>Micro- and nanomaterials derived from biological macromolecules are used in a wide range of industrial, technological, and biomedical applications, e.g., for adsorption, ultrafiltration, packaging, preservation of historical artefacts, thermal insulators, and fire retardants, energy extraction and storage, acoustics, sensory, controlled delivery of drugs, and especially tissue engineering. Due to their mechanical robustness, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and good biodegradability, micro- and nanocellulose have specific functions, such as tissue repair, regeneration, and healing, and they are also antimicrobial nanomaterials with shape memory and intelligent membranes [
