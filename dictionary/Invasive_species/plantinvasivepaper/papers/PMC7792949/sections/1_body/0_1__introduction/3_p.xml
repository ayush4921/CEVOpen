 <italic>Gleditsia triacanthos</italic> L. (
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>) is a native tree to North America, with an extraordinary tolerance to high temperatures and drought, conditions that paradoxically favor its spread. This species is also very tolerant of industrial and transport emissions with relatively high resistance to soils with extreme pH. The combined clonal and sexual reproduction, the short juvenile period, the high seed production and the high germination rate of the seeds are considered defining traits for the degree of invasiveness of these species [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Initially introduced as an ornamental and aromatic species, it spread rapidly, invading different ecoregions, being presently considered one of the most aggressive legume invaders in the world [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This species invasiveness poses serious risks for ecosystems biodiversity, structure, and functions, as well as conservation of the protected areas, and requires high costs for its eradication [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The selective harvesting of reproductive organs of such invasive species for practical use could stop their uncontrolled spread. Taking into account that plant extracts offer unlimited therapeutic options, one of the sectors that could benefit from the potential use of invasive plants is the biomedical field.
