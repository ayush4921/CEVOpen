<p>The FTIR spectra for CM, MFCM, and lignin was recorded at room temperature using the Cary 630 FTIR Spectrometer in ATR mode (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Agilent MicroLab Software FTIR System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA). The chosen measurement range was 4000–650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, number of scans was 400, and resolution was 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The FTIR spectra of dry extract were produced on the alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>G. tricanthos</italic> leaves dried previously in an oven at 35 °C (for 24 h).
