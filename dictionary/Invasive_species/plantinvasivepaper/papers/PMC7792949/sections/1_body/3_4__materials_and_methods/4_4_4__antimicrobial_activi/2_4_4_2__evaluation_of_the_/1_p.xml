<p>The bacterial strains were 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 11229; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538; 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853; 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> DMS 13590; and multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> from microbial collection of Microbiology Lab from Faculty of Biology, University of Bucharest. Two yeast strains were also tested: 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 and 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019 [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The CM and MFCM samples (10 mg) were placed in contact with a microbial suspension (10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/mL—final density) and were subjected to vigorous shaking in order to assure the best contact between microbial cells and the samples. At 0 h and 24 h contact times, the viable cell counts (CFU/mL) of the microbial suspension were determined by spotting serial 10-fold dilutions on Muller–Hinton agar for bacteria and Sabauroud for yeasts. The microbial lg reduction of microbial growth in the presence of the CM and MFCM samples was calculated as follows: recovery rate = lg (CFU sample)/lg (CFU control strain).
