<p>Flavonoid content was assessed through the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> method [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, 0.1 mL sample/standard solution was mixed with 0.1 mL sodium acetate 10% and 0.12 mL AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> 2.5%, with the final volume being adjusted to 1 mL with ethanol 50%. The samples were then vortexed and incubated in the dark for 45 min. The absorbances were measured at Î» = 430 nm. A standard curve was prepared by using different concentrations of quercetin (
