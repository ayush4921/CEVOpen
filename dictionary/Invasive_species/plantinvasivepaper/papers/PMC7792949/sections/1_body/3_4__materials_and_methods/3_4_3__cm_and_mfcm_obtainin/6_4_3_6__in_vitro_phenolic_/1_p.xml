<p>The MFCM were immersed in PBS at 37 °C for 5 days to determine the various compounds’ kinetics release from these dressings. The release studies were conducted in closed glass vessels containing 1 mL PBS. The medium was removed (completely) periodically, at each sampling time (2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 120 h), and fresh medium was introduced. Quantification of the active principle release at different time intervals was determined. The TPC content was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method. For each sampling time, the antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH and TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) methods using a FlexStation 3 UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p>
