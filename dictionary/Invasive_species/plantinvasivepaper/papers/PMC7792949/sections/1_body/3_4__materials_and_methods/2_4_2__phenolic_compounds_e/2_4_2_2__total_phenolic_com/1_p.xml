<p>TPC content was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. An aliquot was mixed with 0.1 mL Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, 1.8 mL distilled water, and 0.1 mL of saturated sodium carbonate. The tubes were vortexed for 15 s and allowed to stand at dark for 60 min for color development. Absorbance was then measured at 765 nm using a FlexStation 3 UV–VIS (Molecular Devices Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) spectrophotometer. A standard curve was prepared by using different concentrations of gallic acid in the same condition with samples (
