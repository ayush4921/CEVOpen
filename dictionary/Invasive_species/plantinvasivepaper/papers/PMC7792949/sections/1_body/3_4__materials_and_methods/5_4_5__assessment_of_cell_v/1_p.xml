<p>MTT assay is a spectrophotometric method to analyze both cell viability and proliferation of L929 murine fibroblasts, which were co-cultivated with the CM and MFCM (at various concentrations: 100, 200, and 500 µg/µL) for 24 h and further incubated with 1 mg/mL MTT solution in the dark at 37 °C. After 4 h of incubation, formazan crystals were solubilized with isopropanol, resulting in a purple solution, and quantified at 550 nm using FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p>
