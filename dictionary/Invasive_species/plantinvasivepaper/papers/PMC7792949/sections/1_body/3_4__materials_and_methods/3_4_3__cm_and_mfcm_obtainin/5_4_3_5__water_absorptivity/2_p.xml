<p>Water retention properties were determined using water retention tests. Samples (CM and MFCM) with the same mass were dried and weighed. Samples were then immersed in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h, and the water on the surface was removed using filter paper. Samples were finally placed in plates at 37 °C and weighed after a specific incubation time [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The water retention capacity was calculated using the following equation: 
 <disp-formula>Water retention ratio (%) = Mi × 100/M
  <sub>0</sub>
 </disp-formula> where M
 <sub>i</sub> and M
 <sub>0</sub> represent the percent of swelling at specific and initial time (maximum PBS swelling), respectively.
