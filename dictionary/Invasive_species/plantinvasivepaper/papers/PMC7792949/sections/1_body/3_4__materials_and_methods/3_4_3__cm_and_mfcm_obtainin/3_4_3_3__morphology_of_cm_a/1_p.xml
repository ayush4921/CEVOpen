<p>The morphology of CM and MFCM were performed by Nova NanoSEM 630 Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) using UHR detector (Through-Lens-Detector-TLD) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a working distance of about 5 mm. The samples were fixed with a double tape on a conductive support of aluminum, which, afterward, was covered with a few nanometers of gold layer using sputtering for 30 s.</p>
