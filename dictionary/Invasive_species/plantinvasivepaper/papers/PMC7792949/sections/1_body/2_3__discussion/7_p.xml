<p>Another important aspect for MFCM is the modulation of antioxidant activity during the release of active principles from the material. Thus, in wound healing, in addition to the antimicrobial potential of dressings, an important aspect is the modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. It is well known that low levels of ROS can exhibit positive effects, including an antimicrobial effect, but their excessive production can lead to oxidative stress, which will further inhibit the wound healing process, thus favoring wound chronicity [
