<p>To the best of our knowledge, the microcellulose obtained from 
 <italic>G. triacanthos</italic> pods is herein reported for the first time, although some studies have been carried out on the characterization of other polysaccharides such as galactomannan [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which is a heterogenous, water-soluble, non-toxic, and biodegradable polysaccharide used as a stabilizing, thickening, and emulsifying agent in the biomedical industry. The cellulose was extracted by treatment of grounded pods with toluene/ethanol (2:1) solution and six cycles of delignification method adapted after Zhuo (2017) [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The cellulose obtained was divided quantitatively into two parts—one was treated with 50% ethanol (control) in accordance with the second part, which contained the extract from the leaves of the same species. After lyophilization, the two materials were evaluated by ATR-FTIR analysis and compared to the commercial lignin. SEM analysis revealed that the control sample (CM) used for multi-functionalization with phenolic compounds showed the presence of microfibers and that the extract adhered to the cellulose microfibers surface, without requiring the presence of a fixing or crosslinking agent. The data were in accordance with Khalil (2020) [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which concluded that by acid hydrolysis, the fiber size was in the range of 9–16 μm. In the wound dressing case, it was shown that cellulose microfibers improved the hemostasis of the scaffolds without affecting its cytotoxicity and the strength and flexibility of the films, which could be used in drug delivery or active wound dressing.
