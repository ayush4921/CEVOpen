<p>There was mixed support for EICAs prediction that introduced-range plants would have higher competitive ability than their home-range relatives within each species. Grown in a common, low- or no-competition environment, introduced-range plants had significantly higher measures of nonreproductive performance and vigor than did home-range plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>), with 48% of the variation in effect size explained by species (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0154). The fail-safe number for this result suggests that this effect is robust against publication biases. However, there was no corresponding difference by range in plant fitness (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Plant species did not significantly explain variation in fitness (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.811), although it did explain variation in competitive ability (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). The low number of studies (five studies containing 18 results) that published the results of experiments that evaluated the response of invasive populations to competition means that this result should be interpreted with caution.
