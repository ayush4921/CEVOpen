<p>We found no general support across invasive plant species for reduced defenses in the introduced range of invaders. There were no overall differences between home and introduced ranges within each species in defense characteristics measured as leaf chemical and physical traits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), their effect on herbivore performance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>), or relative herbivore damage to plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). However, heterogeneity indices indicated that variance in each model could be explained by factors other than geographic range. Chemical and physical leaf defenses varied significantly by plant species, which explained 66% of the variation in effect sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>; Q = 23.6765, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), indicating that there are a few species which support the defense predictions of EICA. We also considered whether expression of defenses would explain variation in leaf chemistry effect sizes, but found no difference in overall effect size between constitutive and induced defenses (Q=4.2512, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.236).
