<p>In order to test the EICA hypothesis that there are genetically based differences between defense and growth traits of introduced- versus home-range populations of invasive plants, we collected published studies from peer-reviewed journals. For the purposes of this review, we are interested in modern invasions, not in range expansions or in historical introduction events. “Invasion” refers to the presence of a plant species novel to an area that was transported and introduced accidentally or intentionally by humans. We define “home” range as the continent where a species has been present since at least the time of European colonial expansion (c. 1500), and “introduced” range as a continent or group of continents where a species was not present preceding European colonialism.</p>
