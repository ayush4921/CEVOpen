<p>Selective factors including climate, resource availability, and biotic interactions may act in concert or in opposition upon ecologically important traits in invasive plant populations. In addition to quantitating the rate and strength of stochastic forces relative to selection, identifying the relative importance of environmental versus biotic selective agents should be a central topic of further research in evolution of invasive plants. Plant populations distributed across a wide geographic range may become locally adapted to climate factors correlated with latitude, both in native species (Macel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2007</xref>; Kawakami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2011</xref>) and in invasive species (Maron et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2004a</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">b</xref>). Including latitude as a covariate in models of plant performance has shown that for some invasive species, evolution of increased growth in invasive populations, which appeared to support EICA, was more closely correlated with latitude (Colautti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2009</xref>). A recent study of the invasive flora of New South Wales used historical herbarium specimens to document that 70% of the 23 annual species accidentally introduced to the region have undergone significant changes in plant height, leaf shape, or specific leaf area over the last 150 years (Buswell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2011</xref>). Interestingly, most of the plants that experienced a change in plant height since introduction were shorter than their introduced ancestors, which the authors attribute to selection by the arid climate in which reduced height means reduced water loss. Abiotic factors can act as strong selective forces, even in a relatively short-time period.
