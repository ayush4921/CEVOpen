<p>The meta-analysis shows that plant vegetative production, but not fitness or competitive ability, is higher in the introduced range across invasive plant species as predicted by EICA. Many of the metrics of plant success reported in these studies as being greater in introduced-range than home-range populations have been shown to be greater in invasive species than in related native species (Grotkopp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2002</xref>; McDowell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">2002</xref>), or greater in invasive species than in native species from the invaded community (Pattison et al.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">1998</xref>; Smith and Knapp 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">2001</xref>). However, the relevance to plant invasions of higher growth of introduced plants in a common environment may be limited by the fact that experimental conditions rarely mimic natural plant communities. Plants grown under greenhouse conditions were typically grown alone in pots and experienced no competition, while the degree and form of competition in common gardens depended on garden design as well as resource availability (see Wilson and Tilman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">1993</xref>) which was rarely reported or manipulated. For the purpose of this study, we assumed that growth under common conditions where competition was not manipulated was growth under noncompetitive conditions. There was no associated change in competitive ability across invasive species, which could be due to low sample size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), but is consistent with a study of 14 introduced species which found differences by ranges in plant biomass under noncompetitive, but not under low or highly competitive, conditions (Blumenthal and Hufbauer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2007</xref>). Overall, we found that introduced-range plants were more robust in terms of performance than home-range plants across invasive plant species as EICA predicts. However, our meta-analysis showed no general increase in fitness or competitive ability across the invasive plant species considered.
