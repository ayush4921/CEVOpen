 <caption>
  <p>Plant competitive ability in introduced versus home ranges of invasive plant species. The summary effect which includes all contrasts is at the top of the graph. Effects categorized by species are indicated by genus names. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of contrasts between home and introduced ranges of invasive plant species for each class of trait. Error bars indicate bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals, and error bars that overlap the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis indicate an effect which is not statistically significant (i.e., there is no significant difference between home and introduced ranges for this effect).
