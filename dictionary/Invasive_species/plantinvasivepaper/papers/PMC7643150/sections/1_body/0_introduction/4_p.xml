 </sup>. STSMs divide a landscape into discrete spatial units (cells) each assigned a discrete state; simulations track changes in cell state over discrete time steps based on discrete transitions between states that can be probabilistic or time-based and can be unique for each transition type (e.g., succession, wildfire, timber harvest, herbicide spraying). STSMs, and other complex models representing ecosystem processes, require multiple parameters that may be stochastic and uncertain. Uncertainties in ecological forecasts using STSMs can include ecological process variables and environmental stochasticity (e.g.

 </sup>). One utility of STSMs for invasive species is identifying research priorities to explore uncertainties that have a strong influence on modeled outcomes, along with helping to identify ‘how big is the problem?’ and appropriateness of various management strategies
