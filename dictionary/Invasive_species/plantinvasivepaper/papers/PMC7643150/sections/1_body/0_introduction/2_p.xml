<p id="Par3">Invasive species, like native species, can be influenced by many interacting abiotic and biotic factors. These factors, including climate, can influence rates of spread across a landscape and patch infilling in established locations, adding variability to invasion dynamics (e.g.,

 </sup>). A patch can be defined as the perimeter of an infested area, and infilling is the increase in cover within that defined patch. Spread occurs when patch perimeters expand or when new satellite patches establish. Spread and infill, particularly in the arid southwestern United States, may be tied to fluctuating resources such as interannual variation in precipitation
