<p id="Par32">We refined previous research results aimed at forecasting the scope of the buffelgrass problem in Saguaro National Park by evaluating sensitivity to uncertainties in the model. Our sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty in model initialization (habitat suitability) had less influence on results than uncertain ecological parameters (infill rates and wet-year probability, timing, and effect). Examining the contribution of components of ecological uncertainty, we found that uncertainty in infill rates had the greatest influence on future landscape conditions, including the amount of buffelgrass on the landscape and the size and frequency of fires; the variation arising from different infill rate values was greater than the variation arising from stochasticity. These results highlight the potential need to better understand the temporal dynamics associated with increases in buffelgrass abundance over knowing the probability of wet years or the effects of wet-year infill acceleration factor.</p>
