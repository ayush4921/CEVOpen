 </sup>. The model divides the landscape into three strata in a 0.25-ha resolution grid, including the desert ecosystem, classified into regions that are susceptible or unsusceptible to buffelgrass establishment (based on buffelgrass habitat suitability

 </sup>), and the grassland ecotone between the desert ecosystem and high-elevation forest that exists in RMD (forested areas of SAGU are not included in the study area; Supplementary Figure S1 online). Susceptible locations were defined as locations predicted as suitable for buffelgrass by a habitat suitability model developed for SAGU using their buffelgrass location data and environmental characteristics including winter temperature, slope, northness and eastness

 </sup>. The desert ecosystem not classified as susceptible was assigned to unsusceptible. The STSM also assigns each grid cell of the landscape to state classes related to buffelgrass cover including uninvaded, seedbank (cells with buffelgrass seeds but no established buffelgrass), buffelgrass cover classes of &lt; 1%, 1–10%, &gt; 10–50%, and &gt; 50%, and a converted state consisting of a buffelgrass savanna as a result of burning. Operationally, each grid cell can be thought of as a patch, and infilling is the increasing cover of buffelgrass within that cell. Landscape state classes also correspond to vegetation fuel load to facilitate use of a fire behavior model. Greater than 10% buffelgrass cover is required to carry fire and fire in a &gt; 50% cover class results in a converted state
