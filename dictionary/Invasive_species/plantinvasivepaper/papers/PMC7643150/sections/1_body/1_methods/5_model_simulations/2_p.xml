<p id="Par19">We ran simulations both with and without fire. We ran each simulation for 30-time steps (from 2014–2044), including 20 Monte Carlo realizations to capture stochasticity in the ecological processes. We considered uncertainties associated with model initialization (initialization scenarios) and uncertainties associated with model parameterization (ecological scenarios). Initialization scenarios included each combination of habitat suitability and initial conditions (nine initialization scenarios). Ecological scenarios included combinations of all three factors affecting cover-class transition rates (infill rate, wet-year probability, and wet-year infill acceleration factor; for a total of 27 ecological scenarios). We were interested in the interaction of these uncertainties with fire on the landscape; however, including FARSITE at each timestep to simulate fire is much more computationally intensive than simulation runs without fire. For this reason, we ran all 27 ecological scenarios without fire, and only ran a subset of ecological scenarios with fire. For fire simulations we ran three combinations of ecological parameter levels: the lower bounds (low infill rate, low wet-year probability, slow infill acceleration factor—referred to as dry-slow patch infill), the middle bounds (moderate infill rate, moderate wet-year probability, moderate wet-year infill acceleration factor—referred to as moderate patch infill), and the upper bounds (high infill rate, high wet year probability, fast wet year infill acceleration factor—referred to as wet-fast patch infill).</p>
