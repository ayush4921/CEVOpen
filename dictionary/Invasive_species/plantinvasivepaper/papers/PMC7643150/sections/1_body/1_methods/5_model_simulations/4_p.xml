<p id="Par21">We analyzed invaded area through time, calculated by multiplying the area occupied by each cover class by the midpoint percent cover for that class (i.e., multiplied area in &lt; 1% cover by 0.005, 1–10% by 0.055, &gt; 10–50% by 0.3, &gt; 50% by 0.75, and converted by 1.0), and compared invaded area at the end of simulations across scenarios. We also compared the amount of the landscape in each state class at the start and end of the simulations (i.e., after 30 years) to show the amount of the landscape in seedbank, &lt; 1% cover, 1–10% cover, &gt; 10–50% cover, &gt; 50% cover, and converted. We used analysis of variance to calculate the variance in invaded area that could be attributed to the different uncertainties in model initialization and parameterization. We then used hierarchical partitioning
