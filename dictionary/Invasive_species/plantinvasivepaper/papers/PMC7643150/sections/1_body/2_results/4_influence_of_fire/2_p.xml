<p id="Par30">There was large interannual variability in the amount of burned area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and many years did not have a fire (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Generally, around half the years in the simulation had a fire, with a range of 7 to 22 years in the 30-year horizon having fires (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Years without fires resulted from both a lack of ignition and from “ignitions” occurring in unburnable locations. However, all scenarios had locations that burned multiple times, as seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, where the cumulative area burned (sum across 30 years of annual burned area) was greater than landscape area burned (amount of the entire study area that burned in at least 1 year of the 30-year simulation). The size of fires (represented by the annual area burned) increased with increasing invaded area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Figure S3) regardless of scenario. The average number of fires burning to the edge of the forest during the 30-year simulations ranged between 0 and 10 with an average around four (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), compared to the number of fires occurring in the Rincon Mountain District containing the high elevation forests of 4 to 17 with an average of 11. Landscape burned area had a significant effect from the interaction between the two uncertainty groups (ecological uncertainty and initialization uncertainty), but initialization uncertainty by itself was not significant (Supplementary 1 Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> online). The cumulative area burned had a statistically significant main effect on patch infill rate (Supplementary 1 Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> online). Neither number of years with fires nor number of fires to forest edge had any significant predictors (Supplementary 1 Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref> online).
