<p id="Par24">Sensitivity to model initialization, including the amount of desert susceptible to buffelgrass invasion and the initial amount of buffelgrass present on the landscape, did not result in major differences among runs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Box plots displaying variation among invaded area for 20 Monte Carlo realizations of the nine simulations of various combinations of initialization all overlap for SAGU. This overlap exists even for simulations at both extremes of initialization—low initial buffelgrass and low suitability (low initialization) compared to high initial buffelgrass and high suitability (high initialization).
