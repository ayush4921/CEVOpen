<p id="Par29">Simulations with fire showed a similar pattern in the influence of uncertainty groups as simulations without fire (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The overall area of the landscape with some level of buffelgrass cover is the same for fire and no-fire runs, reflecting a model assumption that propagule dispersal for a converted patch is similar to that of a &gt; 50% patch. There was overlap in the boxplots for invaded area after 30 years for the three initialization simulations that included fire (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), indicating that initialization did not have a significant effect on model results for fire simulations. Fire simulations had constant wet-year timing; comparing fire simulations to the no-fire simulations with constant wet-year timing, fire simulations had much greater stochasticity than those without fire. However, comparing fire simulations to the no-fire simulations with variable wet-year timing, the stochasticity generated from fire appears to be less than the stochasticity generated by variability in wet-year timing. Overall, the stochasticity of the model resulted in greater variability in invaded area for simulations that included fire than simulations that excluded fire when wet-year timing was held constant (range across all scenarios of 4696 ha compared to 3690 ha; Supplementary 1 Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online), but variability in wet-year timing seemed to have a greater effect than fire. Ecological uncertainties had a greater influence than initialization uncertainties (Supplementary 1 Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> online), so we focus on ecological uncertainties to evaluate fire impacts on invaded area.
