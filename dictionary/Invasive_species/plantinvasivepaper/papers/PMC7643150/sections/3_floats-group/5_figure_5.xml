  <p>Area burned (colored lines represent different Monte Carlo realizations), the average area burned (solid black line), and the average area invaded through time (dashed black line) for 20 different Monte Carlo realizations for three different scenarios reflecting uncertain ecological conditions (low, moderate, and high infill rates, wet-year probabilities, and wet-year infill acceleration factors) in Saguaro National Park. Grey area around dashed line represents + /− 1 standard deviation.</p>
