<p id="Par7">The study was conducted at two sites in Ethiopia. One of the sites is a large-scale commercial farming enterprise, the Upper Awash Agro Industry Enterprise (UAAIE), located 205 km east of Addis Ababa, at 8° 46′ 00.9ʺ N 39° 52′ 09.7ʺ E. The minimum temperature was 12 °C and maximum temperature was 35 °C, and humidity ranged between 32 and 62% RH. At UAAIE, the study was conducted in an irrigated guava (
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>) orchard of 55 ha, and contains fruits year-round. The second site, located 481 km south of Addis Ababa, at 6° 06′ 52.2ʺ N 37° 36′ 28.8ʺ E, included small scale mango plots of the Plant Health Clinic of Arba-Minch, and nearby small-scale farms. In Arba-Minch, the study was conducted in small orchards belonging to small-holders that cultivate mango (
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic>) as the principal fruit crop. Mango fruit is harvested twice a year following the rainy seasons of March and September. Growers cultivate different varieties of mangoes (exotic and local), interspersed with other potential host of tephritids such as guava (
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>), papaya (
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic>), orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) banana (
 <italic>Musa</italic> spp
 <italic>.</italic>), and avocado (
 <italic>Persea americana</italic>). Minimum and maximum temperature records were 14 °C and 34 °C, respectively, and humidity ranged between 61 and 98% RH.
