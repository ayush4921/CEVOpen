<p id="Par20">To analyze capture efficiency and combination of lures, a generalized linear mixed-effects model (glmm) fitted with a negative binomial was used. The theta value was calculated from a zero model. For models using glmm the package lme4
 <sup>

 </sup> was used, while stats package was used for glm. Post hoc tests were done using package multcomp
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> and Tukeyâ€™s all-pairwise comparisons. All graphs were made using ggplot2
