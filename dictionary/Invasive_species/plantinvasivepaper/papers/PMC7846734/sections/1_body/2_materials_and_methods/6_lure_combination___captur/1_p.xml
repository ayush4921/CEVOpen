<p id="Par15">Attractiveness of the combined male lure (CML, which contains 20% ME + 10% TA + 10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) to 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> flies was compared with its individual components: ME (20% ME + 2% spinosad), TML (10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) and TA (10% TA + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) to test if the combinations of male attractants would result in different catch numbers compared to single lures. For this experiment, two types of traps were used. In the smallholder farming setting a modified transparent water bottle trap (1.5 L) with two fly entry openings in the upper half of the bottle (~ 7 mm diam.) was used. In the large-scale farm, we used a commercially available trap, Easytrap. Traps were baited with a 3 g dollop of either ME, TML, TA or CML. Four traps, each containing one of the dollops, were hung at 30 m distance from each other. This was replicated in four plots at Arba-Minch and four plots at UAAIE (a plot is ~ 1 ha). As the 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> population was high in Arba-Minch, we used the larger modified water bottle traps, and trap catches were counted daily. At UAAIE traps were serviced once a week. The experiment was conducted between 2015-02-14 and 2015-07-02.
