<p id="Par8">Mixtures of different male lure formulations, ME (20% ME, 2% spinosad), ME (20%), TML (10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad), TA (10% TA + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad), and a combined male lure (CML, 20% ME + 10% TA + 10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) were formulated in SPLAT MAT, (SPLAT-Specialized Pheromone and Lure Application Technology, ISCA Technologies, CA, USA) (MAT-male annihilation technique). SPLAT is a commercial slow-release matrix SPLAT and is a modified formulation from Atterholt et al.
