<p id="Par9">At the large-scale farm three main techniques were used by the management to suppress 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> population throughout the entire farm, including M3 Fruit Fly Bait Station (Green trading cc, SA), GF-120 containing spinosad (DOW AgroSciences LLC, Indianapolis, IN) and orchard sanitation. GF-120 was diluted in water as recommended in the label 1:5 ratio of GF-120:water and sprayed with a hand-pumped back-pack sprayer using a conventional conical nozzle with 1–2 mm aperture. Approximately 25 ml/tree of the solution was sprayed on a regular schedule at 15 days interval at approximately 1.5 m on trees not bearing fruit. The M3 Fruit Fly Bait Stations were hung on trees at 4 m distances. The efficacy of the treatments (GF-120 &amp; M3) were monitored using a variable number of traps (Easytrap (H14 cm X W9cm X D5cm J.p. Ros, INIA, Madrid) per ha baited with ME and malathion. We plotted the average fruit fly per trap per day (FTD) values of trap catches in the Guava orchard over 8 months (Fig.
