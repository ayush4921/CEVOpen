<p id="Par17">For the mark and release study, a correlation analysis was made using linear models to correlate the distance in log10(meter) from release point and the average trap catch of marked and resident flies. For visualization purposes a map was produced using the average trap catch average per location and the package ggmap, a wrapper for ggplot2 was used for accessing the google API and downloading the map

The map was annotated with each of the orchards and trap position and concentric circles representing the distances from release point. Temperature data was plotted using a violin plot with a dotted line representing the average, and wind direction using a radial plot where the number and strength of each wind vector was plotted.
