  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Many of these regions, however, already had indigenous or other invasive tephritid fruit fly species affecting agricultural production
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. As a result, an invasive species may create a competitive challenge in the established resident community. In the last two decades several fruit fly species of Asian origin have invaded sub-Saharan Africa threatening fruit and vegetable production
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Of these, the species with arguably the biggest impact in the region is the Oriental fruit fly, 
 <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> (Hendel), which was incidentally detected in Kenya in 2003 during routine fruit fly surveillance
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
