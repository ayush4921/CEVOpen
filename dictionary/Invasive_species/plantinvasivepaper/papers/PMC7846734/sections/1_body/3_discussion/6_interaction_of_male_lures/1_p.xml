<p id="Par38">As our field observations indicated that suppression of one pest species can lead to a resurgence of another pest species that occupies the same niche, fruit fly management should target all species in the guild to achieve an effective crop protection. Since different tephritid species are attracted to different male attractants, it would seem logical and economical to combine lures in the same dispenser. We verified possible interactions due to combining such lures (TA and TML, attractant of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>, among other species, and ME attractant of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>). The efficacy of combining male specific lures has been reported to be variable, depending on population density of the interacting species and locality

 </sup>. As no lure interaction was noted in large-scale farms, we suspect that the very high populations of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in smallholder farms suppressed trap entry and catches of 
 <italic>Ceratitis</italic>. Indeed, in Arba-Minch many 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> males were seen on the outside of the trap, which probably interfered with trap entry of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>, particularly since ME is a much stronger male attractant for 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> than TML is for 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>. We therefore cannot confirm that different male lures influence trap catches of either species when placed in the same trap, which has been reported in the literature. For instance, Vargas et al.

 </sup> reported that traps baited with the combination of 50% ME and 50% cuelure (another male lure attractive to certain tephritid species) were equally attractive to 
 <italic>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</italic> as traps baited with cuelure alone, while other reports showed negative or synergistic interactions between these
