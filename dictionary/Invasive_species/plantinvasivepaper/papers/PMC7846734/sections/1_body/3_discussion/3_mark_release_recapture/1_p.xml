 </sup>. This is particularly true for mating disruption-based methods, in which the damaging sex (the female) is only indirectly affected by removing the non-damaging sex (male)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. In such cases, the efficacy is dependent on the extent of males or mated females moving from neighboring untreated areas into the treated area. Mark-release-recapture studies are good tools to assess this factor. For tephritid fruit flies mark-release-recapture studies have been performed in the past, and these show that flies can disperse over long distances, from 11 km up to 19 km for

 </sup>. However, these were done in monoculture settings with moderate winds, compared to ‘calm’ weather conditions (very low wind) and complex culture systems that characterize smallholder-farming in East Africa. Furthermore, the immigration factor is critical in establishing the scale of intervention needed to ensure effective population control, which quickly exceeds the small farm size of smallholder farmers (typically less than 1 ha). Under the conditions tested here, including the high populations levels of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, the low winds and indicated temperatures, 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> readily disperses hundreds of meters in smallholder farming settings, even though fruit and food were abundantly present at and close to the release point. Considering the fact that recapture rates naturally drop with distance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, fewer sampling points per surface area with increased distance from the release points), the relative recapture rate being as high as 60% (of the total recaptured flies) over 300 m and around 8% at over 1000 m are likely a gross underestimate of the actual fraction of flies engaging in long-range dispersion. In addition, the figures may further underestimate natural dispersion, because the capturing and marking may have affected the flies’ fitness to disperse (although low, 11% remained in the release bucket, possibly due to capturing and crowding in the bucket before release) and possibly the reduced likelihood to be recaptured using the same trap and lure (possible negative associative learning). A significant portion of male 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> thus disperses across the boundaries of a few to many smallholder plots (See Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, light-shaded areas indicating farm boundaries). This is further underlined by the fact that recapture rates of green marked flies, which were released 3 d prior to placement of the traps, were lower than those released at the same time of trap placement, particularly for traps within a 500 m distance from the release point, which may partly indicate that flies rapidly disperse outside the release area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, in smallholders farming areas in East Africa, fly management using male annihilation, and likely any other technique, require concerted efforts by the farmers and area-wide management strategies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. It also implies that techniques other than male annihilation, and more focused on reducing the female population, may be more appropriate for such small farm sizes. Further research should evaluate the relative dispersive capabilities of female flies, relative to males. This has not been studied in any previous study, while the impact of dispersing females is much more significant from a population dynamics and pest control perspective.
