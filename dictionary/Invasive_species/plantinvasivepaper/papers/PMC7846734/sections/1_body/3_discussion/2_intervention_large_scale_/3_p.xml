<p id="Par33">Intervention trials in smallholder farms in Arba Minch did not result in suppression of the target pest 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. We infer from our mark-release-recapture data that a main contributing factor to this failure was the high likelihood of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> to disperse the distance of many smallholder plots, and the availability of several hosts in smallholder settings (see below). It is also important to note that in the smallholder farming area no other concerted management efforts were rolled out against fruit flies.
