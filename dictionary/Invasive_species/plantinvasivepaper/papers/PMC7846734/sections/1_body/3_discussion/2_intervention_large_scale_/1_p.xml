<p id="Par31">Since the invasion of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> at UAAIE at around 2010, the species rapidly replaced 
 <italic>Ceratitis</italic> species as main pest. At the large-scale farm, UAAIE, a combination of management methods successfully reduced the invasive pest 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> within 8Â months of intensive control measures. Their efforts anticipated our trial using SPLAT-ME, which could therefore not be carried out. Nevertheless, the data collected during the intervention by UAAIE management demonstrates that it is possible to suppress this highly invasive pest. Yet, although the suppression reduced 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, it caused a resurgence of native 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> within a few months, a species that was rarely caught post invasion of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. This indicates that removal of one species (
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>) can cause competitive release of the replaced species (
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>), a phenomenon well described in other production systems

 </sup>. Clearly, in the presence of a fruit-fly guild, combinations of methods need to be deployed, particularly when the methods target the dominant species almost exclusively (
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>).
