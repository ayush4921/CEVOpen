<p id="Par37">Species with a similar ecological niche can coexist through resource partitioning. The strength of interspecific competition is dependent on the variety of available host fruits that competing pests can utilize

 </sup>. The intercropping of various hosts in the smallholder orchards likely provides opportunities for partition resources of competing Tephritidae species. Interestingly, in smallholder farms the invasive 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> was mainly collected from recently introduced mango varieties such as ‘Kent’ and ‘Tommy Atkins’, whereas 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> flies were mainly collected from local mango and orange, from which few 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> emerged. This suggests that 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> competitive displaced 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> fly onto fruit less preferred by the first (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The complex array of different host species, and of varieties within a species, that typifies smallholder farming plots in East Africa may create more competition-free niches that allow for coexistence of several tephritid species in the same location. In fact, in spite of the high infestation levels of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, several other species besides 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>, were continuously captured in smallholder plots, albeit in low numbers. In contrast, the various 
 <italic>Ceratitis</italic> spp. that challenged production in the large monoculture guava plots at UAAIE prior to 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> invasion

 </sup>, completely disappeared from monitoring traps placed in guava at the start of intervention in 2013, except for 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>. This may be circumstantial evidence for niche differentiation in the smallholder plots, and absence thereof in the large-scale plots. In La Réunion, despite niche overlap with other tephritid pests, 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> was found to uniquely exploit certain hosts

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, Vargas et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, found that in spite of competitive displacement by 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> remained dominant in coffee plantations, which is considered a non-host for 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>.
