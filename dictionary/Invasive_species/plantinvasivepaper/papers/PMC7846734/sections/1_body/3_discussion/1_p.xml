 </sup>. This study evaluated several parameters that are relevant for African farming settings, that impact the effectiveness of male lures in suppressing fruit fly populations and securing fruit production. These include the scale of production, potential for competitive release, field longevity of the male lure, suitability of host fruits, and the dispersive ability of the pest.
