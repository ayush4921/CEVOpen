<p id="Par28">To assess potential competitive displacement of native 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>, we examined resource utilization by 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> and 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> through comparison of the number of emerging adults per kilo of fruit. Emergence rates of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> followed opposite patterns: from fruits from which significantly more 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> emerged, significantly fewer 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> emerged (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Furthermore, significantly higher numbers of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> emerged from guava at early stages of invasion of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, compared to post invasion. Conversely, 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> emergence was significantly higher in post invasion (after establishment) than in early invasion stages, which strongly indicates that 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> competitively displaced 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>.
