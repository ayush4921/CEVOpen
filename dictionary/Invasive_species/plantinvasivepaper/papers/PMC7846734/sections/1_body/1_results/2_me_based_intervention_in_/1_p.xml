<p id="Par23">During 2015 and 2016 an intervention trial using ME-dollops was rolled out to assess the possibility of suppressing 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in individual smallholder farms. Catches of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> fluctuated considerably along with the fruiting period of mango and some other climatic factors (e.g. a flood that inundated most of the mango growing area for a few weeks). Regardless, ME-based intervention did not have a noticeable effect on population levels (measured through catches using ME-baits) compared to control plots (red versus blue lines, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, see also supporting information figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The lack of suppression could be due to the relatively small size of the fields and the diverse cropping systems, which provide for alternative hosts for 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. In addition, a continuous immigration of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> from neighboring fields could have underlined the lack of control. Therefore, we assessed the dispersive range of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> (see below).
