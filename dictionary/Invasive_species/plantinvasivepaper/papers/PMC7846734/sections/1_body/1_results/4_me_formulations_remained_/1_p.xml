<p id="Par25">We subsequently tested the attractiveness of SPLAT-ME as a slow release formulation for methyl eugenol. Lures that had been exposed to field conditions for different lengths of time were compared at close range (1 m separation) or spaced (30 m from each other). When traps were placed in close proximity to each other, traps containing 1-day old lures (fresh lures) were as attractive as 5-day old lures, and more attractive than 7-day old lures. Lures aged for 1, 5 &amp; 7- days were more attractive than 15-day and 30-day old lures (p &lt; 0.0001). However, the 15-day old lure was more attractive compared to the 30-day old lure (p &lt; 0.001).</p>
