<p id="Par40">In our smallholder orchards, where the native fruit fly 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> had been largely displaced by 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, application of ME-based attract-and-kill technique did not suppress 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> to manageable levels, in part due to the speciesâ€™ long dispersive range. Controlling tephritid pests in a smallholder-farming setting thus requires concerted efforts from farming communities to achieve areawide management. Further, the complex and diverse cropping systems in smallholder farms may offer competition-free space for a more diverse fruit fly guild, thereby increasing the risk for competitive release and requiring intervention that targets multiple species.
