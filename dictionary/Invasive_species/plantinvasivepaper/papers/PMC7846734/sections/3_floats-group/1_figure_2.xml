  <p>Normalized trap captures of 
   <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in Arba-Minch in control and treatment plots of smallholder orchards throughout the intervention period. Capture rates were expressed as a fraction of the average capture rates of that plot at the beginning of the intervention trial. Results are expressed as a square root transformed value. Local Polynomial Regression Fitting was used for smoothing the curves.
