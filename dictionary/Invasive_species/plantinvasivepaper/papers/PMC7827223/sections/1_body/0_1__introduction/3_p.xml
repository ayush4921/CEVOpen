<p>Images that are acquired by UAVs can be analysed while using computer vision and GIS techniques. Important results can then be obtained by reducing the complexity contained in the images (using different image interpretation strategies) and the findings can be presented in elaborate visualisations [

 <xref rid="B22-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, we have used persistent homology to measure the spread of invasive species. Processing images and creating orthomosaics allow for a fast analysis of large amounts of data. Deep learning techniques additionally automatize classification and localisation processes, and make it possible to incorporate expert knowledge into the automatic image processing pipeline. This has the potential to increase the scale of the resulting studies to reach large regions that are significant in terms of country-level invasive species detection and management.
