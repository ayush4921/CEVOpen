<p>Blueberry plants show a characteristic red leaf colour in autumn, which make them easily recognisable and identifiable in comparison to other classes of vegetation. Both a simple identification and segmentation by colour were proposed and applied in one of the first segmentation approaches. However, partly visible soil with reddish tones constrained blueberry identification. This problem was especially critical for small blueberry bushes. In autumn, the leaf colours can vary between red, red with a yellowish tone, and partly black. This caused challenges for the annotations and for the deep learning algorithm, since the number of blueberry images was already low in comparison to the other classes and it made the colour approach not usable for this study. Further complications were given by light conditions during image taking. When the blueberry bushes had brighter red colours due to sun light, it was difficult to distinguish them from the ground. Bushes, which were located in the shadows, especially the ones that had a predominately black colour, were barely recognisable.</p>
