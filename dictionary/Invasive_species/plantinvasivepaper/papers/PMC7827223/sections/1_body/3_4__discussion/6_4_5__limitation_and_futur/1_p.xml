<p>The presented work provided a methodology to analyse invasive species from UAV images. Nevertheless, we faced limitations regarding the data that are described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot1-sensors-21-00471">Section 4.1</xref>. The autumn season seemed to be a good timing for image taking, but the difficulties regarding the varying colour of the blueberry bushes should be taken into account more carefully. Image taking could be done when the weather is cloudy and not windy, as suggested in previous studies [

The resolution was reduced to 5â€“7 cm/pixel to be able to use image processing software. This led to difficulties in identifying blueberry bushes and their properties. For the future, different flight settings can be tested, as presented in [

 <xref rid="B50-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], especially smaller flight areas and a reduced flight height can help to increase the resolution and precision of the results of blueberry bush properties.
