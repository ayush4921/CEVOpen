<p>The results of the automatic classification were used in order to map the invasive species, which is an important first step, whereby a refined segmentation is essential to effectively determine the exact location of plant invasions [
 <xref rid="B35-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The deep learning applications used classified images, and a refined mask provided the blueberry bush locations. The refinement step was necessary in this application, since most of the blueberry bushes are small. Hence, the refined mask offered a more precise localisation of the blueberry bushes. Even though not all bushes were found and some soil areas were misclassified as blueberry bushes, the refined mask could significantly reduce the time of manual annotations and provide maps of the studied area. Increasing the amount of blueberry data can help to optimize the classification accuracy and the localisation of blueberry bushes. This will be considered in our future research.
