<p>B1 has a similar distribution, while the number of blueberry bushes per hectare is doubled in comparison to B6. The density map showed high densities in the northern part of the orthomosaic and a gradual decrease of blueberry bushes in the southern direction, which was confirmed by the hotspot analysis. The density of the bushes was higher than in B6, but, as indicated by the persistent homology, the spread was greater. This indicates that the blueberries invaded but did not reach every region of the site. Furthermore, the blueberry bushes in B1 have the largest bush area within all studied sites. The identified bushes maturity suggests that the blueberry species has invaded the area a long time ago. Because the density map provided the information that the blueberry bushes are mainly distributed in the north, there must be conditions in the south, which prevented further spread.</p>
