<p>Our approach is based on a patch classification model that uses the patches of 100 × 100 pixels described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-sensors-21-00471">Section 2.3</xref>. A patch of orthomosaic B1 and B3 covered; therefore, 700 cm × 700 cm and a patch of orthomosaic B2 500 cm × 500 cm. For each patch, a list containing the class labels was created from the binary maps for each class. This classification is usually referred as multi-label, since each input patch might contain different labels (i.e., a part of the patch may contain soil, while other parts of the same patch could also contain bushes or blueberries).
