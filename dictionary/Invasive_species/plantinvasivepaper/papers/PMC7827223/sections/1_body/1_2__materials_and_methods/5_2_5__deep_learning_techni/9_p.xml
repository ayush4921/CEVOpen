<p>We then broke all of the patches into the usual classification categories of:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>True Positives</bold> or TP, predicted to contain the blueberry class and also marked in the ground truth as containing them.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>False Positives</bold> or FP, predicted to contain the blueberry class but NOT marked as such in the ground truth. These patches correspond to over-prediction errors where the algorithm “sees” the blueberry class when it is not really there.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>True Negatives</bold> or TN, not containing the blueberry class in the prediction or in the ground truth.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>False Negatives</bold> or FN, not predicted to contain blueberries, but actually being marked as containing them in the ground truth. These patches correspond to under-prediction errors where existing blueberry instances are missed by the algorithm.
   </p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
