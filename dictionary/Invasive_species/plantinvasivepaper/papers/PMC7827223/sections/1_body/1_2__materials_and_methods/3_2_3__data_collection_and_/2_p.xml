<p>In order to train deep learning models to detect blueberry bushes orthomosaics annotated with all of the aforementioned labels were needed. Therefore, only B1 to B3 were used in the deep learning section of this study. These three orthomosaics, as well as the corresponding annotated binary layers were divided into axis-parallel patches of side length = 100 (hereafter "patch size"). This value was determined by taking the sizes of the blueberry bushes in the images, which ranged from 20 to 100 pixels in radius, into account. The classes in each patch were stored in a separate 
 <italic>label</italic> list. In general, patches contained more than one class and, therefore, our problem can be defined as a multi-label patch classification problem.
