<p>On the one hand, the Dice coefficient, which evaluates the overlap and number of non-GT pixels that are contained in the predicted patches, improved significantly with the refinement algorithm from values around 0.2 to values in the 0.5â€“0.6 range. On the other hand, the ratio of GT pixels that are covered by the mask, which ranges from 0.88 to 0.95 for the non-refined mask was slightly inferior in the refined version (0.78 to 0.87).</p>
