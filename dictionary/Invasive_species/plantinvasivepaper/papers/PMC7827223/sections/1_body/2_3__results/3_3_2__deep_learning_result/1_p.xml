<p>In this section, we describe the usefulness of deep learning techniques in order to automatically determine the location of blueberry bushes in our data. As stated in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot5-sensors-21-00471">Section 2.5</xref>, a widely used network (ResNet50) was chosen and two main aspects were studied: how the data balance affects the final classification results and whether using transfer learning resulted in improved results. Several experiments were presented in a previous study [
