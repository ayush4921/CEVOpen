<p>Finally, the persistent homology was performed, as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3dot1-sensors-21-00471">Section 2.3.1</xref>. The radius was plotted against the fused region, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00471-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The orthomosaics B2, B3, and B4 show a similar trend, while B1 and B6 also follow a different, but similar, trend to each other. B2 is the first orthomosaic, where 1% of the blueberry bushes were fused with a radius of 386 and B1 needed the largest radius with a value of 497. In all orthomosaics the radius needed to fuse up to 10% of the blueberry bushes is similar with values between 415 and 557. There is a small gap of approximately 150 between B3 (945), B6 (998), B1 (824), B2 (768), and B4 (831), when 50% of the blueberry bushes were fused. The radius needed to fuse 90% for B1 and B6 are 3279 and 3611, while, for B2 to B4, it is 1610 to 1709.
