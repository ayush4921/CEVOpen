<p>This section is divided in two parts: the first part of the analysis focused on the manual annotations of the wetland vegetation and, most specifically, of the blueberry bushes. GIS, computer vision, and persistent homology were used to describe and quantify the characteristics of the blueberry invasion in all of our test sites. In the second part of this section, the results of Deep learning techniques are presented. In this case, our goal was to assess to what extent these technologies can be used to automatically generate the annotations that were used in the first part to characterise the invasion. The general workflow can be seen in
