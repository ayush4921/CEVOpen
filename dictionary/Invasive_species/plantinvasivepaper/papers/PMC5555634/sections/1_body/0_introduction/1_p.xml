<p>Invasion is considered as the second most important threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Quest for the ecological mechanism that lies behind the success of invasive species over native species has drawn an attention of research worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>],[
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>],[
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many publications considered key issues in plant invasion ecology and significantly improved our understanding of many aspects of invasions. Different concepts, hypotheses and theories concerning plant invasion ecology were for example reviewed by Richardson and Py≈°ek [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and Rai [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These authors in detail discuss at least 16 different ecological attributes and theories. The most well known and best studied are two ecologically interrelated hypotheses, i.e., enemy release and fluctuating resources which emphasize that invading species must have access to available resources, e.g., light, nutrients, and water, and that an invading species will be more successful at invading a community if it does not encounter intense competition for these resources from resident species [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An extremely important factor, required initially for invasion success, is propagule pressure [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>],[
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Residence time integrates aspects of propagule pressure: the longer the species is present in the region, the greater the size of the propagule bank, and the greater the probability of dispersal, establishment, and the founding of new populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further, phenotypic plasticity and/or rapid evolutionary change (caused by genetic drift and inbreeding in founder populations, by intra- and interspecific hybridization in the introduced range creating novel genotypes, and by drastic changes in selection regimes imposed by novel environments) are two not mutually exclusive basic options that are available for an introduced plant species to invade a new region. Either the plant must possess sufficiently high levels of physiological tolerance and plasticity, or it must undergo genetic differentiation to achieve required levels of fitness [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More other hypotheses pertaining to success of invasive plant species may also include novel weapon, empty niche, evolution of increased competitive ability or seed plant invasiveness [
