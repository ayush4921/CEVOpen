<p>According to MaxentVariableSelection [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the highest AICc score was assigned to the model with beta-multiplayer = 1. The set of the most important and uncorrelated climatic variables included five from the original 19 and they were: Isothermality (Bio03), Minimum Temperature of Coldest Month (Bio06), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (Bio08), Precipitation of Driest Month (Bio14), Precipitation Seasonality (Bio15). Those variables were distinctive for the observed populations and seem not only to influence the distribution of

Thus, given that this region is the speciesâ€™ native area it seems that the variables were unambiguous choice. The most important and uncorrelated soil and topographic variables included: roughness, topographic position index and soil organic carbon content. In general they also well characterise mountainous regions.
