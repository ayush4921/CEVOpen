<p>According to the model, the most suitable habitats within the native range of the species may be located in the whole Caucasus Mts, the Armenian Highlands, the Taurus Mts, the Pontic Mts, and a mosaic of smaller mountain ranges within the Western Anatolian Plateau that should be considered a western border of the native occurrences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182793.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Further suitable habitats found apart from its native range (including also uninhabited areas) comprise the Pindus Mts and adjacent ranges, the Carpathians, the Sudetes, the Eastern Alps, and the Crimean Mts. A few other mountain ranges located in the Mediterranean region and some parts of Scandinavia are also suitable to a lesser extent and mostly are of insular character. Regarding different sets of variables the differences had marginal character and the main area predicted as suitable remains similar. However, some differences exist as for example in the map constructed only with soil variables, vast areas in Western Europe were predicted as suitable (i.e., in Germany and France). Similarly areas in the Apennine and Iberian Peninsulas gained higher suitability. These trends, however, are not visible on predictions which include climatic data suggesting that they may play a role in shaping the western part of the plausible distribution. On the other hand, joint climatic and soil modelling indicated that some areas predicted with the model using only climatic variables were not regarded as suitable. This includes e.g. some areas in Central and northern Europe, central areas of the Carpathian Mts., Corsica, and some smaller areas especially in the Balkan and Apennine Peninsulas.
