<p>The response curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182793.g003">Fig 3</xref>) present the optimal values of the five bioclimatic and three soil/topographic variables. It seems that the most suitable habitat could be characterised by the minimum temperature of the coldest month of around -10°C, maximum mean temperature of the wettest quarter of 15°C, precipitation of the driest month of about 20 mm, non-Atlantic climate and average isothermality. Optimal organic carbon content in the soil should be around 70 g per kg.
