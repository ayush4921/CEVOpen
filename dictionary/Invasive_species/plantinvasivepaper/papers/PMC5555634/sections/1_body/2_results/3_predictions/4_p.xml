<p>PCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182793.g004">Fig 4</xref>) indicates that in comparison to the native populations, invasive ones tend to occupy a somewhat remote position in the environmental niche; however, this is still within the tolerance of the species. This position seem to be mainly associated with the axis related to mean temperature of wettest month (Bio08) which is higher in exotic locations. Relative to the natural populations, those also exhibit only small variation recorded in the natural ones.
