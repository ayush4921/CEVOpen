<p>The modelling was conducted using the maximum entropy method implemented in Maxent version 3.3.3k [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which is widely used and is known for its reliability ([
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and references therein). The maximum iterations were set to 10
 <sup>4</sup> and convergence threshold to 10
 <sup>−5</sup>. For each run, 20% of the data were used and set aside as test points. The “random seed” option which provided random test partition and background subset for each run was applied. The run was performed as a bootstrap with 10
 <sup>3</sup> replicates, “auto features” were used, and the output was set to logistic.
