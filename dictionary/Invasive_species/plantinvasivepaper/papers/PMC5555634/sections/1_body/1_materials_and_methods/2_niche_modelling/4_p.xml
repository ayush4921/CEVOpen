<p>Predictions of the future extent of climatic niche were performed using climate projections obtained from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIPP5) using four “representative concentration pathways” (RCPs: rcp26, rcp45, rcp60, rcp85) which differ in predicted CO

To reduce the bias caused by the selection of only one specific model, they were averaged and the ensemble map for each variable in particular RCP was computed. For presentation of the results, continuous grids were converted to binary grids using maximum training sensitivity plus specificity logistic threshold. In the future predictions soil and topographic data were not used due to uncertainties and lack of availability of their future estimates.
