<p>Additionally it was tested whether any other factors related to topographic or soil properties may be important for modelling distribution of the species. To account for that three separate analyses were run including: selected soil variables, selected soil and climatic variables, and a joint analysis with all (43) available variables. 18 soil variables relevant to plant growth were downloaded from
