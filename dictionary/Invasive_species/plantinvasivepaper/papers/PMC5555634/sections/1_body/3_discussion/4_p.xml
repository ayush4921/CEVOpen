<p>Species distribution modelling is often used to model areas susceptible to invasive species. As this approach bears clear benefits for the biodiversity conservation and invasive plant management, some caveats may also be encountered. First of all evolutionary processes take place continuously and in many cases it was shown that invasive populations often exhibit novel traits that facilitate their invasions in new areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this case a species may evolve novel adaptations and thus is able to colonize niches different than in its native habitat. Secondly, process of modelling is sensitive to different settings such as, for example: variables used, localities, and modelling method [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Here we tried to alleviate this source of errors by using maxent which is one of the most widely used modelling software often outcompeting other methods [e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>],[
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>],[
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]]. Input variables were also screened by computer algorithm for their importance and correlation which makes the choice more objective and not affected by personal preferences. Lastly, to screen for other possible predictions different sets of input variables were used. The last approach revealed that the main area of potential distribution is stable even between as different data sets as climate and soil variables thus adding more support to our analysis.
