   <bold>Figure A. Plot of residual semivariance vs. distance (m) in 
    <italic>R</italic>. 
    <italic>multiflora</italic> occurrence models without (a) and with (b) Block as a random effect
   </bold>. Distance refers to the distance between the plots from which a given pair of data points were collected. Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value given is for Moran’s I test of spatial autocorrelation. Inclusion of Block in the 
   <italic>R</italic>. 
   <italic>multiflora</italic> occurrence models greatly reduced spatial autocorrelation between plots in different blocks although some spatial autocorrelation remains between plots within the same Block (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
   <bold>Figure B. Plot of residual semivariance vs. distance (m) in 
    <italic>R</italic>. 
    <italic>multiflora</italic> abundance models without (a) and with (b) Block as a random effect
   </bold>. Distance indicates the distance between the plots from which a given pair of data points were collected. Dashed lines give 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value is for Moran’s I test of spatial autocorrelation. Inclusion of Block in the 
   <italic>R</italic>. 
   <italic>multiflora</italic> abundance models eliminated spatial autocorrelation between plots at least 50 meters apart although some spatial autocorrelation remains between plots within the same Block (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
   <bold>Figure C. Plot of residual semivariance vs. distance (m) in 
    <italic>B thunbergii</italic> occurrence models without (a) and with (b) Block as a random effect
   </bold>. Distance provides the distance between the plots from which a given pair of data points were collected. The dashed lines give 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value given is for Moran’s I test of spatial autocorrelation. Inclusion of Block in the 
   <italic>B</italic>. 
   <italic>thunbergii</italic> occurrence models eliminated all spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). 
   <bold>Figure D. Plot of residual semivariance vs. distance (m) in 
    <italic>B</italic>. 
    <italic>thunbergii</italic> abundance models without (a) and with (b) Block as a random effect
   </bold>. Distance indicates the distance between the plots from which a given pair of data points were collected. The dashed lines give 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value given is for Moran’s I test of spatial autocorrelation. Inclusion of Block in the 
   <italic>B</italic>. 
   <italic>thunbergii</italic> abundance models eliminated all spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
