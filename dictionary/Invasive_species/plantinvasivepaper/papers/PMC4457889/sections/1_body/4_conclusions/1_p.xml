<p>This study highlights the importance of historic land-use for informing predictions of invasion. A history of mining, agriculture, logging, development, and proximity to roads all increased the probability that at least one of the invasive species that we studied would occur in a particular plot. In contrast, fewer land uses were associated with increased probability of high abundance in

 <italic>thunbergii</italic> or with higher total number of invasive plant species, though the most disturbing land uses of mining and agriculture were associated with these variables. We are not the first study to note that invasive species abundance may be driven by different environmental and anthropogenic factors than occurrence of these species [
