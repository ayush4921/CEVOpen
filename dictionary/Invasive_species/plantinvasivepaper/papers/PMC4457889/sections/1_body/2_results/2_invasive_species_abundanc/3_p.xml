<p>Abundance of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> varied by land-use history within PNR, with cover above ten percent in 13% of always forested plots, 43% of agriculture to forest plots, 30% of logged plots, and 12% of mined plots. 
 <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> was not present at high abundance in the developed to forest plots or developed plots. As predicted, disturbance by humans increased the probability of high abundance and the inclusion of land-use history significantly improved model fit (LR Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 20.39, df = 5, p &lt; 0.001). The probability of high abundance of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> was significantly higher in agriculture to forest plots, where the log odds increased by 1.71 (Wald Z = 4.395, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds by 5.50. There was no significant difference between always forested plots and previously mined plots (log odds = -0.05, Wald Z = -0.058, p = 0.95) or previously logged plots (log odds = 1.46, Wald Z = 1.827, p = 0.068). Plots with a history of development were not included in this model due to sample size limitations (n &lt; 3). Furthermore, as with 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic>, proximity to roads did not significantly increase the probability of highly abundant 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic>, and inclusion of distance to road did not significantly improve model fit (LR Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.08, df = 1, p = 0.298).
