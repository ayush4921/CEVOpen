<p>Roads may also aid the spread of invasive species, even in areas that have historically been forested [

 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Roads provide suitable habitats for invasive species as well as corridors for the dispersal of invasive species [

 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, only a few studies have combined models of invasive species presence and distance to roads with land-use history to examine whether roads continue to be important predictors of invasive spread when land use is included in the model and

 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is important to include both land use and distance to roads in models because the land use history and roads could potentially have interacting effects. For instance, a road close to a disturbed site could increase propagule pressure in that site [

 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], potentially due to species-specific differences in the effects of roads on the occurrence and spread of invasive species [
