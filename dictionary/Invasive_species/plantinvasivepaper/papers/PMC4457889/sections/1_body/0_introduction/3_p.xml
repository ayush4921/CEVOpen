<p>Furthermore, the effects of some past land uses are less well studied, despite their high prevalence in the landscape. For example, the effects of agriculture and logging on invasive spread have been extensively studied, whereas the effects of mining have not been studied as extensively or in the same ways. Over 400,000 hectares of forest have been lost to mining since 1973 in the eastern United States alone and coal mining is currently the leading cause of forest loss in the Allegheny Plateau ecoregion that contains our study site, Powdermill Nature Reserve [

 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it seems likely that mining would enhance the spread of invasive organisms by also creating “windows of opportunity” in a similar manner to how agriculture enhances the spread of invasive species. This situation appears likely, but studies of mining impacts have generally focused on the prevalence of invasive species over the course of succession or on the effects of planting invasive species as part of the mine reclamation process on subsequent invasive species prevalence [
