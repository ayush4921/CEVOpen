<p>In this exploratory study, we examined patterns of occurrence and abundance of two invasive plant species in a deciduous forest ecosystem in eastern North America as a function of roughly 70 years of land-use history and of distance to roads to ask the following questions: (1) How do patterns of land-use change including surface mining for coal, logging, agriculture, and development affect the occurrence and abundance of invasive species? (2) How does the distance to a road affect the occurrence and abundance of invasive species? (3) Is land-use change still a significant predictor of invasive occurrence and abundance once distance to road is accounted for and
