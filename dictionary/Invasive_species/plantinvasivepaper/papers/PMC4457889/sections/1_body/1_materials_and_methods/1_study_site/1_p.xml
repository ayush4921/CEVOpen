<p>To examine the impacts of land-use history on invasive species, we analyzed an extensive vegetation survey from Powdermill Nature Reserve (PNR; 40°09’S, 79°16’W), currently private property maintained as a research field station by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA. PNR covers nearly 900 hectares of temperate deciduous forest in southwestern Pennsylvania (U.S.A), where the predominant tree taxa are maple (
