<p>During the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, a continuous 120m x 120m grid was mapped across PNR (for a total of 647 'blocks'). Within each block, nine circular vegetation plots (10m in radius, ~314 m
 <sup>2</sup> in area, total area = 2827 m
 <sup>2</sup>) were established in a square around the center of each block. Within each vegetation plot, all trees, shrubs, and herbs were surveyed. Shrub and herb abundance was assessed as percent cover (“cover class” hereafter) and assigned a numeric value between 0 and 6 (0, trace = 1, 1–10% = 2, 11–25% = 3, 26–50% = 4, 51–75% = 5, and &gt;75% = 6). Based on cover class assignments, 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> cover in each plot was binned into a “low cover” category (trace-10% cover, hereafter “low abundance”) and a “high cover” category (&gt;10% cover, hereafter “high abundance).
