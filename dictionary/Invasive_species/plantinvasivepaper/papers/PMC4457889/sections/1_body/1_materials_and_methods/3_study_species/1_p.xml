<p>Five invasive plant species were identified in the survey plots at PNR. Multiflora rose (
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic>) and Japanese barberry (
 <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic>) were widespread in the reserve (accounting for 65% and 34% of all invasive species occurrences, respectively), while the three remaining species combined accounted for &lt;1.5% of invasive species coverage (
 <italic>Lonicera morrowi</italic>, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, and
