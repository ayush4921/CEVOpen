<p>Although PNR is currently predominantly forested, the region has experienced a variety of anthropogenic disturbances. As with most forests in the eastern U.S., much of the reserve was logged in the 1800s. The majority of the reserve returned to forest afterward although a small fraction of the reserve experienced more recent clear cutting in the 1960s and became forested later. Following logging, parts of the property were used for agriculture until the early to mid-1900s. In addition, surface mining for coal occurred during the 1940s. Little development (e.g., building) has taken place since PNR was designated as a nature reserve and became a part of Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1956. At present, most of the PNR remains forested and undisturbed with its east boundary connected to the 200-ha Laurel Mountain State Park. However, a high level of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., residential areas and highways) has occurred to the west side of the reserve, which could have accelerated the introduction and establishment of invasive species. No special permission was required to measure woody plants on private property and no protected species were involved in the survey. This study was approved by the Director of Powdermill Nature Reserve and by the Director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.</p>
