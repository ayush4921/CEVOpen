<p>We found that a wide array of land-use histories significantly increased the likelihood of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> occurrence. Plots with a history of mining, logging, or agriculture were significantly more likely to have both invasive species than plots that had been continuously forested since 1939. 
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> was also more likely to occur in plots that were closer to roads and was more likely to occur in plots that had been developed than in plots that were always forested. By comparison, disturbance had less of an impact on the abundance of these invasive species after their introduction. Only a history of agriculture resulted in greater abundance of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic>, whereas 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> was significantly more abundant in plots with mining, logging, or agricultural history. These results suggest that historic disturbances create “windows of opportunity” for introduction of invasive species, which results in long-term persistence of these species in the invaded ecosystem; however, effects of past disturbance on abundance following introduction are limited and depend on the type of disturbance.
