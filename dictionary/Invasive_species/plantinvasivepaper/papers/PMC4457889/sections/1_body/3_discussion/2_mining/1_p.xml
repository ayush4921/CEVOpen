<p>Our study is unique in examining the impacts of historic coal mining on the introduction and spread of invasive species along with other historic land-use changes. Strip mining for coal results in total vegetation clearing and a suite of changes to the soil [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including compaction and the resultant decrease in water absorption [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], acidification, and loss of mycorrhizal symbionts [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the seed bank, and soil microbes [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, invasive species, such as 
 <italic>Elaeagnus umbellata</italic>, are sometimes planted as part of the reclamation process because of their ability to spread quickly and grow under harsh conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These alterations differ from modifications resulting from agriculture and other disturbances, but are similar in that they often inhibit re-establishment of native species while allowing disturbance specialist invasive species to establish. Our findings showed that mining significantly increased 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> occurrence and abundance relative to plots that had always been forested. 
 <italic>Berberis</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> was also more likely to occur in areas that had historically been mined but, in contrast, was not more abundant where it did occur. Historically mined plots also contained more than twice the number of invasive plant species compared to plots that had been forested since 1939. As in our study, invasive species have been found in historically-mined areas, including 
 <italic>Latana camara</italic> in coal fields in India [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and autumn olive (
 <italic>Elaeagnus umbellata</italic>) and 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> in historically-mined areas of Appalachia [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>][
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>Latana camara</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>umbellata</italic> spread quickly in these areas after mining ceased, having negative effects on the recovery of native species, while spread of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> was not examined [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>][
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our research implies that mine reclamation efforts should focus not only on soil amendments to decrease acidification and introduce mycorrhizal symbionts, but also on the establishment of native or non-invasive plant communities to limit invasion opportunities for species such as 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic>, which persist in the ecosystem for decades after mine abandonment.
