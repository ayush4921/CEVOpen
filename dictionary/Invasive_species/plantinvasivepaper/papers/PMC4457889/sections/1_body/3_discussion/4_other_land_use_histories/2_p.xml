 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] found that both species were significantly more abundant in areas that were continuously developed than in areas that stayed forested, in contrast to our results; however they did not have a category for areas that had been developed and then allowed to return to forest. Another study found that high levels of present development corresponded with higher frequency and cover of invasive species and that this pattern held true to a certain extent for both

 <italic>thunbergii</italic> [

However, that study had only three sites and compared the effects of past and present land use, unlike our study, which created land-use categories based on both past and present land use. Most of the developed plots at PNR are of relatively low disturbance intensity (i.e., lawns). This low level of disturbance may have resulted in the limited effects of development on invasive species occurrence and abundance. Studies of the impacts of previous development followed by reforestation on non-native species invasion are quite rare as the conversion of forest to developed land is much more common than the reverse [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, our study is unique in contributing to our limited understanding of both the temporal sequence of land-use change and the effects of present and historic development.
