<p id="Par48">DNA amplification was carried out by a two-step PCR approach with four sets of primer mixes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which were multiplexed for PCR following the procedure described in Curto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>. During the first PCR, the target region is amplified using specific primer pairs. The primer pairs contain additional bases at the 5′-ends. In the second PCR reaction the adapters bind to their complementary oligonucleotides in the primer pair of the first PCR reaction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Five μL Master mix (Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit), 1 μL primer mix with a concentration of 1 μM (forward and reverse combined), 3 μL H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 1 μL DNA were mixed. PCR run with the following program: 95 °C for fifteen minutes, 95 °C denaturation temperature for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for one minute and elongation at 72 °C for one minute, repeating for 30 cycles. For the second PCR, 1.5 μL from each PCR product from the four multiplex reactions were pooled per sample and cleaned by mixing it with 4.3 μL AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, USA). Washing steps as well as the second PCR elongating the PCR strands with unique indexes for sequencing, pooling the amplicons and purification followed Curto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>. The libraries were sequenced in one Illumina MiSeq run targeting around 3,000,000 paired reads of 300 bp, corresponding to an average depth of 800 per sample per marker.
