<p id="Par46">Marker development was conducted according to Tibihika [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and Curto et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. We prepared a whole DNA library (approx. insert length 400–500 bp according to Nextera XT Library Prep., Illumina, USA) and used it for a low coverage run on the Miseq platform, targeting to produce about 300,000 to 1,000,000 paired reads. Whole DNA Library construction and sequencing was performed by Service (LMU Sequencing center) based on a specimen from the founder population in South-France.
