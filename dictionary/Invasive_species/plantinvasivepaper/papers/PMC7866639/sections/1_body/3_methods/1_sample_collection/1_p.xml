<p id="Par45">Specimens for the present study were gathered from commercially-circulated trap nests (in France and Switzerland) and an international initiated citizen science project aiming to investigate its distribution in Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria [

For tests of genetic variation, samples were organized into four sample groups reflecting geographic origins, which were used as populations in subsequent analyses (South-France = SFR, France = FR, Switzerland = CH, Vienna = VIE; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Specimens from trap nests are representatives from localities close to their point of first recognition (SFR, n = 7), other parts in France (n = 40), Switzerland (n = 22) and Vienna (n = 11). Coordinates from vouchers were available from 28 specimens. Samples were included as adults (n = 20) and larvae (n = 61) collected from trap nests in the study, whereas 42 adults and larvae were assigned as females and 39 individuals were assigned as males (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Genetic tests were performed for all samples and due to the haplo-diploid system of hymenopterans, we segregated female larvae by their size and position within the nests from all others (as a protandrous solitary bee, females emerge later than males and were positioned at the back of the nests).
