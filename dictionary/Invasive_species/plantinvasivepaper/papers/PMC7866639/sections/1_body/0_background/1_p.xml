<p id="Par23">Invasion occurs when a species is accidentally or intentionally introduced to and establishes within such a new environment. But invasive pollinators, like invasive bee species, often deviate from the negative perspective of invaders, especially when it comes to pollinators of crops. Bees are generally considered beneficial for the pollination services they provide, but they may have surprising negative impacts on local ecosystems where they do not naturally occur [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Negative impacts can take different forms, including through disrupting plant-pollinator networks, competition with native species for nest sites or other resources, pollinating invasive plants, the introduction of novel pathogens, and economic losses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Among bees, those which nest in cavities opportunistically are disproportionately invasive, i.e. 
 <italic>Afranthidium (Immanthidium) repetitum</italic>, and, relatedly, wood-nesting bees make up larger proportions of the fauna in more remote islands due to higher dispersal abilities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In these ways, invasive bees can be promising study organisms for investigating range expansion and dispersal patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].Given increasing reports of invasions that come with globalization of human society [
