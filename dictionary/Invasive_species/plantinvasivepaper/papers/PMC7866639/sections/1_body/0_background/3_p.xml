<p id="Par25">In Europe, this species was first recognized in a small city near Marseille (Allauch, France) in 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There are relatively few examples of other invasive aculeate species in Europe, besides 
 <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> first recognized in 2005 also in South-France, and 
 <italic>Megachile disjunctiformis</italic> found in northern Italy in 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. 
 <italic>Megachile sculpturalis</italic> most likely found its way to Europe as a stowaway on ships while nesting in dead wood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Following its initial discovery in France, the species was reported from northern Italy in 2009 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the following years, 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> colonized many European countries remarkably fast. Its range expansion from France and Italy continued to Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina reaching now to the Crimean Peninsula [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A recent compilation of records from our collections and a citizen science approach, show range extensions to eastern locations, including Vienna (2017) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], Gyöngyös (2015) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and Belgrade (2017) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This suggests that the current distribution pattern in Europe was attained by two distinctive mechanisms of dispersal. First, after its introduction in South-France, 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> probably colonized most countries by stepwise dispersal. Additionally, accidental transport in wood could explain the large distances-over hundreds of kilometers-between isolated reports eastward [
