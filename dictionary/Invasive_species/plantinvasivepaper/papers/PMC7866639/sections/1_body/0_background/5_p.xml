<p id="Par27">To conduct such analyses, allele frequencies from selected neutral marker loci are compared to assess gene flow, which is a crucial parameter studying population dynamics and invasion biology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Great advances have been made in the study of genetic diversity in non-model organisms over the last decade. Codominant datasets from microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were the standard for assessing connectivity and genetic structure between populations for a long time [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The main advantage of the genotyping by amplicons sequencing (SSR-GBAS) approach is the direct accessibility of the sequence of an allele without the need to indirectly use size as a proxy. Here, we call the method SSR-GBAS, as in earlier studies SSR-GBS was used which led to confusion because of the frequent view of using GBS exclusively for RAD methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Variants using similar allele call methods have also been termed SSR-Seq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The single-base-pair resolution enables enhanced sensitivity in detecting alleles and hidden size-homoplasy with a greater potential for individual identification as well as the ability to resolve low genetic diversity and spatial patterns at very fine scales [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. SSR-GBAS can also be applied for species with large genomes, where little or no genetic data are available. Another major advantage of parallel sequencing is the high number of samples that can be included in single sequencing runs, therefore circumventing some additional shortcomings of microsatellites aside from their exploring only length-polymorphisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The approach is especially promising for samples providing little or degraded DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which is often the case when working with small organisms such as wild bees. Overall, this type of marker is ideal for exploring the invasion dynamics of exotic species.
