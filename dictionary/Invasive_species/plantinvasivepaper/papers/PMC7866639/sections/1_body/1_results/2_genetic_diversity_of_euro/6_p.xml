<p id="Par35">In an AMOVA, 21% of variation was explained by differences between geographical groups and 59% within groups and 20% within individuals. When grouping was done according to the structure analysis, 37% of the variation was described between clusters, 45% within clusters and 18% within individuals. The latter values were derived from K = 4 because of the lower number of admixed individuals. Despite the genetic structure apparent in Structure analysis and PCoA, the sign tests for bottlenecks were significant for all regions with He &gt; Heq as well as the one-tailed Wilcoxon tests (Table
