<p id="Par33">PCoA provided a visualization of the genetic distance patterns between individuals of the four sample groups. Samples from the groups SFR, FR and CH formed one discrete cluster. Samples from Vienna were separated from the remaining samples by relatively high distances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). No genetic structure was obvious in PCoA between the three sample groups SFR, FR and CH (n = 65), excluding the samples assigned to Vienna. Structure and Structure Harvester found that Delta K is highest for a K value of two, meaning that the likelihood of two different big genetic clusters is the highest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The second highest likelihood is for K = 5. Generally, structure analyses were consistent with the outputs of PCoA, indicating two distinctive groups, one for the VIE samples and one for the rest, at K = 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A higher K output indicates different clusters, most diverse in the group FR (cluster 2) followed by CH, and SFR. When cluster assignment was used as a group criterion in the PCoA, these samples grouped to some extend together. This was most clearly found for a group of six individuals from the group FR.
