<p id="Par31">Of the 81 total specimens, seven samples were missing ten or more markers and were excluded from further analysis. In total 74 samples were included. The sample group FR represented the highest number of polymorphic loci with 95.65%, followed by the sample group CH 93.48% and SFR with 89.13% and finally, VIE with 67.39%, which is probably a result of the uneven sample sizes across regions. Specimens from Vienna had the highest number of private alleles (VIE = 0.383), in contrast to low levels in samples from the group CH = 0.191 and SFR = 0.021. The remaining sample group FR had 0.298. This pattern is also reflected by the level of genetic distance between the groups (GD, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Population diversity statistics were first applied including all 74 samples. Due to the haplo-diploid system, females are heterozygous, and males are supposed to be homozygote, which should decrease H
 <sub>o</sub>. When females (n = 42) were separated from the males, we saw a similar picture as for all samples: the Ho was lower than He in all groups and for females overall, but not for the group VIE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
