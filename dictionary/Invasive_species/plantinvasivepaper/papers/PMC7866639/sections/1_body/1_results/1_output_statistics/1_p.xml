<p id="Par29">To study the genetic variability of European 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> populations, 48 SSR markers were designed and tested on 81 samples of European 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> specimens. Out of all 48 markers, two (FB12 and FB47) were excluded due to an unusually high number of alleles as a possible consequence of duplication or scoring errors. The marker set included 20 pentanucleotide (two were excluded) and another 28 tetranucleotide motifs. Primer information is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, including polymorphism information content, number of different alleles and unbiased, expected heterozygosity (uHe).
