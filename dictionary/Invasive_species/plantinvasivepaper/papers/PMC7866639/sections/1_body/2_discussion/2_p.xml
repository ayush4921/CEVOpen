<p id="Par37">Species introduction events begin at their origins, where efficient vectors for single or multiple colonization events are required. Humans most often act as vectors and transport species via commerce and trading networks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. With ongoing globalisation, the frequency of species introductions has increased from year to year on a global scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Human-mediated dispersal is influenced by the likelihood and frequency for a certain species to infiltrate human transport and arrive alive and able to reproduce, which depends on several factors: population size, nesting behavior, biotic interactions and phenology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In the case of 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic>, only long-distance transportation can explain its invasion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. As an example, one specimen was found previously on an airplane in Hawaii arriving from Japan, although it never established there [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. More likely, 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> found its way to North America and Europe on ships following maritime trading routes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As the species is a cavity-nesting bee, it is assumed that wood packaging material provided shelter for overwintering larvae during transportation, like for most insects translocated between continents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. After arrival, the species was unintentionally released in its new environment, with establishment then dependent on the balance of available resources vs. the species’ requirements. Besides long-distance introdcutions to their new environment, some invaders experience range expansions over large longitudinal distances. This stepwise dispersal pattern are in most cases man-made promoting invasion success rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Humans act as ecological filters by translocating species around the world, accidentally or intentionally, whereby the likelihood of human-vectored dispersal increases with human movement and contact zones, e.g. transport networks for roads and ships, trading points and urban areas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].
