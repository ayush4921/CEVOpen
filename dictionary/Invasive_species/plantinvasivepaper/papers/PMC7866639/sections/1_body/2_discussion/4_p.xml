<p id="Par39">Introduced species often require a demographic lag phase immediately following the initial colonization event, prior to full establishment and subsequent range expansion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> was already recognized in 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], for many years the species was reported by single or very few observations restricted to certain areas. During this lag phase, it can be challenging to gather a sufficient sample size to develop and test microsatellites to investigate their genetic structure.
