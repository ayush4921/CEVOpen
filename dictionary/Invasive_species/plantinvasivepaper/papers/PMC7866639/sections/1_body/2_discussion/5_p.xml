<p id="Par40">By implementing SSR-GBAS, fine-scale ecological questions can be answered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], e.g. the small-scale genetic differences found within samples from France. Further, low genetic variation for the sample group of SRF, its putative point of origin, was observed according to the unbiased expected heterozygosity. Invaders typically show low genetic variation, as only fractions of the original gene pool were translocated within the founder specimen(s). Reduced heterozygosity and effective size of the gene pool result in genetic drift fostered by inter-mating of founding individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Nevertheless, organisms with haplo-diploid systems generally have the ability to overcome extreme bottlenecks. Within several hymenopterans, haploid unfertilised eggs develop to males and diploid fertilised eggs mostly into females. In the honey bee sex is determined by the 
 <italic>csd locus</italic> that is heterozygous in females and homozygous in males in what is described as single-locus complementary sex determination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In small groups, likewise founder populations, as a result of the decreased overall heterozygosity, diploid males are more common since diploid eggs are more likely to be homozygote for this locus and develop as males. Diploid male production was found to produce less viable and sterile males driving the population towards the edge of extinction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. However, studies have shown that these systems have the ability to overcome the genetic load by a balanced selection on the 
 <italic>csd</italic> locus, which acts as a coping strategy circumventing the extinction vortex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Besides a smaller effective population size and heterozygosity levels, males are under strong purging selection of exposed deleterious alleles. Therefore, even a small number of founder individuals in haplo-diploid organisms like 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> can successfully invade new areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Regardless, three out of four males sampled in Vienna in 2018 were found to be diploid (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1) indicating a high percentage of diploid males in the species at least in expanding or founding populations. During future investigations more specimens morphologically assigned as males will be included to investigate this context.
