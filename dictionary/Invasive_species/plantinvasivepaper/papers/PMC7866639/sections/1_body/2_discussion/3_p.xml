<p id="Par38">This theoretical framework is reflected in the location where 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> was first observed in Europe. Marseille constitutes an important maritime trading point in southern France. Ships for maritime trading were also most likely the vector delivering the species unintentionally to European islands, e.g. the most recent finding on Mallorca (Balearic island, Spain; ) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>M. disjunctiformis</italic> was found near an international trading hub (Interporto) near Bologna, Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This second invasive wild bee recognized in Europe presents very similar ecological requirements to 
 <italic>M. sculpturalis</italic> in sharing the same natural biogeography, East-Asia, and it is even a member of the same subgenus (
 <italic>Callomegachile</italic>). This supports the assumption that invaders are not random samples of the global species pool [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Marker development of the founder specimen of 
 <italic>M. disjunctiformis</italic> based on the method described is currently in progress.
