<p>The rapidly expanding transportation infrastructure can impact the environment both directly, as an immediate consequence of the presence of the infrastructure and its construction or indirectly, as a result of human activities that are facilitated by new infrastructure [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An analysis of the impacts of 33 planned and existing development corridors, including transportation infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa showed that ecosystems have been significantly impacted by increasing land-use pressure and encroachment that has in part been triggered by the infrastructure development [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other studies have established that transportation infrastructure leads to loss of ecosystem integrity through truncation of ecosystems into smaller, often isolated, patches that may not be able to maintain or sustain ecological processes in the long run [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such impacts include bisection of watersheds and basins; physical disturbance and disruption to the composition, structure and functioning of ecosystems, and movement, migration and survival of resident wildlife species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; direct mortality of wildlife through vehicle/train–wildlife collisions (V/TWC) [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and behavioural modification among diverse species in different ways [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, it is argued that transportation infrastructure contributes to soil, water and air pollution [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; alteration of natural processes including natural hydrology, fire regimes and competitor and predator-prey relationships among other impacts [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to Hulme [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Catford 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], transport infrastructure may act as migration corridors for the natural dispersal of non-native biodiversity by allowing their movement across physical and environmental barriers or by supplying suitable habitat for their expansion.
