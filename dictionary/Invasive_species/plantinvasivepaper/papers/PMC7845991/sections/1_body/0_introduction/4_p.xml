<p>Previous research on the ecological impacts of infrastructure has focused largely on roads where a considerable effort has been expended to quantify their effects particularly in Europe, North America and Australia [

Hence, less is known about the direct and indirect impact of railways on ecological communities and processes. Understanding the impacts of railways and the associated rail traffic is important as part of Kenyaâ€™s commitment to international initiatives for the protection of biological diversity, supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness of impact mitigation measures, and to support cumulative environmental assessment and transportation planning.
