<p>The SGR, by its linear form, cuts across watersheds and drainage basins thereby altering and modifying the local natural hydrological environment. The SGR contractors rerouted or concentrated surface runoff to the underpasses, inevitably increasing the volumes and speed of the flow. This has resulted in flooding, soil erosion, channel modification, and siltation of streams. A significant environmental impact in the SGR is soil erosion, sedimentation and resultant flooding. Indeed, clearing vegetation along and adjacent to the infrastructure can lead to soil erosion and sediment inputs to watercourses [

Furthermore, our study raises concern about the use of embankments to raise the SGR as this inevitably results in rerouting of surface runoff to avoid cutting through the earth embankments. These concerns challenge the conventional infrastructural engineering designs that rely on data and experiences from other areas. The SGR design, alignment and routing was based on existing designs and expertise from China. This approach can draw parallels with challenges around technological transfers that do not take into account local ecological and social context. Engaging with local communities and stakeholders can offer insights into local and ecologically sensitive designs with minimal impacts.
