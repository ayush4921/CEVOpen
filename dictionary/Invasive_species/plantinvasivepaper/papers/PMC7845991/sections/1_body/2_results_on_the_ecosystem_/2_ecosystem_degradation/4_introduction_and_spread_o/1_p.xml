<p>Participants from Voi reported that invasive plant species had recently emerged and were spreading rapidly along the SGR corridor. This, they observed “
 <italic>was a problem in both [Tsavo East-West] National Parks where the invasive cactus Opuntia stricta and Prosopis juliflora (known locally as Mathenge) was also prevalent along the new highway from Voi to Taveta”</italic>. However, we could not establish the connection between the spread of invasive plant species and the construction and operation of the SGR. Meanwhile, in some areas in Kajiado county, invasive plant species were regenerating after long periods of absence due to what locals observed as “
 <italic>disturbance through borrow pits and truck tracks taking soil to the SGR construction sites</italic>”. Although our study team made clear observations of the presence of these invasive plant species, we could not verify that they resulted from the construction and operation of the SGR. This was because there were no clear timelines or monitoring on the emergence and spread of these species linking them to the construction activities.
