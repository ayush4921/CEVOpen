<p>Destruction of the ecosystem due to the SGR and related activities was the least dominant issue of concern to our participants. The construction of the SGR together with the associated quarrying activities resulted in the removal of forest or vegetation cover, destruction of water sources such as rivers, wetlands, grasslands, and parts of protected areas Participants observed that activities along the SGR “
 <italic>modified or disturbed the natural ecosystems especially low-lying</italic>, 
 <italic>poorly drained land in areas around Kibwezi</italic>, 
 <italic>Mombasa ad Voi”</italic>. Of concern was the conversion of land [agricultural and grazing] to settlement and real estates. During a meeting in Kibwezi, the participants stated that they “
 <italic>had observed a number of changes in land use in the area</italic>, 
 <italic>mainly sub-division of land due to population pressure and development of the area through the railway and road network”</italic>. Whereas participants in Narok noted that 
 <italic>“real estate development was picking up in Suswa</italic>. 
 <italic>In addition</italic>, 
 <italic>land sales were high especially around the proposed [SGR] station in Suswa</italic>, 
 <italic>mainly in anticipation of the [Naivasha] dry port”</italic>. Our team observed that wetlands around Kitengela and Kiboko were blocked off and damaged, thereby affecting natural water flow (
