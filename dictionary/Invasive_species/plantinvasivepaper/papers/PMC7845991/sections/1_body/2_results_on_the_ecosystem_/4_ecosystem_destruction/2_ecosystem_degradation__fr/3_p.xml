<p>Although little scientific research has been conducted on the changing nature of wildlife behaviour and railways, especially in Africa, we found that elephants had displayed early signs of behavioural modification in response to the activities around and within the SGR corridor particularly around Tsavo in Voi. These are consistent with behavioural adaptations observed among other species including shifting their home ranges or altering their movement patterns away from areas with high infrastructure densities (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Barnes 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that elephants (
 <italic>Loxodonta africana</italic>) in north-eastern Gabon preferred sites away from both roads and villages. However, this does not hold true for all species, for example, Coleman and Fraser [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported that black vultures (
 <italic>Coragyps atratus</italic>) and turkey vultures (
 <italic>Cathartes aura</italic>) preferred home ranges in areas with greater road densities perhaps due to availability of food. The ability of stakeholders to articulate these provides a key signal towards systematic monitoring of such changes by railway ecologists in Kenya.
