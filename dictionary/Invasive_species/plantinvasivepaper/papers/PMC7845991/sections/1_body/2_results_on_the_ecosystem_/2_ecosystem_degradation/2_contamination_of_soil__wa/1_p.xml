<p>Participants in most of the meetings identified issues around soil, water and air contamination during construction and operation of the SGR. Expected impacts of the SGR included population growth through migration, shifts in land use and land tenure and the emergence of illegal activities such as illegal grazing in protected areas. Officials of the Kenya Wildlife Service observed that “
 <italic>local communities [were] using the underpasses to pass their livestock through to Tsavo National Park particularly around Buchuma gate”</italic>. The livestock incursions they observed “
 <italic>resulted in serious soil degradation in the southern part of Tsavo East”</italic>. Other concerns included oil spills as observed by local officials in Kibwezi County “
 <italic>pollution of the Thange river [though oil spill of 2015 and a recent one in May 2019 around Machakos that contaminated Athi River] has had a great impact on the community given that it provides water for cultivation which is the main economic activity in the area</italic>. 
 <italic>Since the oil spill incident</italic>, 
 <italic>the use of the [Thange] river for irrigation</italic>, 
 <italic>livestock watering</italic>, 
 <italic>and domestic purposes have been suspended and the land in the affected area is still unsafe for cultivation”</italic>.
