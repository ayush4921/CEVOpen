  <title>Dataset 1. Rosa rubiginosa L. occurrence data (occurrences_R.rubiginosa.csv, 416 kb)</title>
  <p>Presence points of R. rubiginosa in its native (N=12132) and invasive (N=1425) range derived from the literature and field data. Geographical positions are given in decimal degrees (longitude, latitude, WGS84). For the final MAXENT model we included a randomly reduced native dataset (3033 presence points) until data points were evenly distributed and no spatial autocorrelation was detected in the model residuals.</p>
