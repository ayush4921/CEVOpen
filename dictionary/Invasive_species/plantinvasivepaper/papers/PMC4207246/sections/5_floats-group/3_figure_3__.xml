  <title>Invasive 
   <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> populations in Argentina (a, b) and native populations in Germany 
   <bold>(c)</bold> and Spain (d).

  <p>In parts of Argentina, single disturbance events have offered windows of opportunity for the species to establish populations, some of which have remained undisturbed for 30 years or longer ( 
   <bold>a</bold>)

   </sup>. The low level of human landscape maintenance means that populations can expand over vast areas and consist of hundreds of individuals ( 
   <bold>a</bold>, here along the whole visible lakeside in Patagonia). ( 
   <bold>a</bold>) For our study area in Patagonia we predicted that 36% of the area (5000 km 
   <sup>2</sup>) was threatened by 
   <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> invasion, across a precipitation gradient from 1400 mm/annum (mountains in the far background) to 600 mm/a 
   <sup>

   </sup>. In Argentina 
   <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> shrubs have time to grow to their full size ( 
   <bold>b</bold>), by contrast, many native landscapes are regularly maintained; shrubs are regularly trimmed and mostly grow in hedgerows ( 
   <bold>c</bold>, Germany). Furthermore, in Germany and Spain, fewer habitats are available in landscapes dominated by agriculture and urban areas ( 
   <bold>d</bold>, Spain).
