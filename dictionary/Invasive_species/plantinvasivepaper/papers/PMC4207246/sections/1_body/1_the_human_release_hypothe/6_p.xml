<p>In parallel to the Enemy Release Hypothesis, here, we propose the Human Release Hypothesis. It describes a situation where alien species have escaped relatively higher levels of human landscape maintenance that is characteristic within their native ranges. Changing patterns of land use are widely recognized to increase opportunities for introduced species to establish and spread 
 <sup>

 </sup>, but already prevailing patterns of land use intensity also should be expected to influence the populations of species – both in their native and introduced ranges. This is because highly intensive land use by humans (such as in many parts of Western Europe) often corresponds to high levels of active landscape maintenance – which translates into little available habitat for both native and introduced species, as well as high levels of active weed control. At the other end of the spectrum of human land use intensity, we hypothesize that pristine natural habitats also offer few windows of opportunity for alien species to establish (the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis) 
 <sup>

 </sup>. Thus, we hypothesize that the abundance of invasive species should be highest in between these two extremes – namely in extensively used landscapes characterized by frequent fallowing, low levels of weed control, high heterogeneity, and many disturbed edges of small farmland patches

 </sup>. Such landscapes are where “human release” should contribute to optimal conditions for invasive species to establish large populations.
