 <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> has successfully invaded a range of ecosystems within Argentina (e.g. high montane grasslands, Patagonian steppe, pastures, road margins, floodplains), covering a major climatic gradient, but exhibiting low levels of genetic diversity

 </sup> ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>). Low genetic diversity suggests that multiple introduction events constituting particularly high propagule pressure cannot explain the species' invasion success. Despite lower genetic diversity, populations of 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> are considerably smaller in Spain and Germany than in Argentina ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) â€“ native populations consist of 5 to 20 individuals whereas invasive populations consist of hundreds of individuals

 </sup>. In addition to propagule pressure, abiotic and biotic variables also cannot fully explain the invasion success of 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic>. In Argentina, the species neither benefits from favourable soil conditions nor from reduced biotic resistance
