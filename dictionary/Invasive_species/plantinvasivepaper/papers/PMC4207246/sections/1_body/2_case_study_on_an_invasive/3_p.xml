<p>Moreover, a global climatic analysis shows that 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> also does not depend or benefit from pre-adaptation to the climate of its new environment ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>). We developed two climatic envelope models based on BioClim parameters and the occurrence of native and invasive populations respectively using the maximum entropy method

 </sup> (MAXENT, see Appendix 1 and 2 in the 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="sm">Supplementary material</xref>). We detected a significant differentiation of realized niches between invasive and native populations based on the MAXENT model (Schoenerâ€™s D=0.31, p&lt;0.0001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>) as well as through a direct ordination approach 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
 </sup> (Appendix S1, Supplementary Figure S4 in 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="sm">Supplementary material</xref>). Furthermore, back-projection of the climatic niche based on invasive populations points to a southern European origin. However, genetic analyses tracked the native origin of invasive Argentinean, Chilean, Australian and New Zealand populations to Central Europe

  <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 </sup>. Key climatic predictors therefore do not point to a climatic advantage in the invasive range, because the native genotypes were not from the climate they invaded in the alien range, but instead indicate that 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> is able to thrive under a wide range of conditions (Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Figure S3).
