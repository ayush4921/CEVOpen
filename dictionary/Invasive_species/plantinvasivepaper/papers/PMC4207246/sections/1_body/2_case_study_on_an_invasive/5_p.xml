<p>Having considered a wide range of existing hypotheses ( 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), we found that additional insights into the invasion patterns of 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> may be gained by the Human Release Hypothesis. This is because a key difference between native and introduced environments appears to be the level of active landscape maintenance. In the case study, we observed frequent trimming or removal of individuals only in Spain and Germany and not in Argentina, and individuals and populations in Argentina were significantly older than their native counterparts

 </sup>. At the global scale, our analysis revealed a similar pattern (albeit at a coarser resolution; 2.5 Ã— 2.5 arc min, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c</xref>). Native 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> populations occur in areas with higher proportions of cropland, residential areas and human population densities than invasive populations ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c</xref>). These conditions very likely correspond to a high degree of landscape maintenance, and hence little available habitat for 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> in its native range. Our results at this coarse scale could also provide some explanation why, more generally, Eurasian species show less niche unfilling and more expansion in North America and Australia than do North American species in Eurasia

 </sup>. In addition to human mediated propagule pressure from Eurasia to North America and Australia, and a longer history of weed selection in human-disturbed landscapes in Eurasia
