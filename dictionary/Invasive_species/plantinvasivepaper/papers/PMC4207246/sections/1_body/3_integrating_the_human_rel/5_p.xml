<p>Evidently, the Human Release Hypothesis is still in its infancy, and it would be unwise to make bold management recommendations on its basis. Based on our analysis to date, preliminary insights that are relevant to managing invasive species are: (i) sparsely populated areas may face a higher risk of biological invasions than more densely populated areas; (ii) extensively managed rangelands may be more susceptible to high abundances of invasive species than intensively managed croplands; and (iii) high abundances of invasive species at landscape and regional scales could be facilitated by long periods of fallowing or land abandonment
