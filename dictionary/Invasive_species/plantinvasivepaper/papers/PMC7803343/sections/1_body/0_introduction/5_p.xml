<p>Consequently, optimization-based surveillance planning has emerged as a sub-discipline of invasive species post-border response. Modern optimization techniques facilitate surveillance planning that accounts for the biology and behavior of an invader while comparing multiple scenarios to identify the most cost-effective options. Indeed, improvements in computational methods and resources have made it possible to find optimal solutions using complex models with varied formulations and objectives. In the next section of this review, we outline some recent advances in the application of optimization models for post-border surveillance planning. In subsequent sections, we consider the extent to which current optimization approaches capture the many real-world limitations faced by survey managers in the field. We also describe an example of optimization for a multi-day surveillance campaign that incorporates an array of practical constraints.</p>
