<p>Regardless, a well-devised, risk-based strategy is crucial for post-border surveillance aimed at reliable and timely detection. Risk-based strategies account for variability between potentially invaded locations in terms of a number of relevant criteria, including environmental suitability (e.g. climatic conditions), host availability and the predicted geographic distribution of the invading species [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Typically, knowledge about these risk criteria is uncertain, especially for newly recorded and therefore poorly understood invasive species [
