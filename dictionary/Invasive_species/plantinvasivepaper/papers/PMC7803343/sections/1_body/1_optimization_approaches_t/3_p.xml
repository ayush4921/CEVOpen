<p>Recently, optimal surveillance models have incorporated statistical quality control methods to account for possible deleterious outcomes of surveillance failures. For example, acceptance sampling [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] is used in manufacturing quality control as a way to inspect large quantities of products quickly despite limited inspection resources. The basic concept is to accept or reject an entire lot (i.e. a group of items) based on findings from a sample of items in the lot; a lot is accepted only if the number of defective items in the sample remains below a defined acceptance threshold. For invasive species surveillance, this threshold can be interpreted as an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect an invader [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Previously, the approach was adapted for optimal inspection of live plant imports to prevent invasive species introductions [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] utilized acceptance sampling to compare optimal survey schemes for the emerald ash borer (

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] used the approach when evaluating the effectiveness of a management strategy that combined surveillance with optional removal of host trees conditional on detection, thus minimizing the pest's ability to spread to uninvaded sites.
