<p>In multi-day surveillance planning, many of the key logistical considerations depend on the configuration of the transportation network that enables access to potential survey sites in the area of interest. In geographic transportation networks, such as urban and suburban road networks, optimal planning of survey visits can be achieved with route optimization approaches. Examples of optimal routing problems include the multiple tour maximum collection problem [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The team orienteering problem attempts to find the shortest possible (or least expensive) path between a set of selected sites, with the constraint that not all sites can be visited within the available time [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Another constraint is that the start and end points of the path are known and consistent day-to-day (e.g. the headquarters for a survey crew). Further practical constraints can also be integrated into the problem formulation, as illustrated below.
