  <title>Conceptual example of optimal routing for a multi-day surveillance campaign.</title>
  <p>The area of interest is represented by a network of nodes (potential survey sites) interconnected by arcs. Each day, the survey crew leaves the main facility and follows a route that takes them to a set of survey sites before returning to the facility at the end of the day. Daily route scheduling must account for several practical factors, including site visit times and travel times between them, as well as any site access limitations. All activities must take place within the specified working day length.</p>
