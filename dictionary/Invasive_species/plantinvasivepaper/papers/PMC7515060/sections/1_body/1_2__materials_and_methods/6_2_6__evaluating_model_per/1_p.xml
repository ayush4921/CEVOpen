<p>The overall model performance was determined based on two statistics, the threshold-independent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) [
 <xref rid="B81-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and the threshold-dependent true skill statistic (TSS) [
 <xref rid="B83-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Model performance was considered as ‘good’ only if both measures were satisfied. The suitable area for individual species was determined by a binary threshold value which discriminates presences (suitable) and absences (not suitable) in grid cells. An ideal threshold determining approach should comply with bigger sensitivity and specificity values meaning smaller false negatives rate and false positives rate in turn in the evaluation data set [
 <xref rid="B84-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity approach which satisfies the 3 main threshold selection criteria (objectivity, equality and discriminability) has been recommended for models that use presence-only data and background or pseudo-absence data (i.e., MaxEnt) [

 <xref rid="B86-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. This threshold has been previously used in several modeling studies to discriminate the suitable areas of invasive species [

 <xref rid="B87-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The relative importance of predictor variables to the individual IAPS models was analyzed using variable contribution table and jackknife test [
