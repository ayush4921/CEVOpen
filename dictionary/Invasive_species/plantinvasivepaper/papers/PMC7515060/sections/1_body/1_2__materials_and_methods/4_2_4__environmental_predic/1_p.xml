<p>We decided to undertake modeling exclusively on climate data due to the following reasons (i) climate provides good prediction over the distribution of invasive species and most other variables (i.e., elevation) are proxy variables for climate; (ii) studies have successfully verified a similarity between the climatic conditions of the ecological habitat and the pattern of spread of invasive species [

 <xref rid="B63-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; and iii) categorical variables are less compatible with continuous variables in MaxEnt model [
