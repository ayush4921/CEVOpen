<p>The low climate suitability class (1–2 IAPS) is predicted to shift inward under both scenarios in the future. This may be mainly by some expanding ranges of some IAPS or by new species colonization. The very low climate suitability (area free from IAPS invasion) is mainly distributed in the North-central and Eastern parts of the country under current climate (
