<p>Overall, the total area represented by moderate, high and very high classes (&gt;3 IAPS), which is about 33% of the area of the country, is predicted to increase by 45% and 58% under RCP 4.5 for 2050 and 2070 respectively; under RCP 8.5, these figures are as high as 90% and 121% respectively. Similarly, the total area represented by very low and low classes (&lt;2 IAPS) which is about 67% of the area of the country, is predicted to decrease by 22% and 28% under RCP 4.5 and 44% and 59% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070 respectively. Both these total area changes, high suitability increase and low suitability decrease, signify the potentially increased risk of IAPS invasion in Sri Lanka in the future under projected climate change. The projected maps forecast a region of potential IAPS concentration in the west and south Sri Lanka. Most of those areas coincide with the lowland wet zone of the country where precipitation is relatively high and high level of biodiversity is concentrated. Therefore, the anticipated impacts of the projected changes on native biodiversity could be considerable. Similarly, a study by [

However, literature shows that hotspots of invasive and the vulnerable native species can vary at different spatial scales [
