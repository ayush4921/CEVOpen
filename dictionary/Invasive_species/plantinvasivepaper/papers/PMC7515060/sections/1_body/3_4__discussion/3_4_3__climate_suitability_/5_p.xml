<p>Potential threats from IAPS that the oceanic islands will face in the future differ markedly with climate change [

 <xref rid="B106-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Thus, it is vital to know in which areas large numbers of IAPS can inhabit for directing limited resources [

 <xref rid="B71-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Therefore, defining areas suitable for multiple IAPS establishment based on climate-based niche modeling can be considered as an increasingly important risk area prioritization approach in conservation planning. The climate suitability maps are powerful tools for policy makers and land managers to design suitable cost-effective strategies to control and manage IAPS. Projected maps clearly show exact locations across the landscape where urgent attention should be focused on. Such information is crucial to implement effective and successful control and management efforts. These results provide an invaluable insight into the climate suitability for multiple IAPS establishment in Sri Lanka.
