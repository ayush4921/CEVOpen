<p>Warming of the earth’s surface has increased significantly and it will continue to warm. The global mean surface temperature will increase significantly by the end of this century (2081–2100) compared to the current period (1986–2005) under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios [

 <xref rid="B25-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As the key determinant of species distribution, climate controls the geographical distribution of plants predominantly over the other non-climatic factors [
 <xref rid="B26-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Climate models based on the bioclimate envelope rely on climatic variables and do not consider the non-climatic variables (i.e., soil type) [
 <xref rid="B27-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the contribution of ecologically meaningful non-climatic variables (i.e., soil, elevation, and slope) and biotic factors (i.e., competition, predation, and pollination) has been frequently discussed in predictive modeling literature [
