<p>We examined the climatic suitability for multiple IAPS establishment and potential invasion dynamics in tropical island settings under climate change using Sri Lanka as an example. Like many tropical islands, Sri Lanka is rich in biodiversity with high conservation values which is at risk by plant invaders. The aims of present study were to (i) identify the potential climate suitability for multiple IAPS establishment under the current climate; (ii) predict potential changes by 2050 and 2070 under two climate change scenarios; (iii) classify climate suitability of the country and examine potential invasion dynamics under climate change. We modeled 14 IAPS which are at different stages of invasion using MaxEnt niche model. More specifically we identified the areas susceptible to multiple IAPS establishment and how will this susceptibility change under the projected climate change. Our study is significant due to two important reasons. Firstly, this study focused on the multi-species projection which had been the focus of a limited number of modeling studies. Secondly, hitherto no comprehensive study has been done to forecast the potential distribution of IAPS under projected climate change in tropical island countries in the region with similar bioclimatic conditions. Defining climatic suitability for multiple IAPS invasion is important for their successful control and management. </p>
