<p>Species invasion has been recognized as an agent of global change that has the potential to make large impacts on biodiversity and associated ecological processes [
 <xref rid="B1-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is considered as a serious threat to biodiversity, second only to habitat fragmentation and degradation [
 <xref rid="B2-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Invasive species can have interactions with other drivers of global change and make complex and combined effects [
 <xref rid="B3-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The threat will be intensified in the future allowing more than 17% of lands vulnerable to species invasion globally [
 <xref rid="B4-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The species diversity on Earth is diminishing due to the introduction of invasive species to new ranges, which is increasing and already beyond the accepted level [
 <xref rid="B5-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is a common problem everywhere in the world, continents, oceanic islands, temperate and tropical regions [
 <xref rid="B6-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The problem is severe in oceanic islands where the species and ecosystems are unique and vulnerable to external impacts [
 <xref rid="B7-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, species invasions can have negative impacts across several sectors other than biodiversity, such as agriculture, tourism, forestry, fishery, human health, water and irrigation. The ultimate impacts can be interconnected [
 <xref rid="B9-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], resulting in an utmost threat to the economy, social and environmental stability and sustainability of the planet [
