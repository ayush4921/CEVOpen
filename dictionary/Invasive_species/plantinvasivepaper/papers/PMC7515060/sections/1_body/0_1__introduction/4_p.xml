<p>Scientists believe that global warming and associated observed changes (i.e., sea level rise, floods, saltwater intrusion) are undeniable and can make a significant impact on life on earth, the sustainability of biodiversity and ecosystem processes [

 <xref rid="B23-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] medium to high emission scenarios can cause sudden, high impact, irreversible damages to the ecosystem composition, structure and function. Global climate change influences the spatial distribution of many plants in the geographic space [
