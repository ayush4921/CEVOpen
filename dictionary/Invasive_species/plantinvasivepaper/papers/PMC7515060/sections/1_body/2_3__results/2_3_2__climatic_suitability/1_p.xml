<p>Under the current climate, both 
 <italic>P. maximum</italic> and 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> predicted the largest areas of 22,205 km
 <sup>2</sup> and 18,851 km
 <sup>2</sup> respectively. The species that was predicted to occupy the least area (471 km
 <sup>2</sup>) of suitability was 
 <italic>U. europaeus</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-entropy-21-00571">Supplementary material S4</xref>). Seven IAPS, namely 
 <italic>A. macrophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>A. glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>D. suffruticosa</italic>, 
 <italic>L. leucocephala</italic>, 
 <italic>M. pigra</italic>, 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. histerophorus</italic> are projected to increase the overall climatic suitability in the future while the other seven IAPS, 
 <italic>A. inulifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic>, 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>, 
 <italic>P. maximum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>U. europaeus</italic>, are projected to decrease. By 2050, all evaluated species are projected to change their respective suitability areas by more than 10% compared to the current climate under both scenarios, irrespective of whether it was a range expansion or a contraction. Five IAPS, 
 <italic>A. glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>L. leucocephala</italic>, 
 <italic>M. pigra</italic>, 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. histerophorus</italic>, are projected to expand the range significantly in the future under both RCP scenarios. This expansion can be up to several fold by 2070 under RCP 8.5 compared to the present; for instance, 
 <italic>P. histerophorus</italic> (581%), 
 <italic>M. pigra</italic> (465%) and 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> (440%). By 2070 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> is projected to loss overall suitability by 56% and 52% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 respectively compared to the current climate. Similarly, 
 <italic>P. maximum</italic> is also projected to contract suitability by 35% and 90% under the above RCPs. It should be noted that by 2050 
 <italic>U. europaeus</italic> is projected to decrease its overall suitability by 100% compared to the current climate under both emission scenarios.
