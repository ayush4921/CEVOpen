<p>The south and west parts of the country exhibited relatively high climate suitability for multiple IAPS establishment in the current climate and this region is predicted to remain in the future too. Similarly, the areas relatively free from IAPS, particularly north-central and south-eastern parts of Sri Lanka are predicted to increase suitability for IAPS. This implies that a vigilant surveillance system needs to be in place in these areas to obstruct pathways of introduction of new IAPS. Potential short-term and long-term impacts on native biodiversity and agriculture in these areas need to be realized for prior and timely actions. As in many modeling studies, our study also shows some limitations due to uncertainty generated by GCMs, SDMs and RCPs. Therefore, we endorse the importance of testing models through multiple SDMs, GCMs, and RCPs to better understand and quantify uncertainties caused by them and recognize the best approach to achieve a specific objective. We also recommend considering all potentially important predictors in model building and avoiding imperfect detection as far as possible, to improve the predictive performance of models. Possible implications that may arise due to these methodological deficits should be considered in decision-making. Therefore, additional effort is needed to minimize uncertainties for the reason that information is lacking or the underlying modeling processes are not fully understood. However, present results provide insight into the relative magnitude of the problem and an outline upon which surveillance, monitoring and control efforts should be focused on. Our findings specify areas of high climatic suitability for large numbers of IAPS and thus locations across the country where early detection and rapid response efforts need to be concentrated on. Therefore, we strongly recommend land managers to use this critical information to develop strategic control plans to combat these IAPS in Sri Lanka.</p>
