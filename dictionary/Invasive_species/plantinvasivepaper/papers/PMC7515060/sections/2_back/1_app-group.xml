S2: Evaluation of model performances of 14 priority IAPS in Sri Lanka. S3: The three most highly contributed environmental variables to the MaxEnt model of 14 priority IAPS in Sri Lanka. S4: The potential distribution of Individual IAPS in the current climate and under MIROC5 RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. S5: Projected area of suitability (km
   <sup>2</sup>) of the 5 classes of IAPS in Sri Lanka under current climate and MIROC5 RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. Percentage changes are given relevant to current climate (percentage changes given within brackets are relevant to 2050).
