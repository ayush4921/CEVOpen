<p id="para0015">One patient died prior to candidaemia notification. Time to blood culture positivity may be delayed, particularly for non-albicans candidaemias (
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and delay in treatment is known to increase mortality (
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), therefore, non-culture-based diagnostics such as galactomannan antigen and BDG should be combine with clinical data to aid diagnosis (
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). 54.4% (n=6) of the patients were tested for BDG, and of those, 50% (n=3) were positive. Although not possible to demonstrate in this patient cohort, an early positive BDG may herald invasive fungal infection, enabling timely initiation of empirical antifungal therapy.
