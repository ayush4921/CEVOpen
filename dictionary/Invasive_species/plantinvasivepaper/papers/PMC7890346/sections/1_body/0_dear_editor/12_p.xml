<p id="para0013">Secondly, intravascular catheters are a well-recognised risk factor for candidaemia (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and over 90% of our patients had these. The incidence of candidaemia observed warrants further consideration, and whilst not compared to pre-COVID-19 incidence (
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), may potentially reflect pandemic unique challenges. Examples include increased ICU capacity, redeployment of less-experienced staff to ICU, challenges to aseptic technique with personal protective equipment (PPE), and patients requiring re-positioning to improve oxygenation, thus increasing possibility of line displacement/contamination. Improved aseptic intravascular catheter training focusing on PPE may be beneficial.
