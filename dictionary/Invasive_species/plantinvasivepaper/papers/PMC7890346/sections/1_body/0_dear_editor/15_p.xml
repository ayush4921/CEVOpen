<p id="para0016">Guidelines for management of candidaemia recommend a care bundle, including repeat blood cultures at 48 hours, echocardiogram, and fundoscopy to identify disseminated infection. In our cohort, only 54.5 % (6/11) of patients had repeat blood cultures within 48 hours, 72.7 % (8/11) an echocardiogram and only 9.1% (1/11) fundoscopy. COVID-19 infection control concerns, patient positioning and PPE, with resultant challenges to ophthalmic examination, may account for the poor fundoscopy compliance, adding further weight to the need for COVID-19 specific practical training.</p>
