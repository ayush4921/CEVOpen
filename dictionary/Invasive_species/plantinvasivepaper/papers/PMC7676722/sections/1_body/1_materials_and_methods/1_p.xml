<p>This study was carried out in Hebei and Liaoning Provinces in the summer (August and September) of 2018 using an ecological line transects method [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Three locations were selected in Hebei, i.e Yangyuan (40° 12′ 749″ N, 114° 39′ 920″ 
 <italic>E</italic>), Huailai (40° 22′ 411′′ N, 115° 31′ 581′′ 
 <italic>E</italic>), and Zhangjiakou (40° 51′ 290′′ N, 114° 51′ 378′′ 
 <italic>E</italic>) and one location was selected in Liaoning, i.e., Fushun (41° 51′ 279′′ N, 123° 49′ 126′′ 
 <italic>E</italic>). The precipitation is higher but monthly mean temperatures are lower in Fushun than in Zhangjiakou, Huailai and Yangyuan (S1 Fig in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228476.s001">S1 File</xref>). In each location, 10 places were selected (10 replicates per location); and at each place, three pairs of invaded and non-invaded quadrats (100 * 100 cm) were setup (3 replicates per place). The 10 spaces in each location were at least 20 km apart from each other [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In order to diminish potential confounding effects of habitat heterogeneity on comparisons between invaded and non-invaded quadrats (i.e., the effects of the invader), the quadrats with and without

 <italic>strumarium</italic> were less than 2 m apart in each pair, and the quadrats in different pair were spaced at least 5 m [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228476.s001">S1 File</xref>). The averages of monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures (Max. T and Mini. T, respectively), monthly mean precipitation (

 <italic>RH</italic>) was collected from data base of
