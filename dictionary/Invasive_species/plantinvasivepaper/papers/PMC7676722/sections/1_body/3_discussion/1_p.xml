 <italic>strumarium</italic> affected directly with native plant species in its invaded quadrats. In Huailai, there was significant (

The decreased value of Shannon’s Diversity Index in invaded plot over non-invaded provided a clear indication that native plant species were less diversified due to 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion. In the non-invaded plots, the competition mechanism among native plants was significantly higher than invaded plots. The high Margalef's Richness Index in non-invaded found heterogeneous nature of plant communities. The native plant abundance reduced significantly (

 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study 24 vs. 19 plant individuals present in all non-invaded vs. invaded quadrats are in line with the researchers who reported 70 vs. 31 plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Margalef’s Richness Index and Shannon’s Diversity Index significantly (

 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A significant (

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion mechanism found diversified in the community at Huailai recorded Simpson’s Diversity index (0.74) compared to all other locations. More Shannon Entropy was recorded by 
 <italic>Setaria feberi</italic> (0.87) found with high evenness (0.37) recorded more diversified and stable in the community in its non-invaded quadrats at Zhangjiakou. Similar results were recorded with high diversity of 
 <italic>Seteria feberi</italic> (0.47) and 
 <italic>Seteria viridis</italic> (0.43) in its non-invaded quadrats at Fushun. Total number of individuals recorded in ten Invaded quadrats (169) compared to non-invaded (457) found strong positive significant correlation (

 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion mechanism in Huailai. There is a positive relationship of Shannon Entropy with species diversity and evenness, however, species evenness increased with the increase of species diversity and Shannon Entropy. Shannon Entropy showed that different plant species in a community had a relative abundance and diverse in a community. These results are in line with the researchers who gave similar recommendations in their experiments [

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion affected on species richness in invaded quadrat resulted to reduce Shannon’s diversity index significantly (

 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The native plant species abundance decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) up to 55.71% due to

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion. The researchers reported that twenty four families were recorded in non-invaded plots compared to fifteen in

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invaded areas. However,

 <italic>strumarium</italic> categorized as one of the dominant invasive alien plant that reduced native species and composition of various plant species in invaded communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The findings of our analysis are also consistent with the researchers who investigated strong impact of invaded species on native populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The diversity indices reduced in invaded plots compared to non-invaded supported our hypotheses that 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> competed with native plant species because of their high phenotypic plasticity in the environment. These results are consistent with researchers who reported that 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> showed its toxic effect on native plant populations in ecosystem [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A large canopy and tap root system of 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> showed substantial impact on native plant communities, but its population abundance threatens native plant communities seriously. Invaded quadrats were found maximum uniformity and good competitor in ecosystem process. The plant invasions recorded serious influence on vegetation size and composition by interfering with biotic interactions in abiotic networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Maximum families (Asteraceae, Poaceae and Apocynaceae) found in our study during survey at different locations; however these three families have maximum tendency to flourish in an ecosystem (S2 Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228476.s001">S1 File</xref>). Invasive species are characterized by their large, persistent, elastic, rapid growth, their ability to travel through vast areas and their rich reproduction allowed them to compete with indigenous plant species [

 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The scientists recorded that the

 <italic>strumarium</italic> was the most aggressive alien-invasive plant in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In invaded and non-invaded squares, researchers previously conducted paired comparative study which indicated that invaded plant species were competed and affected on native plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The hypotheses are true that invasive alien plant can compete in a population with native plant species. These findings were consistent with researchers in their experiments who identified heterogeneous plant populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Maximum dissimilarity or beta diversity was recorded in Huailai (87.06%) followed by Yangyuan (44.43%), Zhangjiakou (40.13%), and Fushun (29.02%). 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> influenced on species abundance in this study which was consistent with the researchers who identified Jaccard's similarity indices between invaded and non-invaded ranges that suggested loss of approximately 38.40% of plant species due to the 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasions resulted in a 61.60% dissimilarity index [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) maximum global test for sample statistics 
 <italic>R</italic> values were reported in Huailai (0.943/94.3%) followed by Zhangjiakou, Yangyuan and Fushun, where similarities were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance taking 999 number of permutations. The higher value of global statistics 
 <italic>R</italic> suggested that there was a greater impact of species diversity on the variables studied. Yangyuan, Huailai, and Zhangjiakou areas were affected significantly by 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasions. The lowest invasion was found in Fushun due to the high dissimilarity or beta diversity in invaded and non-invaded plots. Strong negative and significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) relationship (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.741/74.1%, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) found between 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> and species richness. These results are consistent with the scientists who stated that the regression equation and the Pearson correlation (-0.861) suggested the presence of negative linear relationship between 
 <italic>X</italic>.
