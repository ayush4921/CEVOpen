 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], The invasive plant 
 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> L. competes with native plant species for soil nutrients, moisture, “shelter”, “light”, and other resources, severely influencing natural vegetations [
 <xref rid="pone.0228476.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The invasive plant is monoecious and annual herb of Asteraceae family, with broad leaves and tap-roots [
