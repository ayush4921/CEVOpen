 <italic>strumarium</italic> has become a major concern in China, posing severe problems on the rangeland biodiversity, agriculture lands, parks, banks of river, and lakes, dams, roadsides, and even in urban areas, with great economic and ecological consequences. This plant is a severe threat to agriculture field crops such as soybeans, cotton, maize, sunflower and groundnuts in many parts of the world along with China [
