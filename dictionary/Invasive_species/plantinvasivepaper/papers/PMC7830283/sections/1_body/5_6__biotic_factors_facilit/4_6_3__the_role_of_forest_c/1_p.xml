<p>The conditions of a forest, such as biological diversity, host tree density, pathogen inoculum potential, stand history, resistance and resilience to disturbances and sustainable productivity, are also important factors determining the extent to which 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> pathogens can colonize a forested landscape. Forests with high plant species diversity are more tolerant to 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infection, which is even more important as they limit the colonization and spread of pathogens [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The virgin forests are rather occupied by the saprotrophic 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B108-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Once 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> colonized the young trees at the edge of a ponderosa pine park, new plantation areas with uniform tree species, the fungus spread rapidly possibly through root contacts, resulting in further infection centre enlargement [
