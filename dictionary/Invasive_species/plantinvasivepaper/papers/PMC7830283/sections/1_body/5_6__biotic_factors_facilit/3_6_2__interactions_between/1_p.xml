 <xref rid="pathogens-10-00076-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most of the reports about 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic>-insect co-occurrence presumed that defoliating insects (e.g., gypsy moth, maple webworm, eastern spruce budworm, saddled prominent caterpillar) predispose their hosts to 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infection, and suggest that defoliating insect damage weakens the trees and increases their susceptibility to armillarioid root rot. This was experimentally supported by Wargo and Houston [
 <xref rid="B235-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>], who inoculated sugar maple trees, defoliated artificially, or naturally by larvae of the saddled prominent caterpillar, with an isolate of 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic>, and found that successful invasion of the root systems depended on stress from defoliation. In the case of root collar weevils (e.g., 
 <italic>Hylobius warreni</italic>, 
 <italic>H. pinicola</italic>) it was proposed that feeding wounds made by these weevils may be important infection courts for armillarioids [
 <xref rid="B227-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. A different successional relationship of the co-occurring insect pest and armillarioid root rot pathogen is characteristic for another group of insects including bark beetles (e.g., eight-toothed European spruce bark beetle, fir engraver, western balsam bark beetle), where the armillarioid infection precedes, and also seems to predispose insect damage (
 <xref rid="pathogens-10-00076-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The observations from lodgepole pine stands growing in Wasatch National Forest of Utah, in the Western USA revealed that many trees attacked by endemic mountain pine beetle (
 <italic>Dendroctonus ponderosae</italic>) population had roots with 
 <italic>A. mellea sensu lato</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="B229-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. Kulhavy et al. [
 <xref rid="B228-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] postulated a hypothetical sequence of western white pine invasion by blister rust caused by 
 <italic>Cronartium ribicola</italic>, followed by infection of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> root rot, and finally the attack of the bark beetles 
 <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fossifrons</italic>. Sierota and Grodzki [
 <xref rid="B236-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>] proposed a hypothetical fungal survival strategy for 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic>: Norway spruce trees are first stressed by soil drought and the disappearance of mycorrhizas, making them susceptible to necrotrophic 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> attack, which results in the release of volatile compounds from resin and phloem attracting engraver beetles (
 <italic>I. typographus</italic>). The subsequent beetle invasion kills the tree and provides a substrate source for the saprotrophic stage of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B236-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. The results of an early study by Madziara-Borusiewicz and Strzelecka [
 <xref rid="B217-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>] seem to back up this hypothesis: The authors found that increased volatile oil amounts of changed chemical composition were produced in spruce needles during the initial phase of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> colonization, which was then followed by 
 <italic>Ips</italic> invasion. Among the detected volatile oils, myrtenol is known as one of the main components of attractants and aggregation pheromones of certain bark beetles, suggesting that attraction of engraver beetles by the tree may be connected with the production of host volatiles affected by 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> [
