<p>Tree species composition, maturity and provenance also play essential roles in the widespread distribution of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> pathogens, that are common in the soil of forest area, and no woody plant has complete immunity to infection. However, it has been strongly suggested that seedlings from natural regeneration are less susceptible to 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infection than the planted seedlings [
 <xref rid="B237-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. The rate of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic>-induced decay was generally lower in angiosperm than gymnosperm wood types [
 <xref rid="B238-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. Conifers with rapid early growth after planting had the most significant mortality closely associated with how quickly primary inoculum of 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> transferred to surrounding trees [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conifer seedlings of interior Douglas-fir originated from biologically and physically different environments were screened by Cruickshank et al. [
 <xref rid="B239-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. Seedlings originated from warmer and drier places showed lower susceptibility to 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> infection, reflected from the ability to limit the spread of the pathogens in the root system. Both tolerance and resistance of the interior Douglas-fir were detected on the seedlings challenged with 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic>. Tolerant juvenile trees displayed better growth compared with the resistant group, whereas resistant juvenile trees showed less root collar girdling [
 <xref rid="B240-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. Investigation of the difference in susceptibility between oak species to 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> revealed that holm oak (
 <italic>Quercus ilex</italic>) seedlings were most susceptible and Turkey oak (
 <italic>Q. cerris</italic>), Macedonian oak (
 <italic>Q. trojana</italic>) and English oak were the least susceptible [
