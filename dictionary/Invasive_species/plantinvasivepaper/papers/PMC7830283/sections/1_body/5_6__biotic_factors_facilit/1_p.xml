<p>The establishment and severity of Armillaria root rot disease depend on many interacting factors. Abiotic factors include climatic influences like rainfall, wind speed, sun exposure, and especially the perspective of changing climate and extreme weather. Climate changes, such as the occurrence of flooding, drought, storms or warming, are significant causes of poor soil condition and tree stress, while abiotic soil factors, including oxygen, water, organic and mineral content, pH and temperature, play a vital role in the health of the plant, particularly the root system, which has been discussed in detail elsewhere [

 <xref rid="B195-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Climate change and poor soil either weaken plant vigour, rendering the plants sensitive to the infection of armillarioid fungi, or directly influence the survival, development, reproduction, and distribution of the pathogens, as well as indirectly changing the abundance of stimulators and competitors of armillarioids in forests [
