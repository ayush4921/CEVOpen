<p>When monitoring forest trees for signs of an armillarioid infection, the appearance of the characteristic mycelial fans under the bark of the basal trunk is a reliable indication that the fungal mycelium is already present in the root system [
 <xref rid="B181-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Then the fungus can also expand into the inner bark of both the roots and trunk, and subsequently cause root lesions and basal canker at the base of the trunk, known as root rot, collar rot or foot rot [

 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> infection of various resinous tree species [
