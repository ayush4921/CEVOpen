<p>So as to become an efficient plant invader, armillarioids undergo complex developmental changes to colonize plant tissues and complete their life cycle [
 <xref rid="B155-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Rhizomorphs conquer the infected host tissues by deploying hyphae for nutrient acquisition and also extend into the soil to travel and encompass further susceptible hosts [
 <xref rid="B156-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Networks of rhizomorphs can breach mechanical obstacles and may function as an organ system where absorption and transportation occur and facilitate underground spread [

 <xref rid="B158-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. These benefits led to the extension of several 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species (
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>) over vast territories [

 <xref rid="B161-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species with dichotomously branched rhizomorphs, such as 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. borealis</italic> were a lot more aggressive in killing seedlings compared with monopodially branched species such as 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic>, 
 <italic>A. sinapina</italic> and 
 <italic>A. calvescens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B162-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. The preferentially saprotrophic, less pathogenic 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species propagate their mycelia at higher growth rates by harnessing more abundant and vigourous rhizomorphs in the soil with monopodial branching patterns [
 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These species, rather than causing lethal diseases, prefer to derive nutrition from rotten wood or humus in the soil; and such rhizomorphs, through non-invasive physical contacts, may also share their nutrient resources with potential symbiotic plant partners [
 <xref rid="B163-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Both field observations and laboratory experiments confirmed that rhizomorphs of facultative parasitic species reinforce their foraging efficiency by developing significantly more growth tips to increase their competitiveness in soil when confronted with the larger rhizomorph systems of saprotrophic species [
