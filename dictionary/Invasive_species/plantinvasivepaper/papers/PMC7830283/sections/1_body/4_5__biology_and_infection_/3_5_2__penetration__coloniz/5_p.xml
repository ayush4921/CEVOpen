<p>Aboveground symptoms that are suggestive of an already impacted root and vascular system due to 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infection are wilting, chlorosis, dwarfed or downward-hanging foliage, leaf abscission resulting in premature defoliation, dwarfed fruit, resinosis, little shoots, stand-structural changes, lower-stem deformations, down-wood accumulations, crown thinning and branch dieback, and trees usually die prematurely in the case of conifers as well as nut and fruit crops [

 <xref rid="B185-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. As the trees die, the 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> inoculum incubates further in their decaying root systems, then it spreads and kills other adjacent susceptible hosts that may lead to massive-scale mortality and the formation of the canopy gaps [
 <xref rid="B186-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Gaps associated with root disease can enlarge, triggered by coalescence of multiple smaller gaps. Among all the factors predicted to directly affect canopy gap size in a pristine ponderosa pine (
 <italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic>) stand in the Black Hills of South Dakota, 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> root disease seemed to have the most considerable overall impact, followed by other small-scale disturbances (bark beetles, weak pathogens, ice/snow damage, lightning and wildfires) [
 <xref rid="B185-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Disease centres caused by 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> were observed and investigated in West-Central Alberta, Canada, where dead lodgepole pine (
 <italic>Pinus contorta</italic>) trees appeared commonly in the central infected areas [
 <xref rid="B186-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Diseased trees infected with 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> are generally smaller than healthy trees for all measured variables, in respect of diameter, height, sapwood area at the base of the live crown, crown width and length [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As compared to uninfected trees, symptomatic trees were tested to experience a sustained 5 to 15 years decline in the basal area before death in upland black spruce (
 <italic>Picea mariana</italic>) forests [
