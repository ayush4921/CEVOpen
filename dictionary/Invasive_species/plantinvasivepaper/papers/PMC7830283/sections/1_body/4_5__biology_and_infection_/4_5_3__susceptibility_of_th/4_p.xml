<p>Pathogenicity tests for 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> on different oak trees were conducted by Sicoli et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the results indicated that 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> were significantly more virulent on seedlings and young trees of 5 tested 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species than 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>. One more vital clue came from plant polyphenols, the secondary metabolites acting as the primary chemical defence to inhibit the parasitic fungal growth by restricting the production of cell-wall-degrading enzymes. Hydrolyzable tannins as one type of plant polyphenols are most abundant in the wood, bark, and leaves of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species. However, in contrast to 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> was shown to be more efficient in oxidizing and metabolizing polyphenols [
