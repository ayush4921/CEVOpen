<p>Air pores, hydrophobic structures built of hyphae emerging from the mycelial surface, associate with a net of gas channels inside the mycelia and conduct oxygen into rhizomorphs. This intricate system facilitates efficient oxygen diffusion for the aeration and growth of rhizomorphs, therefore very likely contributing to the broader and deeper spread of inoculum into low oxygen environments in the soil and possibly under the bark of the trees [
