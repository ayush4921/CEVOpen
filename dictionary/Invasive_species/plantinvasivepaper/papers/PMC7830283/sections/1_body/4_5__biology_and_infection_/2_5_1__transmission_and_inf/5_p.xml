<p>As an example, 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> may commonly dominate in the vicinity of pre-existing forest areas, because the remaining forest fragments ensure a reservoir of inoculum for infection of re-established forest plantations; where root fragments, woody debris and small woody plants offer nutrition for the survival [

 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, the tree mortality significantly increased after planting. From the third year on, besides that the contribution of the primary inoculum still being essential, the newly dead pine trees served as a secondary inoculum and played an escalating role along with time [
