<p>Recently, genome-level evolutionary studies confirmed that 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Desarmillaria</italic> species have evolved from saprotrophic white-rot ancestors towards facultative parasitism [
 <xref rid="B73-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]; possibly when predecessors of pathogenic species, being well-adapted to wood decay conditions, gained access to the nutrient-rich living tissues of their hosts. Current armillarioid species exhibit a full spectrum of plantâ€“fungus interaction lifestyles ranging from long-term saprotrophic survival under oxygen-limited soil environments through rare symbiotic interactions with mutualist orchid partners [

 <xref rid="B163-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] to aggressively invading and killing vigorous, young trees. Various isolates of parasitic species may exhibit different virulent or non-virulent abilities, and their invasive efficiencies are also dependent on the susceptibility and vigour of their hosts [
