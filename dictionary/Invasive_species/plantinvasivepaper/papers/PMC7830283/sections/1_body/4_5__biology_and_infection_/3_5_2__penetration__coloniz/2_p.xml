<p>At the initiation of the colonization and during the invasion of plant tissues, plant cell wall degrading enzymes and pathogenicity factors are secreted into the interacting fungal exudates. Along with host metabolites, these exudates play significant roles in driving the interactive processes of pathogenesis [
