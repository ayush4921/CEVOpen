<p>Armillarioid species spread through an underground dispersal mechanism either via their rhizomorphs or through physical root connections. When the roots of infected plants meet uninfected roots of adjacent and susceptible hosts, they form a disease centre, which may be limited to a few trees or spread over several hectares in a forest, orchard or vineyard. A disease centre is usually occupied by one or more diploid individuals which may be derived from the former forest stands [

 <xref rid="B151-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Low genotypic diversity of armillarioid species detected in most disease centres entirely unveiled the destructive impacts from these short distant infection processes. In the Landes de Gascogne forest of France, which is the largest monospecific maritime pine plantation forest in Europe, only one genotype or one predominated genotype was detected for

 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, at least 0.2 ha in size, was identified from the disease centre associated with the dying 60-year-old Scots pines in a naturally regenerated forest [
