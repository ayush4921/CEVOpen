 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species differ in their rhizomorphs, the rate of decay and their either opportunistic/saprophytic or parasitic strategy to infect different host tissues. Therefore, different 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species have different abilities to colonize a tree, resulting in different severities of fungal infection concerning lesion characteristics and anatomical changes in phloem and cambial tissues. Some virulent species, 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, can even colonize the sapwood and the heartwood of a tree discriminately [

 <xref rid="B178-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. The infected tree shows a decline in vigour, little shoots, dwarfed leaves and sudden change of leaf colour in autumn. Infected plants generally die some years after infection [
