<p>Transitions between exploratory rhizomorphs and reproductive structures or adjusting to the environment for nutrient acquisition through specialized mycelia and hyphae, either with saprotrophic or necrotrophic activities, require complex morphological and functional changes [

 <xref rid="B144-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Current genomic and transcriptomic studies demonstrated that gene expression profiles from rhizomorphs of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> represent evolutionarily recent 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> lineage-specific gene sets, and rhizomorphs indeed share patterns of upregulated genes and their cis-regulatory elements with that of the fruiting bodies, indicating possible morphogenetic relationship between them [
 <xref rid="B73-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. So far, more than 10 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> genomes—including also recent genome-level updates—have been released [

 <xref rid="B149-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Comparative genomic studies of 4 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species revealed a full complement of plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes and pathogenicity-related genes, including also genes involved in chitin-binding and others in pectinolytic activities. Current research interests are focused on setting up well-controlled inoculation tests to identify which mechanisms and molecular factors drive rhizomorph contact, penetration, and hyphal-host communication during the progress of infection [
 <xref rid="B150-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Defining genomic and transcriptomic differences between pathogenic and saprotrophic activities, and also between virulent and non-virulent isolates of pathogenic species, and their interactions with the host-associated microbial communities may further help us to understand the complex interactive networks between invasive fungal mycelia and the host.
