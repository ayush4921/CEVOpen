<p>Physical contacts play an essential role in the spread of 
 <italic>D. tabescens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, because these two armillarioid species produce much less rhizomorphs in the soil, while others such as 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> generally infect through the explorative rhizomorphs [
 <xref rid="B166-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The growth of the most critical mycelial structures, i.e., mycelial fans, and rhizomorphs through the host tissue and surrounding soil has long been thought to be the two main modes of infection and spread of armillarioid root diseases [
 <xref rid="B90-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Besides the parasitic behaviour, the fungus can also persist as a saprophyte in the form of a mycelium, colonizing the dead roots and wood in the soil of vineyards, urban planting areas, orchards and timber plantations. The colonized and infected plant tissue or woody debris in soil serve as a long-term source of inoculum, colonizing and infecting the roots of new-planted trees through physical contact, which also increases the risk of mortality in the next rotation of trees. The saprophytic behaviour enables the fungal inoculum residing inside the roots and wood to persist for many years in a forest stand [
