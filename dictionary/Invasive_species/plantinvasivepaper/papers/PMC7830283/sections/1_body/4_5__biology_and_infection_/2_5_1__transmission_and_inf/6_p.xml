<p>Although 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> fruiting bodies produce vast quantities of basidiospores, often leaving dense local spore prints behind, haploid mycelia germinating from the spores and invading plants appear fairly unobservable in nature. As a likely explanation, germinating basidiospores and haploid mycelia on natural substrates that are not easily accessible to them could either be short-lived or become dormant, and then their genetic survival and contribution to new infectious abilities are much dependent on the possibilities to interact and fuse with another compatible haploid partner [
 <xref rid="B169-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. The formation of diploids and haploid mosaic cells can significantly increase phenotypic plasticity in accessing natural resources and adapting to new host environments [

 <xref rid="B171-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. In fact, in an outdoor inoculation experiment, haploid 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> isolates were unable to invade seedlings and saplings of Norway spruce, and only diploid mycelia could be recovered from the infected plants, indicating that the colonization of live plant tissues was readily conditioned on a prior onsite diploidization event [
 <xref rid="B169-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. There is also evidence that new genotypes from basidiospores would favour colonization on clear-cutting or the planting of new conifer stands. In a newly set and disturbed forest environment, 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> became highly pathogenic due to the large number of distinct diploid genets created most likely by the actual spread of basidiospores [
 <xref rid="B172-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Under native undisturbed forest conditions, the epidemiological importance of basidiospores can be detected and tracked by adjusting to the proper spatial scale for sampling, within and between populations, and then relying on the population genetic analyses of genets. It has been shown that sexual spore dispersal may be more efficient at fair spatial scales, for example, a few kilometres in contrast to larger spatial distances [
