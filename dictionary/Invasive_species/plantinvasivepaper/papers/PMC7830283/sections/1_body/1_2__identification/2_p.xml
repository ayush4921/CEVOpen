<p>The species identities of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> isolates can be confirmed by using species-specific haploid tester strains in diploid–haploid pairing assays [
 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Then the clonal individuals or genets can be identified in further pairing assays by testing the self- and non-self-recognition through intraspecific somatic incompatibility reactions [

 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although the efficiency and reliability of the diploid–haploid pairing tests is often debated [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], using well-maintained and genetically characterized haploids combined with proper controls may still offer a clear practical benefit in defining the “biological” species identities from various field isolates.
