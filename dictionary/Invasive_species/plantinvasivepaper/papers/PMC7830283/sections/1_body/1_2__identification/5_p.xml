<p>So far, defining species or especially intraspecies boundaries for various 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> isolates, often coming from different continents, has been a challenging task [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The use of highly conserved markers (ITS, IGS, 
 <italic>tef1</italic>, etc.), either individually or in combination, does not always provide the required resolution for safely identifying new species and establishing reliable clustering of all possible interspecies clades [
 <xref rid="B70-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Here we propose a new, genome level approach for creating a phylogenetic tree by using the power of comparative genomics, based on the full spectrum of orthologues from available genomes of interest [
 <xref rid="B73-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] (Champramary et al. ms in prep) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-10-00076-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Our current data confirm the previously suggested armillarioid clade (
 <italic>Physalacriaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Basidiomycota</italic>) comprising of three genera, namely 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Desarmillaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Guyanagaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The genera 
 <italic>Desarmillaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Guyanagaster</italic>, both consisting of two known species so far, represent extant taxa of early armillarioids, while 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species and lineages are mostly pathogenic wood-decaying fungi that recently diverged. Furthermore, the genome-level analysis of orthologues approves the previous findings of 
 <italic>tef1</italic> sequence analysis in predicting several 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> lineages and separating European 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and North American 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> isolates (the latter ones frequently reported in the literature as 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> but referred further in this article as 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic>) at the species level [
