 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-10-00076-f001">Figure 1</xref>(C1â€“C5)) is considered as a typical saprotroph with a world-wide distribution and a wide host range [
 <xref rid="B141-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]; however, this species may also be a primary pathogen, as it has been observed in blue gum (
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp.) introduced to South-West France [
 <xref rid="B131-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], in peach [
 <xref rid="B142-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>], or as an opportunistic parasite in cork oak (
 <italic>Quercus suber</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B131-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. 
 <italic>D. tabescens</italic> is usually found in oak-dominated forests [
 <xref rid="B106-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] and observed mostly on butts and root systems of dead or dying trees and on stumps. It has a southern distribution, but in the maritime climate of Western Europe its distribution area extends to Southern Britain [
 <xref rid="B109-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In Albania it was found frequently on several species of oak and poplar (
 <italic>Populus</italic> spp.), as well as on blue gum [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>D. tabescens</italic> occasionally also caused disease on pear (
 <italic>Pyrus</italic> spp.) and almond (
 <italic>Prunus dulcis</italic>) trees. In Serbia, this species was found only at altitudes below 550 m [
 <xref rid="B106-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], but in Greece and Albania it also occurred at higher altitudes, up to 1150 and 1300 m, respectively [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B111-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. This difference may be related with climatic conditions, as the climate of Serbia is more continental than that of Greece or Albania. In the South-Eastern USA, 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> root rot on peach is caused primarily by 
 <italic>D. tabescens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B142-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>].
