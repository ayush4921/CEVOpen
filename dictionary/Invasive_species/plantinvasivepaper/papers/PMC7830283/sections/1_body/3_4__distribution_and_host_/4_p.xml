<p>The “Gallica” lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-10-00076-f002">Figure 2</xref>) seems to represent opportunistic or weak pathogenic species. These include 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic>, 
 <italic>A cepistipes</italic>, 
 <italic>A. calvescens</italic>, 
 <italic>A. nabsnona</italic>, 
 <italic>A. altimontana</italic> (formerly NABS X) and the so far unnamed “Nag. E” isolates from Japan [

 <italic>Armillaria gallica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-10-00076-f001">Figure 1</xref>(B1–B5)) occurs in England [
 <xref rid="B109-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], as well as continental Europe [
 <xref rid="B108-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], while in North America it is commonly reported east of the Rocky Mountains and in West Coast states of the USA [
 <xref rid="B132-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>], Arizona [
 <xref rid="B133-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], and it is also known from Mexico [
 <xref rid="B134-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] and Japan [
 <xref rid="B95-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> is known to share many forest types in common with 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, e.g., it was reported that 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> had overlapping geographic ranges in Central North America, the main reason of which probably lies in both of the two species favouring similar hosts, especially various oak and broad-leaved plant species [
 <xref rid="B132-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Interestingly, past surveys have noted that besides 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> can be highly aggressive and become a major threat to forest decline. Under stress such as drought condition and climate change, 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> turned out as an aggressive pathogen on several new hosts of Methly plum (
 <italic>Prunus salinica</italic>), Monterey pine (
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic>) and loblolly pine (
 <italic>Pinus taeda</italic>) in the island of Hawaii [
 <xref rid="B135-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. However, very interestingly, current plant disease reports highlight 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> isolates from Central Mexico acting as virulent pathogens on living trees [
 <xref rid="B136-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], which may well be in line with previous data on 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> virulently invading peach trees also in Mexico [
 <xref rid="B98-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The possible switch from opportunistic pathogenicity towards primary necrotrophy could be related to cryptic speciation events within the Mexican 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> population. The preferentially saprotrophic 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) is the most common armillarioid species in Europe with a wide distribution from Northern Europe through Switzerland [
 <xref rid="B87-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] to Ukraine [
 <xref rid="B108-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], Central Albania, Northern Greece [
 <xref rid="B111-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], and the southernmost part of Italy [
 <xref rid="B112-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. This species was occasionally found to cause disease on grapevines (
 <italic>Vitis</italic> spp.) at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1800 m, mostly as a saprophyte on conifers and broad-leaved trees in beech and silver fir forests [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> often occur in the same forest types, e.g., in Serbia they were observed together in the cold-tolerant conifer forest type dominated by silver fir and Norway spruce [
 <xref rid="B106-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. 
 <italic>Armillaria calvescens</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S9</xref>) is mostly restricted to northern hardwood (beech–birch–maple) forests in North-Eastern North America [
 <xref rid="B100-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. nabsnona</italic> was found on several hardwood tree species in the continental USA—bigleaf maple (
 <italic>Acer macrophyllum</italic>), vine maple (
 <italic>Acer circinatum</italic>), red alder (
 <italic>Alnus rubra</italic>), Sitka spruce (
 <italic>Picea sitchensis</italic>), western balsam poplar (
 <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>) and western hemlock [
 <xref rid="B137-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]; Hawaii—‘Ohi’a lehua (
 <italic>Metrosideros polymorpha</italic>), Nepalese alder (
 <italic>Alnus nepalensis</italic>) and Chinese banyan (
 <italic>Ficus microcarpa</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], as well as Hokkaido, Japan—Mongolian oak (
 <italic>Quercus mongolica</italic> var. 
 <italic>grosseserrata</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B138-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>,
 <xref rid="B139-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], while 
 <italic>A. altimontana</italic> has been found on hardwoods (elder species) and conifers—grand fir (
 <italic>Abies grandis</italic>), western white pine (
 <italic>Pinus monticola</italic>)—in the conifer forest zone of western interior North America [
 <xref rid="B81-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], where it is frequently co-occurring with 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic>.
