<p>Currently, inferences from our orthogroup-based phylogenetic data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-10-00076-f002">Figure 2</xref>), combined also with previous large-scale statistical analysis of 
 <italic>tef1</italic> sequences [
 <xref rid="B70-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], support the confinement of possible “Ostoyae”, “Mellea” and “Gallica” lineages. The species of the “Ostoyae” lineage, besides 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic>—likely representing primary pathogens—may potentially include 
 <italic>A. gemina</italic>, 
 <italic>A. borealis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sinapina</italic>. In Europe, 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) was recorded from many countries, including Switzerland [
 <xref rid="B107-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], Ukraine [
 <xref rid="B108-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] and the southern mountains of Serbia at 800–1800 m [
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In Albania, 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> was common, causing significant damage on black pine 
 <italic>(Pinus nigra</italic>), Scots pine (
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>), Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>), Serbian spruce (
 <italic>Picea omorika</italic>) and silver fir (
 <italic>Abies alba</italic>) at altitudes from 600 to 1800 m, while at lower altitudes (ca. 100–800 m), 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> was recorded on maritime pine (
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>), Mediterranean 
 <italic>cypress (Cupressus sempervirens</italic>) and common juniper (
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The species was also reported from England [
 <xref rid="B109-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], while Greece [
 <xref rid="B111-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] appears to be the southernmost limits of its distribution in the Balkan Peninsula, whereas in Italy the distribution extends to Calabria, the southernmost part of the peninsula [
 <xref rid="B112-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. 
 <italic>Armillaria solidipes</italic> is widely distributed in coniferous forests of Canada (Ontario, British Columbia) as well as the North-Western, interior South-Western, North-Central and North-Eastern USA (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B113-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Within the Western USA it has been commonly found in the pacific North-West (Northern Idaho, Western Montana, Oregon and Washington) and the Colorado Plateau. 
 <italic>Armillaria sinapina</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) is considered as a weak pathogen of diverse hosts [
 <xref rid="B114-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], it has been reported from a variety of conifer—white spruce (
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic>), mountain hemlock (
 <italic>Tsuga mertensiana</italic>)—and hardwood—birch (
 <italic>Betula</italic> spp.), trembling aspen (
 <italic>Populus tremuloides</italic>), willow (
 <italic>Salix</italic> spp.)—forest trees on sites with diverse climates in Alaska [
 <xref rid="B115-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], as well as from Douglas-fir (
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>), western hemlock (
 <italic>Tsuga heterophylla</italic>) and western redcedar (
 <italic>Thuja plicata</italic>) in the southern interior of British Columbia [
 <xref rid="B102-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The host range of 
 <italic>A. gemina</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) was found to be restricted to sugar maple (
 <italic>Acer saccharum</italic>) in Canada [
 <xref rid="B116-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. This species has also been reported in the Eastern USA (Vermont and New York) on sugar maple, American beech (
 <italic>Fagus grandifolia</italic>) and yellow birch (
 <italic>Betula alleghaniensis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B117-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. 
 <italic>Armillaria borealis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) has the most Northern distribution among the European armillarioid species, its limit coinciding with the limit of woody vegetation in Scandinavia (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-10-00076">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B118-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. borealis</italic> is known as a secondary pathogen of weakened coniferous and deciduous trees and its aggressive behaviour is rare [
 <xref rid="B119-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The record of 
 <italic>A. borealis</italic> from Albania represents the southernmost observation in Europe; with the nearest record being from Slovenia [
 <xref rid="B120-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>].
