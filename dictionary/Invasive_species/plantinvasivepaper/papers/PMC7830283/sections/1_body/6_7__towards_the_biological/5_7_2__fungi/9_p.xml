<p>Mycorrhizal associations have been found helpful in enhancing the resistance of plants to certain fungal pathogens [

 <xref rid="B293-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>]. In these symbiotic relationships, the fungus receives carbohydrates from its host, while the plant gets benefited from multiple positive effects of the association. Earlier it has also been reported that ectomycorrhizal fungi can reduce the infections caused by 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B294-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>]. In vitro interaction studies between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> were conducted in grapevine [
 <xref rid="B295-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">295</xref>]. As a result, AMF symbiosis was found to improve the tolerance of grapevine to 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> without showing any direct antagonism or antibiosis against the pathogen, which suggested that the defensive response of grapevines against 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> must be indirect, mediated through the host plant physiology [
