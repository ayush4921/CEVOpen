<p>Among silvicultural practices, planting resistant tree species, inoculum removal realized by removing diseased trees and uprooting even neighbouring uninfected stumps, root collar excavation and solarization may be effective ways of controlling 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infections, but do not seem to guarantee a long-term controlling effect and warrant their cost [

Chemical soil fumigants, such as carbon disulfide, methyl bromide, metham-sodium or chloropicrin, as well as non-phytotoxic fungicides seem to be able to control armillarioid infections even in susceptible plants, however, their application is very costly and labour intensive, and it also faces a lot of safety and health issues for the workers and farmers [

Furthermore, as most of the currently available chemical means for controlling armillarioids are either ineffective or banned, there is an emerging need for effective biocontrol strategies applied either alone or in combination with other control measures [
