<p>Rhizomorphs of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> spp. play a pivotal role in infecting healthy plants and ultimately spread the disease. Root collar excavation followed by 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> inoculation appears to offer a promising integrated strategy for the management of 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> [

 <xref rid="B315-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">315</xref>]. The method alone is unlikely to eradicate an 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infection, but in the case of grapevine, it may allow an infected plant to tolerate Armillaria root rot [
