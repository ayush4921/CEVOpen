<p>Biofumigation can be carried out by incorporation of broccoli (
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. 
 <italic>italica</italic>) residues into the soil. The antifungal properties of biofumigants have been associated with their high glucosinolate content, which can be hydrolyzed to release antifungal isothiocyanates [
 <xref rid="B310-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">310</xref>]. Isothiocyanates released from the hydrolysis of the glucosinolate sinigrin, isolated from 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> seed, showed antifungal properties against 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> strains in in vitro experiments [
 <xref rid="B311-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>]. Sinigrin has shown a fungicidal effect at a concentration of 100 Î¼M, while lower concentrations resulted in a temporary fungistatic effect. Moreover, the application of biofumigant formulations obtained from 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> seeds on potted peach plants inoculated with 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> resulted in enhanced soil biological activity (basal respiration, soil nitrate concentration and microbial biomass) as well as increased peach plant growth, chlorophyll concentration and leaf nitrogen [
 <xref rid="B311-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>]. However, the inhibition of 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> growth by the application of 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> seed meal in in vivo trials was not evidenced due to the lack of infection symptoms in experimentally inoculated potted trees, thus further research is required to study its efficacy in Armillaria root rot disease control. Allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate), a stabilized garlic extract product, was tested on 100 isolates of 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> and was found to inhibit the growth of both fungi under in vitro conditions [
 <xref rid="B312-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">312</xref>]. The potential of allicin for field use is limited due to better inhibition of the less virulent 
 <italic>A. gallica</italic> than the more aggressive 
 <italic>A. mellea.</italic>
