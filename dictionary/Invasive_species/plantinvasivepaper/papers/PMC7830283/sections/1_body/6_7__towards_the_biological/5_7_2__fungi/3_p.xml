<p>The strong antagonism of 
 <italic>T. citrinoviride</italic> to 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> seemed to be induced by diffusible compounds that inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> and the formation of rhizomorphs. It was also proved that these compounds were metabolites and not enzymes since they could still suppress the growth of 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> after denaturing any enzymes in the filtrates of 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> isolates during autoclaving [
 <xref rid="B276-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>]. A further study indicated that compounds from the fermentation of 
 <italic>T. longibrachiatum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. harzianum</italic> in different media exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B277-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. 6-
 <italic>n</italic>-pentyl-Î±-pyrone (6-PP) was the most active metabolite, at a concentration of 200 ppm completely suppressing the growth of 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>. Sorbicillin showed moderate antifungal activity on the fungi 
 <italic>Paecilomyces variotii</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium notatum</italic> but no activity against 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> [
