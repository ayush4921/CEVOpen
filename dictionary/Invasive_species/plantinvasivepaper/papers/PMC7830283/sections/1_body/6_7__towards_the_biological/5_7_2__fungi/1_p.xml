 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species are well known for their antagonistic activity against several fungal plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B267-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>,
 <xref rid="B268-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>]. Their antagonistic behaviour may be the result of competition [
 <xref rid="B269-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>], antibiosis and direct mycoparasitism [
 <xref rid="B270-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. The main challenge in using 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species as BCAs is to maintain an adequate population after the first inoculation, which is required to manage 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B251-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. The population of 
 <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> strain SC1 was found to decrease over time and eventually reached levels comparable to the natural presence of 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B271-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>]. Introducing BCAs and promoting their establishment through bark mulch carrier could represent an alternative or complementary strategy for the control of Armillaria root disease, as bark mulch might be useful in maintaining the viability of the introduced 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. in the soil for a long time [
 <xref rid="B272-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>].
