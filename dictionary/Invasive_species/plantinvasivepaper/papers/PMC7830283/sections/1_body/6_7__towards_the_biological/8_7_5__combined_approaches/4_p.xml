<p>The application of soil-borne 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. may be more effective in controlling 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> infections after the fumigation of soil with methyl bromide and carbon disulfide, as sublethal doses of these fumigants seem to make the mycelium more vulnerable to mycoparasitism by 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. [

 <xref rid="B318-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> strains can survive at much higher concentrations of soil fumigants than 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> [

 <xref rid="B320-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>], the population of 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. presumably seemed even increased by field fumigation with methyl bromide [

 <xref rid="B321-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>]. Moreover, when the root pieces fumigated with carbon disulphide were buried in unsterilized soil or soil amended with 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> was killed and replaced more effectively [
