<p>Several allelopathic compounds were found to be effective against plant pathogens and herbivores, and they can also influence soil microorganisms [

 <italic>Armillaria</italic> spp. are being tested, but no significant inhibitory effect was observed so far. This idea needs further and specialized research in the future to identify BCAs effective against
