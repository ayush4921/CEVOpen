<p>The rapidly growing saprophytic basidiomycete fungi have also proven effective as biocontrol agents to reduce or even prevent armillarioid invasion and colonization by decreasing the available stump wood base through aggressive spatial competition [
 <xref rid="B286-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. Mycelial cord-forming fungi have shown a considerable potential to colonize woody debris under field conditions and persist in woodland forests for a long time [

 <xref rid="B288-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. Competitive antagonists, viz. 
 <italic>Hypholoma fasciculare</italic>, 
 <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic>, 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>, 
 <italic>Xylaria hypoxylon</italic> or 
 <italic>Phanerochaete velutina</italic> can overgrow the colonies of 
 <italic>D. tabescens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, ultimately reducing the inocula, thus decreasing the threat to adjacent trees and/or subsequent plantings [
 <xref rid="B123-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Promising competitors may even be found within the genus 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> itself: 
 <italic>A. altimontana</italic> was found to be harmless to western white pine but reported to frequently co-occur with the virulent primary pathogen 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> in Northern Idaho, suggesting that non-harmful 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species may have in situ biocontrol potential against their root rot pathogenic relatives [
