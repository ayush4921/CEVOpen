<p>The biocontrol interactions were studied by detecting metabolic assimilation of 
 <italic>T. atroviride</italic> SC1 from a 
 <sup>13</sup>C-labelled 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in dual-culture tests. The results showed that, during the direct contact with 
 <sup>13</sup>C labelled 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, the 
 <sup>13</sup>C content in the mycelia of 
 <italic>T. atroviride</italic> increased significantly by assimilating some leaching exudates and metabolites of the pathogen, but mostly assimilating from actively parasitizing the pathogen [

 <italic>Trichoderma harzianum</italic>, which inhibited 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic> with a growth rate of inhibition 80 Â± 0.19%. During contacting with 
 <sup>13</sup>C-labelled 
 <italic>A. mellea</italic>, 
 <sup>13</sup>C values of 
 <italic>T. harzianum</italic> reached to a significantly higher level than the assimilation of 
 <sup>13</sup>C in the antagonistic bacteria 
 <italic>Rhodosporidium babjevae</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>. The mycoparasitic activity of 
 <italic>T. harzianum</italic> against the labelled pathogen sustained for one month in dual culture [
