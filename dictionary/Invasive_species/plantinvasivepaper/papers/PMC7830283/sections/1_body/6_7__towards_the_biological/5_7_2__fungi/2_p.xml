<p>Microphotographs revealed by scanning electron microscopy indicated the penetration of 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> hyphal tips into the melanized outer tissue of the rhizomorphs of host fungi, and 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> eventually killed the 
 <italic>Sclerotium rolfsii</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> and 
 <italic>Armillaria gallica</italic> hyphae by coiling and lysis of hyphal cells [

 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. exhibited toxicity to the causal agent of Armillaria root of tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) in Kenya [

 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. excrete mycolytic enzymes for the digestion of the cell wall of the target fungus, which causes the leakage of the cytoplasm from the host cells resulting in their lysis. The host cytoplasm is, apparently, utilized by the mycoparasite for its further spread [
