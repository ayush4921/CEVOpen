<p>Ample research has been performed on the feasibility of integrated control of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> spp. Wise and judicious use of fire followed by the inoculation of 
 <italic>T. harzianum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. citrinoviride</italic> reduced the growth and rhizomorph formation of 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> and might be used as an option for the integrated strategy of managing armillarioid root diseases [
 <xref rid="B276-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>]. It has also been proved earlier that fire enhanced the concentration of cations in the soil which come from the ash layer, negatively affecting the growth and development of 
 <italic>A. solidipes</italic> in vitro [
 <xref rid="B313-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">313</xref>,
 <xref rid="B314-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>]. If the soil is warmer and drier, there is a lower probability of survival of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> mycelium within partially decayed roots, encouraging the mycoparasitism on 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> mycelium by soil-borne fungi like 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species [
