<p>The integration of several isolates of 
 <italic>T. harzianum</italic> with two systemic fungicides, Fosetyl-Al (Aliette) and Fenpropidin, was tested to suppress the 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> root disease in potted strawberry plants in a greenhouse experiment, and a significant interaction was observed among the 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp., fungicides and the timing of their application [
 <xref rid="B318-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. 
 <italic>T. harzianum</italic> isolates Th2 and Th23 were generally more effective against 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> when applied with a time interval of 40 days after Fenpropidin or before Fosetyl-Al. Moreover, Fosetyl-Al was found to be significantly more effective than Fenpropidin in enhancing the survival of strawberry plants even when used in high amounts, while Fenpropidin in its high doses was observed to be phytotoxic to strawberry plants [
 <xref rid="B318-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. The active ingredient of Fosetyl-Al is phosphonic acid, which has already been proven as a control agent against 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> [
