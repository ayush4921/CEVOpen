<p>Since

What, if anything, could or should be done with the productive growing sites for various coniferous or broad-leaved species that are progressively dying from root rot disease caused by armillarioid pathogens? The disease remains inconspicuous until plants with visible and distinct symptoms are observed, and during the period between the infection and appearance of visible symptoms, 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> may widely spread both in the soil and the host plant [
 <xref rid="B242-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. The control of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> root disease is also challenging due to the hidden growth of the pathogen in the soil and its persistence in dead plant tissues for decades [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The mycelium, beneath the plant bark or inside dead wood, gets protected from the action of control agents [
