<p>The economic and environmental problems caused by 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, increase the need for efficient solution strategies, the development of which requires a solid genome-level knowledge about the molecular background of the pathogenic activities of various species and the infection process of their virulent representatives, as well as the composition and function of the microbiota associated with them in their natural environments. In the “omics” era, modern tools of molecular biology enabling the realization of the above goals are becoming widely available. Genome-level analysis of orthologues offers the possibility of resolving the taxonomy for armillarioids at genus, clade, and species levels. Beyond that, high-quality genomes and well-controlled plant–fungus interaction tests are in line to develop genome-based pathogenicity models, while metatranscriptomic analyses of native infestation assays may assist further in identifying the microbial components contributing to or controlling the invasive activities of various 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> mycelia.
