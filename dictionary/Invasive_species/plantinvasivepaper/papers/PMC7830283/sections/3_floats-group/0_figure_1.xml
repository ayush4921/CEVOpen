  <p>The prominent 
   <italic>Armillaria</italic> and 
   <italic>Desarmillaria</italic> species from broad-leaved forests in Central Europe: 
   <italic>Armillaria mellea</italic> (
   <bold>A1</bold>–
   <bold>A3</bold>); frequent in Turkey oak and pedunculate oak forests (Keszthely Hills, Hungary); 
   <italic>Armillaria gallica</italic> (
   <bold>B1</bold>–
   <bold>B5</bold>); (
   <bold>B1</bold>,
   <bold>B2)</bold> representing freshly grown, while 
   <bold>B3</bold> already decaying fruiting bodies; some were found growing out from the base of still healthy-looking beech trees (
   <bold>B1</bold>–
   <bold>B3</bold>), others (
   <bold>B4</bold>) were prevalently covering already rotten forest logs and woody fragments; 
   <italic>Desarmillaria tabescens</italic> (
   <bold>C1</bold>–
   <bold>C5</bold>); frequently found in oak forests during the first weeks in autumn, in some cases (
   <bold>C5</bold>) fruiting bodies were also observed growing right from the base of dead little oak trees (Sopron Hills, Hungary).
