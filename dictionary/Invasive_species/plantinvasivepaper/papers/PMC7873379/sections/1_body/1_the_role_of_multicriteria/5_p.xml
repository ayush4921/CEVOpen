In the first case, the pre-raid quarantine is designed to reduce or eliminate the probability of a raid. It entails an increase in implementation and management costs, but also negative effects on the well-being of consumers caused by limited commercial flows, as shown by some partial equilibrium analyzes [

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the second case, if the disease or a parasite/pathogen escapes the established quarantine measures (if any) and its entry is confirmed, there are three basic strategies for dealing with it, namely eradication, doing nothing, or a combination of these first options. The criteria used often provide for a reduction in the quantity of yield and an increase in the cost of production [
