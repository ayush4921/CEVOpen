This structure is unlikely to be exposed to any importation at risk, in order to pursue additional profits. The professional operator, at certain levels of capitalization and productivity, can however delocalize its production activity in order to achieve greater economies of scale and scope, finding suitable environmental conditions and different phytosanitary situations in other areas of the planet. The situation is different for the amateur nursery, which experiences the derogation regime and which can be tempted by the possibility of widening its commercial offer, with imports at risk;

To date, the defense against invasion has been based on two conceptual elements, namely the traceability and control of the supply chain at a physical location. On the supply chain of ornamental plants nowadays and at different levels, electronic commerce is inserted in which the plant or part of the plant (scions, for example) skips some important elements of physical reference, in which the prescribed health checks can be carried out. The consumer can connect directly to platforms, not of production but of intermediation, which offer products of all kinds, even of clear foreign origin, community or non-EU, despite the EU Reg. 625/2017 on official controls. If these are not carried out cross-border, they should nevertheless be carried out starting from a site survey, which has not yet been completed;
