<p id="p0405">The size of this trade was determined through the UN ComTrade database, built by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), which collects the commercial data of over 170 countries/territorial areas of the planet defined by FAO and the OECD. Inside, however, we do not find an item exclusively referring to ornamental Rutaceae, because they fall within the tariff code of the 8-digit combined nomenclature 06022090 called “Other” (NACE = 
 <italic>Nomenclature des Activités èconomiques dans les Communautés Européennes</italic>). Not even EU Regulation 2018/1602, which modifies Annex I of Regulation (EEC) n. 2658/87 of the Council concerning the tariff and statistical nomenclature and the common customs tariff in force since 01/01/2019, solves this problem. Therefore, although the economic importance of the sector (equal to 21,858.54 mln €, EU - 28; 2018, source: EUROSTAT), the statistics on ornamental plants remain very aggregated, even if in 2012 Italy had requested at least the distinction between citrus fruit with edible and inedible fruit.
