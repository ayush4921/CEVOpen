<p id="p0485">For these reasons, the possibility of adopting a model, with some instruments of market control and not, to discourage a potential invasion of 
 <italic>Xcc</italic> in the Mediterranean Basin has been evaluated. This is because, since there is currently no import ban for all ornamental 
 <italic>Rutaceae</italic>, these represent for nurserymen an opportunity to differentiate the supply and increase their profits. Not only that, but the ban on the international commerce (import/export) of ornamental Rutaceae only for the risk that they can become an invasion vector involves high social costs, in the form of lack of benefits for consumers and profits for nursery owners. On the other hand, the intensification of trade in non-traditional species could increase the risk of the introduction and spread of Xcc in the Mediterranean Basin.
