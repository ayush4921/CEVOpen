<p id="p0505">In general, private operators (professionals, amateurs, garden centers, landscape businesses and tertiary sector companies) have shown a substantial convergence towards the rejection of new fixed or variable taxes, with limited assessment for the possible scenario. The ornamental Rutaceae are, in fact, an asset with elastic demand and a tax charge (both on the supply side and on the demand side) is seen as a reduction in price/quantity equilibrium, with the consequence that consumers pay more money and businesses receive less. In fact, various empirical evidence shows that both in case of sales tax and in tax on buyers there is damage for both, giving the parties identical regardless of who formally repays the tax. Not only that, but any product revenue is likely to be particularly low for the replacement of Rutaceae with other ornamental species, with fewer phytosanitary problems thus undermining the added value produced, the intense research activity upstream and the highly specialized factors (capital and work), who cannot find easily other jobs, especially in the short term. A basic concern emerges, therefore, that the taxation impairs the development of the market of ornamental Rutaceae.</p>
