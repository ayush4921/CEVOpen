<p id="p0435">In the four subcodes as a whole, around 10,000 tons of plant material is imported into the Mediterranean Basin, for a total value of USD 47 million. European countries play a diversified role by type of product. Thus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Turkey are very active in the trade of live plants (up to 70% of total imports in Greece), unlike Israel and Spain much more exposed to commercial risk for bulbs, tubers, corms, etc (

The intensification of trade inevitably triggers an increase in the demand for phytosanitary services and a tightening of the system of rules (sanitary, phytosanitary, and technical regulations) that governs commercial activities, with the risk of triggering international marketing bans and consequent compromises of benefits for consumers and profits for nurseries.
