<p id="p0050">Since the presence of 
 <italic>Xcc</italic> in the EU territory is not yet ascertained, it is, therefore, possible to definitively affirm that citrus cultivation enjoys a high degree of protection, by the institutional systems in charge in the various countries. These protection systems (phytosanitary authorities) act on the network intervening in the absence of phytosanitary documentation (passport for import/export activities) but do not prevent international trade since, in line with the WTO agreements, phytosanitary controls cannot become a real "non-tariff" barrier to free trade.
