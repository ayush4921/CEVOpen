<p id="p0055">Rutaceous species used for ornamental purposes, for which the market is booming, are not covered. This leads to the conclusion that if a more restrictive system of protection against Citrus Bacterial Cancer was to be applied, it would have been necessary to include in the annexes of Directive 2000/29 EU and EU Reg. 2031/2016 the entire taxonomic category "Rutaceae family" and not the individual citrus species, because this choice meant more freedom for ornamental species.</p>
