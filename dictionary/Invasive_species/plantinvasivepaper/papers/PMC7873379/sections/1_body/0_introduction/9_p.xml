<p id="p0045">The EU Implementing Regulation 2019/2072 provides a list of Rutaceae whose plants, subject to trade, can enter the EU territory with an "official declaration" of the Third Country or with the inclusion of a "supplementary declaration" on the phytosanitary certificate, certifying that the area of origin is free from Xc. Among the plants concerned are "Limonia L.", "Microcitrus Swingle", "Murraya J. Koenig", "Severina", "Poncirus Raf. and their hybrids", etc., although they are hardly traded from risk areas [

 <italic>Xcc</italic> would find favorable environmental conditions for its development, but not from the import of fruit due to the low probability of transferring the bacterium to a suitable host with this medium. Recent studies have shown that the risk of potential invasion is significant in light of the intense commercial exchanges of plant material between some areas at risk because the pathogen is present in them, and the Mediterranean Basin [
