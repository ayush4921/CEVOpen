<p id="p0040">The CBC causes significant damage to the epigean organs of the plant (leaves and branches) and, in particular, on the fruits causing their fall and/or decay, making them not suitable for commercialization [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The disease has never been reported in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin and, therefore, the two responsible bacteria are included in the list of quarantine pathogens of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) [

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], identified among the possible ways of entry of the bacterium into the Mediterranean Basin the trade flows of ornamental Rutaceae species, considering that some of these are widely cultivated in the Mediterranean countries and which activate a great economic and social function. The protective measures against the introduction of Xcc are governed by Directive 2000/29/EC and in the most recent EU Reg. 2031/2016, in which random CBC agents are inserted. In particular, the legislation acts to prevent many species of the genus “Citrus”, “Fortunella”, “Poncirus”, “Murraya könig” (actually since subject to 
 <italic>Diasphorina citri Kuway</italic>) and related hybrids (subject to contamination), except for fruits and seeds.
