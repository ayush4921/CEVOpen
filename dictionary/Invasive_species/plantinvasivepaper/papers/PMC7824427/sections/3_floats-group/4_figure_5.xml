 <caption>
  <p>Soil eco-stoichiometry and the relationships between organic carbon (
   <bold>C</bold>), salinity, and leaf eco-stoichiometry at different tidal levels. Blue and red arrows indicate the soil index and the plant index, respectively. Subfigures (
   <bold>A</bold>â€“
   <bold>C</bold>) represent the sample lines at the three tidal levels: 1, 3, and 5 km from the coastline (T1, T3, and T5, respectively); (
   <bold>D</bold>) represents all sample points from three tidal levels. TC.L: soil total C content; TN.L: leaf total nitrogen (N) content; TP.L: leaf total phosphorus (P) content; C/N.L: leaf C/N ratio; C/P.L: leaf C/P ratio; N/P.L: leaf N/P ratio; SOC.S: soil organic C content; TC.S: soil total C content; TN.S: soil total N content; TP.S: total soil P content; S.S: soil salinity; C/N.S: soil C/N ratio; C/P.S: soil C/P ratio; N/P.S: soil N/P ratio.
