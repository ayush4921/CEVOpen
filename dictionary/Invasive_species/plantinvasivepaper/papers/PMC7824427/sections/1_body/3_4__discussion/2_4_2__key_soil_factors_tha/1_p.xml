<p>The C, N, and P contents of plants are affected by the comprehensive effects of environmental factors, such as the soil physical and chemical properties and the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; therefore, the soil C, N, and P concentrations are expected to determine the concentrations of plant C, N, and P. In addition, our study revealed that soil salinity and soil C/N ratio greatly impacted the eco-stoichiometric characteristics of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves. We speculated that the C/N ratio is a sensitive indicator of soil quality and has important impacts on the soil C and N cycles and plant growth. Some studies have shown that a low C/N ratio can promote microbial decomposition and N mineralization, while a high C/N ratio can slow down the mineralization of organic matter and organic N and promote the fixation of organic C [
