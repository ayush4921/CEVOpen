<p>The transfer of C, N, and P between plants and the soil environment forms part of the C, N, and P cycles within ecosystems. The stability of C, N, and P in the plant leaves affect the soil nutrients and, accordingly, the stability of these nutrient elements in the soil also affect the nutrient availability for plants [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The findings of the present study were consistent with this notion, i.e., the C, N, and P contents in the 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves were significantly positively correlated with the soil C, N, and P contents and with the soil organic C content.
