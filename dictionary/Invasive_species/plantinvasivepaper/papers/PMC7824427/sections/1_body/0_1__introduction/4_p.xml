<p>In this study, we assessed the relationship between 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaf and soil eco-stoichiometry and determined the key soil factors that affect leaf eco-stoichiometry between three different tide levels (i.e., 1, 3, 5 km from the coastline, respectively) in the Yancheng coastal wetland in the Dafeng Elk Nature Reserve. The leaf eco-stoichiometry of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>, including the total C (TC.L), total N (TN.L), total P (TP.L), C/N ratio (C/N.L), C/P ratio(C/P.L), N/P ratio (N/P.L), corresponding soil stoichiometry, including total C (TC.S), total N (TN.S), total P (TP.S), C/N ratio (C/N.S), C/P ratio (C/P.S), N/P ratio (N/P.S); soil salinity (S.S), and soil organic C (SOC.S), were measured. We explored the C, N, and P utilization strategies of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> from the coastline, determined the relationships between 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaf and soil eco-stoichiometry, and identified the key soil factors that affected the leaf eco-stoichiometry. This study furthers our understanding of the invasion mechanism and nutrient allocation strategy of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and provides a theoretical basis for the formulation of control policies for this introduced species.
