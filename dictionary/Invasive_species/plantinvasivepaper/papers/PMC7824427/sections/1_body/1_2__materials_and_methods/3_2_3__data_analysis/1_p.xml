<p>A one-way analysis of variance was conducted using SPSS v22.0 to compare the differences in the eco-stoichiometry of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves and the soil environment, and the other soil physical and chemical properties at different tidal levels. R (Pearson-R) was used to analyze the correlation between the leaf and soil eco-stoichiometry and other indicators. Finally, we conducted redundancy analyses (RDA) to clarify the key soil indicators that affect the eco-stoichiometry of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves. RDA allows multiple response variables to be regressed on multiple explanatory variables and can explain a set of response variables through a set of explanatory variables. Therefore, RDA was selected for analysis in this study instead of principal component analysis (PCA). All statistical tests were performed at the 0.05 level of significance. Data were visualized mainly using Origin2020 and R.
