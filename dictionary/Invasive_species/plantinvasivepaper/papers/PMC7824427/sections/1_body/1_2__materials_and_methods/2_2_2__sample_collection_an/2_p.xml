<p>The total soil carbon content is the sum of organic carbon and inorganic carbon content, and the carbon in plants is mainly organic carbon, so the total carbon content of plants is the organic carbon content. A vario PYRO cube (Elemental, Langenselbold, Germany) elemental analyzer was used to measure the C and N contents in plants and soil samples, the sample was decomposed by high-temperature combustion, and the mixed gas was automatically determined by the thermal conductivity detection system [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The total P content was measured using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method (Cytation, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). Soil organic C was measured using spectroscopy photometer colorimetry (Cytation, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA); under heating conditions, the organic carbon is oxidized by potassium dichromate-sulfuric acid solution, and the Cr
 <sup>6+</sup> in potassium dichromate is reduced to Cr
 <sup>3+</sup>, and its content is proportional to the organic carbon content. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 585 nm to calculate the organic carbon content. C/N refers to the ratio of total carbon to total nitrogen content, C/P refers to the ratio of total carbon to total phosphorus content, and N/P refers to the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus content. Soil salinity was measured using the conductivity method, after extracting the aqueous solution with a water-soil ratio of 5:1, and then measured with a portable conductivity meter (DDS-307A, Shanghai, China).
