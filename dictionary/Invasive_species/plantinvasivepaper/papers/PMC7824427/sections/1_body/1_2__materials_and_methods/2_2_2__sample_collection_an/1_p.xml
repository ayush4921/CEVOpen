<p>In August 2019, three sample lines parallel to the coastline were set up in the core area of the Dafeng Elk Nature Reserve in Yancheng at distances of 1, 3, and 5 km from the coastline. Sample lines were separated by intervals of 2 km. 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> plants and soil samples were collected from 30 sample points (1 × 1 m plots) along each sample line, and the interval of sample points was greater than 5 m. Plants showing good growth were randomly selected at each sample point. The leaves in the upper, middle, and lower parts of each plant were collected. Soil samples were collected (depth: 0–20 cm) in each sample plot according to the five-point sampling method and mixed evenly to form a composite soil sample. To avoid leaf nutrient consumption, the samples were quickly transported to the laboratory and dried in an oven (105 °C, 10 min; 80 °C, and 10 h of drying to constant weight). The soil samples were air-dried after removing the impurities of plants and stones, and they were passed through a 100-mesh sieve to determine the content of soil organic carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, and a 20-mesh sieve was used to determine the soil salinity.
