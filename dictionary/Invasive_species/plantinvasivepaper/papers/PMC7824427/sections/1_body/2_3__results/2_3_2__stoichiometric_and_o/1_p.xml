<p>Significant differences were detected in the soil C, N, and P stoichiometry, soil organic C content, and salinity at different tidal levels (

The SOC.S, TC.S, TN.S, TP.S, and S.S were the highest at T3 (9.59 ± 31 g/kg, 22.34 ± 1.10 g/kg, 0.83 ± 0.06 g/kg, 0.72 ± 0.02 g/kg, 3.30 ± 0.13 ms/cm respectively), intermediate at T1, and lowest at T5 (2.91 ± 0.21 g/kg, 8.88 ± 0.51 g/kg, 0.25 ± 0.01 g/kg, 2.17 ± 0.42, respectively). All differences were significant (

The C/P.S and N/P.S showed the same trend as the other soil indexes, where the highest values were obtained at T3 (30.89 ± 1.37, 1.15 ± 0.07, respectively), followed by T1 and T5. The highest C/N.S value was obtained at T5 (36.29 ± 2.08), but no significant differences were obtained between T1 and T3 (
