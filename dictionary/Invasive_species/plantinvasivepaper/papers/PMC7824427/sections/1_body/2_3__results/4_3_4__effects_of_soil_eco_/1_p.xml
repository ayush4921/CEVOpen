<p>Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to determine the key factors in soil stoichiometry and other properties that affect the eco-stoichiometry of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves. In the analyses, the 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaf eco-stoichiometry represented the response variable, and the soil indicators represented the explanatory variables. The results of the RDA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f005">Figure 5</xref>) revealed that most of the variances in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f005">Figure 5</xref>A–D were represented by axis 1 (A–D: 52.11%, 53.42%, 66.66%, 66.17%, respectively), and the cumulative interpretation rate of axis 2 reached more than 60% (A–D: 63.76%, 71.85%, 72.2%, 78.34%, respectively). The cosine value of the arrow angle approximates the correlation between the variables: the angle closer to 90° means less correlation among variables, and the angle farther from 90° and closer to 0° or 180° means strong positive or negative correlation. These results showed that S.S, C/N.S, and TP.S had a greater impact on leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). At T3, the S.S, C/N.S, SOC.S, and TC.S had a greater impact (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), and at T5, the S.S, C/N.S, and TC.S had a greater impact on the leaf stoichiometric characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). Comprehensive RDA analysis results of the three tidal levels revealed that the S.S, C/N.S, SOC.S, TP.S, and TC.S had a greater overall impact (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). Collectively, the results demonstrated that S.S and C/N.S greatly impacted the 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaf eco-stoichiometric characteristics.
