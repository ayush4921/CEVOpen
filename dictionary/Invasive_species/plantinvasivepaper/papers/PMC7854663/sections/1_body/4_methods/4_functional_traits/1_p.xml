 </sup>, and resistance against the crayfish plague (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The traits generalist diet, short generation time and ability to escape or survive natural enemies from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were excluded for varying reasons. For example, crayfish have a generalist and flexible diet resulting in high similarity between all species included. For the selected traits, information was obtained through literature research; species were assigned trait modalities based on data from scientific papers (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> online). For each trait modality a species scored either 1 or 0, with the possibility to score 1 in multiple modalities for some traits. When trait information for a species was unavailable from literature its modalities were assigned through expert judgement, mostly based on confirmed traits of species within the same genus. For the traits growth rate, migration and aggression the information obtained from literature varied in expression, complicating the definition of clear trait modalities. Here, comparative studies between species were used when possible to assign crayfish into generic categories of ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’. The Köppen-Geiger climate classifications

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>
 </sup> of each species’ native range (Supplementary Table

 <italic>Procambarus virginalis</italic> is a species that originates from the aquarium trade

 </sup> and has no natural home range, thus the native range of its closest relative, 
 <italic>Procambarus fallax</italic>, was used. No scientific literature was available on the traits growth and aggression for the species 
 <italic>C. boesemani</italic> and 
 <italic>C. papuanus</italic>. Therefore, information from aquarium websites was included.
