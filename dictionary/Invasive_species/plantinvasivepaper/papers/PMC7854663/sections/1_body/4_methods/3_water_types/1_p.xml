<p id="Par27">The occurrences of the six successful invasive species were plotted on a map of the Netherlands in ArcMap 10.2.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA) (Fig.

 </sup>, with the closest waterbody within a 200 m radius being assigned to the crayfish sightings. When available within the aquatic map, a Water Framework Directive (WFD) water type was determined as a proxy for environmental conditions, resulting in 1888 records at 615 different sites. Water types were then grouped together in main categories based on their similarity in environmental conditions: deep lakes and ponds, small lentic linear waters, slow flowing linear waters, large lentic linear waters, shallow lakes and ponds, weak brackish to saline waters and fast flowing waters. For each category the number of sites was counted per species.
