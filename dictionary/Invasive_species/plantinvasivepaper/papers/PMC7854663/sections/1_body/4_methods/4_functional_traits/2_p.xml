 </sup>. However, it does introduce a degree of uncertainty in the species by traits table. To address this issue uncertainty values were calculated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Traits taken from literature were scored as 1, traits assigned through expert judgement scored 0.5 and traits based on aquarium websites received a score of 0.1. For each functional trait these scores were added up, divided by the total number of species, multiplied by and subtracted from 100 to obtain percentage-based uncertainty values. The same calculation was performed for each species.
