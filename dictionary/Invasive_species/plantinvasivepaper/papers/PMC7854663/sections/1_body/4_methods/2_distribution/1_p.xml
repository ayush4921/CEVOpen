<p id="Par26">For the six species in the EIS dataset the number of occurrences (records at 3251 different sites in total) per year was plotted from the first introduction or documented sighting until 2015. Based on this data it appeared that crayfish records increased dramatically around 2007 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This was due to a strong increase in targeted monitoring by water authorities. Therefore, the more extensive and reliable data from 2007 to 2015 were used for our analyses. Each species was assigned a category of invasive success (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) according to the classification scheme by Blackburn et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, simplified by combining subcategories (B1, B2, B3) into main categories (B). This classification was performed based on three factors. First, the presence of juveniles or berried females (carrying eggs) as evidence for self-sustaining populations. Second, the number of sites where they were encountered classified into the categories B = 0, C =  &gt; 10, D =  &gt; 100 and E =  &gt; 1000. Thirdly, the spatial scale of the distribution range of each crayfish species in the Netherlands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) classified as C = local, D = regional and E = national.
