<p id="Par24">While not all traits studied appeared to contribute to crayfish invasion in the Netherlands, more successful invaders were distinguished by several traits. During establishment, being adapted to a temperate climate is mandatory for survival. Not having a low egg count is required for establishing a population, while producing more than a single clutch per year increases invasive potential. The importance of these traits for crayfish invasiveness is confirmed by literature. Some traits have less straightforward contributions to crayfish invasiveness: besides a temperate climate tolerance, being adapted to a cold climate can improve winter survival. A high level of aggression as seen in 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> might lead to exclusion of competitors and increase invasiveness. Parthenogenetic reproduction potentially contributed to 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic> passing through stages establishment and spread, and resistance to the crayfish plague has become another important invasion trait due to increased presence of North American crayfish species. Since specific combinations of the traits mentioned above lead to successful invaders, functional trait analysis can be a valuable tool in predicting invasiveness of non-indigenous crayfish species. Using these traits as a descriptive prediction tool, 
 <italic>P. virginalis</italic> is predicted to become a future successful invader in the Netherlands. This prediction conforms to predictions for 
 <italic>P. virginalis</italic> from previous risk assessment studies.
