<p id="Par11">The uncertainty of trait information differs per species as well as per trait (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), with an average uncertainty score across both species and traits of 9%. 
 <italic>Cherax boesemani</italic> and 
 <italic>C. papuanus</italic> showed the highest degree of uncertainty (35%). 
 <italic>Cambarellus diminitus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cambarellus patzcuarensis</italic> roughly had 20% uncertainty, while 
 <italic>Cambarellus puer</italic> had about 12%. The functional traits of both aggression and growth rate showed highest uncertainty (about 20%), closely followed by the traits of migration distance and number of clutches per year (about 17%).
