<p id="Par8">Several nonindigenous crayfish species were first observed in the Netherlands multiple decades ago, such as 
 <italic>Faxonius limosus, Astacus leptodactylus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> (1968, 1978, and 1985, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). More recently introduced species were 
 <italic>Faxonius virilis</italic> (2004), 
 <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic> (2005), and 
 <italic>Procambarus acutus</italic> (2007). The species found in the highest number of sites were 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> and 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic>, while 
 <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. leniusculus</italic> were recorded in the lowest number of sites. 
 <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic> was reported in two areas, each with multiple locations nearby. In contrast, 
 <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> had been found in multiple locations further apart from each other. 
 <italic>Faxonius virilis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. acutus</italic> were sighted at an intermediate number of sites. Although 
 <italic>F. virilis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. acutus</italic> hardly co-occurred, there was a similar pattern in sightings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) as both occur mainly within a limited region with sparse sightings in other regions. Although 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> and 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic> both occurred at many sites, there is a clear difference between their spatial distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The former was found mainly in the mid-west of the Netherlands, while the latter was spread more evenly throughout the entire country. Finally, 
 <italic>P. acutus</italic> showed relatively little overlap with 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic>, while 
 <italic>F. virilis</italic> did occur partially over the same geographical area as 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic>.
