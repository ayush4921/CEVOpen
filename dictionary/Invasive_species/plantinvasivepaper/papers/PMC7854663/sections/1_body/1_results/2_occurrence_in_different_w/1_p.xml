<p id="Par9">The occurrence of crayfish in different water types is species specific (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). 
 <italic>Procambarus clarkii</italic> occurred in waterbodies of all types but was mostly present in both shallow and deeper lakes and ponds and in larger, linear, lentic waterbodies such as canals. In contrast, 
 <italic>P. acutus</italic> was found only in small, linear, lentic waters (mainly man-made ditches and canals, all under 3 m deep and 15 m wide). While 
 <italic>F. virilis</italic> predominantly occurred in deep lakes and ponds, 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic> was distributed over multiple locations across all water types, except brackish and saline waters. Few crayfish were found in brackish and saline waters and fast flowing waters, only 
 <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> was found exclusively in these water types. 
 <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic> occurred only in slow flowing waters.
