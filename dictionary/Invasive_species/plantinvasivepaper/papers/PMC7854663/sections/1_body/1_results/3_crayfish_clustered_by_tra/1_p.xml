<p id="Par10">In the first two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) division all three 
 <italic>Cambarellus</italic> spp. and both 
 <italic>Cherax boesemani</italic> and 
 <italic>Cherax papuanus</italic> were separated based on their low egg production trait (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At the second division, the 
 <italic>Cambarellus</italic> spp. were separated from 
 <italic>C. boesemani</italic> and 
 <italic>C. papuanus</italic> due to the tropical native range of both 
 <italic>Cherax</italic> spp., contrasting to the temperate climate range of 
 <italic>Cambarellus</italic> spp. Both 
 <italic>Cherax destructor</italic> and 
 <italic>Cherax quadricarinatus</italic> were grouped based on their potential to lay over 1000 eggs, where the eight remaining species produce over 100 eggs on average. Of these species, 
 <italic>A. leptodactylus, F. virilis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. leniusculus</italic> were grouped based on the production of a single clutch of eggs per year, while the other crayfish produce multiple clutches. Finally, 
 <italic>P. acutus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> formed their own group due to a shorter lifespan of up to 2 years, while 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Procambarus alleni</italic> and 
 <italic>Procambarus virginalis</italic> in the last cluster can have a lifespan up to 3 to 4 years. Half of the clusters resulting from the TWINSPAN analysis include invasive species, whereas two groups consisted of exclusively invasive species. The eigenvalues associated with the divisions ranged from 0.320 to 0.531, indicating that the resulting groups were quite similar. While functional traits can have clear phylogenetic patterns, species from both genera 
 <italic>Procambarus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cherax</italic> can be found in multiple clusters. This shows that even within a crayfish genus traits can vary substantially. This is further supported by the inclusion of species from three different genera in cluster six.
