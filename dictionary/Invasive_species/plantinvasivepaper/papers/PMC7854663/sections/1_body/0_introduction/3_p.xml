 </sup> showed that 67% of high risk crayfish sold in Germany possess traits attractive for pet owners. They found such functional traits can be directly related to long-term presence of nonindigenous species in the aquarium trade and concluded that higher risk crayfish are selected for introduction due to popular traits (Table
