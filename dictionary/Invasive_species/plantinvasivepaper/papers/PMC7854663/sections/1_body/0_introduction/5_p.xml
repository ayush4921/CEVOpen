 </sup> classified the invasive potential of 77 species in the United States using a functional trait-based analysis. They identified species with a high latent risk to become invasive outside their native range, taking into account that certain traits can be more beneficial in specific stages of invasion. Their results showed that successful invasive crayfish were grouped together based on the traits large size, high fecundity and lentic, terrestrial and generalist habitat preferences. Zeng et al.

 </sup> and assessed which functional traits were associated with species progression to the stages of establishment and spread. Their analysis included human-associated traits such as non-commercial harvesting and ornamental trade. They found clutch size to be predictive of the spread stage. An invasiveness screening tool for fish was also adapted into the Freshwater Invertebrate Invasiveness Scoring Kit (FI-ISK) to assess the invasion risk of nonindigenous crayfish species in Italy, based partly on trait related information
