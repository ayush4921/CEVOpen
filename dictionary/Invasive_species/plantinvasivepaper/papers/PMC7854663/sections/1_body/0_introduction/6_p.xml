<p id="Par7">This paper aims to address the role that functional traits play in the transition of nonindigenous crayfish through the stages of establishment and spread to become fully invasive, and to determine which traits are associated with invasive success. To achieve this, the distribution, relation to their environment and the functional traits of nonindigenous crayfish species currently present in the Netherlands were assessed. The traits of successful and unsuccessful invasive species were compared to determine which specific traits allowed them to pass through the stages of invasion according to the Blackburn framework. Finally, the current invasion status of crayfish in the Netherlands was compared to predictions of invasion risk by other studies. Based on previous research
