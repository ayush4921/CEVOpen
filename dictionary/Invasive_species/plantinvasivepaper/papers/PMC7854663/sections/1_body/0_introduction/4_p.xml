 </sup> suggested a unified framework for biological invasions that combines aspects of both plant and animal ecology and focuses on human-mediated invasions. This framework describes the progressive stages of an invasion from transportation to fully invasive, including specific barriers for each stage (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A nonindigenous species only progresses through successive stages of invasion when it possesses barrier-specific functional traits
