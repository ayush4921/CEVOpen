Although long migration distances were only found in clusters that included invasive crayfish and five of the nine unsuccessful species have short migration distances, the short migration capacity of 
 <italic>F. virilis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. leniusculus</italic> implies that this trait did not clearly contribute to the invasive potential. Moving over land, while less effective than aquatic dispersal, could greatly increase dispersal in crayfish

 </sup>. While not all currently invasive crayfish can move over land, those that do vary in invasive success. The contribution of dispersal traits to invasiveness appears in our data to be outweighed by other traits. In addition, human mediated propagule pressure, such as repeated introduction through pet releases, could also be important during the spread stage by supporting dispersal
