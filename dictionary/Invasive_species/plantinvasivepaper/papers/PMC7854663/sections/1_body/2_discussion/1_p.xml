<p id="Par12">During the stages of invasion, different functional traits can contribute to invasive success of crayfish. Functional traits that separate successful from unsuccessful invaders were a medium egg count and temperate climate adaptation. Crayfish currently in the establishment stage of invasion were separated from fully invasive species by laying only a single clutch per year. The traits parthenogenesis and crayfish plague resistance, contrary to expectation, did not show a clear contribution to invasiveness. Hereafter, the role of functional traits in the invasion stages of establishment, spread, and fully invasive is discussed.</p>
