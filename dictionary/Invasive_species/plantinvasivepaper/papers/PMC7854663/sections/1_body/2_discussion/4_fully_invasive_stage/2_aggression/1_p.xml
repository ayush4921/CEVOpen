<p id="Par17">The level of aggression displayed by current invaders differs from low to high and consequently this trait did not explain invasion success. In contrast, other studies using chelae size as indicator for dominance and competitive ability did find this trait indicative of extraregional invasive success (species that have invaded another continent or crossed major drainage boundaries in their native continent)

 <italic>P. clarkii</italic>, which is mainly found in these waters, forcing 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic> and other species into less optimal water types

 </sup>. Although 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> has a high level of aggression and 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic> a low level of aggression, both are very successful invaders, indicating other traits might offer alternative strategies for high invasiveness.
