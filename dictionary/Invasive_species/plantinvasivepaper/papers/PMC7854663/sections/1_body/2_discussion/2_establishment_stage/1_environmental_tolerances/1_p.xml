 <italic>Cherax boesemani</italic> and 
 <italic>C. papuanus</italic> were separated from the 
 <italic>Cambarellus</italic> spp. based on their tropical native range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). All currently invasive crayfish are adapted to a temperate climate in their native range, most probably a requirement for invasive success in the Netherlands with a temperate ocean climate (Köppen-Geiger: Cfb). All invasive species, except 
 <italic>P. clarkii,</italic> also occur in colder climates in their native range, further stressing that adaptation to cold periods can be very useful to survive European Atlantic winters. Larson &amp; Olden

 </sup> reported niche shifts in 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. leniusculus</italic> with decreased mean maximum temperature and increased minimum temperature variance in comparison to their native range, suggesting that crayfish may survive different climatic condition in their invasive ranges. A separate study confirmed 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic>’s cold tolerance through experimental exposure to winter temperatures in a temperate climate

 </sup>. In contrast, 
 <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> did not survive these experimental conditions, which matches the expectations based on its tropical and arid climate native range. A mismatch between a species’ tolerances and environment means that survival is only potentially possible at locations exhibiting extraordinary environmental circumstances, as was the case where a population of 
 <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> occurred in an oxbow lake in Slovenia with increased temperatures due to occurrence of hot water springs
