<p id="Par21">Early detection of 
 <italic>P. virginalis</italic> introductions is highly important to make informed management decisions, therefore we recommend preventative monitoring. A potential tool for this is environmental DNA monitoring, which has already been successfully applied for targeted detection of 
 <italic>P. virginalis</italic> in several lakes and rivers in Germany
 <sup>

 </sup>. In Norway, eDNA detection of invasive crayfish and the spread of the crayfish plague worked so well that it has been adopted in multiple surveillance programmes

 </sup>. Although not yet suitable for assessing species abundance, presence/absence data can reliably be obtained in Dutch water systems using high throughput sequencing techniques and potentially be gathered through non-targeted monitoring
 <sup>

 </sup>. An advantage of such approach would possibly provide early detection of 
 <italic>P. virginalis</italic> or other invasive crayfish during routine eDNA sampling efforts of Dutch water authorities. Additionally, targeted monitoring could be informed by predictions of invasive crayfish distribution through ecological niche models (ENM) and species distribution models (SDM)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>. Examples of such predictions are ENMs composed for 
 <italic>C. destructor</italic>, 
 <italic>P. leniusculus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup> and SDMs developed for 
 <italic>P. leniusculus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. carkii</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>, which show their potential geographic distributions currently and under the impacts of climate change, respectively.
