<p id="Par22">Several factors determining the resistance of native communities to non-indigenous species, such as predation and competition, increase with native species richness. Disturbance of aquatic habitats by human activities often reduces local biodiversity, and consequently the resistance of native communities to invasion

 </sup> found that increased environmental disturbance and resource availability both significantly contributed to successful invasions. Furthermore, an increase in number of people does increase the chance onto a higher propagule pressure and at the same an increase in environmental pressure providing more opportunity for invasive species. The only crayfish native to the Netherlands, 
 <italic>Astacus astacus</italic>, has almost gone extinct due to the crayfish plague, opening up a niche space for non-indigenous species. Such niche vacancies can also occur due to anthropogenic environmental influences, e.g., Fr√ºh et al.

 </sup> reported that German river and stream sites with invasive species were significantly more degraded than sites without non-indigenous species. In the Netherlands, many waters have been thoroughly altered and many are created by humans. Anthropogenic disturbance might have facilitated invasiveness; the distribution of

 <italic>F. virilis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. acutus</italic> is centred around the largest cities in the Netherlands and nearby densely populated areas, where anthropogenic disturbances are intense.
