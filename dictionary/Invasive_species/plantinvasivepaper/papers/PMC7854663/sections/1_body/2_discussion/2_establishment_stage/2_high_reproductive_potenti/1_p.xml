 <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> were currently not successful invaders. For 
 <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> its climate tolerance could be the cause, however, 
 <italic>C. destructor</italic> has been shown capable to survive under temperate climate winter temperatures

 </sup>. Therefore, a different trait likely determines its lack of invasive success. Besides the number of eggs per clutch, the number of clutches produced also affects invasiveness: the most successful invaders 
 <italic>P. clarkii</italic> and 
 <italic>F. limosus</italic> are capable of laying more than a single clutch per year. Larson &amp; Olden

 </sup> also reported the trait multiple annual reproductive events to be associated with invasive success, which supports our findings. Most crayfish species currently in the establishment and spread phases produce one clutch of eggs and are moderately successful. Although capable of producing three or more clutches, 
 <italic>C. destructor</italic> is unsuccessful, suggesting it might lack other important traits.
