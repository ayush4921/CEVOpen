<p id="Par28">Spatial dimension introduces complexity, though rigorous mathematical analysis is still viable for a small population with few small sub-populations. This situation may arise with an accidentally transferred population. Here, we consider infinitesimally small populations to be rare for invasive species and derive an asymptotic value of the growth rate to the size of the area inhabited by the population.</p>
