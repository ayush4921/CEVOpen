<p id="Par22">We considered stratified dispersals of the invader species. Note that we explicitly considered invader species’ dispersal but their vectors’ movement (e.g., human traffics) was included only implicitly. The short-distance dispersal expands the species’ range only by a constant velocity

Empirical observations showed that long-distance dispersal mediated by human activities introduces a new sub-population to an area at a long distance from its source population, e.g., vehicles can move plant seeds for more than hundreds of kilometers
