<p id="Par15">When spatial heterogeneity of vector density controls the number of dispersers (i.e., a source function) only, the total number of dispersers produced from a population depends on the spatial arrangement of sub-populations. This was caused by a selection of population area in the analyses of the models. If sub-populations cover most of the area, the total number of dispersers will be very close to its expected value. Alternatively, if a population consists of a few small colonies, the total number of dispersers produced varies depending on the actual spatial distribution of the sub-populations. Therefore, spatial heterogeneity in the source function introduces uncertainty in the early phase of population dynamics, which diminishes as the population establishes and expands.</p>
