<p id="Par17">The spatial factor can be reduced by decreasing the dispersal frequency or attractiveness of an area with a high density of dispersal vectors. Therefore, if both source and destination functions influence dispersal success, our model suggests potential eradication success through simultaneous strategies that effectively weaken dispersals between core areas, where colonies tend to produce more propagules than other areas. Similar control strategies focusing on core populations have been suggested by metapopulation models

 </sup>. On the accidental transfer of aquatic species by ballast water or attaching to boats, the number of boats in a port approximates both the inflow (destination function) and outflow (source function) of invader species’ propagules. In addition, using the common assumption of stationarity in the number of boats in each port

 </sup>, the attractiveness and the dispersal frequency of each port also becomes stationary. This introduces time-invariant correlations between the attractiveness and the dispersal frequency of a sub-population. Our results suggest that this correlation between attractiveness and dispersal frequency introduced by a stationary density of boats points to the importance of core populations. Similar discussions may also be applicable to accidental transfers of terrestrial small organisms attaching to vehicles and machinery, which is an important pathway for spreading insect invaders
