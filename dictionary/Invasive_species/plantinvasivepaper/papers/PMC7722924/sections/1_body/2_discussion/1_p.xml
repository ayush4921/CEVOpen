<p id="Par13">In this study, we considered two mechanisms of spatial heterogeneity involved in long-distance dispersal: spatially heterogeneous source functions and spatially heterogeneous destination functions. We analyzed these mechanisms to clarify how heterogeneous distributions of dispersal vectors influence regional population dynamics. Our results show that a combination of these mechanisms, not either of them in isolation, addresses spatial effects on the asymptotic growth rate in the initial success of establishing a population.</p>
