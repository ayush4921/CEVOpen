<p id="Par16">The most notable outcome from our three model settings is that spatial heterogeneity influences initial population growth only when the source and the destination functions are both heterogeneous and are spatially correlated (Supplemental Information SI 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Source and destination correlation results in a higher initial rate of propagule production. On the other hand, after the population covers most of an area, its expansion slows because dispersers are rarely introduced to remaining open areas because of their very low values of the destination function. In this situation, instead of establishing in these open areas, most dispersers are transferred to already populated areas. Among three types of models investigated in this study, only the full models relate spatial heterogeneity with an asymptotic growth rate, which is a key determinant of both extinction probability and invasiveness. The spatial factor we derived here can be considered to be a measure of correlations between the source and the destination functions (without subtracting mean values). Therefore, the full model type is distinct from the others for its ability to determine the effects of long-distance dispersals in the population dynamics of an invading species, especially on the species’ responses to control strategies.
