 </sup>. The asymptotic growth rates in our models are essentially the same formulation as a spatially homogeneous model, with a larger influence of contributions from short-distance dispersal than those of long-distance dispersal. Thus, we expect a larger influence from the proportional change of the short-distance dispersal speed (i.e., expansion speed at edges) than from the frequency of long-distance dispersal

 </sup>. Note that influences from short- and long-distance dispersals on the asymptotic growth rate in our models are multiplicative rather than additive. Therefore, the measures of the additive effects of parameters can indicate a stronger influence from long-distance than short-distance dispersal
