<p id="Par14">When spatial heterogeneity in vector density controls the destinations of long-distance dispersers (i.e., a destination function) in isolation, our modeling suggests that once the population covers a large proportion of available area, there is a delay in population expansion. In a spatially heterogeneous destination, the population aggregates in areas of higher value, resulting in missed dispersal opportunities by re-establishing in areas already occupied by existing sub-populations. This scenario is applicable to introductions of a species to remote areas arrive from outside the focal area (e.g. from forestry plantations to urban areas).</p>
