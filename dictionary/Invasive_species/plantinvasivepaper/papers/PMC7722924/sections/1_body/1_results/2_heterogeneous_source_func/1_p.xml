<p id="Par10">When the source function was spatially heterogeneous but the destination function was homogeneous (source-mediated-dispersal models), colonies scattered on the space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and the length of the early growth period varied greatly relative to those other types of models (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, red squares). The lengths of the establishment periods of the source-mediated-dispersal models responded positively to the spatial factor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, red squares). Periods of subsequent phases (expansion and naturalization) of the source-mediated-dispersal models did not respond to the spatial factor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c,d, red squares). Therefore, spatially heterogeneous source function can induce large fluctuations in the establishment of a population, but has little effect on the later phases of establishment and expansion.
