 </sup> to derive a factor for determining how heterogeneous environments influence the early population dynamics of invasive species. We considered a finite-sized continuous area that is parametrized by two spatial functions, (1) intensities to attract dispersers of the invasive species (destination function) and (2) intensities to produce dispersers of the invasive species (source function). Those two spatial functions describe how spatial heterogeneity influences long-distance dispersal of the invasive species. In this study, we defined and investigated three types of models (1) destination-mediated-dispersal models (spatially heterogeneous destination function and uniform source function), (2) source-mediated-dispersal models (spatially uniform destination function and heterogeneous source function), and (3) full models of which destination and source functions are spatially heterogeneous. By comparing analytical investigations with spatially explicit stochastic models, we demonstrated how to predict early population dynamics for initial control success with considering spatial heterogeneity of dispersal.
