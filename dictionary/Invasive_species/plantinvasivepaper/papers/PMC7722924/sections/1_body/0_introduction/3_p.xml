<p id="Par4">Dispersal of organisms consists of several different processes, e.g., processes mediated by species’ inherent dispersal ability and human transfer, and those processes may have different shapes of their dispersal kernels. Among invasive species often human activities mediate their dispersal that allow rapid range expansions

Therefore, invasive species’ range expansion is better modeled as a stratified dispersal that considers more than one processes is involved in the spread of the invasive species
