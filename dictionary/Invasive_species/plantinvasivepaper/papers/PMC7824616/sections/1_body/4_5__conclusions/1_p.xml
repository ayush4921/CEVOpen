<p>The various phenomena of the colonization and vegetation succession that occur in the vicinity of the mine were determined by three main factors: the type of substrate, especially the type of the fraction (sands and clays), hydration (overdried areas vs. areas that are flooded with water), and the environment (degenerated oak-hornbeam forest). The development of the plant cover was faster than the soil cover formation, which is shown by the example of succession on sands. On the overdried sites, the older stages of succession resemble the forest with 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> in the vicinity of the mine. The occurrence of this species in the study area was possible due to the propagule pressure (fruits, seeds) of 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> from the adjacent forest, which was confirmed by other studies. 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> is only able to invade dry sites, and on wet sites, its spread and abundance is strongly constrained. On flat sites that are flooded with water, only willow (
 <italic>Salix</italic> spp) can thrive. Thus, differences in hydrology causes a niche shift of woody species.
