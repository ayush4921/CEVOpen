<p>The aforementioned species, Black locust 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L., is a legume tree that is native to North America and has been present in Europe since the beginning of 17th century and in Poland as a naturalized tree since mid-19th century. The species is considered to be invasive at least in nine European countries including, among others, Austria, Czechia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It was deliberately introduced into Poland as an ornamental tree by gardeners, as a timber tree by foresters and as a way to improve the quality of the soil, namely, to enrich it with nitrogen. Currently, it is a species that is widespread in the country except for north-eastern part where it occurs less abundantly [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It frequently colonizes xerothermic meadow communities, dry forests, agricultural land, roadsides, as well as urban and industrial areas [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a result of nitrogen fixation via symbiosis with the 
 <italic>Frankia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. bacteria in stands that are occupied by the Black locust the amount of nitrogen in the humus profile can be more than three-fold higher than it was originally [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, it can change the properties of an ecosystem, which can lead to the displacement of oligotrophic and acidophilic species and the appearance of nitrophilic species [

 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It can also have an impact on the light conditions. In the stands in which this species dominates, the decrease in the size of the crowns is smaller and the cover of leaves is shorter than that of other deciduous trees [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This change in conditions promotes light-demanding species including herbaceous plants, especially grasses and geophytes, at the expense of the survival of the seedlings of shade-loving species, thereby strengthening and consolidating the effect of the conversion of a forest stand. Apart from plants, the species also has a negative influence on animals, e.g., birds. It was reported that it causes a decrease in the diversity of specialists to the benefit of the generalists [

 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> has invaded dry areas near disused gravel-sand mines. It is troublesome plant that can change the direction of spontaneous succession on these sites. Two final stages of vegetation development are also likely to form: shrubby grasslands or 
 <italic>Robinia</italic> groves [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Taking into account that the species can also be encountered in alluvial habitats, we wondered whether it could thrive equally in both the dry and wet habitats that occur at the studied mine. Therefore, we studied the hydrological and hydrochemical properties of the water that could affect vegetation and observed the species composition of the vegetation along the environmental gradients in the vicinity of the mine.
