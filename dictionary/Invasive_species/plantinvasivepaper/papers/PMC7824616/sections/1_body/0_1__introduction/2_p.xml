<p>In this study we selected a site that is characterized by a wide diversity of morphological conditions (excavations, landfills, settling tanks) as well as water relations and hydrochemical characteristics. It is the opencast mine “Wójcice” where gravel and sand, which form bedrock of this area, are exploited. This mine, which is situated in southern Poland, has arable fields (corn plantations) and a forest in which 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> grows in close proximity. The territory of the mine has not yet been subjected to land reclamation because it is still active. Due to the legally sanctioned necessity to reclaiming degraded land in the future, the area of mine will be reclaimed. Three forms of management are being employed—forest reclamation, aquatic reclamation, and mining waste disposal [
