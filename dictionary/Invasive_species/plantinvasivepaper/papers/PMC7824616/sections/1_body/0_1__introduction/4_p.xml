<p>The main objective of the research was to in order determine whether the natural succession at this mine is under pressure from 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic>. The specific goals were to answer the following questions: How do the water affect the vegetation and 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> in the vicinity of the mine? Are there any differences in the contribution of 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> on the sites that differ in the amount of moisture and land relief? What is the approximate age at which the species forms a monodominant stand? What are the other environmental factors that control the development of the vegetation in the vicinity of the mine?
