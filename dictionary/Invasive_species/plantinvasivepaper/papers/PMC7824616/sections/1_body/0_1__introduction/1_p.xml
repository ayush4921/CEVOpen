<p>Botanical studies that were conducted on opencast mines including sand mines revealed that spontaneous revegetation and forestry reclamation yielded congruent results: the species richness and the length of time required to achieve the stage of forest vegetation is similar. In addition, vegetation in abandoned sand mines can be more diverse in terms of species diversity [

Depending on the geological substrate (e.g., gypsum, granite), the species composition of the flora is the result of the habitat requirements of the species that are colonizing excavations [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Usually, annual and stress tolerators prefer such extreme habitats [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A similar phenomenon occurs in gravel opencast mines where sand is not the mineral being exploited, but is regarded waste that can be disposed of which form sand heaps. The aforementioned processes of natural revegetation can be disturbed by the appearance of invasive alien species. Usually, invasive species as well as ruderal plants can only occur during the younger successional stages and then disappear after a few years. However, under favorable conditions, some species such as 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L. can develop and change the direction of succession and finally form a monodominant stand [
