<p>A Nonmetrical Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis showed a large variation in the species composition of vegetation among the study sites. The vegetation of the study sites differed significantly from each other according to a centroid analysis using passive vector matching (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.74, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The total cover of plants, species richness, and the value of Shannon-Wiener significantly explained gradient of the vegetational changes from a wetland to forest communities (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.013, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011), respectively. The Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) indicators for moisture and nitrogen were also significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012), respectively. All of these variables are associated with the first axis of NMDS (
