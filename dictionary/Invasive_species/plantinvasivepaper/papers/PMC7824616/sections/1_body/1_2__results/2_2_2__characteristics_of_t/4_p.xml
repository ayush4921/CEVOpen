<p>According to the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), the only significant habitat factors are the content of floatable parts (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and the content of phosphorus (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Higher values of these factors are associated with the wetland plots on clay material and to some degree with the forest plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). On these sites, there were differences in the frequency of mature trees and saplings (G = 9.858, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01981, and G = 11.366, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009904), respectively, whereas the differences in the frequency of the seedlings of 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> among the habitats were not significant (G = 2.7291, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.4353). There were no significant differences in the cover abundance. Only a few individuals of Black locust were found in the WT and the ST habitats (
