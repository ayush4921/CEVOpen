<p>The ionic composition of the water is dominated by bicarbonate anions (about 27%, 2.55 mval/L) and calcium cations (29%, 2.7 mval/L) (

The water of the sedimentation tank is characterized by an average value of electrolytic conductivity of 360 μS/cm and neutral (pH~7) pH. A characteristic feature of the water is the trace amounts of biogenic substances—nitrogen and phosphorus. The average concentration of nitrates (NO
