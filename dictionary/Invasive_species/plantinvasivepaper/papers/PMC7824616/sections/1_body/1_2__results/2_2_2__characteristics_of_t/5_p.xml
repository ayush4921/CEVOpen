<p>There were significant differences in the total plant cover. The highest mean values were found for the study plots in the adjacent forest and the lowest were found on the sandy sediments that are flooded with pulp. The highest value of the Shannon-Wiener index was found for the forests and heaps of sand, and the lowest for the wetlands and the sandy bottom of the sedimentation tank. The highest EIV values for light and temperature were observed for the sandy bottom of the sedimentation tank followed by the sand heaps. The EIV for moisture was highest in the wetlands and they also were the characterized by the highest content of phosphorus and floating parts (
