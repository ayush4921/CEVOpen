<p>The grass 
 <italic>Calamagrostis epigejos</italic> occurs significantly more often in the sand heaps and in the forest (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00040-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, on the study site SH, on which the sand is stabilized by the roots of the grasses 
 <italic>Corynephorus canescens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> L. dominated, Black locust (
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic>) also occurs. The final stage of succession is the formation of black locust thickets or a black locust forest (study site SH), willow scrubs (study site ST), and a mosaic of rushes and willow scrubs (study site WT).
