<p>On the study sites, a total of 101 taxa were found, including 94 vascular plant species, 7 moss species and lichens (
 <italic>Cladonia</italic> sp) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00040">Supplementary Materials Table S1</xref>). Additionally, there was a cover of algae but the species were not identified. On the 30 research plots, from 3 to 20 (on average 8.9 species) were recorded per plot. Species of rush and reed beds (the 
 <italic>Phragmitetea</italic> R. Tx. et Prsg 1942 class), sand swards (the 
 <italic>Koelerio glaucae-Corynephoretea canescentis</italic> Klika in Klika et Novak 1941 class), meadow communities (the 
 <italic>Molinio-Arrhenatheretea</italic> R.Tx. 1937 class) and scrub-forest were also found. On the study sites, which include SH—sand heaps, ST—a sandy bottom of the sedimentation tank, and WT—wetlands, there are several stages and processes that caused succession: colonization by algae and mosses on clay material in the first stage of succession around bird feces (study site WT) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-plants-10-00040">Appendix A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f0A2">Figure A2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f0A3">Figure A3</xref>) and colonization by grassland species on the desiccated parts of the settling tank (study site SH), while on the sandy material periodically flooded with pulp, algae and moss grow (study ST). In the second stage of succession, shrubs or biogroups of saplings (willows 
 <italic>Salix purpurea</italic> L., 
 <italic>S. fragilis</italic> L.—study site ST) occur and on study site WT, 
 <italic>S. purpurea</italic> mainly occurs. According to the Indicator Species analysis (ISA), sand heaps are characterized by one indicatory species, 
 <italic>Picris hieracioides</italic> L., whereas the grass 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> is the only species that is significantly affiliated to the sandy bottom of sedimentation tanks. The wetlands had five indicatory species and the highest number, nine, was growing in the adjacent forest, which was the control. The species 
 <italic>Oenothera biennis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Saponaria officinalis</italic> L. had a high IndVal value in the two sandy habitats.
