<p>The places that periodically flooded with pulp, which are outside the coastal zone of the water reservoir is where the patches of communities built by willows formed: the crack willow 
 <italic>Salix fragilis</italic>, the purple willow 
 <italic>S. purpurea</italic>, and the almond willow 
 <italic>S. trandria</italic>. They are mainly shrub communities and there are only a few species per plot where an important phenomenon occurs, namely leaf fall. There is an enormous body of literature about the role of leaf decomposition and its impact on the soil properties specifically enriching the soil with nutrients and circulating matter [
