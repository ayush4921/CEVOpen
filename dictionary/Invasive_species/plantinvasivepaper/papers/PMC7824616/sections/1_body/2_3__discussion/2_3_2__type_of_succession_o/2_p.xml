<p>The wetland habitat where study site WT was established differs in both moisture and material—mainly clays. In addition, animal activities play an important role in a succession. It seems that the processes of habitat modification and the facilitation of succession are initiated by bird excrement and algae (enrichment of the habitat in nutrients) and that the ground is stabilized by willow roots and their leaves falling. At the shoreline of the tank, bird tracks (mainly ducks) and their excrement and algae colonies form around them. The impact of bird feces on the circulation of nutrients and the formation of ecosystems has been described in many regions of the world and environments, e.g., in forests [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Bird feces are primarily a source of phosphorus. This is confirmed by our research, where the highest reported values of phosphorus are in the area of wetlands (

The rush communities that occur in the vicinity of the mine are characterized by a small number of species in the relevé from 5 to 11 with an average of 8.4 and the Shannon-Wiener index is 1.19. This is typical for the rush communities here, which are mainly built by the reed
