<p>A summary of the directions of succession and individual phases of the development of vegetation is presented in the diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The processes of colonization and succession in this study resemble the processes that was described in the Błędowska Desert by Rahmonov [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similar to that study, this is a primary succession on sand where algae, mosses, and vascular plants that are typical for dry, xerothermic habitats play an important role. It is also typical that the soil development is slower than the development of the plant cover. It is noteworthy that the changes are progressive in terms of the increase in the number of species and coverage. This pattern is consistent with most similar studies [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but is contrary to the results of Kompała-Bąba and Bąba [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] where the number of species decreased and the role of dominants increased in a sand pit.
