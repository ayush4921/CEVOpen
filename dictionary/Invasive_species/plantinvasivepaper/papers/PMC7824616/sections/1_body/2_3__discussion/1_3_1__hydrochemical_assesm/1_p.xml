<p>The detected double-ion domination of bicarbonate ions and calcium is a common hydrochemical type of water that occurs in nature [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The values of electrolytic conductivity and pH are comparable to those found in most anthropogenic water bodies [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The trace amounts of nutrients in the water are another factor that limits colonization. The lack of nutrients in the water is a consequence of the closed water cycle in the sedimentation tank. The water flows through reeds that are located in the sedimentation tank, which removes nutrients from the water. In this case, the sedimentation tank acts as a “hydrophytic treatment plant”. The high efficiency of the settling tank also purified the suspended matter. In the pulp discharge zone, the water turbidity exceeded 100 NTU and in the re-entry zone was about 50 NTU. The periodic flooding with water in the settling tank affects the development of the vegetation on study site WT (wetland) and sporadically on study site ST (sedimentation tanks).
