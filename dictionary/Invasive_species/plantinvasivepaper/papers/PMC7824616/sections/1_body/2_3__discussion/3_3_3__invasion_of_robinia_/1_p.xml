<p>In the later stages of succession in the vicinity of the mine the Black locust 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> occurs primarily on the sands (study sites 1 and 2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). In the vicinity of the mine, Black locust individuals in almost all stages of succession occur. Various herbaceous species grow under the canopy of trees, first forming biogroups, then thickets, and finally a compact Black locust forest. The estimated time for this type of forest to develop is about 25 years (based on the observation of the mine personnel). This is a shorter time compared to other results [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] where succession proceeded toward stabilized, (semi-) natural vegetation with an 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> contribution within 40 years. The thickets and forest with 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> are characterized by a lower species richness (maximum 20 species per plot) and low values of Shannon-Wiener index, which is congruent with the general trend. In other habitats, even those with natural forest conditions, the 
 <italic>Robinia</italic> forest were species poor [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our study, the largest individuals in this phase of the Black locust forest on sandy habitats were about 8 m high and had ca 5 to 13 cm of diameter at breast height (DBH), whereas the largest stems in adjacent forest had a DBH that was no larger than 16 cm. Thus, all of them can be classified as early-successional trees and shrubs of Black locust [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The research results show that the older stages of succession, especially on the sand heaps, are similar to the forest in the area in terms of its structure and species composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Based on the species composition, it can be concluded that the adjacent forest resembles the human-cultivated forest 
 <italic>Chelidonio-Robinietum</italic> Jurko 1963 s.l. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Taking into account the relatively small distance from the adjacent forest to the territory of the mine including the sandy habitats, the transport of seeds by the wind could be efficient enough to disperse this plant. It was reported that seeds can be transported by wind on the ground up to 67 m from a single mother plant [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The nearby forest with 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> is a probable source of the propagules of black locust in the habitats in the vicinity of the sand-gravel mine. The presence of water directly affected the performance of 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic>. It was not found in the distinguished study plots in the areas that flooded. This contradicts the findings that they can occupy alluvial sites and previously flooded area [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, these authors also state that the species does not occur in wetlands or the parts of alluvial forests that have frequent and long-term waterlogging and in which the soils are compact. In the present study, 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> was not found anywhere in the wetlands and in areas that got flooded, there are only a few individuals. The hydrochemical properties of water do not matter at all, especially because they are typical for the majority of surface water in Poland.
