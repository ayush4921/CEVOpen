<p>The study area (the Wójcice mine) is the territory of an open cast mine. The mineral aggregate deposits are mined using the underwater method, which is conducted in the dam reservoir zone of the “Nysa Lake”. The output is rinsed and screened (sorted) in order to remove the smallest fractions (mainly sand and clay). While the water for rinsing is taken from “Nysa Lake”, it is circulated in a closed cycle. After passing through the sedimentation tank, it is used in material sorting processes once again. The lake water is only used to compensate for any technological losses. Of the mineral aggregates that are mined, only the gravel is sold. As a result, the fractions of highly hydrated pulp that are separated are hydraulically transported to the sedimentation tank where it undergoes sedimentation and dehydration (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-plants-10-00040">Appendix A</xref>). The pulp is a by-product of the mine, which cannot be sold due to its specific properties. In the sedimentation tank, thickest fractions are separated in the first part of the sedimentation (sands with a small admixture of gravels) after which the fine-grained dust and clay fraction is separated (mainly in the water zone of the settling tank). The sludge that is deposited in the settling tank is characterized by characteristic lamination, which is a consequence of cyclic pulp inflows (

This is called the exploitation of the anthropogenic deposit, which are primarily heaps of sand that are unstabilized and heavily desiccated (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-plants-10-00040">Appendix A</xref>). The analysis of the vegetation mapping, type of substratum, degree of moisture and age of the sedimentation tank enabled four research study sites to be distinguished (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00040-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and within them 30 study plots (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00040-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These were 1—sand heaps (SH), 2—sandy bottom of sedimentation tank (ST) 3—wetlands (WT), and 4—reference site (R, adjacent forest). The reference site was a forest with a high contribution of 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> in its tree layer. Based on the species composition, the forest can be classified as a degenerated oak-hornbeam forest 
 <italic>Tilio-Carpinetum</italic>. Taking into account the internal diversity of the succession stages and the surface area of the distinguished habitats, a total of 30 study plots of 5 m × 5 m were established. During the vegetation season from the end of March to the end of August, soil and botanical studies were carried out and at the site of the discharge of the pulp onto the surface of the settling tank, hydrochemical studies of water were performed.
