<p>Within the study plots, a floristic inventory was taken (vascular plants and bryophytes) and a modified Braun-Blanquet approach was performed [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In total, 30 phytosociological relev√©s were taken at all of the distinguished study sites. The cover abundance of the recorded plants was visually estimated in % (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 ... 100) and the total cover using the Canopy Cover Free 1.03 application for mobile devices with the Android system and canopyscope [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] with our own modifications [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] were used to assess the tree canopy. Based on the occurrence and cover abundance of the species, the Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) were calculated [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The cover-weighted EIV were calculated for light (L), temperature (T), moisture (F), and soil reaction (R). The EIV for nitrogen (N) was not considered because the soil samples were analyzed for N
 <sub>T</sub> and the continentality K was not applicable in this study. The nomenclature for the species follows the Euro+MedPlantBase [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], whereas the syntaxonomical nomenclature follows the Guide for Plant Communities in Poland [
