<p>The statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in the R software [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) using indicator value, i.e., IndVal—the indicator value that indicates the magnitude of species affinity and the p-value of the statistical significance were also calculated (package 
 <italic>indicspecies</italic>). Based on the collected vegetation data, the biodiversity indices were calculated: the number of species (S), the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’), and the species evenness (E), as well as the sum of the species cover (COVER). Next, Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was conducted to examine the variability direction of the analyzed vegetation. For the NMDS, the data was log-transformed. In order to examine the differences in the species composition of vegetation among the four study sites, the centroids representing the vegetation of a given study site was analyzed using the vector fitting method. The same test (999 permutations) was used to fit the biodiversity indices to the ordination result as passive vectors, which were plotted as an NMDS biplot. In order to investigate the influence of the habitat factors pH, total nitrogen content, phosphorus and percentage fraction of the floating parts of the substratum (fraction &lt; 0.05 mm) on the species composition, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed, and the significance of the habitat factors was also assessed using the permutation test (999 iterations). The biodiversity indices and ordination were analyzed using the 
 <italic>vegan</italic> package. In turn, the significance of the differences in the biodiversity indices and habitat factors was analyzed using a non-parametric equivalent of the analysis of variance ANOVA, i.e., Asymptotic K-Sample Fisher-Pitman Permutation Test [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] followed by a post-hoc Conover test. The significance of the differences in the frequency of 
 <italic>R. pseudoacacia</italic> was tested by G-test using the 
 <italic>DescTools</italic> package. The significance was assumed at a level of 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
