<p>The hydrology was mapped according to the guidelines by Gutry-Korycka, Werner-Więckowska [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00040" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. During the research, ten water samples with the pulp that were floating to the surface of the settling tank were collected. The basic physical and chemical properties of water (temperature, pH, oxygen saturation) and redox potential were measured directly in the field using a YSI EDS 6600 multi-parameter probe (US production). Prior to each test, the probe was calibrated using the standard solutions. During the fieldwork, water samples were also collected for the chemical analyses. The samples for the laboratory analyses were placed into 0.5 L polyethylene bottles. The water samples were transported to the laboratory at +4 °C. They were filtered on a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore). Laboratory analyses included determining the main cations and anions in the water: Ca

 <sup>2−</sup>, Cl
 <sup>−</sup>, NO
