 <caption>
  <p>Population growth rate of 
   <italic>A. petiolata</italic> over time. Points represent mean growth rate across sites, lines and shaded areas represent marginal means and 95% CI based on linear mixed model predictions (
   <italic>N</italic> = 1000 bootstrap samples). Population growth rates are estimated only for time spans for which demographic data are complete (missing years of data at some sites truncate the data available to estimate growth rates) and do not necessarily reflect population size at the end of the study. Values above and below one indicate the population is projected to grow or decline respectively. Model included random intercept effects for site.
