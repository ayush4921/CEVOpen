<p>We standardised the time axis as date when monitoring was initiated at each site. Initial analyses indicated a nonlinear relationship between 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> performance measures and time. Therefore, we employed generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to evaluate change in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> performance over time. Generalised additive models are a nonparametric approach that can account for nonlinear relationships through splines (Hastie and Tibshirani,
