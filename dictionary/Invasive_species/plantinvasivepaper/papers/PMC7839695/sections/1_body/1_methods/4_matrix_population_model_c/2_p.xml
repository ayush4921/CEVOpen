<p>We calculated the dominant eigenvalue of each matrix to determine projected growth rates (λ). At λ &gt; 1 populations are expected to grow; at λ &lt; 1 declines are projected; and at λ = 1 populations are expected to remain stable (Caswell, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). We evaluated change in λ over the monitoring period with a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) with site as a random factor and a first order autocorrelation structure. Models evaluated second order polynomial effects of year, initial 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> density, continental region (Northeast or Midwest) and their second order interactions. We constructed simplified models by removing one term at a time in a hierarchical fashion and retained lower‐level terms if an interaction or polynomial term was included in the model. We evaluated competing models with AICc (Burnham and Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) and followed the same procedure as described above to remove models that appeared legitimate but were not because they contained uninformative parameters (Arnold,
