<p>We established a long‐term monitoring program to document local baseline population dynamics that would allow us to separate annual population fluctuations from potential future impacts of specialised biocontrol herbivores (Blossey 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Our criteria for selecting study sites included forest size &gt; 2 ha, presence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> &gt; 3 years and protection from management (fire, herbicide, weeding or cutting) for at least 10 years. We selected 16 forested sites across northeastern North America (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) ranging in latitude from 39.4 to 42.7 degrees and in longitude from −74.1 to −89.2 degrees. These locations represent a transect through 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> invasion history in North America (Nuzzo, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Depending on location, we established sites between 2000 and 2006, and monitored them regularly for 5 to 15 years following a standardised monitoring protocol (Blossey and Nuzzo, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>).
