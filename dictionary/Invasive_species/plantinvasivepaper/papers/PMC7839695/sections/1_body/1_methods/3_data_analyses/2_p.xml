<p>We evaluated long‐term changes in adult density, June cover of adults and seedlings, mean adult stem height per quadrat, and mean number of siliques/stem/quadrat (hereafter referred to as silique number) via separate models (with Gaussian errors) applied to log‐transformed (adult density, cover and silique number) or raw (stem height) data. Models included random intercept effects for calendar year and nested effects for site and quadrat within site, as well as a random slope for monitoring year. We ran a separate GAMM model with binomial errors to evaluate changes in proportion of quadrats with 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> presence in June.
