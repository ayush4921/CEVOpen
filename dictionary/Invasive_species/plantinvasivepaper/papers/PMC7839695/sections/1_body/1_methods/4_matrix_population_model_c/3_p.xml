<p>We constructed multiyear projection matrices, 
 <bold>B</bold>, for each study site to capture cumulative demographic trends over the study period. The matrix was estimated as the product of annual transition matrices, such that 
 <bold>B</bold>

 <bold>A</bold>
 <sub>site.n</sub>
 <bold>A</bold>
 <sub>site.n‐1</sub>… 
 <bold>A</bold>
 <sub>site.n=1</sub>; where 
 <italic>n</italic> = years monitored (Caswell,

 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). We estimated the cumulative growth rate over the whole period (λ

 <bold>B</bold> and time‐averaged growth rates per site (λ
 <sub>year.site</sub>) over the study period as n
 <sup>th</sup> root of λ
