<p>At each site we established 20–26 0.5 m
 <sup>2</sup> (1 m × 0.5 m) permanent quadrats (marking corners with PVC stakes) along two to four randomly established transects. We placed the first quadrat at random in an existing 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> patch and spaced additional quadrats at 10 m intervals. We shifted quadrat locations as necessary to ensure that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> rosettes or adults were present in every quadrat, except for two sites in Michigan where some quadrats did not contain 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> at the start of the monitoring period.
