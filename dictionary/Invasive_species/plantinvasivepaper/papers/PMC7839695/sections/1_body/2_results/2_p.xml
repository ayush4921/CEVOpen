<p>Across all sites, adult density showed large annual fluctuations but declined 48–100% from an initial mean of 13.7 ± 1.9 stems/0.5m
 <sup>2</sup> (mean ± 1SE; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 16 sites; range 3.62–31.05 per site) to 1.33 ± 0.4 stems/0.5m
 <sup>2</sup> at the end of the study, and this pattern was most obvious for sites with the longest observation periods (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The best performing models included initial 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> adult density as a covariate and indicated a significant decline in adult density over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>) with important differences between the Northeast and Midwest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Sites in the Northeast showed two phases of decline, whereas at Midwest sites adult density oscillated downwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a and b</xref>). Sites in the Midwest were typically monitored fewer years than sites in the Northeast, increasing model uncertainty in the last years of the study. The best model of adult density (adj. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.16; AICc weight = 0.46) included initial density as a covariate (Estimate ± 1SE: 0.17 ± 0.02, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), separate smoothers per region (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but no effect of longitude or latitude (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Models including latitude and longitude (models 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) had larger AICc values than the corresponding models without these parameters (models 5, 9 and 10; Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Removal of these parameters resulted in a AICc weight of 1 for the best model (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).
