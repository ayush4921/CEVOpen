<p>At the beginning of our study, projected site‐specific population growth rates (1.33 ‐ 1.85; mean ± 1SE: 1.56 ± 0.04) indicated expanding populations. However, population growth rates significantly decreased over time (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>; Fig 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) at all sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). Analysed over the whole study period, the time‐averaged growth rate per site (λ
 <sub>year.site</sub>) was significantly less than one at eight sites, did not differ from one at four sites and was significantly higher than one at two sites (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Estimates assume that seed survival and germination are similar across sites and did not vary over time.
