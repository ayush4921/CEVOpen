<p>Average stem height per quadrat at the beginning of the study ranged from 39 to 92 cm and declined at most sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). The two top models included longitude effects and indicated a decline in height over time (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Although the rate of decline differed by region in the best model (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.1; AICc weight = 0.24), it was similar for both regions in the second top model (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.08; AICc weight = 0.19) (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). The best performing model indicated a decline in stem height in the Midwest, whereas in the Northeast stem height decreased in the first years of the study and then remained stable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e and f). Stem height significantly decreased with longitude (−6.57 ± 2.96, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; with taller stems at western sites, Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>) but was not significantly correlated with initial 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> adult density or latitude (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Removing models with latitude and/or initial density (uninformative parameters) from the set resulted in AICc weight = 0.46 and 0.35 for the two top models respectively.
