<p>Silique production/stem remained relatively stable at most sites throughout the study period (5.7–22.8 siliques/stem at study initiation) (Fig.

 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). All best models included a smoother per region, an interaction between stem height and adult density and longitude and latitude effects. The best model (adj.

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8, AICc weight = 0.53; Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>), indicated mean silique number per stem per quadrat decreased in the Midwest but did not change in the Northeast. Silique production was positively correlated with stem height (estimate ± 1SE: 0.03 ± 0.0007, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and adult density (0.06 ± 0.02, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), with taller stems in quadrats with low stem densities producing more siliques than stems of the same height in quadrats with high stem densities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Silique production was negatively correlated with latitude (−0.17 ± 0.04, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and longitude (−0.13 ± 0.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), with stems at northern and eastern sites producing more siliques than stems at southern and western sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>). Initial 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> density was not included as covariate in the best model and its addition resulted in lower AICc values than the corresponding model without initial density (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). Removing this model from the candidate set resulted in an AICc weight of 0.80 for the best model.
