<p>When we established sites, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was present in all quadrats (except in three quadrats at Box Woodlot and two at Ives Rd.). By the end of the study, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> frequency (proportion of quadrats containing 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>) in June declined at 11 of 16 sites by 9% to 53%. Declines were greater at eastern sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and longitude had a significant explanatory effect (estimate ± 1SE: −0.93 ± 0.43, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Although two of the top three models indicated regional differences between the Northeast or Midwest, the best model (adj. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.07, AICc weight = 0.28) included a single smoother for both regions and longitude (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Models that incorporated latitude (models 4, 5, 7 and 8) had AICc values greater than the corresponding models (models 1, 2, 3 and 6) that lacked a latitude effect (Table 
 <xref rid="ele13649-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Removing this uninformative parameter rendered an AICc weight = 0.40 for the best model.
