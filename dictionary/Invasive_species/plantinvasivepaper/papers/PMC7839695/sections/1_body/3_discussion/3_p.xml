<p>Ecological dominance waning over 100–300 years associated with negative soil feedback are described for introduced plants in New Zealand (Diez

 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) and they may play a role in the reduction in abundance of invasive plant species described for eastern North America (Warren 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). We have some evidence suggesting the importance of negative soil feedback in affecting survival and vigour of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> from a site in central New York. At this location, which is not part of our long‐term monitoring, we were able to observe a detailed chronosequence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> arrival, spread and decline over a 10‐year period (for details see Plant‐Soil Feedback section in Supplementary Material). Our preliminary experiments from this single location leads to a new hypothesis: the decline of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> as a function of local residence time, is caused by negative soil feedback. PSF may also help explain the regional differences between eastern and western sites. For example, legacy effects of differences in precipitation (Crawford &amp; Hawkes, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) or previous land use histories that create persistent different microbial communities can affect plant demography and persist from decades to centuries (Wubs 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>).
