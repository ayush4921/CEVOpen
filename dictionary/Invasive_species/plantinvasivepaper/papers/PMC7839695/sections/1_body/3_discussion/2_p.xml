<p>We find support for our second prediction that local declines are a function of regional residence time. The species first established in the East and then spread into the Midwest (Nuzzo, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>) and our data indicate that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> declines occurred faster and were more pronounced at eastern study locations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ele13649-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although detailed mechanisms responsible for these findings remain elusive at present, unique regional climates, soil and vegetation characteristics may be important in determining local site trajectories. However, longer overall residence time in the East may also facilitate and enhance local build‐up of biotic resistance, or other eco‐evolutionary feedbacks. While we did encounter above ground natural enemies (herbivores or diseases), they never appeared abundant enough to strongly affect 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> populations. Instead, the patterns we describe are consistent with expectations of plant‐soil feedback (PSF), where plant species‐specific rapid soil conditioning leads to performance reductions (negative soil feedback) (Klironomos,

 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and the importance in range expansion or biological invasions is now well established (Koorem

 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Wolfe and Klironomos,

 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) but how these impacts change over time is far less clear.
