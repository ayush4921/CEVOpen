<p>Where large plant populations exist and eradication is no longer an option, we recommend establishing long‐term ‘research refuges’ to allow evaluation of eco‐evolutionary processes and potential buildup of local biotic resistance or biological control by native organisms to occur over time in absence of management. This switch in scientific focus from potential traits of invaders, to assessing biotic resistance traits of invaded communities may lead to improved understanding of invasion dynamics.</p>
