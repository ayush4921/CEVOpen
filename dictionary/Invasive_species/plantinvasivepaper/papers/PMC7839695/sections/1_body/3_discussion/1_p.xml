<p>The results of our regional investigation require us to reject our first assumption—
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is unable to maintain stable or increasing populations over time. While our monitoring protocol was not intended to capture very early stages of arrival at a site, our data suggest an initial local abundance increase, followed by sustained vigour declines. Earlier demographic models developed to aid in selection of potential biocontrol agents for 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> identified transitions from rosettes to flowering plants as most important in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> demography (Davis 
 <italic>et al</italic>.,

 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). This is exactly what we document and, despite abundant germination and a fairly long‐lived (10–13 years) seedbank (Blossey 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), over time projected population growth rates decline to &lt;1. This phenomenon is not restricted to our long‐term monitoring sites and has been noted observationally or through demography investigations by others (Kalisz 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Dávalos 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015b</xref>; Faison 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), but we are the first to document and quantify these declines through a chronosequence at many different locations.
