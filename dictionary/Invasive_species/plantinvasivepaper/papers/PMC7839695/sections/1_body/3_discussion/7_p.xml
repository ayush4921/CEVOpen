<p>Our work contributes to the increasing body of evidence for declines in invasiveness and therefore potential ecological impacts of introduced species across many different taxa. Rapid evolutionary changes allowed 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> to thrive in North America (Lankau, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2011b</xref>) but rapid eco‚Äêevolutionary feedback in native species has reduced ecological and evolutionary novelty and initial negative impacts (Hierro and Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Callaway 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Mangla 
 <italic>et al</italic>.,

 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) and we show widespread declining 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> population growth rates. These phenomena have important implications for how we approach research in and management of biological invasions. If impacts are caused by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, how quickly do impacts materialise, do they persist, or do they fade (Lankau, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2012b</xref>) once the initial high abundances are reduced? Do affected species or communities recover over time, and how quickly? Does active management of garlic mustard extend local dominance potentially increasing impacts?
