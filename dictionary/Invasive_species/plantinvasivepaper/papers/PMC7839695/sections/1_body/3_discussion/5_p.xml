<p>Our data were collected in areas with the oldest invasion history of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in North America (Nuzzo, 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="ele13649-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) with unique regional climate, soil and vegetation characteristics. The species has since spread more widely triggering continued widespread manual and chemical removal experiments. We have no information on the long‐term population dynamics in areas outside of our investigation, but we only detected long‐term declines because we required cessation of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> management for the duration of our study. Removal of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> may in fact set back negative soil feedback or other processes that collectively lead to population declines. It appears important that local management efforts are cognizant of the possibility that their activities may be detrimental to 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> declines and local plant community recovery. We recommend for local managers to set aside certain locations for observational investigations to assess whether the phenomena we describe occur outside of our region.
