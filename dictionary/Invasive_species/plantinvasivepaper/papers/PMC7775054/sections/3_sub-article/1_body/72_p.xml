<p>Another set of hypotheses could be related to the marginal improvement in model forecasts over existing models. As the authors correctly note, a number of platforms exist to provide national degree days based on recent weather. (I was a bit surprised to not see any mention of the Spatial Analytic Framework for Advance Risk Information System [SAFARIS] also sponsored by USDA APHIS.) The authors suggest that one distinguishing feature of the current model is the ability to account for variation in response to degree day accumulations. Yet, no data are provided to measure how the forecast is improved when such variability is added.</p>
