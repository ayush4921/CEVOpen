<p>Reviewer #1:Â Barker et al. provide a well written accounting of DDRP, a new software package to calculate degree days and climatic suitability for insects. The authors are correct that refinements are needed to prepare forecasts of the potential distribution and activity of insects over time. Such forecasts could be useful to refine surveys, particularly for invasive species whose complete current distribution may not be known with confidence.</p>
