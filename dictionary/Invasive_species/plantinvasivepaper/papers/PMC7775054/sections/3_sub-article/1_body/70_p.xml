<p>While I do not find any errors, per se, I do not find any underlying hypotheses to underpin the research. One set of hypotheses could be related to the ability of the model to reproduce the distribution or activity of the light brown apple moth or the small tomato borer, the example cases that were provided. Ideally, these forecasts would be for areas that were not used for model development. Such validation is routine for these types of models and is a bare minimum. The model might have high commission error rates, classifying more areas as suitable than exist. It is not clear how well the model performs with respect to seasonal activity/phenology.</p>
