<p>The reviewers and I agree that this a well-written manuscript. I appreciate your attention to detail and your thorough explanations of the choices you made in developing DDRP. However, Reviewer 1 expressed reservations about the lack of underlying hypotheses and validation, and I share some of those concerns. As you are probably aware, PLOS ONE has a specific set of criteria for manuscripts that present new software. These criteria relate to utility, validation, and availability (

With respect to validation, “the submitted manuscript must demonstrate that the new tool is an improvement over existing options in some way. This requirement may be met by including a proof-of-principle experiment or analysis; if this is not possible, a discussion of the possible applications and some preliminary analysis may be sufficient.” I believe your goal is to see wide uptake of DDRP, which means that you must meet a fairly high standard for validation that goes beyond preliminary analysis. Certainly, your discussion of the practical advantages of DDRP over alternatives is compelling, but it would be much better if you provided quantitative evidence.
