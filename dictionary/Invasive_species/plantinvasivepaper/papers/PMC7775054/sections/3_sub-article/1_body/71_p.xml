<p>The authors discuss at great length different methods of estimating degree days. An argument is made that the method of calculation could result in quantitatively and qualitatively different forecasts. Such a suggestion is intriguing (and is certainly the subject of several other research papers), but the authors provide no new evidence (e.g., trap catch data over time) to demonstrate that the method they selected was substantially better, worse, or no different from other methods.</p>
