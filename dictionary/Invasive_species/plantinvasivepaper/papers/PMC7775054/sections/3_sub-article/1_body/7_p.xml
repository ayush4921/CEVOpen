<p>I encourage you to look to the comments of Reviewer 1 for potential opportunities to evaluate model performance. For instance, it should be relatively straightforward to implement (holdout) validation of the predicted distributions for your two example cases and derive some estimates of the error rates. Additionally, you should be able to devise some sort of test of the relative merit of your degree-day modeling method, even with limited data.</p>
