<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written. The authors provide good justification for their modeling parameters and adequately discuss the limitations of DDRP. The authors develop two solid insect pest model examples in DDRP which highlight the platformâ€™s products and potential as a decision support tool. The modeling is sound, and the R code is readily available online. There is very little that I can fault here. This article is certainly suitable for publication in Plos One.</p>
