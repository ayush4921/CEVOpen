<p>The authors description of the method of calculating cold and heat stress is vague. Do they use the same fundamental formulas as are used in CLIMEX. Why? Have they independently vetted those indices to determine how well they perform? Further, why do stress indices need to be determined on a daily basis? Again, with no formal comparisons, I am unclear what new insights the model is providing over existing models.</p>
