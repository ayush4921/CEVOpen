<p>First, we describe the modeling process and workflow of DDRP, summarize types of model outputs, and review its system and software requirements. Next, we demonstrate its capabilities and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species which threaten agricultural biosecurity in the United States: the small tomato borer, 
 <italic>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</italic> [Guenée (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)], and the light brown apple moth, 
 <italic>Epiphyas postvittana</italic> [Walker, 1863 (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)]. These species were chosen because they have been well-studied in terms of their developmental requirements, and previous climatic suitability studies provide a basis for parameterizing the climatic suitability model in DDRP. Additionally, models for these species are intended to aid surveillance teams at the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) pest detection program, which supports the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) as it works to safeguard agricultural and environmental resources in the United States. We used population monitoring data for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> in California to test the hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the timing of first spring egg laying and the generation length of the species. Additionally, we used a validation data set consisting of presence localities from California (
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic>) and Brazil (
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic>) to test the hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict each species’ known distribution in these areas. The DDRP platform will be a useful decision support tool for preventing, monitoring, and managing new and existing invasive pests of agriculture and natural resources in the United States.
