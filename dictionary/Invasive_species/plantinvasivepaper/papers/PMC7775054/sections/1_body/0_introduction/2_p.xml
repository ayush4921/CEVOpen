<p>Modeling climatic suitability (risk of establishment) and the timing of seasonal activities (phenology) of invasive insect species can help stakeholders including farmers, natural resource managers, and surveillance teams detect and prevent their establishment, slow their spread, and manage existing populations more sustainably and economically [
