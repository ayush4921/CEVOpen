<p>Despite their widespread use, currently available degree-day modeling platforms are in need of improvements. None of them integrate predictions of phenology and climatic suitability, which would provide guidance on the question of both where

For most species, addressing this two-part question would require finding, potentially purchasing, and learning how to use two separate platforms. Additionally, many phenology modeling platforms use oversimplified models that make broad assumptions about insect biology, such as assuming a single lower developmental temperature threshold for multiple species, or assuming that an entire population emerges from overwintering at a single time. However, developmental temperature thresholds may vary widely across insect species, and development rates often vary within populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A biologically unrealistic model may produce inaccurate predictions of phenological events (e.g. spring emergence, first adult flight, egg-hatching) or voltinism. Moreover, most platforms are capable of forecasting phenology only a week or two into the future in specific states or regions. However, stakeholders may need to plan operations several weeks in advance, potentially in areas that are outside the geographic bounds of predictive models.
