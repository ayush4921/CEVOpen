<p>In this study, we introduce a new spatial modeling platform, DDRP (short for Degree-Days, establishment Risk, and Phenological event maps) that generates real-time and forecast predictions of phenology and climatic suitability (risk of establishment) of invasive insect species in the conterminous United States (CONUS). The objective of DDRP is to provide a multi-species modeling tool that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of programs that aim to detect new or spreading invasive insect species in the United States, to monitor and manage species such as IPM insect pests that are already well-established, and to improve programs for classical biological control insects. The platform is written entirely in the R statistical programming language [

Gridded temperature data for DDRP may include the entire CONUS or a specific region or state, and may be at any spatial resolution that can be handled by the userâ€™s computing system. DDRP will generally use observed and future (forecast or recent average) temperature data because it was designed to be run as a within-season decision support tool that can provide guidance on where and when to expect the pest to appear each year, but it will accept temperature data for any time period. Model outputs include gridded (raster) and graphical (map) outputs of life stages present, number of generations, phenological events, and climatic suitability.
