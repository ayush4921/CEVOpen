<p>Invasive insects in the United States are a significant threat to the economy, environment, food security, and human health [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They cause billions of dollars in damage to forests each year [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Insect invasions in the United States also reduce the abundance and diversity of native species, which negatively impacts ecosystem functions and services such as soil health, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Rapidly detecting and responding to new invasive insects and the spread of those that are already established before they can cause significant economic and environmental damage has therefore become a major priority [
