<p>Degree-day models that predict insect phenology are an established tool for decision support systems that assist stakeholders with scheduling surveillance, monitoring or IPM operations for numerous pest species over the growing season [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most degree-day models predict phenology by measuring linear relationships between temperature and development rate, and they employ daily time steps to estimate degree-days using daily minimum and maximum temperature (

Several web-based platforms host degree-day models for insect pest species in the United States, offering users opportunities to model phenology of multiple species at single locations (site-based model) or across a certain area (spatialized model). These platforms include but are not limited to Michigan State University’s Enviroweather (
