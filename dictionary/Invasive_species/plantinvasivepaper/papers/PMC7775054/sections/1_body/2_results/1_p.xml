<p>DDRP predictions of the timing of first spring egg laying for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> were consistent with estimates of first spring peak flight derived from three population monitoring data sets for most years. Predicted dates of first spring egg laying differed by fewer than six days from the peak date for 2013, 2014, 2019, and 2020, with some occurring later than the peak (2014, 2020) and others occurring earlier (2013, 2019;

 <italic>ca</italic>. 3 weeks later than peak spring flight). For 2008 and 2009, DDRP predictions for three of the four analyzed counties were consistent with the observed month of peak spring flight. Estimates of degree-day accumulation between the last peak fall and first spring flights across four winters (
