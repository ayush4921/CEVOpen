<p>For all modeled years, DDRP predictions of the potential distribution of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> were in agreement with the vast majority of validation localities. The model based on 30-year climate normals predicted suitable conditions at 99.7% (871/874) of validation localities. On average, models based on climate data for each year between 2010 and 2019 predicted suitable conditions at 97.4% (range = 92.4−99.4%) of validation localities, whereas only 2.3% (range = 0.6−6.8%) and 0.4% (range = 0.2−0.8%) were predicted to be excluded by moderate and severe heat stress, respectively.
