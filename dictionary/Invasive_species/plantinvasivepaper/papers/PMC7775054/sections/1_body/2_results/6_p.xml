<p>Predictions of potential dates for phenological events and voltinism for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> in 2018 varied substantially by latitude in eastern CONUS (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g006">6</xref>). The earliest date of egglaying for the first generation of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> was predicted to be as early as mid-March in Florida to as late as December in the Pacific Northwest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The average date of first generation beginning of egg hatch for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> was predicted to begin in the first week of January in Florida but not until mid-June in the Pacific Northwest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Thus, the timing of monitoring trap installation to detect ovipositing adults and eggs of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic>, or larvae of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic>, could vary widely across CONUS. For both species, DDRP predicted as many as seven to nine generations in coastal areas of the Southeast, compared to only one or two generations in colder parts of the Pacific Northwest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Three to six generations were predicted for most other regions of CONUS. These findings may indicate that the Southeast would experience the longest duration of pest pressure.
