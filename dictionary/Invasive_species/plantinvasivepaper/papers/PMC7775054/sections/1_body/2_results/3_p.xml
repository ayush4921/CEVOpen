<p>Similarly, DDRP models for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> in Brazil predicted suitable conditions at most validation locations where the species is known to occur (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). On average, models based on climate data for each year between 2005 and 2016 predicted suitable conditions at 92.4% (range = 87−100%) of validation localities. Conversely, 4.7% (range = 0−13%) and 2.9% (range = 0−8.7%) were predicted to be excluded by moderate and severe heat stress, respectively. Two localities which were incorrectly excluded by heat stress in 13 of the 15 modeled years occurred in the Serra de Ibiapaba, which is a high-elevation region (maximum of 850 m) in the state of Ceará where elevations change quickly across relatively short distances (e.g. 
 <italic>ca</italic>. 30 km in many areas). The coarse spatial resolution of input climate data (
 <italic>ca</italic>. 28 km
 <sup>2</sup>) relative to the scale of these elevational changes most likely explains inaccurate predictions. For relatively warm years since 2011, heat stress was predicted to exclude 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> from warmer regions of Brazil (e.g. in the states of Maranhão, Piauí, and Tocantins; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) where the species has not been documented to our knowledge.
