 <italic>postvittana</italic> was excluded by heat stress from warm areas of CONUS that were included in its potential distribution under historical conditions, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and the Central Valley of California (

 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> experienced only small reductions in its potential distribution in southeastern California and southwestern Arizona due to heat stress (
