 </sub> estimates for 1961â€’1990 and calibrated model parameters in accordance with the CLIMEX model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Specifically, we compared maps of temperature stress accumulation, and adjusted temperature stress limits so that most areas predicted to be under moderate and severe climate stress by DDRP had low (20 &gt; EI &gt; 0) or zero (EI = 0) suitability according to CLIMEX, respectively. Additionally, we modeled climatic suitability for the species in California for each year between 2010 and 2019 and calibrated stress parameters to maximize the fit of the model to 144 georeferenced records that were collected over the same time period (N = 144 from GBIF, N = 77 from Nick Mills). For each modeled time period, we extracted climate stress exclusion values for presence localities in the California Department of Food and Agriculture data set to test our hypothesis that DDRP could correctly predict the potential distribution of the species. We removed localities that occurred within the same 4 km grid cell, which resulted in 872 unique validation localities.
