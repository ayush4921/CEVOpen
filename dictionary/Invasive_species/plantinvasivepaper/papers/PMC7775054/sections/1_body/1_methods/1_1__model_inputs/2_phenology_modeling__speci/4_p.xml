<p>Users may specify the timing (in degree-days) of phenological events that are important to their target system to generate phenological event maps in DDRP, which depict the estimated calendar dates of the event over a time frame of interest. We typically generate phenological event maps based on temperature data for an entire year so that events for multiple generations of each of the five life stages are modeled. For example, phenological event maps that depict when the overwintering stage would emerge may be useful for identifying start dates for surveillance operations for a species, whereas maps for subsequent generations could help with planning operations later in the year. The timing of phenological events may be based on life stage durations (e.g. the end of the egg stage signifies egg hatching), or on occurrences within a stage such as the midpoint or peak of oviposition or adult flight. Currently, one user-defined phenological event for each life stage for up to four generations may be modeled, although the platform could be modified to predict multiple events for each stage (e.g. first, midpoint, and end of the stage) for any number of generations.</p>
