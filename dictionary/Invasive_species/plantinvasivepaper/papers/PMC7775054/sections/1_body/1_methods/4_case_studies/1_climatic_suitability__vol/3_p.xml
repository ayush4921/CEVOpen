We applied seven cohorts to approximate a normal distribution of emergence times that spanned 100 to 320 DDC (average = 210 DDC) based on a report that overwintering larvae at four sites in California required between 102 and 318 DDC to finish development [

This would correspond to the time required for mid-stage (3rd−5th instars, average 4th instar) female larval feeding on old foliage (0.45 × 494 DDC = 210 DDC), after a January 1 start date. The single triangle method was used to calculate degree-days.
