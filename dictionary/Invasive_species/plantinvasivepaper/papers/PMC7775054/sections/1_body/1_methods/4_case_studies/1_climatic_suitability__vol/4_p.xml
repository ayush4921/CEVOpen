<p>We tested the hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the timing of first spring egg laying and generation length for

 <italic>postvittana</italic> by analyzing three monitoring data sets that were collected in and around the San Francisco Bay Area in California over a 12 year time frame (2008‒2009, 2011‒2014, and 2019‒2020). All three data sets were comprised of moth count data that had been collected via pheromone trap surveys on a bi-weekly or monthly basis by USDA APHIS or the University of California Cooperative Extension. For each data set, we estimated the difference between the date of the peak in first spring flight and DDRP predictions of the average date of first spring egg laying. This event was chosen because peak flight would likely happen at about the same time that peak egg laying is occurring [

Additionally, we used DDRP to calculate the number of degree-days that accumulated between the last peak fall flight and first peak spring flight for four winters (2011‒2012, 2012‒2013, 2013‒2014, and 2019‒2020), which should serve as a rough estimate of generation time. These estimates were compared to the generation time that is used by the DDRP model (823 DDC for the overwintering generation; 734 DDC are used for later generations that have young foliage to feed upon [
