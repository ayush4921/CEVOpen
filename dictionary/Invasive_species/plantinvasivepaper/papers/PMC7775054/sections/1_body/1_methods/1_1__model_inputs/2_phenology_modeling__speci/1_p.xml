<p>The life history and behavior of a target species must be considered for appropriateness to model in DDRP. In its current form, the platform can model four separate life stages (the egg, the larva or nymph, the pupa or pre-oviposition, and the adult) plus a separately parameterized overwintering stage. As movement and migration are not handled by DDRP, it is currently limited in its ability to model migratory species, such as those that may establish in southern areas of their potential range and migrate yearly to more northern areas. Species that lack an overwintering stage, which are common in tropical and subtropical areas, may be difficult to model because the timing of first spring activities and stages present cannot be accurately estimated. Currently DDRP is entirely temperature-driven, so species whose growth and reproduction are strongly influenced by additional environmental factors such as day length or moisture may not be accurately modeled.</p>
