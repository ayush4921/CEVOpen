 <italic>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</italic> has no apparent photoperiodic response, diapause, or specific overwintering stage. In subtropical climates in Brazil, the insect remains active throughout the year if host plants are available [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We defined adults as the overwintering stage and used January 1 as the model start date for CONUS because few host plants would be available for immature stages at this time. We assumed that adult feeding and host search activities could begin immediately if temperatures are suitable, and that first egg laying would subsequently occur after the estimated pre-oviposition period of 
 <italic>ca</italic>. 55 DDC. The durations of later events (first to peak oviposition, immature development, etc.) were estimated from previously published data [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. We applied seven cohorts to approximate a normal distribution of emergence times that spanned 0 to 111 DDC (average = 50 DDC) because overwintered adults begin finding hosts over this time frame, and we used the single triangle method to calculate degree-days. Unfortunately, we were unable to find monitoring data that were suitable for validating the DDRP phenology model for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic>. Population monitoring studies of the species have been conducted in Brazil; however, the species at these locations does not have a discrete overwintering stage so peaks in flight are more or less sporadic and not indicative of first spring activity or voltinism.
