<p>Climatic suitability modeling in DDRP is based on cold and heat stress accumulation and requires data on temperature stress threshold and limits of a species (

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While parameter values may be estimated from laboratory or field experiments, such data are lacking for most species. Additionally, extrapolating laboratory data to the field to project accumulation of stress is difficult due to oversimplification of the number of variables and the temporal and spatial variation in natural environments [

Laboratory collected data may help with parameterizing a CLIMEX model; however, model parameters are fine-tuned and the model is fitted using observations from the speciesâ€™ known geographical distribution [
