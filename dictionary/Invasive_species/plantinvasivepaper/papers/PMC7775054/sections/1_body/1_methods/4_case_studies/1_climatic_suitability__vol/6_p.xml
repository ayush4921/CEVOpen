<p>For model validation, we used locality records from 14,949 sites in California where the California Department of Food and Agriculture detected

 <italic>postvittana</italic> between 2007 and 2013, and from an additional 47 localities in California where it was positively diagnosed between 2011 and 2017. We removed localities that occurred within the same CLIMEX grid cell, which resulted in 140 unique localities. Of these, 95% (133/140) were in areas predicted to have high suitability (EI &gt; 20), 4% (6/140) were in areas predicted to have low suitability (0 &lt; EI &lt; 20), and 0.007% (1/140) were in unsuitable areas (

These findings suggest that the CLIMEX model accurately predicted suitable climates at the majority of localities where the species is known to be established in CONUS, and it is therefore a useful tool for calibrating a climatic suitability model in DDRP.
