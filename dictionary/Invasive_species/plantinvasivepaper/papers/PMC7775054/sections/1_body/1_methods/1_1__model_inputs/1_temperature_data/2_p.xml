<p>For forecast modeling, DDRP is currently configured to use either monthly-updated, daily-downscaled NMME (North American Multi-Model Ensemble) 7-month forecasts at a 4 km resolution [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], or recent 10-year average PRISM daily data that are calculated on a bi-monthly basis. We consider 10-year average data to be an improvement over 30-year climate normals for producing forecasts because temperatures in CONUS have significantly increased over the past 30 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The match of mean forecasts of the NMME model’s ensemble to the observed value (i.e. skill) varies both spatially and temporally due to topography, season, and the presence of an El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It may therefore be more conservative, and provide more consistent predictions, to use 10-year averages instead of NMME data to avoid potential issues with skill. However, we caution that the 10-year average data do not simulate variation in daily
