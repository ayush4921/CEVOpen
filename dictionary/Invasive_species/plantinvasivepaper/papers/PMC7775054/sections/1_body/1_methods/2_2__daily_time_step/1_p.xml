<p>DDRP models insect phenology and climatic suitability by stepping through each day of a specified time period and calculating degree-day and temperature stress accumulation at each grid cell of a focal area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The time period may span the entire year of interest, or include only a subset of days such as those during the growing season. Users may sample and save daily modeling results every 30 days, 14 days, 10 days, seven days, two days, or one day. Results are saved in multi-layer rasters that are processed and analyzed after the daily time step to produce final model outputs. We describe the phenology and climatic suitability modeling process and outputs in more detail in the following sections.
