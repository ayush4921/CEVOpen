<p>DDRP requires data on the developmental temperature thresholds (in either degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) and durations for each life stage of an insect species in degree-days (

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data are typically collected in the laboratory by measuring how temperature influences the rate of development, although data derived from season-long monitoring studies are also used [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We round Fahrenheit values of thresholds to the nearest integer in all DDRP models because it allows for simpler communication of models to end-users, and it is a long standing convention for degree-day models in the United States. A different developmental threshold may be assigned to each stage, although we typically solve for a common threshold if differences across the stages are minimal. Additionally, applying common thresholds allows a modified version of the DDRP model to be used by the site-based modeling tool at USPEST.ORG (

Presently, the model depends upon a fixed starting date such as January 1, specified by the user for the entire region of interest. The duration of the overwintering stage represents the number of degree-days that must accumulate from the start of the year for the stage to complete.
