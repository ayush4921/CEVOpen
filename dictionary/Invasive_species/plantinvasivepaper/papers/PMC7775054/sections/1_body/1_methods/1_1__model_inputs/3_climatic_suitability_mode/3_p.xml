<p>Importantly, DDRP was designed to model climatic suitability based on daily current or forecast temperature data at fine spatial scales (e.g. a single state or region), which would give users insight into the potential risk of establishment or spread during a particular season or year. In contrast, CLIMEX is normally used to estimate a species’ potential distribution using coarse-scale (10ʹ and 30ʹ resolution) global gridded 30-year monthly climate normals centered on 1975 (1961‒1990) or future projections from selected global circulation models (GCMs) [

In theory CLIMEX could be used for real-time climatic suitability, but it has no native ability to import and process common gridded formats and is incapable of using daily resolution climate data. Thus, DDRP’s climatic suitability models are intended to improve the efficiency of surveillance and trap deployment at a relatively small focal area for a current or near-future time period, whereas CLIMEX models provide a more general and coarse-scale assessment of suitability based on averaged climate data.
