 <italic>elegantalis</italic> for which daily gridded meteorological data are available. We did not use temperature data for earlier years (1980 to 2004) because they had lower accuracy [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A random subsample of 70% of locality records (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244005.s009">S1 Table</xref>) were used to fit the DDRP model (N = 58), and the remaining 30% (N = 25) were used for model validation. We modeled climatic suitability for each year between 2005 and 2016 and iteratively adjusted heat stress parameters to maximize model fit. Brazil represents a relatively warm part of the distribution of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic>, so we were unable to calibrate cold stress parameters. During this process, we also considered how well DDRP predictions of suitability and heat stress aligned with those of CLIMEX (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Despite DDRP’s use of climate data for different time periods than CLIMEX for this analysis (i.e. individual recent years vs. 30-year climate normals), its predictions of heat stress accumulations and climate stress exclusions over several years were often spatially concordant with CLIMEX’s estimates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This finding provided some additional reassurance beyond the validation analysis that DDRP could correctly model climatic suitability of the species.
