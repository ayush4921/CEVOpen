 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to estimate a common lower temperature threshold for all life stages, which involved adding a point to force the x-intercept to an integer value in degrees Fahrenheit. We weighted the analysis to select a common lower threshold for immature stages, which are the longest in duration, because this should produce the lowest error for the overall life cycle. The lower threshold values for immature stages were very similar to the overall egg-to-adult value of 8.89째C (48째F), so we chose 8.89째C as the common threshold instead of a higher one solved for the adult pre-oviposition stage (11.5째C). We estimated the duration for eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults to peak oviposition as 86, 283, 203, and 96 DDC, respectively. This analysis is presented in
