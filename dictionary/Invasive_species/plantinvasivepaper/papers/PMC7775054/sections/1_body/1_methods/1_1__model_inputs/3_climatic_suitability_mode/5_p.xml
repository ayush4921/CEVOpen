<p>We compare CLIMEX’s predictions of temperature stress accumulation and overall climatic suitability to similar outputs in DDRP to help parameterize a DDRP climatic suitability model. Temperature stress thresholds may be calibrated so that predictions of cold and heat stress accumulation at the end of the year are spatially concordant with CLIMEX’s predictions. Climatic suitability in CLIMEX is estimated with the Ecoclimatic Index (EI), which is scaled from 0 to 100, and integrates the Annual Growth Index and the Annual Stress Index (all climate stress indices) to give an overall measure of favorableness of a location or year for long-term occupation by the target species [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. An EI ≥ 1 is often used as a threshold for defining whether a location is suitable for long-term survival, although an EI exceeding 20 or 30 (depending on the species) is sometimes used to indicate a highly suitable climate [
