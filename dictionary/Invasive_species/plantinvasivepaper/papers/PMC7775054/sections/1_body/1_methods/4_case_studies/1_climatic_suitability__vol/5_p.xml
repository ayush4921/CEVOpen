<p>We generated a CLIMEX model for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> using CLIMEX version 4.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to help parameterize the climatic suitability model in DDRP. The model applied a combination of parameter values (
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) derived from two previous CLIMEX studies of this species [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, we used a cold stress threshold (TTCS) of 3°C, which is lower than He et al.’s (2012) value (5°C) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and higher than Lozier and Mill’s (2011) value (1.5°C) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We applied a top-up irrigation (additional simulated rainfall) rate of 2.5 mm day
 <sup>−1</sup> for the winter and summer season because irrigation mitigates the hot-dry climate that limits distribution of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> within CLIMEX. We fit the CLIMEX model using a data set of 393 georeferenced locality records from Australia (N = 317) and New Zealand (N = 76), which were obtained from GBIF.org (18th July 2019; GBIF Occurrence Download
