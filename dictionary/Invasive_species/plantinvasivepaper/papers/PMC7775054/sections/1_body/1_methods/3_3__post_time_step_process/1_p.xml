<p>After the daily time step has completed, DDRP combines and analyzes results across cohorts and generates final multi-layer rasters (“.tif” GeoTIFF files) and summary maps (“.png” image files) for each sampled day. If multiple cohorts were modeled, then DDRP uses estimates of the relative size of the population represented by each cohort to calculate the relative size of the population (totaling 100%) in any given life stage and generation. For phenological event maps, the earliest and average day of year that an event occurs across cohorts is calculated, and these are displayed as calendar dates (month-day) on summary map outputs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). DDRP also generates a summary map that depicts the life stages of each generation that are present on a given day. Owing to complexities involved with depicting estimates of the relative size of the population that is represented by each generation and stage, these maps are produced only for the middle cohort because it should represent a large proportion of the population if a normal distribution of emergence times is applied.
