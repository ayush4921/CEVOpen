<p>Independently from the phenology model simulations, DDRP calculates daily cold and heat stress accumulations and compares these estimates to user-defined moderate and severe stress limits to delineate the potential distribution of the species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We opted to use moderate and severe stress limits to reflect two distinct themes. First, they may provide a way to depict the potential for short term vs. longer term establishment. For most species, the potential distribution could be represented by areas where cold and heat stress have not exceeded the severe or moderate stress limits, as these should allow for long-term survival. DDRP depicts these areas with maps of cold stress exclusion, heat stress exclusion, and all stress exclusion (cold plus heat stress exclusions; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Areas under moderate stress exclusion may represent temporary zones of establishment in which a species establishes only during a favorable season, such as after an annual migration event. Conversely, areas under severe stress exclusion do not allow for even short-term establishment. Typically we visualize exclusion maps calculated for the last day of the year (day 365) under investigation to provide insight into the potential distribution for an entire growing season. For CONUS, the northern range limit is typically delineated by cold stress and the southern range limit, if any, is delineated by heat stress.
