<p>A summary of phenology and climatic suitability model parameters used for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> in DDRP is reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We assigned all life stages a lower developmental threshold of 7.1°C (45°F) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and an upper developmental threshold of 31.1°C (88°F). Laboratory studies revealed small differences in the lower developmental threshold (&lt; 1°C) across different life stages [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The upper developmental threshold value is based on studies showing that all life stages cease development between 31‒32°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We derived life stage durations (in degree-days Celsius; hereafter, DDC) for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> based on an analysis of published data [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which resulted in 127, 408, 128, and 71 DDC for eggs, larvae (females on young apple foliage), pupae, and adults to 50% egg laying, respectively (
