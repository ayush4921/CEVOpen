<p>We used two different approaches to parameterize a DDRP climatic suitability model for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> for CONUS. First, we used a similar approach taken for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> in using a CLIMEX model to help calibrate temperature stress parameters in DDRP. As detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244005.s004">S4 Appendix</xref>, we re-parameterized a previously published CLIMEX model for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] because it appeared to underpredict suitability in warmer areas where the species is known to occur. Briefly, this involved fitting a CLIMEX model using 228 locality records from the Neotropics and validating it using a separate set of 54 localities (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244005.s009">S1 Table</xref>). CLIMEX correctly predicted suitable conditions (EI ≥ 1) at 96% of the validation localities (51/53) that fell within a unique grid cell (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244005.s006">S2 Fig</xref>), which suggests that the model is robust at predicting climatic suitability. We therefore compared DDRP maps of temperature stress accumulation to those of CLIMEX, and adjusted temperature stress limits so that most areas predicted to be suitable by CLIMEX were also included in the potential distribution by DDRP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We considered any area that had an EI ≥ 1 to potentially be suitable because some localities occurred in areas that had only marginal suitability (
