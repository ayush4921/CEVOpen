<p>Relying on real-time climatic suitability models for decision support on where to employ pest management and eradication operations for a given year or season is preferable to using models based on 30-year climate normals. A model that uses current climate data is more biologically relevant because the risk of establishment in an area would be affected by the conditions that a species physically experiences, not by averages of historical climate. Additionally, climate in CONUS is changing rapidly, so models based on climate normals may produce unrealistic predictions of present-day climatic suitability. Over the past

Nonetheless, DDRP is not currently capable of including moisture factors in the modeling process like CLIMEX, so model predictions for moisture-sensitive species in very arid or wet areas should be interpreted with caution. We discuss the potential implications of generating a climatic suitability model based solely on temperature in the ‘Discussion.’
