<p>DDRP integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability so that users can use a single model output to obtain guidance on their “where” and “when” questions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For example, a user involved with planning surveys may want to know where a target species may establish, and within those areas, when populations may emerge from overwintering. Each output of the phenology model with the exception of accumulated degree-days will be associated with two additional outputs for each sampled day (or the last day for a phenological event map): 1) one that includes severe stress exclusion only, and 2) one that includes both severe and moderate stress exclusions. For example, a phenological event map with severe and moderate stress exclusions for 2018 (all 365 days) would present predicted dates of the selected event only in areas where long-term establishment is predicted (
