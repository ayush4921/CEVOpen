<p>Second, using two levels of stress may provide a way to represent uncertainty for estimating the potential distribution. As discussed in more detail in the ‘Discussion,’ several sources of uncertainty and error in the modeling process may bias model predictions, such as applying inappropriate parameter values, using climate data with low skill or poor spatial resolution, ignoring biotic factors such as species interactions, or ignoring non-temperature abiotic factors such as microclimate effects, moisture, and photoperiod [

Defining the potential distribution as areas under severe stress only would typically provide a broader estimate than a definition based on both stress levels. While this approach may over-predict the risk of establishment, conducting surveys over too broad an area is probably better than surveying too small of an area, which may allow a new invasive species to establish and spread.
