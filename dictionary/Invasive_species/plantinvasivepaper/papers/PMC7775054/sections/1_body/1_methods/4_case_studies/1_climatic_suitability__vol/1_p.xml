<p>The light brown apple moth, 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>postvittana</italic> (Walker 1863) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a leafroller pest native to southeastern Australia, including Tasmania [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The species invaded Western Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, England, and Hawaii more than 100 years ago [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and has been established in California since 2006 [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It poses a significant threat to agricultural production in the United States because it feeds on more than 360 host plants, including economically important fruits such as apple, pear, citrus and grapes [

 <italic>postvittana</italic> to four major fruit crops (apple, grape, orange, and pear) in CONUS estimated an annual mean cost of US$105 million associated with damage to crops and control, quarantine, and research [
