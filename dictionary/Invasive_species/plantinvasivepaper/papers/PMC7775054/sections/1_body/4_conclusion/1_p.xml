<p>DDRP is a new multi-species modeling platform that can integrate mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when an invasive insect species could potentially invade. When used for surveillance, the platform will hopefully increase chances for early detection of new or spreading invasive threats in the United States, and therefore help pest management programs mitigate their potential damage to agricultural and environmental resources. Additionally, DDRP may help plan monitoring and management efforts for IPM pests and biological control insects, and to predict pest pressure on host plants.</p>
