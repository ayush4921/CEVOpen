 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] software packages are open-source R programs that use life stage specific parameters to model temperature-based insect phenology, and both incorporate parameters that describe developmental variation within a population. ILCYM is similar to DDRP in its ability to predict phenology and climate based establishment risk in a spatial context. However, ILCYM is a full population dynamics modeling platform that requires life table data at constant and variable temperatures, which are seldom available for anticipated but not yet present invasive insect species. Additionally, published ILCYM risk model simulations use climate normals or GCMs at global or regional scales [

The phenModel package is not spatialized nor capable of modeling climatic suitability, and it would need to be modified to use for an insect species other than the blue willow beetle
