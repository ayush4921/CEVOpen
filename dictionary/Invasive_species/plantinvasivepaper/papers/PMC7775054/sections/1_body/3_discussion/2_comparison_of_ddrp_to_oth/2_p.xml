<p>Web-hosted daily degree-day maps and degree-day lookup table maps for pest management are available from several platforms including USPEST.ORG, SAFARIS, and Enviroweather, but none of these are capable of predicting climatic suitability like DDRP. Additionally, degree-day lookup tables have certain underlying assumptions which may result in an oversimplified model that is lacking in biological realism, such as assuming that multiple species or life stages within a species have a common lower temperature threshold, and that early season development in a population begins at the same time (i.e. no developmental variation). In contrast, DDRP uses species specific parameters including stage-specific lower and upper developmental temperature thresholds, and it can account for developmental variation within populations by generating and combining results across multiple cohorts that complete the overwintering stage at different times. Compared to a simple model based on generation time degree-days, a well-parameterized DDRP model would likely produce more accurate predictions of voltinism and spring activity because different temperature thresholds for multiple life stages may be used, the overwintering stage is parameterized separately from the post-winter stage (e.g. overwintering adult vs. adult), and the timing of spring activity is summarized across multiple cohorts.</p>
