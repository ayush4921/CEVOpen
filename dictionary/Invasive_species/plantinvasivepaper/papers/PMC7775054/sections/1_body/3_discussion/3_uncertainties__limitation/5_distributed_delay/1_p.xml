<p>There is currently no distributed delay function in DDRP, meaning that the overlap in generations and life stages of cohorts does not increase over multiple generations. This is particularly an issue for species that have significant overlap in generations because they continue to develop throughout winter months or lack a temperature or photoperiodic event that synchronize populations, such as

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. DDRP may accurately predict peak events in each generation for these species, but inaccurately predict the first appearance of one or more life stages after the first or second generations because of increasing overlap in generational cohorts. Consequently, phenological event maps should be most reliable for the first few generations. This will be among the high priority issues in development of future versions of the platform.
