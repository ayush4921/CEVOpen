<p>An improved understanding of

DDRP is a new spatial modeling platform that integrates real-time and forecast predictions of phenology and climatic suitability (risk of establishment) of invasive insect pests in CONUS, providing insights into both where and when to focus detection efforts for a given year or growing season. These predictions may help with detecting the presence of invasive species in the shortest time possible after they arrive and reproduce, which increases the chance of eradication success and makes other rapid response measures (e.g. deployment of biological control) possible and less costly [

Thus, users can use a single program to address decision support needs for early pest detection.
