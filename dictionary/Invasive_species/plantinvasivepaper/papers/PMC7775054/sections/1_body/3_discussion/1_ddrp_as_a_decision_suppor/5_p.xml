<p>There are numerous opportunities for improving and extending the applications of DDRP. The platform can be readily modified to use daily temperature data for a different region than CONUS, as we demonstrated in our analysis of climatic suitability for

Additionally, DDRP could be modified to model other types of temperature-dependent organisms such as non-insect invertebrates, plants, plant-pathogenic bacteria and fungi, and insect plant and animal virus vectors. The platform has been tested for and could be used through an on-line web interface, although there is the potential that memory intensive processes could overload a server host. This issue, as yet untested, could be addressed by using a cloud computing platform. We describe some additional features that could be added to potentially improve model accuracy and expand the list of outputs in more detail below. The most recent code for DDRP is available at GitHub (
