<p>DDRP predictions of the potential distribution of

 <italic>postvittana</italic> and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> in simulations for multiple recent years were in agreement with the vast majority of validation localities, a finding which supports our hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the known distribution of each species. Our models for 2018 indicated that heat stress excluded populations of both species from a greater area of the Southwest compared to 1961‒1990, which is consistent with studies showing that global warming may reduce species’ distributions in warmer parts of their range [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, determining whether these putative range shifts are persistent or temporary would require combining model runs for multiple recent years or seasons. For example, trends in the geographic distribution of climate stress exclusions over several years or seasons could be visualized with a probability surface map. Estimating the direction of range shifts may also provide insights into the response of the species to future climate change. Nonetheless, the differences that we documented in predictions of climatic suitability based on climate data for 1961‒1990 compared to 2018 suggests that an area’s contemporary risk of establishment is different than it was 
 <italic>ca</italic>. 30 years ago. DDRP’s ability to produce climatic suitability models in real-time may provide more meaningful insights into areas that are presently suitable for an invasive species, and therefore allow for more effective placement of surveillance operations. Additionally, the ability to capture interannual variability of pest risk in space-time may allow decision-makers in pest management to react more adaptively to risk.
