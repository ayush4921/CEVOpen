<p>DDRP uses a relatively simple degree-day modeling approach, whereas some platforms including ILCYM, phenModel, and devRate [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] offer complex functions to model nonlinear responses of insects to temperature. Degree-day models are ideal for multi-species platforms like DDRP because there are sufficient data to parameterize a degree-day model for most insect pest species of economic importance in the United States [

 </sub> data (as opposed to hourly data for most nonlinear models), which are available at a high spatial resolution for CONUS from multiple sources including PRISM and RTMA. Nonetheless, it is important for users to recognize potential sources of error and lack of precision in degree-day models, such as their limited ability to accurately model development at supra-optimal temperatures [
