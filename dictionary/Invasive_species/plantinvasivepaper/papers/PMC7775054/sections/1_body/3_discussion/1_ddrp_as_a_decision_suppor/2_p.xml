<p>Additionally, DDRP may be a useful decision support tool for monitoring and managing populations of IPM pests and classical biological control agents. For example, growers have used predictions of the timing of first egg hatch for codling moth [
 <italic>Cydia pomonella</italic> (Linnaeus)], first emergence of western cherry fruit fly [
 <italic>Rhagoletis indifferens</italic> (Curran)], and first spring oviposition of spotted wing drosophila [
 <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (Matsumura)] to help monitor and reduce populations of these major crop pests [
