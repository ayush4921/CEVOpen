<p>Populations of an invading species may exhibit geographic variation in temperature dependent development if genetically divergent individuals are introduced to different areas or rapid evolutionary changes occur in new environments [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. If the geographic distribution of variation in a relevant thermal trait is well understood, then model accuracy may be improved by building separate models for each genotype. For example, an egg hatch phenology model for a subspecies of the Asian gypsy moth, 
 <italic>Lymantria dispar asiatica</italic> (Vnukovskij), had reduced error compared to a similar model constructed for the European subspecies that has invaded North America, 
 <italic>Lymantria dispar dispar</italic> (Linnaeus), which has a markedly different predominant phenotype [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. An alternative approach may be to run several models, each with a different value for the parameter of interest, and present a range of model predictions. Conversely, DDRP could be modified to accept a grid of parameter values so that geographic variation would be accounted for in a single model run.
