<p>Our hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the timing of first spring egg laying and the generation length of

 <italic>postvittana</italic> was generally supported, although there was variation in prediction error across years and regions. DDRP predictions were averaged across several grid cells for two of the three monitoring data sets because they lacked precise location information, which would likely contribute to prediction errors. Additionally, errors in predictions of spring egg laying may reflect either differences in the effects of evening temperatures and wind speeds on flight activity [

Most estimates of generation length that we obtained by measuring degree-day accumulation for the overwintering generation across four years were higher than the value used by the DDRP phenology model, which may in part be due to the modelâ€™s assumption that overwintering larvae feed on old apple leaves, which slows development [
