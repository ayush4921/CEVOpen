<p>A lack of knowledge on how early-season environmental conditions or events that initiate the first spring activity of a species (biofix) vary geographically may be a source of error because the model start date affects all downstream predictions. For example, how does first spring activity vary across the wide range of warming conditions possibly encountered for a large region such as CONUS? As a case in point, our phenology model for 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> assumes that moths have only 55 DDC before egg laying behaviors may occur. This assumption may not be valid for sub-tropical zones of the United States, where flight and reproduction could occur even earlier. Conversely, a much longer spring warm-up may be needed in temperate zones because commercial tomatoes are transplanted much later in the year. Studying how first spring activity (adult flight) in 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>elegantalis</italic> potentially varies geographically in Central or South America would help to refine a range of model start times. The phenology model for DDRP could then be parameterized using a necessarily conservative selection of start dates or by inputting a grid of start dates. Using a broad distribution of emergence times to initiate the cohorts could be another approach to accommodate uncertainty in first spring activity.
