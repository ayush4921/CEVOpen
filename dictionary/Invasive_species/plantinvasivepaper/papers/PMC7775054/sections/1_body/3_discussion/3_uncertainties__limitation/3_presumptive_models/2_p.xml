<p>Web platforms that support sharing of pest observations from the United States will be valuable resources for validating and increasing the predictive performance of DDRP models for species that are already established in CONUS. For example, the iPiPE and its sister platforms (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ipmpipe.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://ipmpipe.org</ext-link>) have created a national information technology infrastructure for sharing pest observations in near real-time and contributing them to a national repository [
