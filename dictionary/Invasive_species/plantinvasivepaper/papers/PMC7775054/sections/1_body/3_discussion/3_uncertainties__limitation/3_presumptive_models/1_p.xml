<p>Uncertainties regarding the accuracy of temporal or spatial predictions of invasive species that are not yet established is inevitable, in part because no validation data are yet available, and species interceptions do not imply establishment [

 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. DDRP models for species for which only presumptive models exist should therefore be used conservatively. For example, surveillance or management actions could be implemented in advance of predicted phenological events as a precautionary measure (e.g. installing traps even earlier than estimates for the earliest date of overwintering adult emergence). To potentially avoid under-predicting the risk of establishment, the potential distribution could be defined as areas not under severe climate stress as opposed to defining it using both stress levels. Additionally, climatic suitability models generated by DDRP could be combined with those produced using different modeling methods (e.g. correlative, semi-mechanistic, or mechanistic) to create a “hybrid” model, which may increase the reliability of predictions [
