<p>From a historical perspective, DDRP could be considered a partial descendant and spatialized version of the PETE (Predictive Extension Timing Estimator) phenological modeling platform that was established as a standard in the mid-1970s [
 <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Features in common include a cohort approach to population phenological modeling using daily degree-days as the main input, provision for major insect life stages and a separately parameterized overwintering distribution, an open-source non-proprietary standard for sharing, and a focus on agricultural extension (applied decision support). Unlike PETE, DDRP is spatialized and therefore able to produce a variety of mapping outputs including phenological event maps, and it also includes options to use separate thresholds for different life stages and to generate climatic suitability models. DDRP could be improved by adding certain features of the PETE platform including the use of a diapause trigger, and a distributed delay function that would allow population spread to increase with each subsequent generation.
