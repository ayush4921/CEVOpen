  <p>CLIMEX (A) and DDRP (B) predictions of heat stress and climatic suitability for 
   <italic>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</italic> in Brazil. The CLIMEX model is based on 1961‒1990 climate normals whereas DDRP models are presented for all years between 2011 and 2016. Locality records that were used to fit (blue triangles) and validate (black circles) the DDRP climatic suitability model are depicted. Both models predicted suitable conditions in regions where 
   <italic>N</italic>. 
   <italic>elegantalis</italic> is widespread, including in the states of Espírito Santo (ES), Goiás (GA), Minas Gerais (MG), Pernambuco (PE), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Paraná (PR), Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), and São Paulo (SP). The pink and blue lines in DDRP heat stress maps depict the moderate and severe temperature stress limits, respectively.
