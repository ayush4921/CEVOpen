  <p>Predictions of cold stress, heat stress, and climatic suitability for 
   <italic>Epiphyas postvittana</italic> (light brown apple moth) in CONUS produced by CLIMEX (A‒C) and DDRP (D‒F) based on 1961‒1990 climate normals. Climatic suitability is estimated by the Ecoclimatic Index (EI) in CLIMEX, and by combining cold and heat stress exclusions in DDRP. In DDRP, long-term establishment is indicated by areas not under moderate (excl.-moderate) or severe (excl.-severe) climate stress exclusion. Cold and heat stress units in DDRP were scaled from 0 to 1000 to match the scale in CLIMEX. CLIMEX maps were generated for this study based on parameters documented in
