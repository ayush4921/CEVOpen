  <title>Schematic of the DDRP model framework.</title>
  <p>1) Input data sets (blue shaded boxes) include a) data on the developmental requirements, climatic tolerances (optional), and emergence times of population cohorts of a species (
   <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and b) daily minimum and maximum temperature (

   </sub> and

   </sub>, respectively) data. 2) Hollow blue boxes indicate calculations conducted on each daily time step, where a dashed outline represents calculations for climatic suitability. Phenological event map (PEM) calculations for each life stage (E = egg, L = larva, P = pupa, A = adult) are shown in green font. A full generation is counted when adults lay eggs (in red), and the number of generations subsequently increases. 3) After the daily time step completes, DDRP combines the results across all cohorts and exports the model outputs as multi-layer raster (“.tif”) and summary map (“.png”) files (orange shaded boxes). Orange shaded boxes with a dashed line represent model outputs for PEMs and climatic suitability.
