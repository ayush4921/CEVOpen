<p>- L440 – this mention of 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uspest.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">uspest.org</ext-link> seems out of the blue. USPEST is mentioned once early in the paper (L55), though it’s not made clear that the authors run this program or how it intersects with the DDRP package described in this manuscript.
