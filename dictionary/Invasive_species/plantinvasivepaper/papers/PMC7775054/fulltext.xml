We describe a new spatial modeling platform that integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when invasive insect species could potentially invade the conterminous United States. The Degree-Days, Risk, and Phenological event mapping (DDRP) platform serves as an open-source and relatively easy-to-parameterize decision support tool to help detect new invasive threats, schedule monitoring and management actions, optimize biological control, and predict potential impacts on agricultural production. DDRP uses a process-based modeling approach in which degree-days and temperature stress are calculated daily and accumulate over time to model phenology and climatic suitability, respectively. Outputs include predictions of the number of completed generations, life stages present, dates of phenological events, and climatically suitable areas based on two levels of climate stress. Species parameter values can be derived from laboratory and field studies or estimated through an additional modeling step. DDRP is written entirely in R, making it flexible and extensible, and capitalizes on multiple R packages to generate gridded and graphical outputs. We illustrate the DDRP modeling platform and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species as example threats to United States agriculture: the light brown apple moth, <italic>Epiphyas postvittana</italic>, and the small tomato borer, <italic>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</italic>. We then discuss example applications of DDRP as a decision support tool, review its potential limitations and sources of model error, and outline some ideas for future improvements to the platform.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Center for Plant Health Science and Technology</institution></funding-source><award-id>15-8130-0304-CA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coop</surname><given-names>Leonard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Applied Research and Development Program (NIFA-CPPM-ARDP)</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014-07773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coop</surname><given-names>Leonard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>USDA APHIS PPQ Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey</institution></funding-source><award-id>AP18PPQHQ000C009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coop</surname><given-names>Leonard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development</institution></funding-source><award-id>W912HQ-17-C-0051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grevstad</surname><given-names>Fritzi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the USDA APHIS PPQ Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) grant no.

Insect invasions in the United States also reduce the abundance and diversity of native species, which negatively impacts ecosystem functions and services such as soil health, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Rapidly detecting and responding to new invasive insects and the spread of those that are already established before they can cause significant economic and environmental damage has therefore become a major priority [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Modeling climatic suitability (risk of establishment) and the timing of seasonal activities (phenology) of invasive insect species can help stakeholders including farmers, natural resource managers, and surveillance teams detect and prevent their establishment, slow their spread, and manage existing populations more sustainably and economically [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Estimates of climatic suitability identify areas to concentrate surveillance or management resources and efforts [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whereas real-time (i.e. current) or forecasted predictions of phenology can improve the timing of surveillance and integrated pest management (IPM) efforts such as monitoring device installation, pesticide applications, and biological control release [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, estimates of climatic suitability, phenology, and voltinism (number of generations per year) can help growers predict the impact of pests and diseases on agricultural production and associated economic losses [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Degree-day models that predict insect phenology are an established tool for decision support systems that assist stakeholders with scheduling surveillance, monitoring or IPM operations for numerous pest species over the growing season [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most degree-day models predict phenology by measuring linear relationships between temperature and development rate, and they employ daily time steps to estimate degree-days using daily minimum and maximum temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>, respectively) data. In the daily time step, degree-days accumulate if heat exceeds the lower developmental temperature threshold of a species (and below its upper threshold for some calculation methods) during a 24-hour period [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several web-based platforms host degree-day models for insect pest species in the United States, offering users opportunities to model phenology of multiple species at single locations (site-based model) or across a certain area (spatialized model). These platforms include but are not limited to Michigan State University&#x02019;s Enviroweather (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.enviroweather.msu.edu/">https://www.enviroweather.msu.edu</ext-link>), Oregon State University&#x02019;s USPEST.ORG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://uspest.org/wea/">https://uspest.org/wea/</ext-link>), the Spatial Analytic Framework for Advance Risk Information System (SAFARIS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://safaris.cipm.info/">https://safaris.cipm.info/</ext-link>), and the USA National Phenology Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.usanpn.org/">https://www.usanpn.org</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Despite their widespread use, currently available degree-day modeling platforms are in need of improvements. None of them integrate predictions of phenology and climatic suitability, which would provide guidance on the question of both where <italic>and</italic> when&#x02014;e.g. is an area at high risk of establishment, and if so, then when will the species emerge or begin a specific activity? For most species, addressing this two-part question would require finding, potentially purchasing, and learning how to use two separate platforms. Additionally, many phenology modeling platforms use oversimplified models that make broad assumptions about insect biology, such as assuming a single lower developmental temperature threshold for multiple species, or assuming that an entire population emerges from overwintering at a single time. However, developmental temperature thresholds may vary widely across insect species, and development rates often vary within populations [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A biologically unrealistic model may produce inaccurate predictions of phenological events (e.g. spring emergence, first adult flight, egg-hatching) or voltinism. Moreover, most platforms are capable of forecasting phenology only a week or two into the future in specific states or regions. However, stakeholders may need to plan operations several weeks in advance, potentially in areas that are outside the geographic bounds of predictive models.</p><p>In this study, we introduce a new spatial modeling platform, DDRP (short for Degree-Days, establishment Risk, and Phenological event maps) that generates real-time and forecast predictions of phenology and climatic suitability (risk of establishment) of invasive insect species in the conterminous United States (CONUS). The objective of DDRP is to provide a multi-species modeling tool that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of programs that aim to detect new or spreading invasive insect species in the United States, to monitor and manage species such as IPM insect pests that are already well-established, and to improve programs for classical biological control insects. The platform is written entirely in the R statistical programming language [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], making it flexible and extensible, and has a simple command-line interface that can be readily implemented for online use. Gridded temperature data for DDRP may include the entire CONUS or a specific region or state, and may be at any spatial resolution that can be handled by the user&#x02019;s computing system. DDRP will generally use observed and future (forecast or recent average) temperature data because it was designed to be run as a within-season decision support tool that can provide guidance on where and when to expect the pest to appear each year, but it will accept temperature data for any time period. Model outputs include gridded (raster) and graphical (map) outputs of life stages present, number of generations, phenological events, and climatic suitability.</p><p>First, we describe the modeling process and workflow of DDRP, summarize types of model outputs, and review its system and software requirements. Next, we demonstrate its capabilities and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species which threaten agricultural biosecurity in the United States: the small tomato borer, <italic>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</italic> [Guen&#x000e9;e (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)], and the light brown apple moth, <italic>Epiphyas postvittana</italic> [Walker, 1863 (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)]. These species were chosen because they have been well-studied in terms of their developmental requirements, and previous climatic suitability studies provide a basis for parameterizing the climatic suitability model in DDRP. Additionally, models for these species are intended to aid surveillance teams at the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) pest detection program, which supports the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) as it works to safeguard agricultural and environmental resources in the United States. We used population monitoring data for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> in California to test the hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the timing of first spring egg laying and the generation length of the species.

We consider 10-year average data to be an improvement over 30-year climate normals for producing forecasts because temperatures in CONUS have significantly increased over the past 30 years [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The match of mean forecasts of the NMME model&#x02019;s ensemble to the observed value (i.e. skill) varies both spatially and temporally due to topography, season, and the presence of an El Ni&#x000f1;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

In its current form, the platform can model four separate life stages (the egg, the larva or nymph, the pupa or pre-oviposition, and the adult) plus a separately parameterized overwintering stage. As movement and migration are not handled by DDRP, it is currently limited in its ability to model migratory species, such as those that may establish in southern areas of their potential range and migrate yearly to more northern areas. Species that lack an overwintering stage, which are common in tropical and subtropical areas, may be difficult to model because the timing of first spring activities and stages present cannot be accurately estimated. Currently DDRP is entirely temperature-driven, so species whose growth and reproduction are strongly influenced by additional environmental factors such as day length or moisture may not be accurately modeled.</p><p>DDRP requires data on the developmental temperature thresholds (in either degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) and durations for each life stage of an insect species in degree-days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data are typically collected in the laboratory by measuring how temperature influences the rate of development, although data derived from season-long monitoring studies are also used [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We round Fahrenheit values of thresholds to the nearest integer in all DDRP models because it allows for simpler communication of models to end-users, and it is a long standing convention for degree-day models in the United States. A different developmental threshold may be assigned to each stage, although we typically solve for a common threshold if differences across the stages are minimal. Additionally, applying common thresholds allows a modified version of the DDRP model to be used by the site-based modeling tool at USPEST.ORG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://uspest.org/dd/model_app">https://uspest.org/dd/model_app</ext-link>), which requires common thresholds across stages, and to more easily compare the DDRP and site-based model implementations for a given species. Presently, the model depends upon a fixed starting date such as January 1, specified by the user for the entire region of interest. The duration of the overwintering stage represents the number of degree-days that must accumulate from the start of the year for the stage to complete.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0244005.t001"

These data are typically gathered using field monitoring studies, whereby the temporal distribution of emergence times and number of individuals that emerge on a given date is documented [e.g. 32]. Assigning a single value to the overwintering stage duration parameter would assume that an entire population develops simultaneously, which may not be biologically realistic because several intrinsic (with a genetic basis) and extrinsic (e.g. microclimate, nutrition) factors can produce variation in development rates within a species [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Indeed, phenology models that incorporate developmental variability in a population may have increased predictive power [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. DDRP therefore allows the duration of the overwintering stage to vary across a user-defined number of cohorts (groups of individuals in a population). Much of the intrinsic variability in insect development during a generation often occurs in the overwintering stage [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], although developmental variation may occur in any life stage [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. DDRP uses five parameters to generate a frequency distribution of emergence times: the mean, variance, low bound, and high bound of emergence times, and the shape of the distribution (Gaussian or lognormal; <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The platform uses these data to estimate the relative size of the population represented by each cohort, which initializes the population distribution that is maintained during subsequent stages and generations. Individuals within each cohort develop in synchrony.</p><p>Users may specify the timing (in degree-days) of phenological events that are important to their target system to generate phenological event maps in DDRP, which depict the estimated calendar dates of the event over a time frame of interest. We typically generate phenological event maps based on temperature data for an entire year so that events for multiple generations of each of the five life stages are modeled. For example, phenological event maps that depict when the overwintering stage would emerge may be useful for identifying start dates for surveillance operations for a species, whereas maps for subsequent generations could help with planning operations later in the year. The timing of phenological events may be based on life stage durations (e.g. the end of the egg stage signifies egg hatching), or on occurrences within a stage such as the midpoint or peak of oviposition or adult flight. Currently, one user-defined phenological event for each life stage for up to four generations may be modeled, although the platform could be modified to predict multiple events for each stage (e.g. first, midpoint, and end of the stage) for any number of generations.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Climatic suitability modeling: Species data and parameters</title><p>Climatic suitability modeling in DDRP is based on cold and heat stress accumulation and requires data on temperature stress threshold and limits of a species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0244005.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While parameter values may be estimated from laboratory or field experiments, such data are lacking for most species. Additionally, extrapolating laboratory data to the field to project accumulation of stress is difficult due to oversimplification of the number of variables and the temporal and spatial variation in natural environments [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We have been using the CLIMEX software [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (Hearne Scientific Software, Melbourne, Australia), which is one of the most widely used species distribution modeling tools for agricultural, livestock and forestry pests and non-pests [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], to assist with climatic suitability model parameterization in DDRP. Laboratory collected data may help with parameterizing a CLIMEX model; however, model parameters are fine-tuned and the model is fitted using observations from the species&#x02019; known geographical distribution [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>DDRP was designed to be complementary to CLIMEX in several ways to facilitate climatic suitability model parameterization, but the two programs also differ in several respects (<xref rid="pone.0244005.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Both platforms use a process-based modeling approach in which parameters that describe the response of a species to temperature stress are included in calculations of climatic suitability. Certain model outputs, particularly maps of temperature stress accumulation, are therefore directly comparable. DDRP uses the stress accumulation method of CLIMEX in which cold and heat stress units begin to accumulate when temperatures exceed the cold and heat stress temperature thresholds, respectively. In both platforms, cold stress units are calculated as the difference between <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub> and the cold stress temperature threshold, and heat stress units are calculated as the difference between <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> and the heat stress temperature threshold. However, DDRP uses daily temperature data and stress accumulates linearly over time, whereas CLIMEX uses average weekly temperature data and stress accumulates at a weekly rate that becomes exponential over time (each week&#x02019;s stress in multiplied by the number of weeks since the stress first exceeded zero) [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These differences appear to be minor in using CLIMEX outputs and parameters to support calibration of DDRP parameters, as demonstrated in our case studies (see &#x02018;Case Studies&#x02019;). Similar to CLIMEX, DDRP uses a single cold and heat stress temperature threshold for all life stages, and stress units accumulate across the entire time period of interest (i.e. across all life stages and generations). We apply the cold and heat stress threshold of the life stage that would be most likely to experience the coldest or hottest temperatures of the year, respectively. DDRP assumes that stress could indirectly kill individuals by restricting their activity, or directly cause mortality through extreme cold or heat events such as a hard freeze.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0244005.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0244005.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of the characteristics, parameters, and outputs of climatic suitability models in DDRP and CLIMEX.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0244005.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0244005.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Attributes</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DDRP</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CLIMEX</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Temporal range (time frame)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any&#x02013;historical, real-time, near forecast, and climate change forecasts</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Historical (1961&#x02013;1990), and future climate change forecasts for 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080, 2090, and 2100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Temporal scale (time step)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 day (daily) for PRISM data&#x02013;others potentially accommodated</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Typically weekly values interpolated from monthly data</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spatial scale</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any&#x02013;default is a 2&#x002b9;

In contrast, CLIMEX is normally used to estimate a species&#x02019; potential distribution using coarse-scale (10&#x002b9; and 30&#x002b9; resolution) global gridded 30-year monthly climate normals centered on 1975 (1961&#x02012;1990) or future projections from selected global circulation models (GCMs) [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In theory CLIMEX could be used for real-time climatic suitability, but it has no native ability to import and process common gridded formats and is incapable of using daily resolution climate data. Thus, DDRP&#x02019;s climatic suitability models are intended to improve the efficiency of surveillance and trap deployment at a relatively small focal area for a current or near-future time period, whereas CLIMEX models provide a more general and coarse-scale assessment of suitability based on averaged climate data.</p><p>Relying on real-time climatic suitability models for decision support on where to employ pest management and eradication operations for a given year or season is preferable to using models based on 30-year climate normals. A model that uses current climate data is more biologically relevant because the risk of establishment in an area would be affected by the conditions that a species physically experiences, not by averages of historical climate. Additionally, climate in CONUS is changing rapidly, so models based on climate normals may produce unrealistic predictions of present-day climatic suitability. Over the past <italic>ca</italic>. 30 years, the average annual temperature in CONUS has increased by 1.2&#x000b0;F (0.7&#x000b0;C), the number of freezing days has declined, and extreme temperature events have increased in frequency and intensity [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, DDRP is not currently capable of including moisture factors in the modeling process like CLIMEX, so model predictions for moisture-sensitive species in very arid or wet areas should be interpreted with caution. We discuss the potential implications of generating a climatic suitability model based solely on temperature in the &#x02018;Discussion.&#x02019;</p><p>We compare CLIMEX&#x02019;s predictions of temperature stress accumulation and overall climatic suitability to similar outputs in DDRP to help parameterize a DDRP climatic suitability model. Temperature stress thresholds may be calibrated so that predictions of cold and heat stress accumulation at the end of the year are spatially concordant with CLIMEX&#x02019;s predictions. Climatic suitability in CLIMEX is estimated with the Ecoclimatic Index (EI), which is scaled from 0 to 100, and integrates the Annual Growth Index and the Annual Stress Index (all climate stress indices) to give an overall measure of favorableness of a location or year for long-term occupation by the target species [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. An EI &#x02265; 1 is often used as a threshold for defining whether a location is suitable for long-term survival, although an EI exceeding 20 or 30 (depending on the species) is sometimes used to indicate a highly suitable climate [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As discussed in more detail in &#x02018;Case Studies&#x02019;, temperature stress limits in DDRP can be adjusted so that areas predicted to be suitable by CLIMEX are also included in DDRP&#x02019;s prediction of the potential distribution.</p><p>Comparing DDRP climatic suitability model outputs to those of CLIMEX for model fitting purposes is naturally more appropriate when temperature data are derived from the same time period. We have therefore been using a PRISM <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> 30-year average data set centered on 1975 (1961&#x02012;1990) to match the time-schedule of the CliMond CM10 (also 1961&#x02212;1990) world climate data set currently supplied with CLIMEX [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We temporally downscaled monthly PRISM estimates for 1961&#x02012;1990 because DDRP requires daily data and PRISM daily temperature data for years prior to 1980 are not available. For each month of a given year, a bilinear interpolation method was used to assign each day an average temperature value that was iteratively smoothed and then adjusted so that the monthly averages were correct.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>2) Daily time step</title><p>DDRP models insect phenology and climatic suitability by stepping through each day of a specified time period and calculating degree-day and temperature stress accumulation at each grid cell of a focal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The time period may span the entire year of interest, or include only a subset of days such as those during the growing season. Users may sample and save daily modeling results every 30 days, 14 days, 10 days, seven days, two days, or one day. Results are saved in multi-layer rasters that are processed and analyzed after the daily time step to produce final model outputs. We describe the phenology and climatic suitability modeling process and outputs in more detail in the following sections.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Phenology model</title><p>DDRP calculates daily degree-days over the specified time period using developmental temperature threshold information and gridded temperature data that have been cropped to the extent of the focal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Currently DDRP has two methods to calculate degree-days: the simple average using an upper threshold with a horizontal cutoff, and the single triangle method with upper threshold [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

While daily degree-days are calculated for each life stage, the cumulative degree-days are summed only for the first cohort of the larval stage, as these degree-day maps are representative for all cohorts and life stages.

The timing of phenological events is estimated by computing daily degree-day totals from the gridded temperature data, and storing the day of year when an event threshold is reached. Event results are generated only on the last day of the daily time step (typically, the last day of the year) because the entire time period must be analyzed for all potential event days to be considered.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Climatic suitability model</title><p>Independently from the phenology model simulations, DDRP calculates daily cold and heat stress accumulations and compares these estimates to user-defined moderate and severe stress limits to delineate the potential distribution of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We opted to use moderate and severe stress limits to reflect two distinct themes. First, they may provide a way to depict the potential for short term vs. longer term establishment. For most species, the potential distribution could be represented by areas where cold and heat stress have not exceeded the severe or moderate stress limits, as these should allow for long-term survival. DDRP depicts these areas with maps of cold stress exclusion, heat stress exclusion, and all stress exclusion (cold plus heat stress exclusions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Areas under moderate stress exclusion may represent temporary zones of establishment in which a species establishes only during a favorable season, such as after an annual migration event. Conversely, areas under severe stress exclusion do not allow for even short-term establishment. Typically we visualize exclusion maps calculated for the last day of the year (day 365) under investigation to provide insight into the potential distribution for an entire growing season. For CONUS, the northern range limit is typically delineated by cold stress and the southern range limit, if any, is delineated by heat stress.</p><p>Second, using two levels of stress may provide a way to represent uncertainty for estimating the potential distribution. As discussed in more detail in the &#x02018;Discussion,&#x02019; several sources of uncertainty and error in the modeling process may bias model predictions, such as applying inappropriate parameter values, using climate data with low skill or poor spatial resolution, ignoring biotic factors such as species interactions, or ignoring non-temperature abiotic factors such as microclimate effects, moisture, and photoperiod [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Defining the potential distribution as areas under severe stress only would typically provide a broader estimate than a definition based on both stress levels. While this approach may over-predict the risk of establishment, conducting surveys over too broad an area is probably better than surveying too small of an area, which may allow a new invasive species to establish and spread.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>3) Post time step processing</title><p>After the daily time step has completed, DDRP combines and analyzes results across cohorts and generates final multi-layer rasters (&#x0201c;.tif&#x0201d; GeoTIFF files) and summary maps (&#x0201c;.png&#x0201d; image files) for each sampled day. If multiple cohorts were modeled, then DDRP uses estimates of the relative size of the population represented by each cohort to calculate the relative size of the population (totaling 100%) in any given life stage and generation. For phenological event maps, the earliest and average day of year that an event occurs across cohorts is calculated, and these are displayed as calendar dates (month-day) on summary map outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). DDRP also generates a summary map that depicts the life stages of each generation that are present on a given day. Owing to complexities involved with depicting estimates of the relative size of the population that is represented by each generation and stage, these maps are produced only for the middle cohort because it should represent a large proportion of the population if a normal distribution of emergence times is applied.</p><p>DDRP integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability so that users can use a single model output to obtain guidance on their &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;when&#x0201d; questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For example, a user involved with planning surveys may want to know where a target species may establish, and within those areas, when populations may emerge from overwintering. Each output of the phenology model with the exception of accumulated degree-days will be associated with two additional outputs for each sampled day (or the last day for a phenological event map): 1) one that includes severe stress exclusion only, and 2) one that includes both severe and moderate stress exclusions. For example, a phenological event map with severe and moderate stress exclusions for 2018 (all 365 days) would present predicted dates of the selected event only in areas where long-term establishment is predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0244005.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0244005.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Phenological event maps generated by DDRP for (A) <italic>Epiphyas postvittana</italic> (light brown apple moth) and (B) <italic>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</italic> (small tomato borer) in CONUS in 2018.

We weighted the analysis to select a common lower threshold for immature stages, which are the longest in duration, because this should produce the lowest error for the overall life cycle. The lower threshold values for immature stages were very similar to the overall egg-to-adult value of 8.89&#x000b0;C (48&#x000b0;F), so we chose 8.89&#x000b0;C as the common threshold instead of a higher one solved for the adult pre-oviposition stage (11.5&#x000b0;C).

We defined adults as the overwintering stage and used January 1 as the model start date for CONUS because few host plants would be available for immature stages at this time.

Population monitoring studies of the species have been conducted in Brazil; however, the species at these locations does not have a discrete overwintering stage so peaks in flight are more or less sporadic and not indicative of first spring activity or voltinism.</p><p>We used two different approaches to parameterize a DDRP climatic suitability model for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> for CONUS. First, we used a similar approach taken for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> in using a CLIMEX model to help calibrate temperature stress parameters in DDRP.

DDRP is a new spatial modeling platform that integrates real-time and forecast predictions of phenology and climatic suitability (risk of establishment) of invasive insect pests in CONUS, providing insights into both where and when to focus detection efforts for a given year or growing season. These predictions may help with detecting the presence of invasive species in the shortest time possible after they arrive and reproduce, which increases the chance of eradication success and makes other rapid response measures (e.g. deployment of biological control) possible and less costly [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, phenological event maps for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244005.g002">Fig 2</xref>) identify high-risk areas where surveillance activities could be concentrated, in addition to providing estimated dates of activities that can ensure timely trap placement. Thus, users can use a single program to address decision support needs for early pest detection.</p><p>Additionally, DDRP may be a useful decision support tool for monitoring and managing populations of IPM pests and classical biological control agents. For example, growers have used predictions of the timing of first egg hatch for codling moth [<italic>Cydia pomonella</italic> (Linnaeus)], first emergence of western cherry fruit fly [<italic>Rhagoletis indifferens</italic> (Curran)], and first spring oviposition of spotted wing drosophila [<italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (Matsumura)] to help monitor and reduce populations of these major crop pests [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Phenology models for biological control insects can help managers schedule sampling trips to coincide with insect presence on the target organism, and to estimate the synchrony of insect and host phenology at a given location [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. DDRP&#x02019;s estimates of voltinism may provide insights into expected pressure on target organisms, as higher voltinism should translate to greater agent population growth and biocontrol success.</p><p>Our hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the timing of first spring egg laying and the generation length of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> was generally supported, although there was variation in prediction error across years and regions. DDRP predictions were averaged across several grid cells for two of the three monitoring data sets because they lacked precise location information, which would likely contribute to prediction errors. Additionally, errors in predictions of spring egg laying may reflect either differences in the effects of evening temperatures and wind speeds on flight activity [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], differences in diet which affects development rates [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], or a lack of consistent correspondence between male flight and peak egglaying, albeit the two events are often found to correlate well enough at least during the springtime to use as a biofix for models informing treatment decisions. Most estimates of generation length that we obtained by measuring degree-day accumulation for the overwintering generation across four years were higher than the value used by the DDRP phenology model, which may in part be due to the model&#x02019;s assumption that overwintering larvae feed on old apple leaves, which slows development [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>DDRP predictions of the potential distribution of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> in simulations for multiple recent years were in agreement with the vast majority of validation localities, a finding which supports our hypothesis that DDRP can correctly predict the known distribution of each species. Our models for 2018 indicated that heat stress excluded populations of both species from a greater area of the Southwest compared to 1961&#x02012;1990, which is consistent with studies showing that global warming may reduce species&#x02019; distributions in warmer parts of their range [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, determining whether these putative range shifts are persistent or temporary would require combining model runs for multiple recent years or seasons. For example, trends in the geographic distribution of climate stress exclusions over several years or seasons could be visualized with a probability surface map. Estimating the direction of range shifts may also provide insights into the response of the species to future climate change. Nonetheless, the differences that we documented in predictions of climatic suitability based on climate data for 1961&#x02012;1990 compared to 2018 suggests that an area&#x02019;s contemporary risk of establishment is different than it was <italic>ca</italic>. 30 years ago. DDRP&#x02019;s ability to produce climatic suitability models in real-time may provide more meaningful insights into areas that are presently suitable for an invasive species, and therefore allow for more effective placement of surveillance operations. Additionally, the ability to capture interannual variability of pest risk in space-time may allow decision-makers in pest management to react more adaptively to risk.</p><p>There are numerous opportunities for improving and extending the applications of DDRP. The platform can be readily modified to use daily temperature data for a different region than CONUS, as we demonstrated in our analysis of climatic suitability for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> in Brazil. Additionally, DDRP could be modified to model other types of temperature-dependent organisms such as non-insect invertebrates, plants, plant-pathogenic bacteria and fungi, and insect plant and animal virus vectors. The platform has been tested for and could be used through an on-line web interface, although there is the potential that memory intensive processes could overload a server host. This issue, as yet untested, could be addressed by using a cloud computing platform. We describe some additional features that could be added to potentially improve model accuracy and expand the list of outputs in more detail below. The most recent code for DDRP is available at GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bbarker505/ddrp_v2.git">https://github.com/bbarker505/ddrp_v2.git</ext-link>), where we invite scientists and practitioners to jointly develop the platform and database of species models.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Comparison of DDRP to other platforms</title><p>From a historical perspective, DDRP could be considered a partial descendant and spatialized version of the PETE (Predictive Extension Timing Estimator) phenological modeling platform that was established as a standard in the mid-1970s [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Features in common include a cohort approach to population phenological modeling using daily degree-days as the main input, provision for major insect life stages and a separately parameterized overwintering distribution, an open-source non-proprietary standard for sharing, and a focus on agricultural extension (applied decision support). Unlike PETE, DDRP is spatialized and therefore able to produce a variety of mapping outputs including phenological event maps, and it also includes options to use separate thresholds for different life stages and to generate climatic suitability models. DDRP could be improved by adding certain features of the PETE platform including the use of a diapause trigger, and a distributed delay function that would allow population spread to increase with each subsequent generation.</p><p>Web-hosted daily degree-day maps and degree-day lookup table maps for pest management are available from several platforms including USPEST.ORG, SAFARIS, and Enviroweather, but none of these are capable of predicting climatic suitability like DDRP. Additionally, degree-day lookup tables have certain underlying assumptions which may result in an oversimplified model that is lacking in biological realism, such as assuming that multiple species or life stages within a species have a common lower temperature threshold, and that early season development in a population begins at the same time (i.e. no developmental variation). In contrast, DDRP uses species specific parameters including stage-specific lower and upper developmental temperature thresholds, and it can account for developmental variation within populations by generating and combining results across multiple cohorts that complete the overwintering stage at different times. Compared to a simple model based on generation time degree-days, a well-parameterized DDRP model would likely produce more accurate predictions of voltinism and spring activity because different temperature thresholds for multiple life stages may be used, the overwintering stage is parameterized separately from the post-winter stage (e.g. overwintering adult vs. adult), and the timing of spring activity is summarized across multiple cohorts.</p><p>The Insect Life Cycle Modelling (ILCYM) [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and phenModel [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] software packages are open-source R programs that use life stage specific parameters to model temperature-based insect phenology, and both incorporate parameters that describe developmental variation within a population. ILCYM is similar to DDRP in its ability to predict phenology and climate based establishment risk in a spatial context. However, ILCYM is a full population dynamics modeling platform that requires life table data at constant and variable temperatures, which are seldom available for anticipated but not yet present invasive insect species.

Degree-day models are ideal for multi-species platforms like DDRP because there are sufficient data to parameterize a degree-day model for most insect pest species of economic importance in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Linear degree-day models are also readily calibrated and sometimes constructed entirely using field data, making them more practical for extension and decision support use [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

However, this conservative-leaning error may in fact better reflect human manipulation of the landscape (e.g. greenhouse and irrigation usage) that may allow the species to exist in such regions. Future versions of DDRP that can process gridded moisture data and incorporate moisture stress factors into climatic suitability models may help overcome our current limitations in matching CLIMEX models, and may improve predictions for moisture-sensitive species such as <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic>. Additionally, we are developing a version of DDRP that incorporates photoperiodically induced life history events such as winter diapause and summer aestivation, which builds on earlier phenology modeling work that estimated voltinism of photoperiod-sensitive insects [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Presumptive models</title><p>Uncertainties regarding the accuracy of temporal or spatial predictions of invasive species that are not yet established is inevitable, in part because no validation data are yet available, and species interceptions do not imply establishment [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. DDRP models for species for which only presumptive models exist should therefore be used conservatively.

To potentially avoid under-predicting the risk of establishment, the potential distribution could be defined as areas not under severe climate stress as opposed to defining it using both stress levels. Additionally, climatic suitability models generated by DDRP could be combined with those produced using different modeling methods (e.g. correlative, semi-mechanistic, or mechanistic) to create a &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d; model, which may increase the reliability of predictions [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><p>Web platforms that support sharing of pest observations from the United States will be valuable resources for validating and increasing the predictive performance of DDRP models for species that are already established in CONUS. For example, the iPiPE and its sister platforms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipipe.org/">http://www.ipipe.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ipmpipe.org/">https://ipmpipe.org</ext-link>) have created a national information technology infrastructure for sharing pest observations in near real-time and contributing them to a national repository [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Similarly, the USA National Phenology Network provides a repository of plant and insect phenology observations contributed by citizen scientists [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The National Agricultural Pest Information System (NAPIS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://napis.ceris.purdue.edu/home">https://napis.ceris.purdue.edu/home</ext-link>) currently has over 5.17 million records from pest detection surveys, and is another potential source of validation data.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Geographic variation</title><p>Populations of an invading species may exhibit geographic variation in temperature dependent development if genetically divergent individuals are introduced to different areas or rapid evolutionary changes occur in new environments [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. If the geographic distribution of variation in a relevant thermal trait is well understood, then model accuracy may be improved by building separate models for each genotype. For example, an egg hatch phenology model for a subspecies of the Asian gypsy moth, <italic>Lymantria dispar asiatica</italic> (Vnukovskij), had reduced error compared to a similar model constructed for the European subspecies that has invaded North America, <italic>Lymantria dispar dispar</italic> (Linnaeus), which has a markedly different predominant phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. An alternative approach may be to run several models, each with a different value for the parameter of interest, and present a range of model predictions. Conversely, DDRP could be modified to accept a grid of parameter values so that geographic variation would be accounted for in a single model run.</p><p>A lack of knowledge on how early-season environmental conditions or events that initiate the first spring activity of a species (biofix) vary geographically may be a source of error because the model start date affects all downstream predictions. For example, how does first spring activity vary across the wide range of warming conditions possibly encountered for a large region such as CONUS? As a case in point, our phenology model for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> assumes that moths have only 55 DDC before egg laying behaviors may occur. This assumption may not be valid for sub-tropical zones of the United States, where flight and reproduction could occur even earlier. Conversely, a much longer spring warm-up may be needed in temperate zones because commercial tomatoes are transplanted much later in the year. Studying how first spring activity (adult flight) in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> potentially varies geographically in Central or South America would help to refine a range of model start times. The phenology model for DDRP could then be parameterized using a necessarily conservative selection of start dates or by inputting a grid of start dates. Using a broad distribution of emergence times to initiate the cohorts could be another approach to accommodate uncertainty in first spring activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Distributed delay</title><p>There is currently no distributed delay function in DDRP, meaning that the overlap in generations and life stages of cohorts does not increase over multiple generations. This is particularly an issue for species that have significant overlap in generations because they continue to develop throughout winter months or lack a temperature or photoperiodic event that synchronize populations, such as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0244005.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244005.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. DDRP may accurately predict peak events in each generation for these species, but inaccurately predict the first appearance of one or more life stages after the first or second generations because of increasing overlap in generational cohorts. Consequently, phenological event maps should be most reliable for the first few generations. This will be among the high priority issues in development of future versions of the platform.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>DDRP is a new multi-species modeling platform that can integrate mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when an invasive insect species could potentially invade. When used for surveillance, the platform will hopefully increase chances for early detection of new or spreading invasive threats in the United States, and therefore help pest management programs mitigate their potential damage to agricultural and environmental resources. Additionally, DDRP may help plan monitoring and management efforts for IPM pests and biological control insects, and to predict pest pressure on host plants.</p><p>The case studies we presented provided examples of how DDRP models may be parameterized and then run to produce various outputs including gridded and graphical predictions of the number of generations, life stages present, dates of phenological events, and areas of climatic suitability based on two levels of climate stress. We encourage users of DDRP to consider the limitations of the platform, to report the conditions that their model was designed to work under (e.g. a particular region, life stage event, or generation), and to document any known sources of model error that could not be accounted for when providing validation and other feedback reports. Additionally, models should be validated whenever possible, as we did for the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>postvittana</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>elegantalis</italic> models presented in this study. The flexible and open-source nature of DDRP will facilitate making modifications and improvements, such as adding new environmental factors, using it for other regions besides CONUS, modeling non-insect organisms, expanding the types of model products, and adding features to improve model accuracy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting

</p><p>PONE-D-20-15142</p><p>DDRP: real-time phenology and climatic suitability modeling of invasive insects</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Barker,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>The reviewers and I agree that this a well-written manuscript. I appreciate your attention to detail and your thorough explanations of the choices you made in developing DDRP. However, Reviewer 1 expressed reservations about the lack of underlying hypotheses and validation, and I share some of those concerns. As you are probably aware, PLOS ONE has a specific set of criteria for manuscripts that present new software. These criteria relate to utility, validation, and availability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-methods-software-databases-and-tools">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-methods-software-databases-and-tools</ext-link>). With respect to validation, &#x0201c;the submitted manuscript must demonstrate that the new tool is an improvement over existing options in some way. This requirement may be met by including a proof-of-principle experiment or analysis; if this is not possible, a discussion of the possible applications and some preliminary analysis may be sufficient.&#x0201d; I believe your goal is to see wide uptake of DDRP, which means that you must meet a fairly high standard for validation that goes beyond preliminary analysis. Certainly, your discussion of the practical advantages of DDRP over alternatives is compelling, but it would be much better if you provided quantitative evidence.</p><p>I encourage you to look to the comments of Reviewer 1 for potential opportunities to evaluate model performance. For instance, it should be relatively straightforward to implement (holdout) validation of the predicted distributions for your two example cases and derive some estimates of the error rates. Additionally, you should be able to devise some sort of test of the relative merit of your degree-day modeling method, even with limited data.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Aug 31 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p><p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future.

The authors are correct that refinements are needed to prepare forecasts of the potential distribution and activity of insects over time. Such forecasts could be useful to refine surveys, particularly for invasive species whose complete current distribution may not be known with confidence.</p><p>While I do not find any errors, per se, I do not find any underlying hypotheses to underpin the research. One set of hypotheses could be related to the ability of the model to reproduce the distribution or activity of the light brown apple moth or the small tomato borer, the example cases that were provided. Ideally, these forecasts would be for areas that were not used for model development. Such validation is routine for these types of models and is a bare minimum. The model might have high commission error rates, classifying more areas as suitable than exist. It is not clear how well the model performs with respect to seasonal activity/phenology.</p><p>The authors discuss at great length different methods of estimating degree days. An argument is made that the method of calculation could result in quantitatively and qualitatively different forecasts. Such a suggestion is intriguing (and is certainly the subject of several other research papers), but the authors provide no new evidence (e.g., trap catch data over time) to demonstrate that the method they selected was substantially better, worse, or no different from other methods.</p><p>Another set of hypotheses could be related to the marginal improvement in model forecasts over existing models. As the authors correctly note, a number of platforms exist to provide national degree days based on recent weather. (I was a bit surprised to not see any mention of the Spatial Analytic Framework for Advance Risk Information System [SAFARIS] also sponsored by USDA APHIS.) The authors suggest that one distinguishing feature of the current model is the ability to account for variation in response to degree day accumulations. Yet, no data are provided to measure how the forecast is improved when such variability is added.</p><p>The authors description of the method of calculating cold and heat stress is vague. Do they use the same fundamental formulas as are used in CLIMEX. Why? Have they independently vetted those indices to determine how well they perform? Further, why do stress indices need to be determined on a daily basis? Again, with no formal comparisons, I am unclear what new insights the model is providing over existing models.</p><p>This model was developed with support from the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey. Can the authors describe how surveys were conducted before the development of this platform? How have they changed in response? Is there any evidence that trapping is now more efficient?</p><p>Current conclusions are not based on the results of the study. They are primarily aspirational.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This article describes a new a new multi-species spatial modeling platform that integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time which has applications for invasive pest detection and management. While many insect phenology modeling platforms are currently available, none to my knowledge, consider that multiple insects cohorts emerging at different times.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written. The authors provide good justification for their modeling parameters and adequately discuss the limitations of DDRP. The authors develop two solid insect pest model examples in DDRP which highlight the platform&#x02019;s products and potential as a decision support tool. The modeling is sound, and the R code is readily available online. There is very little that I can fault here. This article is certainly suitable for publication in Plos One.</p><p>General Comments:</p><p>The manuscript is a bit on the long side. I would recommend some trimming in the discussion section.</p><p>Line by Line comments:</p><p>143: Replace &#x0201c; have simulated&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;simulate&#x0201d;</p><p>171: Replace &#x0201c;develop&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;development&#x0201d;</p><p>226: Replace &#x0201c;is&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;in&#x0201d;</p><p>400-405: DDRP seems like it would have a steep learning curve given that it runs best on a Linux OS and requires knowledge of R. How are these forecasting maps going to made available to pest managers and growers planning their pest management schedule for the growing season?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
