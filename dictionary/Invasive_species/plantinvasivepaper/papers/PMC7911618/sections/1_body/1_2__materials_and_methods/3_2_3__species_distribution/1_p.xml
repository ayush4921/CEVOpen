<p>MaxEnt requires the user to specify a set of parameters, namely, the percentage of test training (i.e., the percentage of locations used for model development and internal testing), the number of background spots, the form of the functional relationship (the type of feature in the MaxEnt Language), clamp (i.e., whether to constrain the prediction within the variability of the input predictor), and the regularization multiplier (i.e., to avoid over-fitting of the response curve). However, there is no agreement in the literature on which set of parameter values to use in MaxEnt, and best practices recommend performing a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the performance of the parameters selected by the model. In this study, the lower area under the curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to test the accuracy of the results of the suitability analysis of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic>. The ROC curve is a receptivity curve, in which the abscissa represents the false positive rate (1—specificity), and the ordinate represents the true positive rate (1—omission rate) [

The grade of simulation prediction is poor (AUC ≤ 0.80, 0.80 &lt; AUC &lt; 0.90), better (0.90 &lt; AUC &lt; 0.95), and excellent (0.95 &lt; AUC &lt; 1.00) [

The AUC value shows that it can separate the existence of the local distribution, which shows that the prediction effect of the MaxEnt model is better. However, although we used AUC, which is probably the most popular method to evaluate the accuracy of the predictive distribution model [

 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], to evaluate the performance of parameter configuration, we chose the parameter configuration in view of the controversy among scientists about its reliability. In this study, first, based on the known distribution points of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> and its corresponding environmental variables, the RM was set to 0.5–4. Six feature combinations (FC) were used to optimize the model parameters to select the optimal parameter combination: L (linear features); LQ (linear features + quadratic features), H (hinge features), LQH (linear features + quadratic features + Hinge features), LQHP (linear features + quadratic features + hinge features + product features); and LQHPT (linear features + quadratic features + hinge features + product features + threshold features). Finally, the RM of this study was set to 1, the feature combination was LQHPT, and the proportion of the data of the distribution points of the verification set was 25%. The software randomly selects 75% of the data from the known distribution points of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> as the training set using the cross-validation method (that is, the species distribution data are randomly divided into 10 parts, one of which is selected as the test set, and nine are selected as the training set). The maximum number of iterations is 500 and the maximum number of background attractions is 10,000. The knife-cutting method (jackknife test) was selected to determine the weight of each variable affecting the suitable growth area of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic>, and the environmental variable ROC was selected.
