<p>The multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) was used to analyze the degree of ecological change of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in the distribution area under the future climatic background. MESS analysis first determines the reference layer of bioclimatic variables. It then calculates the similarity between bioclimatic variables under different climatic conditions and the point set of bioclimatic variables in the reference layer (similarity, S). When the S value is positive, the smaller the S value, the more significant the climate difference at the point; when the S value is 100, no difference exists; when the S value is negative, the S value of at least one bioclimatic variable at the point is beyond the reference range. The environmental change at this point is excellent [
