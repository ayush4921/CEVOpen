<p>Bioclimatic variables downloaded from the World Climate WorldClim2.0 Database (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/</uri>) were used to build models for predicting species distribution. These variables include past climate data (1970–2000) and future climate data (2030: 2021–2040, 2050: 2041–2060) with a resolution of 2.5’. The National Climate Centre launched the earth system model BCC-ESM1.0 with an aerosol chemistry module, the medium resolution climate model BCC-CSM2-MR, and the high-resolution climate model BCC-CSM2-HR [

They play an increasingly critical role in predicting climate change and related research, and supporting climate policy decision-making.
