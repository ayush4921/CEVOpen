<p>Three leading suggestions can be made to prevent 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> invasion and spread: (1) strengthen monitoring and timely early warnings. According to the occurrence law and bio-ecological characteristics of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic>, monitoring sites should be set up in eucalyptus planting areas. Timely investigation and monitoring should be carried out, especially on the seedling production base, the surrounding areas of the occurrence area, and the young eucalyptus forests and road protection forests on both sides of urban traffic trunk lines. (2) Varieties or clones with strong resistance should be given priority for afforestation. Eucalyptus varieties or strains resistant to 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> have been planted to improve the resistance to 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> and reduce its occurrence and harm. (3) Scientific prevention and control to prevent spread damage. For the areas where 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> occurs, positive and effective measures should be implemented to control its damage, reduce the economic losses caused by disasters, and effectively prevent or slow the speed of outward spread.
