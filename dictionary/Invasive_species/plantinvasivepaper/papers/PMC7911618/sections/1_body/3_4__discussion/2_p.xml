<p>Some studies have shown that, due to the influence of global climate change, the continuous rise of global temperature, and future changes of precipitation pattern (time and space) and precipitation intensity [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], will lead to the trend of migration of many species to high latitudes and high elevations [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For example, Jia Dong et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] predicted that the apple red constricted aphid would spread to high latitudes and Northeast China in the future. Jamal et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] predicted that the small beehive beetle would spread to northern Africa and parts of Europe in the future. The future geometric distribution centers of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> predicted in this study generally migrate to high latitudes, and the range of distribution gradually spreads to the northeast. New suitable zones will appear in Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other regions. For invasive species, the distribution is affected not only by climatic conditions, but also by the species and distribution of natural enemies, host distribution, topography, and other factors. It may also be related to the unique characteristics of parthenogenesis, low-temperature resistance, generation overlap, and individual size of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In recent years, the phenomenon of global warming has intensified, which has changed the suitable environment of many species. It can be seen that climate change has a significant impact on the suitable habitat of species.
