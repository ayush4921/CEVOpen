<p>The scope of invasion of invasive species in the future is difficult to predict. At present, scientists and scholars are using and relying on environmental variables (temperature and precipitation) to predict the potential distribution of alien invasive species and suitable habitats [

 <xref rid="B41-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, the MaxEnt model was used to predict the potential distribution range of branch gall wasp in 2030 and 2050 according to environmental variables. The AUC value tested by the MaxEnt model was 0.982, which shows that the prediction result of the model has high accuracy and credibility [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and that the prediction result is also consistent with the actual distribution of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in China. According to the contribution rate of environmental factors to 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> and the importance of environmental factors in the model jackknife test, this study found that the temperature factor mid-year mean temperature (Bio1) is the most important factor affecting 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic>. This is consistent with a study by Huang Rui, which found that the growth, development, reproduction, and distribution of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> are mainly affected by temperature [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Chen Yuansheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] measured the relationship between the growth and development of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> and climate using indoor constant temperature inoculation and rearing. The results showed that the optimum temperatures for development were 25.68, 25.65, 24.58, 26.42, and 23.84 °C, and the optimum temperature for growth was 12.21–35.48 °C. In this study, the optimum range of annual average temperature of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> was 19.60–25.82 °C. This is consistent with the optimal temperature predicted in the current model, which proves that our results are credible. In this study, when the distribution probability of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> reached the maximum, the corresponding values of annual average temperature, coldest month minimum temperature, driest season average mild, and coldest monthly average temperature were 25.82, 17.50, −10.65, and 9.80 °C. Zhu Fangli et al. showed that the developmental zero temperature (DZT) of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in the whole life cycle (egg-adult) was about 19 °C, and the DZTs in egg, larva, and pupa are 13, 19.7, and 17 °C, respectively [
