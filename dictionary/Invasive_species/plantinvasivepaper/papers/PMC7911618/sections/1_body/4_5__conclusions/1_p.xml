<p>In this study, the MaxEnt model was used to model 
 <italic>Leptocybe invasa</italic> 194 distribution points and ten environmental factors to predict the suitable growth area of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> under current and future climatic conditions. The results showed that the AUC value tested by the MaxEnt model was more than 0.980, indicating that the prediction accuracy was very high. Under the background of global climate change, 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> survives in areas where the annual average temperature is 19.60–25.82 °C, the lowest temperature in the coldest month is −33.78–17.50 °C, the average seasonal temperature in the driest month is −28.40–22.77 °C, and the average temperature in the coldest month is 8.13–18.82 °C. The precipitation in the wettest season is 394.13–1946.78 mm. Under the three future climatic scenarios, the area of potential high growth zones of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in China increases and tends to spread to high latitudes, which will become more evident with the process of climate warming. 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> is the second alien invasive species in China. Combined with the results of predicting potentially suitable areas in this study, the diffusion trend can be identified, which has important theoretical significance for curbing the growth and development of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> and formulating effective control measures.
