<p>The primary aims of this study are as follows: (1) To select the main environmental variables that affect the distribution of the species to establish a model; (2) to predict the spread of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> according to SSPs1–2.5, 3.5, and SSPs5–8.5 climate change scenarios; (3) to analyze the potential suitable areas of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in China in 2000 and in the future (2030 and 2050), and to discuss the suitable growth range and future migration route of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> affected by the main environmental factors affecting potential distribution. The research results provide an essential theoretical basis for the monitoring, early warning, and effective prevention and control of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic>.
