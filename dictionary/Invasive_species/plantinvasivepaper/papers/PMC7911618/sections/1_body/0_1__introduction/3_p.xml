<p>Eucalyptus is one of the fastest-growing tree species in the world, and plays an essential role in wood processing, papermaking, as a raw material, refining essential oils, etc., [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In China, the planting area of eucalyptus is more than 36.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, and the direct economic income is more than CNY 100 billion [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, in line with the increase in the eucalyptus planting area, the number of eucalyptus pests has increased sharply [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The number of eucalyptus pest species in China increased from 53 in 1980 to 319 in 2011, resulting in a direct economic loss of more than CNY 1.125 billion per year [

 <italic>Leptocybe invasa Fisher &amp; La Salle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)</italic> was first discovered in Dongxing City [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Guangxi PROVINCE in 2007 and was listed as the second alien invasive species in China by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’s Republic of China on 7 January 2010. This insect is a globally invasive pest in eucalyptus plantations, and can harm a variety of eucalyptus strains and form galls in various parts of the plant. In severe cases, it can cause seedling lodging and stop growth, causing substantial economic losses to the eucalyptus industry (e.g., 
 <italic>eucalyptus urophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>corymbia polycarpa</italic>, 
 <italic>southern mahogany</italic>, and 
 <italic>queensland peppermint</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The early stages of adults and larvae of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> are difficult to find, hampering early interception of the pests, which can therefore be readily introduced. In addition, small species can also promote their spread locally through unintentional transport. Strict quarantine measures may delay the spread of the 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic>, but are unlikely to stop the invasion of all countries that grow eucalyptus [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The species originated in Australia but has subsequently appeared in 39 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas [

 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In China, in the space of a small number of years, 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> spread to the coastal areas of Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan, and also migrated to Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other regions in the inland areas. It has also spread to high latitude areas [

 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00092" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to use the MaxEnt model to predict the potential distribution and migration route of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in China at present and in the future. Based on the current distribution data of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in China, combined with the geographic detector and MaxEnt models, this study screened the main environmental variables and predicted the potential suitable growth areas of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> in China in 2030 and 2050.
