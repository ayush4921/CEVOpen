<p>Species distribution models (SDMs), also known as niche models, have been widely used to study the impact of climate change on the potential geographical distribution of species. The potential geographical distribution of species can be inferred from maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and other environmental factors [

At present, commonly used niche models are the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), the biological population growth model (CLIMEX), bioclimatic and domain models based on bioclimatic data, the niche factor analysis model (ENFA), and the genetic algorithm model (GARP) [

According to the longitude, latitude, and environmental variable data of actual distribution points of a species, the prediction model obtained by a probability density operation is used to evaluate the possible distribution of target species in the target area. The MaxEnt model is widely used in the prediction of the suitable growth zone of a species because of its stable operation result, short operation time, and accurate prediction ability [
