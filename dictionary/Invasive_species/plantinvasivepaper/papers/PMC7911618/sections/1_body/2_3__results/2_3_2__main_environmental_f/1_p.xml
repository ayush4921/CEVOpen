<p>The environmental factors that have significant influence on 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> distribution range calculated by MaxEnt model were as follows: annual mean temperature (Bio1) contribution rate was 43.4%; NDVI contribution rate was 20.0%; wettest seasonal rainfall (Bio16) contribution rate was 11.1%; lowest temperature (Bio6) contribution rate of the coldest month was 10.5%; and seasonal mean temperature (Bio11) contribution rate of the coldest month was 6.3%. The contribution rates of wettest quarterly average temperature (Bio8), annual temperature range (Bio7), warmest seasonal rainfall (Bio18), driest quarterly average temperature (Bio9), and isothermal (Bio3) were 3.7%, 2.1%, 1.2%, 1.0%, and 0.7% respectively (

The results of the knife-cut test showed that when only a single ecological factor variable is used, the four environmental factor variables with the most significant influence were annual mean temperature (Bio1), lowest temperature of the coldest month (Bio6), driest seasonal mean temperature (Bio9), and coldest monthly seasonal mean temperature (Bio11) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00092-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Combining the two results, the main influencing factors were vegetation cover (NDVI), weather (annual average temperature, lowest temperature of the coldest month, driest seasonal average temperature, coldest seasonal average temperature), and precipitation (wettest seasonal rainfall). According to the response curve of the main environmental factors for 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00092-f005">Figure 5</xref>), when the probability of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> distribution is ≥0.6, and the suitability grade is high suitable distribution, the normalized vegetation index is 0.10–0.64, the annual average temperature is 19.60–25.82 °C the coldest monthly minimum temperature is −33.78–17.50 °C, the driest seasonal average temperature is −28.40–22.77 °C, the coldest monthly average temperature is 8.13–18.82 °C, and the wettest season precipitation is 394.13–1946.78 mm. When the probability of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> distribution reaches the maximum, the corresponding normalized vegetation index, annual average temperature, coldest month minimum temperature, driest seasonal average temperature, coldest month season average mild, and wettest season precipitation are 0.39, 25.82 °C, 17.50 °C, −10.65 °C, 9.80 °C, and 613.15 mm, respectively.
