<p>Under the future climate scenario, the area distribution of the climate anomaly area (S &lt; 0, red area) in the whole potential distribution area is small (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00092-f010">Figure 10</xref>). Compared with the potential distribution area under the same climate scenario in the same period in the future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00092-f007">Figure 7</xref>), the suitable growth area of 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> is not predicted in the climate anomaly area. Under the climate scenarios of 2030 SSPs1–2.6, 2030 SSPs2–3.5, 2030 SSPs5–8.5, 2050 SSPs1–2.6, 2050 SSPs2–3.5, and 2050 SSPs5–8.5, the average similarity values of the 194 modern effective distribution record points for 
 <italic>L. invasa</italic> are 2.58, 2.46, 2.75, 1.76, 1.92, and 1.28, respectively, indicating that the degree of anomaly is higher in the 2030 SSPs5–8.5 climate scenario. The abnormal degree of the other five climate scenarios is low.
