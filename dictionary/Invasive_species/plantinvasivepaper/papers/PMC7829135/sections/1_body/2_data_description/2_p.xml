<p id="para0006">The ecological data presented in this article include field-observed, calculated and analysed data. Cover-abundance values observed in 53 plots were analysed, and four communities were delineated; each community was then individualized according to plots and species. The four individualized communities were composed of 15, 13, 13 and 12 plots and 52, 42, 84 and 52 species respectively. The diversity indices presented in the supplementary file were also calculated from these data.</p>
