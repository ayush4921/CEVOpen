<p id="para0016">For each plot, plants were recorded (1) andÂ their species were identified. Data on vegetation were analysed using MVSP (Multivariate Statistical Package) software in which variables are plots and samples (cases) are species. Correspondence analysis was used to delineate communities in all the sampled areas, and plant diversity of communities was calculated using Shannon-Weiner formula.</p>
