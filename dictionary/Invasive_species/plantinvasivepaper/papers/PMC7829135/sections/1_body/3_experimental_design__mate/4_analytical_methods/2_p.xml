<p id="para0015">Vegetation sampling was performed systematically according to Braun-Blanquet [11]. Plant species were inventoried in plots of 10 × 10 m which were regularly and alternatively spaced at 10 m intervals along a transect. Geographic coordinates of each plot were recorded using an estimated precision of positioning. A total of 53 plots were sampled, with 41 plots in fern bracken vegetation and 12 plots in primary forest.</p>
