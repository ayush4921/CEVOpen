    <td valign="top">Vegetation data were collected using consolidated field sampling methods. Several plaint traits were attributed to each sampled plant species by using well-established methods (e.g. Grime 
     <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> for ecological strategy, Gibson et al. 
     <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> for plant succession, Raunkiaer 
     <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> for biological forms, White

     <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> for plant distribution and IUCN 
     <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> for conservation status).Cover-abundance values were attributed to each classified plant species by using the Braun-Blanquet scale 
     <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and the percentage species coverage was then calculated from raw cover-abundance values. Taxonomic diversity indices were also calculated from the raw presence-absence values by using Multivariate Statistical Package (MVSP) software.

    <td valign="top">Vegetation sampling was performed by a systematic sampling methodology where plant species were inventoried in plots of 10 × 10 m which were regularly and alternatively spaced at 10 m intervals. Four sites were selected for the sampling. Two of them were bracken- dominated areas, the third was a bracken-regenerated site after its removal and the fourth site was a non-invaded area sampled as the control site.</td>
