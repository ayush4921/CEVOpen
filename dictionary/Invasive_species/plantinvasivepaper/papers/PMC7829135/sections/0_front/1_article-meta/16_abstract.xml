 <p>The data presented in this article describe plant traits (ecological strategy, plant succession, biological form, plant distribution and conservation status), cover-abundance scores of individualized communities after the application of Multivariate Statistical Package (MVSP) software and coverage percentage of species which compose the communities in areas sampled from Nyungwe forest. Taxonomic diversity indices (Shannon, Evenness and Richness) were also calculated and included in the dataset. The observed data can support the evaluation of
