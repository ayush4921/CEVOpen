<p>Invasive plant species are defined by three main properties, (i) their bio-geographical origin (alien plants, introduced either accidentally or on purpose by living organisms), (ii) their ability to spread without human assistance (aggressive invasion of pristine environments or opportunistic establishment in disturbed habitats), and (iii) their negative effects, including economic, environmental, and aesthetic impacts [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most species of IAPs belong to the three plant families Compositae, Poaceae, and Leguminosae [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The IAPs reviewed here are among those with potential relevance to arthropods and particularly to virus-transmitting mosquitoes. In particular, these are species that are able to rapidly fill “open” niches by fast growth and aggressive spread dynamics [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and that occupy ecological niches similar to those preferred by disease vectors [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This concerns open water surfaces (IAPs colonizing aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats) or anthropogenically disturbed terrestrial areas where IAPs displace natural vegetation using allelochemicals [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and by effectively competing for resources such as light, water, and nutrients [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In these cases, IAPs may substantially alter ecological conditions, differentially affecting arboviral mosquito vectors at different stages of their development. The main group of plants discussed in this review correspond to (i) floating aquatic plants and semi-aquatic helophytes, (ii) annual and perennial forbs, (iii) woody species, and (iv) succulent plants (
