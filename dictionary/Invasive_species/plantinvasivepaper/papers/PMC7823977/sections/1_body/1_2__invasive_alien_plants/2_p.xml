<p>Aquatic and semi-aquatic environments have been greatly affected by IAPs in Africa. Floating species such as water hyacinth (
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic>), water lettuce (
 <italic>Pistia stratiotes</italic>), and water fern (
 <italic>Salvinia molesta</italic>) are considered among the earliest introductions of alien plants into Africa [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Due to the azonality of aquatic environments, most of those species are ubiquitous. The neotropical species 
 <italic>Mimosa pigra</italic> are predominant in semi-aquatic habitats such as swamps and floodplains. These aquatic IAPs were introduced into Africa as ornamental plants for artificial ponds and are causing huge ecological and economic problems [
