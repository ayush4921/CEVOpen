<p>Mosquito species of the 
 <italic>Aedes, Culex, Mansonia, Eretmapodites</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> genera are tremendous threats to public health due to their ability to transmit viruses to humans and/or livestock [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Because viral susceptibility and transmission by a mosquito vector is affected by nutrition [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], the choice of nutrition is critical for the propagation of infectious pathogens to humans and livestock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00032-f001">Figure 1</xref>f). However, little to nothing is known about the role of plant nutrition of the mosquito vector on viral infection, replication, and transmission.
