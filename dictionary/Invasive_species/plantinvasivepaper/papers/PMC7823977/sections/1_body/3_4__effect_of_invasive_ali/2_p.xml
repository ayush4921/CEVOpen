<p>Similarly, the impenetrable thickets formed by woody IAPs like 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> can provide favourable microhabitats with access to water and shelter for mosquito vectors, especially in semi-arid regions of Africa, therefore ensuring diurnal survival. Thus, it is quite likely that the presence of certain IAPs in an environment impact vector survival and consequently their abundance and distribution [

 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> on the health of local communities, through favouring the development of arboviral mosquito vectors, adds a new dimension to the already ambiguous effects this IAP can have on community livelihoods through provision of fuel wood on one hand and the invasion of rangeland on the other [
