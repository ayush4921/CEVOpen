<p>Though there is currently no evidence for a direct link between the presence of IAPs to an increased abundance of arboviral mosquito vectors in east Africa, higher malaria incidence in Prosopis invaded areas around Lake Baringo was associated with Prosopis invasion based on perceptions by the community [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Furthermore, a habitat manipulation experiment in Mali showed that eliminating flowering branches from Prosopis plants lead to a drop in the malaria vector population by 69%, thereby confirming the perceptions of the local community [

 <italic>Prosopis juliflora</italic> has nectariferous flowers and an extremely precocious flowering age (3 to 5 years after seedling establishment) [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], which may be an important source of nutrition for vectors. Furthermore, 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> as well as many other Leguminosae (e.g., 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Senna</italic> spp.) have extra-floral nectar glands situated on the leaves [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-13-00032-f001">Figure 1</xref>e), which may offer nectar to arboviral mosquito vectors for longer periods than flowers. Additionally, in a cage experiment, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were reported to feed (93%) and survive best (86%) on flowing 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> compared to most other plants [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Flowering 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> were additionally considered to be significantly more attractive to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. These preliminary findings emphasise the need for more conclusive research on the role of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> on vectors of arboviral diseases.
