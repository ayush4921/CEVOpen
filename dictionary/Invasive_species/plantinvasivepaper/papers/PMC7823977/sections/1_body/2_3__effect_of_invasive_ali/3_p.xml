<p>In addition to the indirect facilitation of the development of Cyanobacteria by floating aquatic plants [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the presence of plant debris or inorganic material may increase the Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) content of the water, thereby supporting the growth of micro-organisms, possibly leading to increased mosquito oviposition, since the emerging larvae depend on Cyanobacteria as food for their development [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This is particularly true for 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, the primary vector of WNV and secondary vector of RVFV, which is known to thrive in habitats that contain high amounts of organic material, often as a result of human and livestock activities [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Decaying 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves for instance, have high N and P release rates [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and the presence of its leaf litter has been shown to significantly drive increases in immature 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. compared to those of the native plant 
 <italic>Terminalia sericea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, despite the extremely progressive invasion history of Prosopis in semi-arid regions of Africa [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], little is known on the potential effects of Prosopis debris on the development of immature arboviral mosquito vectors in comparison to local native plants. Thus, this needs to be investigated.
