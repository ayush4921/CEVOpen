<p>Furthermore, the thickets formed by these IAPs may provide a suitable moist and humid microhabitat conducive for egg laying as well as some protection against desiccation, especially during lengthy periods of drought. This will particularly be beneficial for floodwater 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. (primary and maintenance vectors for the RVFV), that need to remain viable during extended periods of drought. Elucidating the potential role IAPs play in supporting the development of immature stages of important arboviral mosquito vectors could greatly improve our understanding of the distribution of these vectors as well as the dynamics of the diseases they transmit. Future research should address, among others, whether (i) IAP debris can alter the oviposition activities of certain mosquito vectors, thus affecting larval and subsequently adult emergence, and (ii) if the development of immature mosquitoes in IAP debris infested breeding sites affects the ability of the emerging vectors to transmit arboviruses. Such data are important for identifying productive breeding sites for targeted vector and/or IAPs control, as well as for identifying hot spot areas for arbovirus emergence.
