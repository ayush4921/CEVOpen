<p>The Julian day on which peak “green” plant biomass (&gt; 88% of ANPP) occurs declined by 23 days (16%) over our study. This large phenological change was not related to increasing temperature as often projected [

 <sub>3</sub>), which grow rapidly and more abundantly with wetter and cooler conditions. Therefore, the peak period of growth may be more affected by changing species composition and specific seasonal, not annual, climate trends. At another western Montana location, earlier flowering dates for dicots are reported, but this is correlated with different local seasonal climate trends [
