<p>Species richness increased by 51.7% over our study, as summer senescence intensified. Species richness is important in grasslands as it strongly affects ecosystem functioning [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], which has been experimentally demonstrated [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Cleland et al.â€™s [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] survey of grassland regions found that richness increased with low precipitation, but we found that it increased with summer temperature, which may be explained if regional low precipitation and high summer temperature are positively correlated. However, while richness increased, the Shannon diversity index, which includes richness and evenness of abundance, only weakly increased (26.5%) over our study, which is counter to expectation [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Therefore, greater richness must be countered by less evenness, if more drought resistant species are 
 <underline>added</underline> and become more common, while less drought resistant species are not lost, but become rarer.
