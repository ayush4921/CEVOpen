<p>Seasonal, rather than annual, changes in climate and their strong directional effect on the NBR vegetation, may be affecting the small areas of remaining bunchgrass prairie elsewhere. Climate change can be directional or part of a natural cycle. Using time series partial autocorrelation and Fourier analysis on the 109 year NBR climate record, one can observe 4–6 and 10–15 year cycles in precipitation and temperature, as expected, given cyclic oceanic drivers [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]; rather an unidentified cycle with periodicity greater than twice our 40-year study period would be needed to produce directional changes, which seems unlikely. Therefore, a likely explanation for our observations is anthropogenic climate change [
