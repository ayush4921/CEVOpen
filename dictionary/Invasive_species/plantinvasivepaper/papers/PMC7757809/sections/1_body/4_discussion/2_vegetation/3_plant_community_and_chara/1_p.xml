<p>Bluegrasses decreased by 89% and wheatgrasses increased by 143% over our study, as summer senescence intensified. The majority of bluegrass and wheatgrass species in our study are natives that form clumps (cespitose) and can spread vegetatively (rhizomatous). However, bluegrasses are more shallowly rooted than wheatgrasses (~25 vs. 40 cm) and would be more negatively affected by warm and dry conditions during summer (less drought tolerant, USDA plant database). The dramatic post-2005 increase in wheatgrasses may be due to a steady rise in summer temperatures (0.05°C/yr: P &lt; 0.0003) and senescence (&gt;1%/yr: P &lt; 0.03) until 2005 and then summer temperature (21.3°C: P &lt; 0.45) and senescence (29%: P &lt; 0.21) stabilize.</p>
