<p>The identified seasonal climate changes also may impact intermountain bunchgrass prairies in other ways, including increased invasive species impacts and susceptibility to fire. Invasives are dramatically increasing at other intermountain bunchgrass prairies [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Invasives do not influence NBR ANPP, because most are small annual plants that do not add much biomass (&gt;50% are annual grasses). However, these annual plants contribute to increased summer senescence and thereby, may intensify the potential for fire.
