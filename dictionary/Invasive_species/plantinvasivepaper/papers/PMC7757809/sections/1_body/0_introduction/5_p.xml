<p>The bunchgrass prairie region is expected to become warmer and drier over time with anthropogenic climate change [

If drying is observed, it should lead to greater water limitation, and possibly greater nitrogen limitation, as nitrogen mineralization and atmospheric deposition may decline with less precipitation. Whether water or nitrogen is limiting, primary production should be declining over time, and drying should be increasing plant senescence over the normal summer dry period. However, vegetation responses may depend on more than annual changes over time; therefore, we also examined changes over time in seasonality that may better explain vegetation responses. In addition, climate change may affect the vegetationâ€™s species composition, which impacts drought tolerance, fire resistance, and susceptibility to invasive species. Finally, warming and drying might convert bunchgrass prairie into cold desert steppe.
