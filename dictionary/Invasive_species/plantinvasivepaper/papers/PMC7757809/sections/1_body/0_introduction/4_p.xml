<p>We examined how climate and nitrogen changes may be affecting an intermountain bunchgrass prairie. Intermountain bunchgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America, once covered ~11.7 million hectares of intermountain valleys from the Rockies west to the Cascades and from southern Alberta/British Columbia south to northern Utah/Nevada, but now is restricted to less than 100,000 hectares by agriculture and overgrazing (&lt;1% of original area) [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Bunchgrass receives much less precipitation than the Great Plains as surrounding mountains create rain shadows, and little precipitation occurs in summer (July–Sept) given prevailing Westerlies [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Finally, bunchgrass may be especially sensitive to climate change, as its precipitation and temperature falls within a narrow range between that for cold desert and Great Plains mixed grass prairie [
