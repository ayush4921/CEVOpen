<p>Grasslands are particularly important to humans by providing a disproportionate amount of agricultural and livestock production, as well as wildlife habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As grasslands are often found in drier and warmer climates, they may be particularly susceptible to declining primary production and changing vegetation as climate changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Few long term data sets examine grassland responses to climate change, e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and most examine large spatial scale responses to changes in annual temperature and precipitation. However, Craine et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] indicate that seasonal shifts in temperature and precipitation may be more important at local spatial scales.
