<p>Plant species composition was only measured repeatedly at two sites (Hill, Triangle: 2001â€“2017) with the same methodology (point frame). Because grasses are the dominant species, we examined the relative abundances of the two most common types of grass: bluegrasses and wheatgrasses, which varied in relative abundance among years (
