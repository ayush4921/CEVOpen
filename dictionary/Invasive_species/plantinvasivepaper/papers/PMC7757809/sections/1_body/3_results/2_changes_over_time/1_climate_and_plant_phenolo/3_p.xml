<p>Climate changes at more specific times during vegetation phenology were examined. During the main period of plant growth (late-Mayâ€“June: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g002">Fig 2</xref>), temperature tended to remain unchanged (Mann-Kendall: z = -0.52, P &lt; 0.30), as found for spring in general, while precipitation tended to increase (Mann-Kendall: z = 1.23, P &lt; 0.11), opposite the spring seasonal value. Therefore, the ratio of precipitation to temperature tended to increase (Mann-Kendall: z = 1.11, P &lt; 0.13) over the period of main plant growth during our study. This indicates reduced evapotranspiration [
