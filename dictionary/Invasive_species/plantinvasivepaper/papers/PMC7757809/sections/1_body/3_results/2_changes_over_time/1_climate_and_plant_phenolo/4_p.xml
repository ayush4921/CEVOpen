<p>There is a period of summer plant senescence (July–Aug decline in “green” plant biomass: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g002">Fig 2</xref>), as the vegetation is dominated by “cool-season” grasses (C
 <sub>3</sub>: &gt;&gt;95% of bomass). During this period, temperature increased (Mann-Kendall: z = 3.37, P &lt; 0.0004) and precipitation decreased (Mann-Kendall: z = -2.24, P &lt; 0.01), which are consistent with the summer seasonal trends. This led to a decline in the precipitation to temperature ratio (Mann-Kendall: z = -2.60, P &lt; 0.005), as expected with annual and summer seasonal drying and warming. This suggests that senescence should have intensified over our study.
