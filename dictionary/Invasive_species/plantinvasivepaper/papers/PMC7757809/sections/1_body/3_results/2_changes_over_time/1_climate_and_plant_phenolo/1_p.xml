<p>Monthly average temperature and precipitation since 1909 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) indicate a 19.0°C maximum temperature in July–Aug, a -2.5°C minimum temperature in Dec–Jan, and a 5.7 cm maximum precipitation in May or June. As expected since 1909, average temperature increased 0.7°C (11%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and average precipitation decreased 10.9 cm (27%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). During our study (1978–2017), average annual temperature increased (Mann-Kendall: z = 1.97, P &lt; 0.02), which accounts for 63% of the overall temperature increase observed since 1909, so that average annual temperature increased at a 127% faster rate than before our study (0.018°C/yr vs. 0.008°C/yr). Likewise, annual precipitation decreased during our study (Mann-Kendall: z = -1.99, P &lt; 0.02), which accounts for 21% of the overall precipitation decrease since 1909, so that average annual precipitation decreased by a 68% slower rate than before our study (0.19 cm/yr vs. 0.06 cm/yr).
