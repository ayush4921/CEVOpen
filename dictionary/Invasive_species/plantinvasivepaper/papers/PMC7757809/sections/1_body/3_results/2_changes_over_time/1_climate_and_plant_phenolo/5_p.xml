<p>There is a brief period when plants grow again (late-Sept increase in “green” biomass: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g002">Fig 2</xref>) after summer senescence and before the onset of frosts (Oct). During this period, temperature increased (Mann-Kendall: z = 2.20, p &lt; 0.02) as expected for the summer season, and precipitation was unchanged (Mann-Kendall: z = -0.86, p &lt; 0.20), which is opposite the summer seasonal decrease and fall seasonal increase. This tended to reduce the precipitation to temperature ratio (Mann-Kendall: z = -1.11, p &lt; 0.13), which should have decreased this renewal of plant production during our study.
