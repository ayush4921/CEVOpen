<p>Daily climate data (precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature) are available since 1909. Data from 1909 –July, 1999 are available from the NBR headquarters (795m: 707570E 5249753N). Since July, 1999, the weather station was moved and data were not regularly collected. Therefore, data were obtained from the AgriMet Round Butte, MT station (18.9 km away, 926m: 704653E 5268696W). From 1989–2000, precipitation and temperature were highly correlated between NBR and Round Butte sites (precipitation: r = 0.94, N = 12, constant not different from 0, slope = 1.03 and p &lt; 0.000001; temperature: r = 0.94, n = 12, constant not different from 0, slope = 0.94 and p &lt; 0.000008).</p>
