<p>Plant species composition was obtained for 1978, 1980–1983 and for all years since 1997. In June 1978, vegetation was clipped and sorted to species for 26–1 m
 <sup>2</sup> plots randomly located throughout NBR. In June 1980–1983, vegetation was clipped and sorted to species for 30–0.1 m
 <sup>2</sup> plots randomly located at each of two sites (Hill &amp; Triangle, which were sampled in 1978). Since June 1997, point frame sampling [

 <sup>2</sup>) at one site and 9 at the other, 100 points in June and Sept were identified to bare ground, litter, moss, lichen, or plant species. Plant species were identified using a number of keys [
