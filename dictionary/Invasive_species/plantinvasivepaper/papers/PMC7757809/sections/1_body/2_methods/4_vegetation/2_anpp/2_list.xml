  <p>For the period 1978–1993, live (green) vegetation was clipped on 10–12 randomly selected 0.1 m
   <sup>2</sup> plots at each site every two weeks from late-May–mid-Oct. Clipped vegetation was separated between grass and dicot (forbs or leaves from woody vegetation), dried for 48 hours at 60°C, and then weighed. This also provided the relative abundances of grass and dicot. Clipping is time consuming and destructive, so this method was replaced.

  <p>Since 1994, 10–12 permanent points were randomly selected at each site, and the abundance of live (green) vegetation was measured every two weeks by radiometer [

   <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] from late-May–mid-Oct. This is non-destructive and requires less time. The radiometer was held at a height to measure a 0.10 m
   <sup>2</sup> area. Live plant biomass is computed from radiometer readings using a site and date specific regression. Each regression was based on radiometer readings of 3–5 0.1 m
   <sup>2</sup> plots that were adjacent to the study location; these reference plots were selected to range from very low to very high plant abundances. Green vegetation in each plot was clipped, separated between grass and dicot, dried for 48 hours at 60°C, and weighed. Regressions averaged an r of 0.93 (±0.03 SE; range: 0.45–0.99). Relative abundances of grass and dicot were based on clippings from reference plots.
