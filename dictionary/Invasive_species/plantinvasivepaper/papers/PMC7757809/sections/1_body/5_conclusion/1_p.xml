<p>Climate over the past 109 years in a bunchgrass ecosystem has annually warmed and dried as expected with anthropogenic climate change. Over the past 40 years, we found that changes in plant production, composition and summer senescence followed seasonal, not annual, climate trends. The period of greatest (&gt; 88%) plant production (late-May–June) became wetter and cooler counter to annual trends, which resulted in increased plant production, especially for grasses. Summer temperature became warmer than expected from annual trends, which resulted in increased summer senescence and decreased fall regrowth. Therefore, our data support claims that ecological forecasts for the consequences of climate change should be based on local [
