<p>The above and additional patterns (e.g., nitrogen changes, species composition, invasive species, and possible increased fire) reported here indicate that intermountain bunchgrass prairie is no longer the historic ecosystem, and may be morphing into a previously unknown ecosystem. Therefore, ecologists may have difficulty in forecasting how ecosystems will respond to climate change and other associated disturbances without far greater ecological knowledge at local and seasonal levels as we describe here.</p>
