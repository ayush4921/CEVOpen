<p>Geographical, socioeconomic, and ecological data that were suspected drivers of invasive species diversity were assessed for each island. The complete list of variables assessed is included in Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>. These data were obtained in August 2016 from The World Factbook (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/</ext-link>) and from the UNEP Island Directory (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://islands.unep.ch/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://islands.unep.ch/</ext-link>). Data for islands with political units corresponding to different countries (e.g., Dutch and French parts of St Martin and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands) were combined and reported as absolute or mean values depending on the variable type (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>).
