<p>Using the ratio of invasive to native species as the dependent variable, the GLM analyses showed that the model including all factors explained 75% of the variation (Table

 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Nevertheless, from all 64 models generated (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), the simplest best‐fit (most parsimonious) model (AICc = −32.56; AIC
 <sub>weight</sub> = 0.39; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) included only one variable: the GDP. The next best models included human population density (AICc = −28.80; AIC
 <sub>weight</sub> 0.06) and a combination of island area and GDP (AICc = −28.35; AIC
 <sub>weight</sub> = 0.05) but both were less well supported than the best‐fit model (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the number of invasive species increases consistently with island size and that paved roadways (an index of economic development) are facilitating the entrance and movement of invasive species on these islands. On the other hand, the ratio of invasive to native species increases with economic development and human population density, suggesting that human activities are favoring the establishment of invaders over native species.
