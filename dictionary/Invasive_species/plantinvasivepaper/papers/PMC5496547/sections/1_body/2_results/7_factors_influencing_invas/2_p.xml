<p>Our GLM analyses for the number of invasive species as the dependent variable showed that the model including all factors explained 36% of the variation (Table

 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). However, the AICc analyses for determining the simplest best‐fit model showed that from all 64 models created, only two equivalent models (∆AICc &lt; 2.0; Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>) were good predictors of the number of invasive species per island. The first model included only the kilometers of paved roadways (AICc = 104.20; AIC
 <sub>weight</sub> = 0.42; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), while the second model included only the island area (AICc = 105.52; AIC
 <sub>weight</sub> 0.22; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The AICc statistics suggest that both models are robust (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>). The third best model included only elevation (AICc = 108.96; AIC
 <sub>weight</sub> = 0.04), but it was less well supported than the two best‐fit models and the difference in AICc was larger than 4 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>).
