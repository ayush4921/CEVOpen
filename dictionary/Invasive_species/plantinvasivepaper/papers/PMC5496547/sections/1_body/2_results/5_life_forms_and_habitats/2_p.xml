<p>Invasive plant species in the West Indies show diverse life forms, with a prevalence of herbs (162 species, 31%) followed by trees (102 species, 20%), shrubs (80 species, 16%), grasses (77 species, 15%), vines (67 species, 13%), succulents (15 species, 3%), and aquatic herbs (13 species, 2.5%). The majority of the invasive species (77%) are perennials, while the remaining 23% are considered annuals (Table

At the island scale, herbs are again the dominant life form on five of the nine islands analyzed (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and St Lucia), followed by trees that are the dominant life form on three islands (Bahamas, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago) and grasses that are the dominant life form on St Martin (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>). Across the nine islands, invasive species occur in all four habitats considered in this study: ruderal (506 species, 98%), seminatural (314 species, 61%), agricultural (138 species, 35%), and mature forests (27 species, 5%), with species often found in more than one habitat. These results showed that for the West Indies invasive plant species are considerably more frequent in ruderal and seminatural habitats regardless of whether they also occur on other habitats.
