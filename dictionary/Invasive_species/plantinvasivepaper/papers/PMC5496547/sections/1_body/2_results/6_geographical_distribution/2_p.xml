<p>Invasive plant species in the West Indies can be sourced to all continents (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), with the largest fraction coming from Asia (30%), followed by species coming from continental America (25%) and Africa (19%). Asiatic species are largely represented in the invasive flora of the Bahamas, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Trinidad and Tobago. Among the nine islands studied, Cuba has the highest percentage of invasive species coming from continental America (30%). The islands of St Martin and St Lucia, on the other hand, have the highest percentage of invasive species derived from Africa (45%) and Europe (44%), respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When considering the type of introduction, we found that 75% of all invasive plants are species that have escaped from cultivation, 18% are the result of unintentional introductions (e.g., contaminants), and 7% were deliberately introduced into natural ecosystems (e.g., plants for erosion control). The most common planting purpose/use category was ornamental (51%) followed by species introduced for forage and fodder production (12%), agriculture/food crops (11%), agroforestry (6%), soil improvement (5%), and timber production (2%).
