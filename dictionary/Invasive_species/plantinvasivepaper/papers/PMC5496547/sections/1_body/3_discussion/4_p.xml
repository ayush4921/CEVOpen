<p>Our combined results indicate that the invasive floras of the West Indies are ecologically and taxonomically very diverse, with low similarity of invasive species richness observed among islands. Fabaceae and Poaceae are the families with the highest numbers of invasive species, as expected given that they are among the largest plant families at both global and local scales (Acevedo‐Rodríguez &amp; Strong, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Daehler, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>) and they are the two most diverse families in the alien and invasive floras of other insular systems (Guézou et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Kueffer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Silva &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). On Caribbean Islands, most Fabaceae and Poaceae invaders are species that have escaped from active and abandoned pastures and agroforestry systems (introduced primarily as nitrogen fixers, soil improvers, forages, and fodders) and ornamentals escaped from cultivation (Oviedo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Rojas‐Sandoval &amp; Acevedo‐Rodríguez, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Van der Burg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In fact, our results showed that most invasive plant species in the West Indies (75%) have escaped from cultivation. We also found that more than 50% of plant invaders were introduced as ornamentals on these islands. Ornamental trade has been recognized as the main pathway for plant invasions worldwide (Dehnen‐Schmutz, Touza, Perrings, &amp; Williamson, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Hulme, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and has been shown to be a crucial factor explaining the establishment, naturalization, and subsequent invasion of alien plant species on Caribbean islands (Rojas‐Sandoval &amp; Acevedo‐Rodríguez, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The recurrent introduction of certain species associated with ornamental trade, directly linked to economic development (see below), may increase propagule pressure and the establishment probability of invasive species (Lockwood, Cassey, &amp; Blackburn, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Mack &amp; Lonsdale, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Pemberton &amp; Liu,
