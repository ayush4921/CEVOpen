<p>On islands, human activities are known drivers for the spread and establishment of invasive species (Kueffer et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Richardson &amp; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Our statistical models based on GLM show that invasive species diversity is well predicted by a combination of island area and economic development (measured here as GDP per capita and kilometers of paved roadways). For the West Indies, plant invasions appear to be more frequent on large islands with substantial economic activity. These patterns are in general agreement with other studies showing that measures of economic development including GDP, presence of airports, and trade intensity are good predictors of invasive species diversity on islands (Denslow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Kueffer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Indeed, economic development is often correlated with the magnitude of alien introductions as well as with the intensity of anthropogenic disturbance of natural areas (Kueffer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Pyšek &amp; Richardson, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Reaser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). On islands with higher economic activity, the magnitude of introduction and planting (propagule pressure) of particular species, especially ornamentals and commodity plants, are expected to be higher than in less developed islands. Our results suggest that this link between propagule pressure and economic development may be crucial to predict the future trajectories of plant invasions in the West Indies. Critically, the high rates of invasibility on Caribbean islands come at the cost of negative impacts on native ecosystems and the threat of extinction of endemic species (Rojas‐Sandoval &amp; Meléndez‐Ackerman,
