<p>We have identified a total of 516 alien plant species that are invasive on at least one of the nine islands studied. The incidence of invasive plant species in the West Indies seems to be high when compared to the numbers reported for other island groups. For instance, Kueffer et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) studied 30 island groups worldwide and reported 383 invasive plants species, and Weber (
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) estimated 448 invasive plants globally for islands and continents combined. However, these studies only included alien plant species invading natural terrestrial habitats while our study included natural terrestrial and aquatic habitats, but also ruderal and semi‐natural habitats. Indeed, for the nine islands included in our study, the majority of invasive species occur (but not exclusively) on ruderal and disturbed habitats. Our results show that the proportion of alien species that have become invasive, at both regional and local scales, is also higher than the corresponding value reported for other islands: This proportion ranges from 6% to 54% on selected islands across the West Indies (this study), while the values reported for other islands are generally lower and vary from 3% in the Juan Fernandez Archipelago (Castro &amp; Jaksic, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0501" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) and 5% on Hawaii Islands, to 11% in Fiji (Meyer, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and 12% on Galapagos Islands (Trueman, Atkinson, Guézou, &amp; Wurm, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
