<p>Plant fitness â€“defined as the relative reproductive success of a genotype as measured by survival, fecundity or other life history parameters [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]- is highly dependent on a series factors such as environmental stress, life cycle, and breeding system. As pointed out by Valladares (1999) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] the Darwinian fitness concept is easy to understand, however, it can be extremely difficult to measure directly and it can be only measured in relative terms. Hence, plant fitness is estimated through indirect parameters such as plant size, adult longevity, or growth, which are correlated to fitness, but also to plasticity. We performed a controlled experiment with individuals from the invasive species 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> Weber ex F. H. Wigg (Dandelion) from five continents as plant model because is an apomictic plant. It reproduces through unfertilized ovules that are genetically identical to the mother plant [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this way, we were able to evaluate the extent of the relationship between physiological performance and fitness and to properly isolate if a physiology-fitness relationship between different genotypes has an adaptive basis. Specifically, we tested the prediction that photochemical efficiency can be a good predictor of plant fitness by using second generation (F
 <sub>2</sub>) individuals of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> as to ask whether: (i) Are higher photochemical efficiency values correlated with higher female fitness, measured as seed-output?, (ii) Does environmental heterogeneity modify the strength of the relationship between physiological performance and female fitness?, and (iii) Has the variation in the physiology-fitness relationship any adaptive relevance under different abiotic scenarios?
