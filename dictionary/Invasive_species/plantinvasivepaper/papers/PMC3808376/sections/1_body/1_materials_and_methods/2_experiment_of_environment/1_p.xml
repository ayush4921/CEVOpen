<p>Second generation seedlings from all localities were planted in 500-mL plastic pots filled with potting soil, and transferred to greenhouse. Two watering regimes were applied to individuals from all populations. In the homogeneous environmental regime, plants received 50 ml of water every day (350 ml per week). Plants in the heterogeneous environmental regime also received a total of 350 ml of water, but watering was randomly distributed during the week, with a minimum and maximum amount of 25 and 100 ml of water irrigation, respectively. The full experiment resulted in 12 replicates x 2 watering scenarios x 17 localities = 408 pots in total. Pot position within the greenhouse was changed every five days and interpot distances were sufficient to prevent mutual shading. Plants were supplemented with 0.2 g l
 <sup>-1</sup> of PhostrogenÂ® (Solaris, N-P-K, 14:10:27) once every 15 d. Experimental treatments lasted for 150 days and then we measured maximum quantum yield and seed-output as proxies of physiological performance and fitness traits, respectively.
