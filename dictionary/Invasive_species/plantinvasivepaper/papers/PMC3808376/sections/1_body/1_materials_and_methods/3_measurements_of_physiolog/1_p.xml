<p>We measured physiological performance (maximum quantum yield) at the end of the anthesis at room temperature using a pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer (FMS 2, Hansatech, Instruments Ltd, Norfolfk, UK). We considered maximum quantum yield of PSII (F
 <sub>v</sub>/F
 <sub>m</sub>; where F
 <sub>v</sub> = [F
 <sub>m</sub> - F
 <sub>0</sub>], F
 <sub>m</sub> = maximum fluorescence yield, and F
 <sub>0</sub> = minimum fluorescence yield) as a proxy of physiological performance (see, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). One fully-developed attached leaf from each individual was dark adapted for 30 min (to obtain open PSII centers) using leaf-clips to ensure maximum photochemical efficiency. The fiber-optic and its adaptor were fixed to a ring located over the clip at approximately 10 mm from the sample and the different light pulses were applied (see below). Signal recordings and calculations were performed using the data analysis and control software provided with the instrument. Minimal fluorescence (F
 <sub>0</sub>) with all PSII reactions in the open state was determined by applying a weak modulated light (0.4 mol m
 <sup>-2</sup> s
 <sup>-1</sup>). Maximal fluorescence (F
 <sub>m</sub>) with all PSII reaction centers in the closed state was induced by a 0.8s saturating pulse of white light (9000 µmol m
 <sup>-2</sup> s
 <sup>-1</sup>). After 15 s, the actinic light (180 µmol m
 <sup>-2</sup> s
 <sup>-1</sup>) was turned on and the same saturating pulse described previously was applied every 60s, until steady-state photosynthesis was reached in order to obtain the steady-state fluorescence yield (F
 <sub>s</sub>) and light-adapted fluorescence maximum (F
 <sub>m</sub>'). Finally, F
 <sub>0</sub>' was measured after turning the actinic light off and applying a 2 s far red light pulse (see, 18]).
