<p>Under water shortage, as it is expected mainly in localities with highly seasonal precipitation, down-regulation of photosynthesis or photoinhibition cause overexcitation of the photochemical system [

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, a high concentration of reduced electron acceptors may increase the regeneration of free radical molecules, which can damage PSII components, even the thylakoid membrane, negatively affecting physiological performance [

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Free-radical damage to the photosystems can potentially have a whole-plant effect and negatively impact fitness, although we not measured the effect of free-radicals, negative effects that decrease the fitness in 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> is not rule out here. There is a strong relation between PSII efficiency and CO
 <sub>2</sub> assimilation. Some authors have argued that different fluorescence parameters could be appropriate estimators of plant performance and therefore positively linked with plant fitness [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results support the idea that maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II is positively related to fitness in 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals, and rainfall seasonality can drive the strength of this relationship. Thus, we suggest that a rapid measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters would be used to estimate the potential fitness, at least of the invasive 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic>.
