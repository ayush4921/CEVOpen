<p>In both homogeneous and heterogeneous watering conditions, seed-output was greater in individuals with higher values of physiological performance (

Under the homogeneous regime of watering, those individuals with higher maximum quantum efficiency (Fv / Fm) and from localities with low precipitation seasonality showed a greater seed-output. Contrarily, under a heterogeneous watering regime, those individuals of
