<p>It is estimated that extrafloral nectaries occur in 1%–2% of terrestrial plant species. These highly diversified structures, located at almost every above‐ground organ of plants, produce aqueous solution of carbohydrates and other compounds, similar to “classic” nectar produced in flowers (Weber &amp; Keeler,

As different species of ants (Formicidae) are the most common insects utilizing this source of food, it is generally accepted that occurrence of extrafloral nectaries is evidence of coevolution between plant and ants. There are three main models of this coevolution: protection, flower distraction, and ant distraction. Probably, first of them is the most common; in this model, the ants protect plant against herbivores, obtaining in return “reward” from the plant. Two other models assume that plant with help of extrafloral nectaries distracts ants from flowers, where they may affect pollination, or from their herbivorous trophobionts (Del‐Claro et al.,
