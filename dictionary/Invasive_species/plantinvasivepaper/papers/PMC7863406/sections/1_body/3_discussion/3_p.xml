<p>Presence of extrafloral nectaries on mentioned above plants was not studied by us in details, but high number of insects, especially different ant species, was noted on all these trees checked in all study sites. Although we are not able to confirm whether these insects were using extrafloral nectaries of 
 <italic>Spathodea campanulata</italic>, 
 <italic>Hibiscus tiliaceus</italic>, 
 <italic>Acacia mangium</italic>, 
 <italic>Erythrina fusca</italic>, and/or 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> as food source, numerous examples from different regions of the world clearly show that high diversity and abundance of Formicidae on plant species having such structures is a typical phenomenon (e.g., Aguirre‐Jaimes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Fonseca‐Romero et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Fotso et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Giuliani et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Sanz‐Veiga et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). As it was noted in the literature, ants collect food from extrafloral nectaries and at the same time they can protect the plant against herbivorous insects (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), so both partners of such mutualistic relationship have benefits. On the other hand, it can be expected that high number of ants can result in higher number of predators specializing in such type of prey, like arboreal tiger beetles, especially 
 <italic>Tricondyla</italic> species. Although no details about Formicidae species were provided by the authors, we believe that most probably such example comes also from the paper by Abeywardhana et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) who noted 
 <italic>T. gounelli</italic> Horn, 1900 on 
 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic>. This tree species has extrafloral nectaries on leaves, flowers, inflorescences, and fruits, what makes this plant very attractive for ants and, consequently, for ant predators including arboreal tiger beetles. Although definitely future studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, the described situation clearly suggests that at least some arboreal Cicindelidae can benefit from presence of alien/invasive tree species in human‐changed habitats because of high concentration of their potential prey. As 
 <italic>Hibiscus tiliaceus</italic> and 
 <italic>Erythrina fusca</italic>, which are native to the Philippines, were the second and the third tree species according to number of tiger beetles noted in this study, we suppose that presence of these insects on trees having extrafloral nectaries is not fully a novel hunting adaptation (even if never studied before), but can suggest that at least some arboreal tiger beetles can easily adapt to environmental changes like is was observed earlier in other representatives of this family (e.g., Cabrera et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Gilbert, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Rewicz &amp; Jaskuła, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Riggins &amp; Hoback, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Moreover, our results clearly suggest that presence of alien/invasive tree species, even if generally it has negative impact on biodiversity (e.g., Dostál et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Harvey &amp; Fortuna, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), occasionally can support local populations of some native or even endemic taxa, especially in highly human‐disturbed habitats.
