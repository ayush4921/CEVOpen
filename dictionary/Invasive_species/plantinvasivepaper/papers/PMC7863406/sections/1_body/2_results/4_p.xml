 <xref rid="ece37149-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that 
 <italic>Tricondyla elongata</italic> was observed at five tree species; however, 
 <italic>Spathodea campanulata</italic> and 
 <italic>Hibiscus tiliaceus</italic> seemed to be the favorable for this species (respectively, 65% and 19% of noted specimens). Three other species (
 <italic>Erythrina fusca</italic>, 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acacia mangium</italic>) were visited by less than 10% tiger beetles each. In contrast, 
 <italic>Tricondyla cavifrons</italic> was found on four tree species, especially on tree trunks and branches of 
 <italic>Erythrina fusca</italic> (53%), 
 <italic>Hibiscus tiliaceus</italic> (23%), and 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> (17%). Only 7% of hunting specimens of this species was noted on 
 <italic>Spathodea campanulata</italic>. The result of chi‐square test shown significant differences between these two 
 <italic>Tricondyla</italic> species according to visited tree species (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 33.92, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In case of both 
 <italic>Neocollyris</italic> species, it is rather difficult to estimate tree preferences as only single individuals were noted during this study.
