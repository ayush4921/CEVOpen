 <p>Arboreal tiger beetle species used invasive and native trees having extrafloral nectaries as preferred place for hunting on ants, the insects which are attracted to these trees because of presence of sweet substances produced in these elements. Based on these observations, we suggest a new mutualistic insectâ€“plant interaction between native and invasive species. In our opinion, this is the first case of such interactions noted between tiger beetles and invasive trees both in the Philippines and in the entire area of the southeastern Asia.
