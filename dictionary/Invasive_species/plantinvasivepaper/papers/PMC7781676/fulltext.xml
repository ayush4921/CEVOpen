It has been estimated that approximately 10% of food samples collected between 2007 and 2012 were estimated to contain aflatoxins [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When these foods are ingested or when <italic>A. flavus</italic> is able to grow without immunological constraint, acute toxicity in addition to a long-term increase in cancer risk can occur in affected individuals [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Owing to the economic and food safety issues in agriculture and medicine, much attention has been directed at the study of aflatoxin synthesis and pathway regulation through the genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry methods. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathway regulation will enable the development of innovative approaches for reducing aflatoxin production in important agricultural crops and human exposure to aflatoxins in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis. Although a wide variety of factors can induce or inhibit aflatoxin synthesis in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref>], the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling aflatoxin production in <italic>A. flavus</italic> are still fragmentary.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that fungal vacuoles/vesicles are versatile organelles, involved in regulating various cellular processes [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mutations affecting vacuole function and vacuole membrane homeostasis can lead to defects in fungal virulence [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref>]. In <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, mutations of a subset of vacuolar proteins affected hyphal morphogenesis, growth, and virulence [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, a lack of the vacuolar transport chaperone Vtc4 in <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> significantly decreased its virulence on maize [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and deletion of the vesicle-vacuole fusion protein Vb1 influences aflatoxin synthesis in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notably, previous efforts have focused on the role of vacuoles and vesicles in the secondary metabolism of <italic>A. flavus</italic> [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting that a functional vacuole plays an important role in fungal growth and virulence. However, very little is known about the regulatory mechanism of vacuoles in regulating <italic>Aspergillus</italic> metabolism, particularly the functions of vacuole-related genes.</p><p>Accumulating evidence has revealed that phosphatidylinositol lipids play important roles in various cellular processes [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among them, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub>), which predominantly locates in the endosome and vacuole, has been implicated in membrane homeostasis in various types of eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub> is generated from phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI-3-P) by the phosphoinositide phosphate kinase Fab1. Previous effects have stated that Fab1 kinase is highly conserved in many fungi and may play an important regulatory role in maintaining the normal vacuole function and morphology by regulating the PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub> levels in phosphatidylinositol metabolism [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The ability of Fab1 to regulate vacuole size, protein sorting, osmotic balance and the trafficking of some substrates in yeast has been well established [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Notably, defects in the dynamic regulation of PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub> are linked to human diseases [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the human pathogenic fungus <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub> levels regulated by Fab1 are closely related to membrane trafficking and vacuole homeostasis, and <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Fab1 plays important roles in the intracellular survival and virulence of this fungus [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite the studies of Fab1 having had some success, the molecular details of how this enzyme regulates vacuolar functions and aflatoxin synthesis in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> are still lacking.</p><p>To fill this gap, we have made an attempt to unravel the functional role of the <italic>A. flavus</italic> putative orthologue of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub> kinase Fab1 in a variety of cellular processes. Our functional studies revealed that deletion of Fab1 influences the growth, development, aflatoxin production, pathogenicity, and vacuole/vesicle function of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Further quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that Fab1 may maintain vacuolar/cellular homeostasis to facilitate aflatoxin synthesis in <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanisms of <italic>A. flavus</italic> pathogenicity and aflatoxin biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s0002" disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-s2001" disp-level="2"><title>Discovery and validation of a novel vacuole-related protein</title><p>Through NCBI BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searching, we identified an <italic>A. flavus</italic> protein with significant similarity to yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) PtdIns-3,5-P<sub>2</sub> kinase (Fab1 protein) (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). The coordinates of the putative <italic>fab1</italic> were 4,215,543&#x02013;4,220,895 from NW_002477237.1 fragment in the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome, with no annotation information (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>). To further confirm the existence of the putative <italic>fab1</italic>, we performed transcriptional expression analysis by using previously published RNA-Seq data. As shown in <bold>Figure S2</bold>, the additional transcriptomic data also supported the presence of this novel gene in the <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome. Notably, a highly similar homolog of this protein was discovered in <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and designated as a putative phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (<bold>Fig. S3A</bold>). Moreover, analysis of the protein structural domain revealed that this family of proteins contains a number of highly conserved domains, including a zinc finger structure (FYVE), as well as Cpn60_TCP1 and phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase domains (PIPKc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a</xref>)), which correspond to phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases in most eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These analyses thus suggested that this novel protein may function as a phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (named as Fab1) involved in phosphatidylinositol metabolism. We hypothesized that Fab1 in <italic>A. flavus</italic> may catalyze the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, which are essential lipid molecules in a range of cellular processes [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that this protein was highly conserved among different species, including <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, <italic>Elaphomyces granulatus, Penicillium arizonense, Penicillium coprophilum, Penicillium polonicum, Penicillium vulpinum</italic> and <italic>Talaromyces atroroseus</italic> (<bold>Fig. S3B</bold>). To further validate the novel protein, we assessed <italic>fab1</italic> expression at the transcript level and our result revealed significant up-regulation under three distinct growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(b</xref>)).<fig id="f0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Fab1 identification and validation.

Unlike in the WT strain, sclerotia in the &#x02206;fab1 strain were completely absent; this phenotype was reversed in the &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(d</xref>) <bold>and Fig. S5E</bold>), suggesting that a loss of <italic>fab1</italic> led to impairing sclerotial formation.

As such, we hypothesized that vacuolar dysregulation arising as a result of the loss of <italic>fab1</italic> would result in impaired aflatoxin export. To test this hypothesis, we assessed aflatoxin production via thin layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. TLC analyses indicated markedly reduced aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> production from the &#x02206;fab1 strain relative to from the WT and &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(e</xref>)), with the levels reduced by &#x0003e;10-fold relative to the WT strain (<bold>Fig. S5G</bold>). We then validated this result via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a Xevo TQ MS machine. This analysis confirmed that only trace levels of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> were detectable and minimal aflatoxin B<sub>2</sub> was evident in the &#x02206;fab1 strain, whereas normal production of these aflatoxins was observed for the WT and &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(f</xref>) <bold>and Fig. S5H</bold>). This thus further suggested that Fab1 was likely to influence the biosynthesis of aflatoxins and their consequent export by controlling vacuolar membrane homeostasis.</p><p>As aflatoxin contamination of food sources is a significant source of concern, we next explored the impact of <italic>fab1</italic> deletion on the pathogenicity of <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We observed difference growth dynamics for these strains when they were used to inoculate peanut seeds; the growth, sporulation, and invasion of the &#x02206;fab1 strain were markedly less effective than in the WT and &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(a</xref>)). Consistent with our previous results, the &#x02206;fab1 strain tended to produce fewer conidia than the WT and &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(b</xref>)). Previous studies showed that aflatoxin is important for seed infection [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref>]. We subsequently assessed aflatoxin production in these samples, revealing that the WT and &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strains, but not the &#x02206;fab1 strain produced aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(c</xref>)). Further MS analyses confirmed that the &#x02206;fab1 strain failed to produce detectable aflatoxins, whereas normal aflatoxin production was evident for the WT and &#x02206;fab1::fab1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(d</xref>)).

Early aflatoxin synthesis may also occur in peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9</xref>).

The DEPs in these organelles may also impact gene expression and transport mechanisms, thereby altering aflatoxin synthesis.
