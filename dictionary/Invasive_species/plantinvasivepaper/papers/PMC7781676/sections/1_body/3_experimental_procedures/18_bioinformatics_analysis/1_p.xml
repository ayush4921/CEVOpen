<p>The functional annotation of all the identified proteins was performed by using Blast2GO tool and the subcellular localization was analyzed by CELLO web tool [
 <xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Conservation analysis of the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> proteome was carried out by using reciprocal BLAST [
 <xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Sequence alignment was also performed using ClustalX2 [
 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and visualized by CLC sequence viewer (

 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed by using MEGA 5.0 software [
 <xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The transcripts were retrieved from NCBI (SRX237459, SRX237295, SRX1330586, SRX396791). For RNA-seq data analysis, the retrieved low-quality RNA reads were filtered and then mapped to the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome using TopHat (version 2.1.1) [
 <xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. R scripts and Excel were used for the statistical analyses. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student’s t-tests and expressed as a p value. 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
