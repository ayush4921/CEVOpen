<p>The cultures were then collected by filtration and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. The mycelia were ground into powders and reconstituted in buffer [20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1× phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)]. The mixtures were shaken at 30°C for 1 h and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 1 h. Finally, the protein concentration was measured by bicinchonininc acid (BCA) method (Tiangen, Beijing, China).</p>
