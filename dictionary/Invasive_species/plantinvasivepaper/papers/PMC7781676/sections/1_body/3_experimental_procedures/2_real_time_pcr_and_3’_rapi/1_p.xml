<p>Total RNA was extracted from the mycelia grown in different conditions (37°C, 29°C, salt and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> stresses) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as the manufacturer’s protocols. The concentration of total RNA was quantitated using the Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer. RT-PCR validation of novel genes was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche). The actin gene was used as the endogenous control and three independent biological replicates were carried out for duplicate samples. The gene-specific primers were compiled in
