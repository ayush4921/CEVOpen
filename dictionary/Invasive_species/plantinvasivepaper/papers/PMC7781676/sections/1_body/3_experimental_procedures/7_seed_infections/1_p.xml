<p>To measure the pathogenicity of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, mature peanut and maize seeds were washed with 0.05% sodium hypochlorite, 75% ethanol and sterile water, and then inoculated by immersion in a 10
 <sup>7</sup> spores suspension for 30 min. The infected seeds were then placed in culture dishes lined with three pieces of moist sterile filter paper to maintain humidity. After 5 days of incubation, the infected seeds were pictured, collected, and mixed with 0.05% Tween 80, followed by vortexing to release the spores. About 100 µl spore suspension was collected, diluted, and counted for further quantification. Aflatoxins were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometer assays according to the protocol described below. Each treatment was performed with three independent biological replicates.
