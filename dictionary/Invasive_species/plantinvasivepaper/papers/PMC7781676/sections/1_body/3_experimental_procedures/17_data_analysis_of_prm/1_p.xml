<p>For the identification of DDA data, raw data files were processed as the protocol described in Protein identification and quantification. For the acquired PRM data, all raw files were imported into the target quantitative software Skyline daily (v.3.5.1.9942). Spectral libraries were built using MS/MS search files from MaxQuant. The precursor of targeted peptide and the 3â€“10 most intense fragment ions were monitored and used for quantification. Peaks were manually checked for correct integration and the area under the curve of targeted peptide was obtained from the summed AUCs of each transition. The abundance of each peptide was normalized against the average of abundance of each protein. For the protein quantification, the mean of targeted peptide abundance was used to calculate fold changes between samples.</p>
