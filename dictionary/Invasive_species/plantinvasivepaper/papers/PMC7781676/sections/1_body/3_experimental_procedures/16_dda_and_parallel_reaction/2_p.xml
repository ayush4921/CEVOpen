<p>For DDA-based experiments, a full MS scan from m/z 350 to 1,800 was acquired at 70,000 resolution. The top 10 most intense precursor ions were selected for following MS/MS fragmentation by HCD with NCE of 28% and analyzed with a resolution of 17,500 in the Orbitrap. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.1 kV and dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s. The maximum injection times for both full MS and MS/MS were 20 ms and 100 ms, respectively. The isolation width of precursor ion was set to 1.6 m/z. AGC for both MS and MS/MS were set at 3E6 and 5E4, respectively.</p>
