<p>3’RACE procedures were performed by using 3’-Full RACE Core Set kit (Code No. 6106, Takara) as the manufacturer’s instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by using 1 μg RNA at the poly(A) tail of the mRNA. Two rounds of nested PCR were performed with the gene-specific forward primers and the RACE adaptor primers. Touch-down PCR protocol was used to confirm the appropriate annealing temperature. Amplicons were detected by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel to determine the length, and then cloned to T-vector and further sequenced to confirm the specificity of amplification. The gene-specific forward primers were: fab1-RACE1: 5’-GTTTTACGCTGAACAGTTCGATGCTTT-3’ and fab1-RACE2: 5’-CAAGAGTCGGTTCAGGGAAGCAATGGC-3’.</p>
