<p>Northern blotting analysis was carried out by using DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The integral RNA was hybridized with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe of the 
 <italic>fab1</italic> gene overnight at 42°C. The double-stranded DNA probes specific for 
 <italic>fab1</italic> was synthesized 
 <italic>via</italic> PCR using primers 5’-TGAACCTTCCTCGTCCTC-3’ and 5’-CCACATTCGCTAGTCACAG-3’. The 
 <italic>actin</italic> gene was used as control and the probe was generated 
 <italic>via</italic> PCR using primers 5’-TGATGAGGCACAGTCCAAGCG-3’ and 5’-CACCGATCCAGACGGAGTATTT-3’. Chemiluminescent signals were detected using a fluorescence scanner (ImageQuant TL, GE Healthcare).
