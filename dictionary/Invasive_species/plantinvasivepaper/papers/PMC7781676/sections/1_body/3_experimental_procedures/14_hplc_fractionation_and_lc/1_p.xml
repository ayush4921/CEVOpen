<p>TMT-labeled peptides were resuspended in 1% (v/v) formic acid and separated into 60 fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC using a 4.6 mm × 25 cm C
 <sub>18</sub> column (5 μm particles, Agilent) with a 60 min gradient of 8–32% acetonitrile (10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 9). Finally, the peptides were combined into nine fractions and dried with a vacuum centrifuge.
