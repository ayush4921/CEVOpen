<p>After dissolution with 0.1% formic acid, the fractioned peptides were directly separated with an online nanoflow EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of an increase from 6% to 22% of solvent B (0.1% formic acid/90% acetonitrile, v/v) over 38 min, 22%-32% in 4 min, 32%-80% in 4 min, and holding at 80% for the last 4 min at 450 nL/min flow rate. A full MS scan from m/z 350 to 1,600 was acquired at 120,000 resolution. The top 20 most intense precursor ions were selected for following MS/MS fragmentation by HCD with NCE of 28% and analyzed with a resolution of 30,000 in the Orbitrap. The dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and maximum injection times for both MS and MS/MS were 50 ms and 60 ms, respectively. The isolation width of precursor ion was set to 1.4 m/z and the intensity threshold was set at 8.3E4. AGC for both MS and MS/MS were 3E6 and 1E5, respectively.</p>
