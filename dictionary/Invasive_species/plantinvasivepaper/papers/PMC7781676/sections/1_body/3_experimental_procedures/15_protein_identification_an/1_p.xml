<p>For the identification, the RAW data were searched against the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> protein database concatenated with the protein sequences of common contaminants using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.3.4). Trypsin was used as a protease with two maximum missed cleavages and fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine. Dynamic modifications were set as deamidation (Asn/Gln) and oxidation (Met). Reporter ion was set as 6plexTMT for quantification. The mass errors for precursor ions and fragment ions were set to 20 ppm and 0.02Â Da, respectively. Peptide for quantification was set as unique and razor. The FDR thresholds for peptide and protein identification were specified at maximum 1% and minimum score for peptides was set &gt;40. Proteins identified based upon the presence of at least two unique peptides were accepted and reported.
