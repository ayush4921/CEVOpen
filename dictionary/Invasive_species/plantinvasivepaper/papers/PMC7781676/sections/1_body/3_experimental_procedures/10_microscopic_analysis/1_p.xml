 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was cultured in YES media at 37°C for 6, 24, 36, 48, or 60 h. After washing three times with PBS to remove the media, hyphal filaments were separated from the mycelia pellet by using forceps, and then stained with neutral red staining solution (C0125, Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) for 5–8 min. In addition, all samples were stained with 50 µm FM4-64 staining solution (N-3-triethy lammoniumpropyl 4-p-diethylamino phenyl-hexa-trienyl pyridinium dibromide) (DE-N4073, BioDee, Beijing, China) for 20–30 min. After washing three times with PBS, the hyphal filaments were placed on a microscope slide, and observed using a Nikon Ti-U microscope. Fluorescent photographs were observed on a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was excited with a 488 nm laser and FM4-64 with a 558 nm laser. Fluorescence emissions were measured at 507 nm and 734 nm for GFP and FM4-64, respectively.
