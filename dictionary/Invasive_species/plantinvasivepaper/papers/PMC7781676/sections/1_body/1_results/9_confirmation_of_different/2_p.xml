<p>To further validate these findings, we subjected 41 of the DEPs to RT-PCR-mediated comparisons of transcript abundance between the WT and âˆ†fab1 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains. We observed expression patterns consistent with our proteomic results for more than half of these genes, whereas discrepancies between the mRNA and protein abundance were observed for the remaining genes (
 <bold>Fig. S9C</bold>). This weak correlation between the mRNA and protein abundance suggests the potential for the proteins posttranscriptional regulation of these genes. Together, these results revealed that Fab1 may influence aflatoxin biosynthesis via maintaining vacuolar/cellular homeostasis by regulating diverse vacuole-related proteins.
