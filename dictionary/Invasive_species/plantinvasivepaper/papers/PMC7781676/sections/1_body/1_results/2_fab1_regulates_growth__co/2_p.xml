<p>We next measured the growth and morphology of WT, ∆fab1 and ∆fab1::fab1 strains of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> grown on yeast extract-sucrose agar (YES) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) agar media. After growth on YES and PDA media for 5 days, the ∆fab1 strain exhibited smaller diameter colonies relative to the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a,b</xref>) 
 <bold>and Fig. S5A, B</bold>), suggesting that 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion reduced the growth rate of this fungus. Consistently, the ∆fab1 strain failed to form conidiophores according to microscopic examination, whereas this effect was restored in the ∆fab1::fab1 strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(c</xref>) 
 <bold>and Fig. S5C</bold>), suggesting that 
 <italic>fab1</italic> is important for conidial formation in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We additionally confirmed this result 
 <italic>via</italic> measuring the expression of two transcription factor-encoding genes important for conidiation (
 <italic>brlA</italic> and 
 <italic>abaA)</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] 
 <italic>via</italic> qPCR during vegetative growth. We found the expression of both of these genes was significantly reduced by &gt;90% in the ∆fab1 strain relative to in the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <bold>Fig. S5D</bold>). These results thus indicated that the conidiation pathway was affected by 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion, leading to downregulation of 
 <italic>brlA</italic> and 
 <italic>abaA</italic> expression.
