<p>Consistent with the functional annotations, the DEPs were mapped to KEGG pathways and we found a subset of DEPs to be involved in development and secondary metabolite production in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(b</xref>)). For example, proteins associated with development, such as conidial hydrophobin RodB/HypB [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase [
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], spore-specific catalase CatA [
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a TCTP family protein [
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], were also differentially expressed in the âˆ†fab1 strain. We further identified 14 proteins involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis, including monooxygenase, polyketide synthase, o-methyltransferase, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde reductase, acetate kinase, lipase/esterase, Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (Ada2) [
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and cysteine-rich secreted protein [
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We also observed significant changes in the levels of two vacuole-associated proteins and four proteins linked with phosphatidylinositol metabolism, further supporting the roles of these proteins in vacuolar homeostasis.
