<p>Vacuoles were previously shown to be essential for fungal growth, differentiation, symbiosis, and pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We observed marked increases in the vacuole size in ∆fab1 fungi, with the vacuoles exhibiting swelling to fill most of the cell volume when the strains were grown under aflatoxin inducing conditions (YES) (
 <bold>Fig. S8</bold>). We next confirmed this vacuolar phenotype 
 <italic>via</italic> staining the cells with neutral red dye when the cells were grown on aflatoxin-inducing medium (YES) during different growth stages. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(b</xref>), we observed the presence of significantly more large vacuoles in the ∆fab1 strain relative to in the WT control during conidial germination and hyphal growth. Surprisingly, the vacuole occupied most of the total volume of the fungal cell in ∆fab1 strain grown on YES medium for 60 h. The substantial vacuolar enlargement observed in the ∆fab1 strain had the potential to drive substantial cellular swelling. Our results suggested that the formation of large vacuoles was linked to 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion, and the swelling was presumably associated with the well-documented role of proteins in this family as regulators of vacuolar/cellular homeostasis and turnover of the vacuolar membrane [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We speculated that Fab1 is vital for normal vacuole function and morphology in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>.
