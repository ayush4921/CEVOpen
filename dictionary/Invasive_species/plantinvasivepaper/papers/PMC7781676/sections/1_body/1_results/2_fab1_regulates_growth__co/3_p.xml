<p>As sclerotia are important means of resisting stress conditions, we assessed sclerotial formation when the strains were grown on sclerotia-inducing YPD medium at 37°C for 9 days. Unlike in the WT strain, sclerotia in the ∆fab1 strain were completely absent; this phenotype was reversed in the ∆fab1::fab1 strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(d</xref>) 
 <bold>and Fig. S5E</bold>), suggesting that a loss of 
 <italic>fab1</italic> led to impairing sclerotial formation. We additionally assayed the expression of the sclerotia-associated 
 <italic>nsdC, nsdD</italic> and 
 <italic>nsdR</italic> and found that both 
 <italic>nsdC</italic> and 
 <italic>nsdR</italic> were twofold downregulated in the ∆fab1 strain, while 
 <italic>nsdD</italic> was downregulated by 10-fold relative to in the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <bold>Fig. S5F</bold>). These results thus together clearly indicated that Fab1 is essential for 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth, conidial formation, and sclerotial production.
