<p>Through NCBI BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searching, we identified an 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> protein with significant similarity to yeast (
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> kinase (Fab1 protein) (
 <bold>Fig. S1</bold>). The coordinates of the putative 
 <italic>fab1</italic> were 4,215,543â€“4,220,895 from NW_002477237.1 fragment in the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome, with no annotation information (
 <bold>Fig. S2</bold>). To further confirm the existence of the putative 
 <italic>fab1</italic>, we performed transcriptional expression analysis by using previously published RNA-Seq data. As shown in 
 <bold>Figure S2</bold>, the additional transcriptomic data also supported the presence of this novel gene in the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> genome. Notably, a highly similar homolog of this protein was discovered in 
 <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and designated as a putative phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (
 <bold>Fig. S3A</bold>). Moreover, analysis of the protein structural domain revealed that this family of proteins contains a number of highly conserved domains, including a zinc finger structure (FYVE), as well as Cpn60_TCP1 and phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase domains (PIPKc) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a</xref>)), which correspond to phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases in most eukaryotic cells [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These analyses thus suggested that this novel protein may function as a phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (named as Fab1) involved in phosphatidylinositol metabolism. We hypothesized that Fab1 in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> may catalyze the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, which are essential lipid molecules in a range of cellular processes [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that this protein was highly conserved among different species, including 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, 
 <italic>Elaphomyces granulatus, Penicillium arizonense, Penicillium coprophilum, Penicillium polonicum, Penicillium vulpinum</italic> and 
 <italic>Talaromyces atroroseus</italic> (
 <bold>Fig. S3B</bold>). To further validate the novel protein, we assessed 
 <italic>fab1</italic> expression at the transcript level and our result revealed significant up-regulation under three distinct growth conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(b</xref>)).
