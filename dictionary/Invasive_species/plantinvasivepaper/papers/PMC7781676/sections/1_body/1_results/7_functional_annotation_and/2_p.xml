<p>Using the MultiLoc tool to assess protein subcellular localization, we found that most of the DEPs were located in the cytosol (Up: 64, Down: 63), followed by the extracellular (Up: 30, Down: 12) and mitochondria (Up: 17, Down: 8) compartments. Interestingly, many of these DEPs were located in the peroxisomes (Up: 14, Down: 12), vacuole (Up: 17, Down: 5), endoplasmic reticulum (Up: 6, Down: 4), and Golgi (Up: 3, Down: 0) (
 <bold>Fig. S9A and Table S5</bold>). A previous study showed that Fab1 is linked not only to vacuoles, but also to the pre-vacuolar compartment, which is important for protein trafficking from the Golgi and the plasma membrane to the vacuole in eukaryotic cells [

 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, in line with a previous fungal study [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, as unexpected, proteins involved in such trafficking activity were found to be significantly regulated by vacuolar dysregulation upon
