<p>A variety of methodologies now support relative quantification measurements in proteomics, and one of the most commonly used strategies through MS is stable isotope labeling of peptides using isobaric reagents, such as tandem mass tag (TMT). To this end, we next examined the molecular basis of Fab1 function by TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis to identify proteins regulated by Fab1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(a</xref>)). Finally, a total of 4,928 proteins were identified by proteomic analysis. Among them, 4,292 proteins were identified based upon the presence of at least two unique peptides and 3,821 proteins (&gt;89%) were quantifiable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(b</xref>) 
 <bold>and Table S1</bold>). The large number of identified proteins reproducibly quantified in all samples led to very strong correlations for these fungal strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(c</xref>)). We constructed a heatmap showing the relative levels of quantifiable proteins in the WT and ∆fab1 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains, with 289 proteins exhibiting a &gt; 1.2-fold change between samples (∆fab1/WT) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(d</xref>) 
 <bold>and Table S2</bold>). Of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 163 were up-regulated and 126 were down-regulated.
