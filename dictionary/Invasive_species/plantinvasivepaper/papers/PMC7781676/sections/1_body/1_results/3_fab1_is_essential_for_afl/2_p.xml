<p>As aflatoxin contamination of food sources is a significant source of concern, we next explored the impact of 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion on the pathogenicity of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. We observed difference growth dynamics for these strains when they were used to inoculate peanut seeds; the growth, sporulation, and invasion of the ∆fab1 strain were markedly less effective than in the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(a</xref>)). Consistent with our previous results, the ∆fab1 strain tended to produce fewer conidia than the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(b</xref>)). Previous studies showed that aflatoxin is important for seed infection [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref>]. We subsequently assessed aflatoxin production in these samples, revealing that the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains, but not the ∆fab1 strain produced aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(c</xref>)). Further MS analyses confirmed that the ∆fab1 strain failed to produce detectable aflatoxins, whereas normal aflatoxin production was evident for the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(d</xref>)). We similarly analyzed the invasive growth of these 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains on maize seeds, revealing that aflatoxin production and conidial formation were significantly reduced for the ∆fab1 strain relative to the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(e–h)</xref>). Together, these findings indicated that 
 <italic>fab1</italic> in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> may play a regulatory role in seed infection.
