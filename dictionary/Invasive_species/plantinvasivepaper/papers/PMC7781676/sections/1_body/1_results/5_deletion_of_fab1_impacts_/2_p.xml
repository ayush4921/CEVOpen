<p>In addition, cellular metal ions (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup>) in the WT, ∆fab1 and ∆fab1::fab1 strains were assessed by using specific fluorescent indicator dyes, including Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-specific fluorescent probe Fura-2-AM (Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester), Na
 <sup>+</sup>-specific fluorescent probe SBFI-AM (sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester) and K
 <sup>+</sup>-specific fluorescent probe PBFI-AM (potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester), according to previously described methods [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36–39</xref>]. Upon binding metal ions, these specific fluorescence dyes can exhibit a fluorescence absorption shift from 380 to 340 nm of excitation. As a result, the relative Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> concentrations were evaluated and quantified as the ratio of fluorescence intensities assessed at the excitation wavelengths of 340/380 nm. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6(d</xref>–f), we observed obvious differences of intracellular metal ions concentrations in the WT, ∆fab1 and ∆fab1::fab1 strains. The ∆fab1 strain showed significantly decreased relative levels of intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> concentrations compared to the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (

 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion resulted in severe defect in vacuolar and cellular acidification, as well as cellular metal ion homeostasis.
