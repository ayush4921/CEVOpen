<p>In yeast, Fab1 is associated with the vacuolar and pre-vacuolar compartments [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In order to assess Fab1 subcellular localization in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, we first produced a Fab1-GFP fusion protein that was validated by PCR (
 <bold>Fig. S7A</bold>) and western-blotting analysis with an anti-GFP antibody (
 <bold>Fig. S7B</bold>). Subsequently, the WT strain expressing the Fab1-GFP fusion protein was stained with the membrane-specific dye FM4-64. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(a</xref>), strong fluorescence was detected in the fungal cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) analysis during conidial germination and hyphal growth. Notably, the green fluorescence signals (indicated by GFP) were clearly observed on the vacuolar membrane of the wild-type strain, whereas hyphal cells also showed obvious red signals (fluorescence of FM4-64) on the vacuolar membrane when the strains were stained with the membrane-specific dye. As a result, these results indicated that Fab1 protein is localized to the vacuolar membrane (
