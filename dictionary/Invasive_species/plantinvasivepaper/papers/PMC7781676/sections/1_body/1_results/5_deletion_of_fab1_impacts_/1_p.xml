<p>Previous studies have proven that fungal vacuoles are acidic organelles, involved in many aspects of cellular processes, including cellular homeostasis, membrane trafficking, signaling, and nutrition, as well as stress responses [

 <italic>fab1</italic> would affect the cellular acidification, we measured the vacuolar and cytosolic pH in the WT, ∆fab1 and ∆fab1::fab1 strains. These strains were stained with a specific fluorescent dye (BCECF, 2,7-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester) to compare the changes of pH in different strains, and the vacuolar pH was quantified from the collected hyphal cells as previous reports [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As expected, the vacuolar pH in the stained ∆fab1 strain was quantified as 5.76, which was significantly more acidic than that of the WT (pH 6.13) and ∆fab1::fab1 (pH 6.13) strains (
