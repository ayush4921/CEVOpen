<p>Accumulating evidence has revealed that phosphatidylinositol lipids play important roles in various cellular processes [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among them, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub>), which predominantly locates in the endosome and vacuole, has been implicated in membrane homeostasis in various types of eukaryotic cells [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> is generated from phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI-3-P) by the phosphoinositide phosphate kinase Fab1. Previous effects have stated that Fab1 kinase is highly conserved in many fungi and may play an important regulatory role in maintaining the normal vacuole function and morphology by regulating the PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> levels in phosphatidylinositol metabolism [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The ability of Fab1 to regulate vacuole size, protein sorting, osmotic balance and the trafficking of some substrates in yeast has been well established [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Notably, defects in the dynamic regulation of PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> are linked to human diseases [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the human pathogenic fungus 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> levels regulated by Fab1 are closely related to membrane trafficking and vacuole homeostasis, and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Fab1 plays important roles in the intracellular survival and virulence of this fungus [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite the studies of Fab1 having had some success, the molecular details of how this enzyme regulates vacuolar functions and aflatoxin synthesis in 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> are still lacking.
