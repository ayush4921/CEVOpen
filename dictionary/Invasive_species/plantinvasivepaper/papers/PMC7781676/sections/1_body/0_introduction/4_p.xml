<p>To fill this gap, we have made an attempt to unravel the functional role of the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> putative orthologue of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> kinase Fab1 in a variety of cellular processes. Our functional studies revealed that deletion of Fab1 influences the growth, development, aflatoxin production, pathogenicity, and vacuole/vesicle function of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Further quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that Fab1 may maintain vacuolar/cellular homeostasis to facilitate aflatoxin synthesis in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanisms of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> pathogenicity and aflatoxin biosynthesis.
