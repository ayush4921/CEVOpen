<p>Based on our findings and past reports, we were able to construct a hypothetical model in which Fab1 regulates aflatoxin synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9</xref>). Peroxisomes and mitochondria can serve as a source of the large amounts of acetyl-CoA necessary for aflatoxin synthesis, flowing from peroxisomes into vacuoles [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Early aflatoxin synthesis may also occur in peroxisomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9</xref>). Consequently, acetyl-CoA synthesis and flux may be regulated by enzymes within these organelles, influencing early aflatoxin biosynthesis. The most important enzymes for the mid- and late stages of aflatoxin biosynthesis are also known to transit to the vacuoles from the nucleus, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum via autophagic and cytoplasm-to-vacuole-targeting (Cvt) pathways [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The DEPs in these organelles may also impact gene expression and transport mechanisms, thereby altering aflatoxin synthesis. Notably, enzymes linked with secondary metabolite production are often localized to vesicles and vacuoles, and the same is true for those associated with fungal aflatoxin production [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>, the vacuole localized protein 4 (VLP4) are required for the autophagy, development, and virulence, suggesting the potential role of vacuolar protein in fungal virulence [
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In this study, altered expression of the vacuole/vesicle-associated proteins and of other transport-associated proteins thus can impact aflatoxin biosynthesis, transport, and excretion. Together, we conclude that 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion may alter PtdIns-3,5-P
 <sub>2</sub> levels, further disrupting vacuolar homeostasis and impacting the whole metabolic network in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>.
