<p>In summary, a novel phosphoinositide kinase (Fab1) was identified in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. In order to further explore its biological roles, we revealed it to have previously undocumented roles in the regulation of pathogenicity and aflatoxin production. Our results can serve as a valuable resource for future efforts to explore the synthesis, storage, transport, and excretion of secondary metabolites including aflatoxins.
