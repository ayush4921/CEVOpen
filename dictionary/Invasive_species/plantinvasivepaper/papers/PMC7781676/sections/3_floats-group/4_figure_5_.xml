  <p>Localization of Fab1 in 
   <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains. (a) Microscopic images of the WT strains expressing Fab1-GFP fusion protein. The strains were cultured in YES medium for 6, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h. The vacuolar membranes were stained with fluorochrome FM4-64. The bright, expressed, stained and merged images were shown. Scale bars represented 15 µm. (b) Bright-field microscopy of WT and ∆fab1 strains stained with neutral red commonly used for staining of the vacuole 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. The WT and ∆fab1 strains were cultured in YES medium for 6, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h. Scale bars represented 15 µm
