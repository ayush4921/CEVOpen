 <p>We developed a novel three‚Äêpart approach using molecular dietary analysis and microbial forensics to reveal species interactions and scavenging by invasive rats on native and introduced birds in Hawaii. Our forensic genomic tool for use in ecological contexts is valuable for (a) detecting diet items in stomach and fecal samples, and (b) determining decomposition status of prey. Our method properly calibrated and replicated has great potential to detect and quantify species interactions that are remote, rare, and challenging to measure.
