<p>We compared the sequences of our bacterial biomarker to the sequences of bacteria detected in rat fecal and stomach microbiomes to identify which bacteria were both biomarkers and also present in the GI tract of rats. We used a custom blast analysis in Geneious 8.1 to query our biomarker sequences against the microbiome sequences (Muletz‐Wolz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We used a megablast program, having Geneious return results as query‐centered alignment data only and returning only the top hit. We considered a rat GI microbiome ASV as a match to a biomarker ASV if they matched at ≥97% sequence similarity. We caution that this does not necessarily mean these bacteria are the same species or strains, only that they are strong candidates particularly at ≥99% sequence similarity (which a majority of our biomarkers are—see in results Table
