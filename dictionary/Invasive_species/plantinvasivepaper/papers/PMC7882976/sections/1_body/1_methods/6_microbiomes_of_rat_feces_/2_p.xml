<p>We conducted Illumina high‐throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize bacterial communities in rat feces and rat stomachs. We amplified DNA using the same primers as used for the chicken samples (515F, 939R). We used a two‐step library preparation to generate 16S rRNA amplicons for sequencing. First, we performed duplicate PCR reactions for each sample, and included negative extraction controls and negative PCR controls. Each 25‐μl amplicon PCR reaction consisted of 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher), 1.5 μM MgCl, 200 nM dNTPs, 500 nM reverse primer with overhang adapter, 500 nM forward primer with overhang adapter, 20 ng/μl BSA and 3 μl DNA template. PCR conditions were 95°C for 7 m, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s and a final extension (72°C for 7 m). Then, we performed index PCR, adding custom i5 and i7 adaptors to the PCR amplicons to uniquely identify each sample. Each 50‐μl index PCR reaction consisted of 25 μl of 2× Phusion Hot Start II HF Master Mix, 1 mM i5 primer, 1 mM i7 primer, and 5 μl amplicon PCR DNA template. PCR conditions were 98°C for 2 m, followed by eight cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 62°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s and a final extension (72°C for 2 m). Between each PCR reaction, PCR products were cleaned with Speed‐beads (Rohland &amp; Reich,

We conducted size selection for the target band using E‐Gel EX 2% agarose (Invitrogen) and Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction kit. We conducted Illumina MiSeq high‐throughput sequencing on one sequencing run (v3 chemistry: 2 × 300 bp kit) to characterize the bacterial communities of each sample.
