<p>We conducted a chicken (
 <italic>Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>) tissue decomposition study and collected black rat (
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>) fecal and stomach samples from rat traps in forest fragments, locally known as “kīpuka”. Hundreds of kīpuka were created by historical lava flows in 1855 and 1881 (Vaughn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The kīpuka we sampled are located on the NE slope of Mauna Loa Volcano in the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve on the Island of Hawaii (19°40′N 155°20′W, 1,470–1,790 m elevation). These well‐replicated fragments vary in size, yet they share the same soils, origin, and a single dominant forest canopy species, ‘ōhi‘a lehua (
 <italic>Metrosideros polymorpha</italic>). Both native and non‐native animals inhabit these forests (Gruner, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), including birds endemic and introduced (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) to Hawaii (Flaspohler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Hawaii has only one native terrestrial mammal 
 <italic>Aeorestes semotus</italic> (Hawaiian hoary bat). All other terrestrial mammals present in the study system are non‐native, including 
 <italic>Rattus exulans</italic> (Polynesian rat), 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (Norway rat), 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (house mouse), 
 <italic>Herpestes javanicus</italic> (Asian mongoose) and the most commonly encountered, 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> (black rat). Of these carnivorous and omnivorous species, only 
 <italic>R. rattus</italic> demonstrably climbs trees and forages in forest canopies with regularity (Shiels et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Vanderwerf, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Wilson Rankin et al.,
