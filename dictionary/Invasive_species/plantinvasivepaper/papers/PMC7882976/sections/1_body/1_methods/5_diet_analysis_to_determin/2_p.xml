<p>We extracted DNA from rat fecal and stomach samples using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA stool mini kit with modifications from manufacturer's protocol following previously published methods (Eggert et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) to increase DNA yields from fecal samples. We included a negative extraction control with each set of extractions. We used two independent bird‐specific primer pairs targeting conserved regions of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and Cytochrome b (Cytb) genes to determine if rats had consumed bird.
