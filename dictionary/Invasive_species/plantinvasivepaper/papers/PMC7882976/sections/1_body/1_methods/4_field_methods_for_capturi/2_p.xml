<p>As part of a larger study on the interactive effects of predation and ecosystem size on kīpuka food webs (spanning 34 kīpuka within a ~35 km
 <sup>2</sup> range), rats were removed from 16 kīpuka, while 18 other kīpuka served as control plots (Knowlton et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In rat removal kīpuka, Victor M326 Pro Rat snap traps were set out and baited with peanut butter or coconut to quickly and ethically kill rodents upon entry (Stanford IACUC, no. 1776). Freshly killed rats (

All equipment was disinfected with 10% bleach between dissections. In control kīpuka, two feeding stations (Black Trakka™, Gotcha Traps Limited) per hectare were set out and baited with peanut butter. Pilot studies conducted in 2012 demonstrated that each trap night yields 4–15 fecal pellets. One fecal pellet was preserved in 100% ethanol and frozen until processing (
