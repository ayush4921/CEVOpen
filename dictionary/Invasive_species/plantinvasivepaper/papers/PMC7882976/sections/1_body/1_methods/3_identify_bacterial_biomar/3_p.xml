<p>We conducted 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize bacterial communities of the decomposing chicken tissue samples. We cut the tissue sample into 5 mm × 5 mm sections using scissors and tweezers sterilized with bleach and ethanol between each sample. We extracted DNA from 70 chicken tissue samples using the BioSprint 96 DNA kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol for tissue extractions with an overnight incubation in lysis buffer and included negative extraction controls. We followed previously published methods (Muletz Wolz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) to amplify the V3‐V5 16S rRNA gene region with the universal gene primer set 515F and 939R and to conduct library preparation. Each 25‐μl PCR reaction consisted of 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher), 2.5 μM MgCl, 200 nM dNTPs, 200 nM reverse fusion primer, 400 nM forward barcoded fusion primer and 3 μl DNA template. PCR conditions were 95°C for 7 m, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s and a final extension (72°C for 7 m). We used Speed‐beads (in a PEG/NaCl buffer; Rohland &amp; Reich, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) to clean post‐PCR products, and pooled samples equimolar based on Qubit (Invitrogen) DNA concentration values. We conducted high‐throughput sequencing of samples using one Roche 454 GS Junior run and one GS FLX + run. Negative extraction controls and negative PCR controls were run with each 454 sequencing run to monitor for and then remove from analyses potential contaminant bacteria introduced in the laboratory.
