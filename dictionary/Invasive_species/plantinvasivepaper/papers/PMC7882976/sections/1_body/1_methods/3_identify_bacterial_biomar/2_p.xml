<p>To quantify microbial decay of bird tissue, we sampled decomposing chicken tissue at day 0 in the lab, and days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11 in the field at 10 locations (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). First, we obtained a whole chicken carcass labeled antibiotic free from a grocery store (KTA Super Stores, Hilo HI). We split the chicken breast tissue into 70 equivalent samples weighing approximately 6 g on a sterile work surface in the laboratory and surface sterilized the chicken samples with 10% bleach. We created 10 sets of seven tissues samples and randomly assigned each set of samples to one of ten locations. Prior to leaving the lab, we immediately collected one sample from each assigned location and those served as the lab control samples (Day 0 lab; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). In the field, in two separate kīpuka, we placed the remaining six samples at each of ten specified forested locations. These kīpuka were a subset of the larger study on the interactive effects of predation and ecosystem size on kīpuka food webs (spanning 34 kīpuka within a ~35 km
 <sup>2</sup> range; Knowlton et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The two kīpuka for this chicken decomposition study were chosen as easily accessible, of intermediate size (3.19 and 2.77 ha for K18 and K19 respectively) and had rats present (rat removal controls in larger study). We chose to do the decomposition in the field to determine bacteria as biomarkers for decomposition in the same habitat as where the rats and birds occur. We placed each chicken tissue sample on a sterile piece of tin foil in a cleaned, closed rat trap (Havahart
 <sup>®</sup>) secured to the ground using clean, new tent stakes. Samples were placed in traps to avoid loss of experimental units during the decomposition experiment by rats. No ground scavenging insects were observed at the field sites, nor any evidence of such scavenging of tissue pieces. Immediately after placing the samples in the trap, we collected one sample from each location and those served as the field control samples (Day 0 field; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). The remaining samples were collected during subsequent visits at Days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11. We wore a fresh pair of sterile nylon gloves to collect each sample and placed it into 2 ml tubes in Queens College Buffer (20% DMSO, 0.25 M EDTA, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, saturated with NaCl; Amos et al.,
