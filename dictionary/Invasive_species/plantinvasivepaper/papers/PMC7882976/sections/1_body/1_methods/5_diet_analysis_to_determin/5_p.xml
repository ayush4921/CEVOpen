<p>We verified that the nine bird species found in the study sites (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) had sequences in GenBank for either the COI gene, the Cytb gene, or both by custom searches. Two bird species (
 <italic>C. sandwichensis</italic>, 
 <italic>L. leucomelanos</italic>) did not have reference sequences available for COI, but the 
 <italic>Lophura</italic> genus had reference sequences. All bird species had reference sequences for the Cytb gene. In the ‘consumed bird’ samples, we did not find evidence of multiple sequencing (i.e., superposition of several sequences from different species in the same sample).
