<p>Samples were assigned a category of ‘consumed bird’, ‘not consumed bird’, or ‘ambiguous’ based on PCR results and Sanger sequencing. Every sample was tested at least twice, once with the COI primer set and once with the Cytb primer set. We considered samples as ‘consumed bird’ if at least one of the bird primer sets produced a high‐quality sequence (&gt;50% quality) from Sanger sequencing, and that sequence matched a bird species in GenBank that we would expect to detect in our study site (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). We blasted individual sequences in NCBI using BLASTN 2.9.0+. When all top matches (e‐value &lt; e−50) matched a bird species in our study sites (native or introduced) with high query coverage (&gt;95%) we recorded that bird species as the bird species consumed by the rat. We considered a sample as ‘not consumed bird’ if both bird primer sets did not amplify DNA in either of the COI and Cytb PCR reactions. We replicated the PCRs for the ‘not consumed bird’ for each primer set a second time to reduce the probability of false negatives. The negative samples were all tested a total of four times (two replicates per primer pair). We considered a sample as ‘ambiguous’ if at least one bird primer set produced a PCR band of appropriate target bp size, but we were unable to get a high‐quality sequence matching a bird sequence from Sanger sequencing after replicate sequencing attempts. Ambiguous samples were either (a) repeatedly low‐quality sequences, (b) of mixed sequences, or (c) the sequence was of high quality, but matched a non‐bird taxon (often earthworms and moths). Ambiguous samples were excluded when identifying informative biomarkers in the rat GI microbiome (see 
 <italic>biomarker and microbiome matching</italic> subsection below).
