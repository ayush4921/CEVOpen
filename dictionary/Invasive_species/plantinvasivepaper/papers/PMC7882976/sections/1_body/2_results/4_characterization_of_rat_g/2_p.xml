<p>We generated 1,230,163 high‐quality sequences from 51 rat samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 28 fecal samples, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 23 stomach samples). Average sequencing depth per biological sample was 24,121 sequences (min = 4,762, max = 74,921). We identified 987 ASVs present in the rat GI tract belonging to 11 bacterial phyla (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37171-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The majority of ASVs belonged to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Stomach and fecal samples cumulatively had 987 bacterial ASVs, with 407 ASVs detected in both sample types. The shared ASVs made up 84.5% of the sequences from stomach samples and 67.7% of sequences from fecal samples, indicating that many ASVs were shared between sample types.
