<p>As part of an exploratory analysis, we used the informative bacterial ASVs for decayed tissue consumption to suggest the bird consumption status for some of the ‘ambiguous’ rat samples from diet analysis. We had 20 rat samples (12 fecal and eight stomach samples) that we originally assigned as ambiguous for bird consumption through diet analysis. We suggest that five of those 20 rats (three fecal and two stomach samples) may have consumed birds as carrion; those rat samples contained at least two of the 15 informative bacterial ASVs for decayed bird tissue in their microbiome.</p>
