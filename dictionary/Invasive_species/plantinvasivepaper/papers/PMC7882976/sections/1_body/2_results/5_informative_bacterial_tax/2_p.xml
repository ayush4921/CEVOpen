<p>We determined if the bacterial biomarkers that we identified from decaying chicken tissue (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37171-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were able to predict bird consumption and decay status. We detected several decayed tissue bacterial biomarkers in rat GI samples that had consumed bird, but did not detect any fresh tissue bacterial biomarkers. We detected 40 bacterial ASVs in the fecal and stomach microbiomes of rats that matched 22 decayed tissue bacterial biomarkers (matched ≥97% sequence similarity). We then eliminated the bacterial ASVs that were present in rat microbiome samples of rats that did not consume birds. In other words, we eliminated any bacterial biomarker that may have been resident microbial taxa in GI tract of rats. After this filtering step, we had 15 informative bacterial ASVs, which matched seven decayed tissue biomarkers and were found only in rats that had consumed bird (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of the 20 rats we confirmed consumed birds through diet analysis, we identified nine rats that potentially consumed birds as carrion (3/7 fecal samples; 6/13 stomach samples) with our 15 informative bacterial ASVs (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Combining diet and biomarker analysis, we found that rats consumed four different bird species, including one native and three introduced birds, and likely consumed three of those bird species through scavenging (Table
