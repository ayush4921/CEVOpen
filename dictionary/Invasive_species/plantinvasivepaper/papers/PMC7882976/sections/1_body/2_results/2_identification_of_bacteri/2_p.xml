<p>We generated 215,369 high‐quality sequences from 66 chicken tissue samples. Average sequencing depth per biological sample was 3,193 sequences (min = 5, max = 12,338). Many of the early sampling days (Day 0 lab, Day 0 field, Day 1) had low sequence coverage likely due to few microbes colonizing the freshly bleached tissue. We identified 79 ASVs present on chicken tissue belonging to three bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes), with 99% of sequences belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum. The majority of bacterial biomarker ASVs belonged to the genus 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> within the phylum Proteobacteria (Figure
