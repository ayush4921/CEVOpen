<p>We found that the rat samples we collected included rats that had consumed birds recently and rats that had not consumed bird recently (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37171-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We identified 20 rat samples that contained bird DNA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 feces, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 stomachs). We identified 11 rat samples that contained no bird DNA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9 feces, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 stomachs). We had 20 samples that we could not unambiguously confirm the presence or absence of bird DNA; we considered these samples as ambiguous, and excluded these samples from when we were identifying the putative biomarkers. All sequences and their associated data are provided at
