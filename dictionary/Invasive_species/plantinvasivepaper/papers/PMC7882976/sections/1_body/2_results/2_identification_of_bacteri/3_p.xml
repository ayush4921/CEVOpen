<p>We found similar microbiome composition on decomposing chicken tissue among the ten replicate sites (Jaccard PERMANOVA: 
 <italic>p</italic> = .291; Bray–Curtis: 
 <italic>p</italic> = .37), but differences across sampling days (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37171-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Site replicates were pooled together to identify fresh tissue biomarkers (present in only Day 0 lab, Day 0 field, and/or Day 1) and decayed tissue biomarkers (present only in Days 2, 4, 7, and/or 11). We identified 44 ASVs of the 70 chicken‐tissue‐associated ASVs as biomarkers. Two ASVs we identified as fresh tissue bacterial biomarkers, and 42 ASVs we identified as decayed tissue bacterial biomarkers (Figure
