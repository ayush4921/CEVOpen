<p>Molecular diet analysis of fecal material is gaining traction among molecular ecologists as a noninvasive method to study diet and trophic interactions, particularly for invasive species (Egeter et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). However, molecular techniques in diet analysis are not without issue, and some ambiguity can exist such as repeatability in food item detection (Forin‐Wiart et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Integrating diet analysis with forensic microbiology can provide a suite of tools to better inform conclusions on food webs, including resolving ambiguities in diet analysis and elucidating whether diet items were likely consumed through predation versus scavenging.
