<p>We found that 39% of the rats we sampled (20/51) unambiguously consumed birds, and nearly half of those—18% in total (9/51)—may have consumed birds as carrion by the presence of bacterial biomarkers in their GI microbiome. It is possible that the other 11 rats that we confirmed consumed bird may have consumed the birds as prey given the absence of decayed tissue biomarkers. We found that four of the nine birds repeatedly detected in our study area were detected in the diet of rats, which included one native bird species (
 <italic>M. obscurus</italic>) and three introduced bird species (
 <italic>L. leucomelanos</italic>, 
 <italic>M. gallopavo</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. japonicus</italic>). Two of the native bird species did not have reference sequences for our COI primer set, which may have reduced our likelihood to detect them; however, we did not detect these as diet items with the Cytb primer set for which there were reference sequences in GenBank. The Kalij pheasant (
 <italic>L. nycthemera</italic>) was the only species lacking biomarkers attributable to scavenging, while the other three species had individuals that may have been consumed through scavenging.
