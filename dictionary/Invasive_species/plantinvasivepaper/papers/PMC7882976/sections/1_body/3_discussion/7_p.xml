<p>In this study, we determined that invasive rats in Hawaii consumed tissues of both native and introduced birds as diet items. One of the birds identified was the Japanese white‐eye (
 <italic>Z. japonicus</italic>), an invasive bird that since its introduction in 1929 has proliferated to become the most abundant bird species on the islands (Berger,

 <italic>Z. japonicus</italic> carcasses in decomposition and/or feeding trials as they are invasive, abundant, and a known rat diet item. It would be pertinent to compare future studies using wild birds with the bacterial biomarkers identified in our chicken decomposition study to verify how the impact of whole unaltered carcasses impact biomarker discovery.
