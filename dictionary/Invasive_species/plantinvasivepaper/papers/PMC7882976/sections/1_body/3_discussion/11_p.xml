<p>Genomic forensics have many applications to wildlife conservation settings and to food web ecology. Rats (

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Knowing the magnitude of predation by invasive rats can inform management practices. Yet, monitoring large numbers of bird nests in the forest canopy to determine if rats caused significant nest failure through predation can be time‐ and cost‐prohibitive. For instance, extensive previous monitoring of bird nests identified a general cause of nest failure (i.e., “presumed predation”) in only ~15% of cases (Knowlton, unpublished data). Similarly, observing foraging behavior to assess rat diets becomes impractical with increasing canopy or cliff height, and a massive effort is required to obtain the statistical power to detect subtle population and community impacts. Repeated temporal snapshots are needed to observe dietary changes that might result from behavioral shifts in foraging, but invasive techniques such as stomach sampling remove animals from the population and is impractical at a large scale. Our paired diet and microbial forensics approach using noninvasive fecal samples could be implemented as a means to screen larger geographic regions for rat predation versus scavenging; certain areas could then be identified for validation with direct observation. Direct observations would be informative to validate bacterial biomarkers that could conclusively differentiate predation and immediate consumption from predation and consumption over several days and from scavenging.
