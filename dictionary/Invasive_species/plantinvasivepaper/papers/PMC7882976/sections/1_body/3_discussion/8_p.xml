<p>The bacterial biomarkers we identified have the potential to be used to determine if rats had consumed birds or not, in cases where the results from diet analysis are ambiguous. However, with our currently limited knowledge on the specificity of bacterial biomarkers of decay to particular diet items, we provide an exploratory analysis with potential for use in future work. We had a relatively high number of ambiguous samples, and this number may have been reduced with more replication of PCR and sequencing (e.g., six PCR replicates per primer pair such as in Zarzoso‐Lacoste et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Nonetheless, we were able to robustly identify 20 rats as ‘consumed bird’ and 11 rats as ‘not consumed birds’ for analyses and identification of biomarkers, which was one of our primary goals of the research.
