<p>The rats that we identified as likely consuming birds through scavenging contained at least one of 15 informative bacterial ASVs of carrion consumption in their GI microbiome. We caution that these biomarkers may be generally indicative of other vertebrate carrion consumption. In our study system, there are few other vertebrate diet items, but we cannot rule out the possibility that those were also consumed as carrion. In future work, if diet samples are analyzed more broadly, for example using a metabarcoding approach (Forin‐Wiart et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and only bird species are identified, then identified bacterial biomarkers in the feces or guts most likely originated from the bird in the diet and not some other vertebrate. Additionally, future work should determine if bacterial biomarkers can be considered specific to a particular diet group (e.g., birds or mammals or reptiles) by conducting feeding trials (Zarzoso‐Lacoste et al.,
