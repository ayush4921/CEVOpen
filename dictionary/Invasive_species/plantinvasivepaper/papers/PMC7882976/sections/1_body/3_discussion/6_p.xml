<p>We identified bacterial biomarkers of decayed tissue (i.e., carrion) consumption that we considered indicative of scavenging, but were unable to identify bacterial biomarkers of fresh tissue that could have been indicative of predation. In our system, it is most likely that predation with immediate consumption and scavenging are the primary feeding strategies as rats are the primary consumers of bird nestlings and fledglings in the kīpuka. However, in other systems where rats may consume large prey items over a series of days, it would be important to differentiate predation and consumption over several days from scavenging. We suggest that for future studies to conclusively differentiate (a) predation and immediate consumption, (b) predation and consumption over several days, and (c) scavenging, it will require direct observation or manipulation to identify and validate biomarkers for each category. In our study, we did find two bacterial ASVs in the decaying chicken tissue study indicative of fresh tissue (and potentially predation), but we did not detect those bacterial ASVs in rat GI microbiomes. The chicken tissue was sterilized with bleach prior to placing it in the field in order to remove any bacteria that accrued on the surface of the meat during its processing for sale. This may have impacted our ability to identify biomarkers of fresh bird tissue, and few bacterial taxa were present at early sampling time points. Likewise, the microbiome of commercially produced chicken is unlikely to resemble that of wild forest birds at initial time points, but during decomposition we expected that the decaying chicken microbiome would be representative of a general bird decomposition microbiome (Belk et al.,
