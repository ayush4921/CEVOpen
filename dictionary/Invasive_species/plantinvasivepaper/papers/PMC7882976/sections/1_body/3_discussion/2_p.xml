<p>Scavenging is widespread and significant in most food webs, but is often significantly underestimated, producing inflated predation rates and underestimated indirect effects (Wilson &amp; Wolkovich, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). We used a multi‐pronged approach of new molecular and classic ecological methods to document bird scavenging by invasive rats in Hawaii. We showed that bacterial biomarkers, linked to the successional stage of bird carcass decay, likely persist through digestion as biomarkers of carrion consumption in both rat stomachs and fecal material. Our forensic microbiology tool provides vital information to identify species in networks, detect cryptic linkages that occur beyond our observation (e.g., at night, in the forest canopy, in burrows or crevices) and can be used to help build weighted network models with predictions for food web stability (Deng et al.,
