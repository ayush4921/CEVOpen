<p>Microbial composition in the environment and on animals can often differ across the landscape (Bisson et al.,

Across the kīpuka we sampled, we found that eight of the 15 informative bacterial biomarkers occurred in rats sampled in multiple kīpuka indicating reproducibility of bacterial signatures of decay within our study area. From studies of human and mouse carcass decomposition, evidence suggests that microbial signatures of decay are often predictable on a larger scale across soil types, seasons and host species (Belk et al.,
