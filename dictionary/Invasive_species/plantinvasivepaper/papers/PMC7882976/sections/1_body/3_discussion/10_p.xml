<p>In order to validate that rat fecal samples would provide similar biological conclusions as stomach samples, we utilized rat stomach and fecal samples from 18 different kīpuka that were collected as part of a larger study in which rat removals were performed and individuals were ethically euthanized (stomachs) or traps were placed in control non‐rat removal plots (feces). We found that while rat stomachs and rat feces differed in their microbiome structure with reproducibility in those differences across kīpuka, two of 15 bacterial biomarkers were detected in both sample types (
 <italic>Ewingella americana</italic> and a 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp.). In paired samples from individual animals of other vertebrate species, fecal samples differed from stomach samples in microbiome structure, including in bats (Ingala et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and birds (Drovetski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Videvall et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Ingala et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) proposed that fecal microbiomes may be more species rich than stomachs, because bacterial DNA from diet items can be retained in pockets of undigested material in feces. Recently produced fecal material may serve as a better sample type than stomachs for bacterial biomarkers of conditions prior to consumption, given the greater potential for retention of bacterial DNA from those diet items in feces. Likewise, collecting fecal material is less time‐intensive and more humane than stomachs.
