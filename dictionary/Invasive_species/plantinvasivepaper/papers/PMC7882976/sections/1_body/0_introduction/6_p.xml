<p>We developed a novel three‐part approach to identify potentially informative biomarkers of diet item decay status, determine if invasive black rats (
 <italic>R. rattus</italic>; GI samples) consumed birds, and to determine if the biomarkers could distinguish bird predation from bird scavenging (i.e., carrion consumption; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37171-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). First, we identified bacterial taxa that were associated with either fresh or decaying chicken tissue. Second, we determined whether rats had consumed birds using PCR‐based diet analysis. Third, we identified bacterial taxa that were both (a) detected only in rats that had consumed birds and (b) were indicative of fresh or decaying tissue in the experimental chicken model. We collected both rat stomachs and rat feces to validate that rat fecal samples, both less invasive and time‐intensive, would provide similar biological conclusions as stomach samples. We present evidence that bacterial biomarkers, linked to the successional stage of bird carcass decay, can persist as biomarkers through digestion to be measurable as biomarkers in both rat stomachs and noninvasive fecal material. Properly replicated through time and space and calibrated for use in a local system, such forensic genomic tools can detect and quantify species interactions that are remote, rare, and highly challenging to measure.
