<p>Interactions among species impact biodiversity patterns, ecosystem responses to change, and ecosystem services (Tylianakis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The classic approaches for measuring species interactions involve direct and indirect observation, experimental manipulations of species or functional guilds, and predator stomach content analysis (Novak &amp; Wootton, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Paine, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">1980</xref>; Ruffino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). However, trophic interactions may be cryptic or rare and are often logistically challenging to measure. An integrated battery of techniques is often necessary to quantify predation by consumers, resolve trophic links, and to parameterize food web network models (Birkhofer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Carreon‐Martinez &amp; Heath, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Traugott et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). To date, these methods do not provide a solution for determining if a consumer is intaking a diet item as prey through predation or as carrion through scavenging. Ecologists often use indirect approaches (e.g., molecular or isotopic analyses) to identify that a food item was consumed, and the detection of a food item is generally classified as a predation event. Yet, scavenging may be involved in up to 45% of food web links and represents a substantial form of energy transfer between trophic levels that is unique from predation (Wilson &amp; Wolkovich, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). For instance, 124‐fold more energy can be transferred per scavenging link than per predation link (Wilson &amp; Wolkovich, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Underestimating the role of scavenging in food webs likely impacts assessments of predator–prey interactions, energy flow, and important foodweb metrics. Likewise, the distinction between predation and scavenging has consequences for population and community dynamics (Moleon et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Forensic genomics may be a useful technique to differentiate predation and scavenging to aid in our understanding of species interactions and food web ecology.
