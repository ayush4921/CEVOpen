<p>Invasive black rats can directly and indirectly impact the ecology and food web links for native and introduced bird species in Hawaii (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37171-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Estimates of nest predation by black rats in Hawaii have ranged from high (e.g., 87% [Stone et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>] to extremely low (e.g., 4% [Amarasekare, 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>]), indicating that black rats can have direct negative effects on reproductive success of native birds via predation, but this may vary by location. Rats can also have indirect effects on native and introduced birds by altering their foraging behavior and vertical habitat use, in turn impacting arthropod community biomass in the upper canopy (Wilson Rankin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Determining if invasive rats are preying upon birds, consuming birds as carrion, or not consuming birds will help ascertain the extent of the direct and indirect effects the rats are having on bird communities. If rats are directly consuming eggs, nestlings, fledglings or healthy adult birds, then such consumption could have a devastating direct effect on bird populations. If rats are consuming birds as carrion or rarely consuming birds in general, then the direct impact of rats on bird populations will be little to none (Fukami et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), although negative indirect impacts are still likely to occur (Wilson Rankin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37171-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Quantifying interactions among native and introduced species is critical to predicting the long‐term impacts of biological invasions and to understanding mechanisms for coexistence in these modified communities.
