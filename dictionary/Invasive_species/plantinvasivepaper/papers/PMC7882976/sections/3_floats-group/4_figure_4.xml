  <p>Microbiome structure by rat sample type. Fecal samples had (a) higher bacterial ASV richness and (b) dissimilar community composition (UniFrac distances shown here with 95% confidence ellipses: shapes indicative of bird in diet status) from stomach samples. The relative abundance of bacterial phyla was generally similar (c), except Bacteroidetes was higher in feces compared to stomach samples</p>
