 <p>Excessive herbivory by native deer can reduce abundance of native vegetation and increase non-native vegetation, but how does the forest recover when deer are excluded or numbers are reduced? The expectation is that understory vegetation will return to a previously diverse condition, but this is not always the case. We found that community-level monitoring captured both change and lack of change in vegetation cover, height, species richness, and response of common species, but failed to capture response of uncommon species. In contrast, monitoring of target species favored by deer indicated increased plant size and reproduction when deer were reduced or excluded. We conclude that measuring individual plants (growth, flowering and reproductive success) provides a sensitive and powerful assessment of forest understory responses to deer management.</p>
