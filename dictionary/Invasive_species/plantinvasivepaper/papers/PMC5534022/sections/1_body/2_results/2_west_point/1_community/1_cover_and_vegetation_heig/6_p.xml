<p>Separate analyses for May 2016 (
 <italic>N</italic> = 10 sites, two sites excluded from analysis due to fence damage) showed similar cover at low and high earthworm density sites and between open and fenced plots (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), but a significant effect of site invasion (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,14</sub>=5.33, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Total cover was significantly higher at the five sites dominated by non-native vegetation (42 ± 17.1 %; mean ± 1SE; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 5 sites; values reflect mean of median cover per plot) than at the five sites dominated by native vegetation (23 ± 3.9 %). We found no significant effect of fencing or earthworm density on vegetation height (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.5).
