<p>Between 2008 and 2012, 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> mean cover in permanent vegetation quadrats significantly increased in all fenced plots, and remained relatively constant in all open plots (significant year × fencing interaction; interaction effect ± SE: −0.016 ± 0.05;

 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> stems, distributed across six sites (only sites where the species was present were included in the study). Plants in the fenced plots were significantly taller (Est ± 1SE: 20.27 ± 3.5,
