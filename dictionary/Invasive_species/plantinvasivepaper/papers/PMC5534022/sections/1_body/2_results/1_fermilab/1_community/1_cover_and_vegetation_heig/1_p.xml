<p>Total cover increased significantly after deer reduction, and cover of native plants increased at a significantly faster rate than cover of non-native plants (significant year × origin interaction; Est ± 1SE: 4.8 ± 2.3,

While native (bi)annual cover slightly increased after deer reduction, non-native (bi)annual cover peaked the year after deer reduction and then steadily decreased over time (
