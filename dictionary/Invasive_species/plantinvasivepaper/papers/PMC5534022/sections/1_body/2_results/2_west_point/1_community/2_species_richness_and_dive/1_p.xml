<p>Over the 5-year study period we recorded a total of 192 species (36 graminoids, 17 (bi)annuals, 8 ferns, 78 perennial forbs and 53 woody species). The majority of species (92 %) were native. Species richness was not affected by fencing, earthworm density or site invasion, but significantly decreased over the study period at both the 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrat scale and 900 m
 <sup>2</sup> plot scale. Species richness over 2009–2012 averaged 7.3 ± 0.17 species per 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrat and significantly decreased from 7.82 species on average in 2009 to 7.00 species in 2012 (year effect ± SE: −0.29 ± 0.09;
