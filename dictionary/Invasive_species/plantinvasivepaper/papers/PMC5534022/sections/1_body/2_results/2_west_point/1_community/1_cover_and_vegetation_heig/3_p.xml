<p>Analyses of native cover by life form indicated significant interactions between year, fencing, plant species origin and earthworm density (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="plx026-T2">Table 2</xref>). Over the 4 years, averaged across all plots and treatments, native (bi)annual cover (3.31 %) was significantly higher than non-native (bi)annual cover (1.02 %), and native (bi)annual cover tended to be higher at high earthworm sites (3.02 %) than at low earthworm sites (0.50 %; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Native graminoid cover (2 % averaged across all years and treatments) was significantly lower than non-native graminoid cover (9 % on average per quadrat). Both native and non-native graminoid cover were significantly higher at high earthworm density sites than at low earthworm density sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F6">Fig. 6</xref>). We found significant interactions between all study factors (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="plx026-T2">Table 2</xref>). Over time, native graminoid cover remained stable in open and fenced plots, whereas non-native graminoid cover decreased in fenced plots (from 9 to 3 %).
