 <italic>Maianthemum racemosum</italic> was uncommon at both sites in both years. In total, we found and measured 50 
 <italic>M. racemosum</italic> in 2012 and 24 in 2016, of which 12 (24 %) and 5 (21 %) were in open plots in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Stem height (Est ± 1SE: −0.74 ± 0.14, 
 <italic>t</italic>=−5.2, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=7.1, df = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and leaf width (Est ± 1SE: −0.27 ± 0.06, 
 <italic>t</italic>=4.33, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=6.4, df = 1, P = 0.01) were significantly higher in fenced (mean ± 1SE; height: 23.69 ± 1.8 cm; leaf width: 3.96 ± 0.14 cm) than open plots (height: 10.4 ± 1.1 cm; leaf width: 3.11 ± 0.23 cm; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F10">Fig. 10</xref>). We found no flowering 
 <italic>M. racemosum</italic> in open plots at either site, but 32 % and 16 % of plants flowered in fenced plots at sites 5 and 8, respectively. Flowering plants were significantly taller (Est ± 1SE: 0.75 ± 0.15, 
 <italic>t</italic>=5.1, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=21.9, df = 1,
