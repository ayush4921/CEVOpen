<p>Overall, native woody cover was significantly higher than non-native woody cover (15 and 10â€‰% averaged across all years and treatments, respectively). We found a significant interaction between plant species origin and earthworm density (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="plx026-T2">Table 2</xref>): native woody cover was significantly higher at low earthworm density sites than at high earthworm sites, whereas non-native woody cover was not significantly correlated with earthworm density. We also found a significant interaction between origin and fencing: native woody cover was significantly higher in fenced than open plots (
