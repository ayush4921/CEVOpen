<p>Deer culling or fencing results in reduced non-native plant cover and increased native plant cover, but little change in plant community composition (although a few early successional native forbs can increase rapidly under reduced deer browse). We found that deer herbivory interacts with impacts of introduced earthworms in shaping plant communities, especially growth of different life forms. We also found that non-native plant species (at least the three in this study) had minimal effect on plant community composition. Rather, they are indicators of other stressors, especially presence of non-native earthworms and deer abundance.</p>
