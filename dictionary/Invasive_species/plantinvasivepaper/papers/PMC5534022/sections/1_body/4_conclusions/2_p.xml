<p>Plant community monitoring fails to capture initial and subtle effects of reduced or even cessation of deer browse on browse sensitive species, especially when these species are rare or are not present in standardized monitoring quadrats, as occurred in our study. Measuring responses of individual plants (growth, flowering and reproductive success) provides a more sensitive and powerful assessment of forest understory responses to deer management.</p>
