<p>U.S. DOE Fermilab National Environmental Research Park (hereafter Fermilab) is located 60 km west of Chicago, in Kane County, IL, USA and contains a mixture of forests, oldfields, restored prairies and active farm lands on 27.5 km
 <sup>2</sup>. We selected the largest forest on the site, a 31.6-ha mesic forest (“Big Woods”) dominated by 
 <italic>Tilia americana, Fraxinus americana, Quercus macrocarpa</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. alba</italic>, and known for extensive spring displays of 
 <italic>Trillium flexipes</italic> and 
 <italic>T. recurvatum</italic>. The forest had been grazed some time prior to establishment of the Research Park. A rapidly expanding deer herd and concomitant decline in 
 <italic>Trillium</italic> floral displays prompted research to assess deer impacts on understory vegetation. White-tailed deer densities averaged 11/km
 <sup>2</sup> in 1993, and 24.6/km
 <sup>2</sup> in 1998, according to winter aerial surveys. Deer densities were reduced ∼90 % in winter 1998/1999 and were subsequently maintained using sharpshooters at approximately the same density (2.5–6/km
 <sup>2</sup>) each year thereafter.
