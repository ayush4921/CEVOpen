<p>We used Linear Mixed Models to evaluate effects on individual species cover and height and Generalized Linear Mixed Models with binomial errors to evaluate effects on species frequency or flowering probability. 
 <italic>Trillium recurvatum</italic> models at Fermilab evaluated changes before and after deer reduction (a fixed factor with two levels [before and after]) and included sampling year as a random factor to account for temporal correlation within years. Models for West Point evaluated the effects of fencing, earthworm density and site invasion and included site and plot within site as random factors.
