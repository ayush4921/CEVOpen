<p>In late July 2008–2011 we randomly selected 5 of the 10 vegetation quadrats within each open and fenced plot, stratified equally across the plot, and sampled earthworms within a 0.25-m
 <sup>2</sup> frame placed 1 m distant from the vegetation quadrat. To ensure equal sampling of plots over time, we rerandomized sample locations each year. We removed and sifted all leaf litter, capturing any earthworms, then firmly placed a metal frame (10 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm) on the ground. We then poured 3.79 L of aqueous mustard solution (15 g L

 <sup>1</sup>; Frontier Natural Products Co-op, Norway, IA) evenly across the frame area, and collected all surfacing earthworms. We preserved specimens in 10 % formalin before transferring to 70 % ethanol, then weighed and identified each individual to species (sexually mature worms) or genus (immature worms). Sites varied in earthworm abundance and species composition, naturally grouping into either ‘high’ (12.4
