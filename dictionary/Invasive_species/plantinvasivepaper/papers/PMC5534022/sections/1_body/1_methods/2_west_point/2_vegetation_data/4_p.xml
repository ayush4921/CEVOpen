<p>In mid-September 2012 we recorded density, height, and reproductive status of each 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> in the 10 permanent 1Â m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats in each open and fenced plot at the six sites that contained this species. If 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> was not present in the initial quadrat location, we searched for the closest 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic>, and then placed the quadrat with the plant in one corner and shifted to maximize number of plants in the re-established quadrat. Thus, we recorded frequency and cover in initial quadrats, and plant vigor in initial and additional quadrats.
