<p>US Army Garrison West Point (hereafter West Point) is a 65-km
 <sup>2</sup> site located on the west bank of the Hudson River some 80 km north of New York City, NY, USA. This facility is located in the Hudson Highlands Province, a landscape characterized by steep hills, thin soils and rocky outcrops. We selected 12 upland deciduous forests (1–8 km apart from each other) dominated by oak (
 <italic>Q. rubra</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. prinus</italic>) and/or sugar maple (
 <italic>Acer saccharum</italic>); sites differed in land use history, aspect, soil and understory vegetation. Our investigations focused, in part, on the importance of non-native invasive plants, non-native invasive earthworms and their individual, additive or synergistic interactions with white-tailed deer and the resulting impacts on native plant species. We therefore selected 12 sites based on site invasion: 6 sites based on presence and abundance of 3 non-native plant species (
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, 
 <italic>Berberis thunbergii, Microstegium vimineum</italic>; two sites each) and six sites that had few or no non-native plant species present (please see
