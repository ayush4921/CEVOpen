 <sup>2</sup> permanent quadrats in a stratified random manner in each fenced and open plot in July 2008 (11 sites) or May 2009 (1 site) (12 sites × 2 plots per site × 10 quadrats per plot = 240 vegetation quadrats). Within each quadrat we recorded species presence, and estimated the percent cover for each species &lt;1 m tall in 17 cover categories (midpoints: 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 98 and 100 %). Plant species nomenclature and native/non-native status follows USDA Plants (
 <xref rid="plx026-B90" ref-type="bibr">USDA NRCS 2017</xref>). We recorded data twice a year, in mid-May (2009–2012) and late July (2008–2012), and again in May 2016. We estimated vegetation height by measuring the “average” height of vegetation at four locations within each quadrat, and then averaging these heights for each quadrat. We classified each species by origin and life form, and summed cover of individual plant species as described above under Fermilab.
