In May of even-numbered years (1992–2006) we recorded species presence, and estimated percent cover for each species &lt;1 m tall in 17 cover categories (midpoints: 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 98 and 100 %) in 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats randomly located within contiguous 20 m intervals along each transect (121–129 quadrats each year). Plant species nomenclature and native/non-native origin follows the USDA Plants Database (
 <xref rid="plx026-B90" ref-type="bibr">USDA NRCS 2017</xref>). Beginning in 1998 we measured “average” vegetation height to the nearest cm. While this is a quantitative measurement of a qualitative feature, all measurements were made in a consistent manner, and gross differences are assumed to be indicative of true height differences. In 2004 and 2006 we recorded species presence and height in all quadrats, and percent cover of individual species in alternate quadrats (69 and 65, respectively). We summed cover of all species within a quadrat using cover class midpoint values: thus, total cover could exceed 100 % due to layering. We classified each species by origin (native or non-native) and life form (annual and biennial forb combined, hereafter referred to as (bi)annual, perennial forb, graminoid, and woody). Graminoids included all grass-like plants (Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Juncacaeae). Ferns were so infrequent that they were combined with perennial forbs.
