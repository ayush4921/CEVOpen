 <italic>Individual species</italic>: Beginning in May 1998 and prior to the initial deer cull we collected demographic data for 
 <italic>T. recurvatum</italic> to supplement frequency and cover data. We recorded stem density, stem height (cm; measured to the junction of the three leaves or to the leaf base), life form (sterile, fertile, one leaf), and presence of browse on each stem within each quadrat.
