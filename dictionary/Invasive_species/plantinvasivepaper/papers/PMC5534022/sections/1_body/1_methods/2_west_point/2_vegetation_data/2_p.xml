 <italic>Individual species</italic>: We selected three native perennial plant species favoured by deer (
 <italic>Eurybia divaricata</italic>, 
 <italic>Maianthemum racemosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonatum pubescens</italic>) in 2012 for additional study. We assessed all sites for presence of each species but collected data only at sites where we could find a minimum number of individuals in both open and fenced plots (2 sites for 
 <italic>M. racemosum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pubescens</italic> [25 plants/plot minimum] and 6 sites for 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> [50 plants/plot minimum]).
