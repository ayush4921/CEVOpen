<p>Our results further demonstrate that the effect of deer browse on vegetation is influenced by earthworm density, and deer browse and earthworms interact to influence growth of different plant life forms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F5">Figs. 5 and 6</xref>). We are unable to assess how plant invasion and deer browse intensity have interacted historically to facilitate changes in native or introduced plant abundance. But earthworm abundance itself is a function of deer presence, deer exclusion results in declines of earthworms over time (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015c
 </xref>), and earthworms also decline as forests age (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>) suggesting a complicated web of interactions that we are only slowly beginning to understand (

 <xref rid="plx026-B15" ref-type="bibr">Craven

 </xref>). At West Point, both native and non-native vegetation composition was strongly affected by earthworm density at the beginning of our investigations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F5">Fig. 5</xref>), which in turn may have been influenced by site-specific factors such as soil pH, moisture or invasion history (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="plx026-B65" ref-type="bibr">Paudel 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>) and both native and introduced species responded more strongly to deer exclusion in areas with high earthworm density.
