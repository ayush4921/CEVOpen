<p>We used two commonly employed methods, deer culling and fencing, to assess whether significant deer population reduction or even deer browse cessation has potential to allow for forest understory recovery. Our results indicate that based on how we define recovery, we can either accept or reject our first hypothesis. If we define recovery as increased abundance, however subtle, of native understory forest plant species, then we can accept our first hypothesis that reduced deer browse pressure can result in recovery of understory communities. At both Fermilab and West Point, cover of native species increased and cover of non-native species decreased in response to reduced deer abundance. At Fermilab recovery was dramatic with cover and height increasing rapidly, but this response was driven by explosive growth of early successional species already present in the community. At West Point change was more nuanced as total cover (native and non-native combined) was similar inside and outside fenced plots over the study period. At both locations, species present before deer reduction remained present afterwards, and few new species appeared.</p>
