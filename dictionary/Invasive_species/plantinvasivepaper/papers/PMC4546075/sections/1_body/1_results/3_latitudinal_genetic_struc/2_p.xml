<p>In the STRUCTURE analysis of only European individuals ΔK suggested that the data were best described by two clusters (ΔK = 17208), also the number of clusters with the highest repeatability between runs according to CLUMPP H values (0.997), with the second highest ΔK and CLUMMP H values for the K = 4 model (ΔK = 1951.6, H = 0.984, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). At K = 2 the clusters corresponded to the north – south clustering observed in the full data set (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The four-cluster model additionally had a cluster containing only the Stockholm population and a cluster consisting primarily of the individuals from Amiens2 and Bremen (data not shown). In analysis of only the Kashmir populations ΔK suggested 3 (ΔK = 324.75, H = 0.949) as the number of K best describing the data, while the CLUMPP H value was the highest for K = 2 clusters (ΔK = 11.375, H = 0.972, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The K = 2 cluster model primarily separated Kashmir2 from Kashmir1 and Kashmir3, while at K = 3 all populations consisted of individuals assigned to different clusters (data not shown).
