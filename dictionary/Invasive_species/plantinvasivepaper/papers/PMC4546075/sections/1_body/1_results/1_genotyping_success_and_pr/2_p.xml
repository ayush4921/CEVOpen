<p>Two hundred thirty-eight marker genotypes with poor quality chromatograms were genotyped a second time. Of these, the majority (87 %) yielded identical genotypes upon repeated scoring. Genotyping error rate was not estimated for samples with high quality chromatogram markers, but is expected to have been considerably lower than for low quality chromatogram markers. In 75 out of 117 marker - population combinations the frequency of null alleles was estimated to be less than 5 % suggesting that null alleles were not a predominant property in most populations (Additional file
