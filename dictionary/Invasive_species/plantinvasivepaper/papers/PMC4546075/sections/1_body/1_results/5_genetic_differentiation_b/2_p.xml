<p>Pairwise F
 <sub>ST</sub> values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) between all possible pairs of one southern European and one northern European population were of a similar magnitude as F
 <sub>ST</sub> values between all possible pairs of one European and one Kashmir population (Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.083). F
 <sub>ST</sub> values were lower between pairs of Kashmir populations (mean 0.102, s.d. 0.026) than between pairs of European populations (mean 0.414, s.d. 0.165, Wilcoxon rank sum test 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the difference was not driven by the larger distances covered in the European sampling. This was shown by the fact that F
 <sub>ST</sub> values only for within-municipality pairs of populations (mean 0.243, s.d. 0.113) were also significantly higher than F
 <sub>ST</sub> values for the Kashmir populations (Wilcoxon rank sum test 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
