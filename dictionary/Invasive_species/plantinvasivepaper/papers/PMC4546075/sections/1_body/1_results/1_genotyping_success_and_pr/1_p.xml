<p>A final dataset of 378 individuals genotyped for nine markers was used to explore the population genetics of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. Originally individuals from 10 populations, some located within the same municipality, along the species’ north – south distribution in Europe were genotyped for eleven microsatellite markers and compared with individuals from three populations from Kashmir in the species’ native range (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The locus IGNSSR103 failed to amplify and was therefore excluded from further analysis. The locus IGNSSR106 (14 % successfully amplifying individuals) and one individual each from the populations Amiens1 and Kashmir1 with &lt; 30 % successfully amplifying markers were also removed due to poor success rate, leaving the final dataset to be used for further analysis.
