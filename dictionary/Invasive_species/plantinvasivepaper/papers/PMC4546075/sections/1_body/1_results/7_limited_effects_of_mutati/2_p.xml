<p>Populations that have recently undergone a bottleneck will experience both loss in the number of alleles and observed heterozygosity. In spite of the relatively recent naturalisation and spread across Europe we found little evidence of genetic bottlenecks when analysing the data with the software BOTTLENECK. No heterozygosity excess was detected for any population in any of the three population group sets used (Wilcoxon sign-rank text, all 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, two of the northernmost populations, Trondheim1 and Trondheim2, showed the shifted mode indicative of a recent bottleneck. The proportion of migrants into a population, assessed using the software BayesAss, was in most cases less than 1 %, and only a few populations showed indications of more than 10 % of the individuals being migrants from other populations (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The highest migration rates were shown within municipalities, from Trondheim2 to Trondheim1, and from Lund1 to Lund2, but also from Lund1 to Amiens1 and Bremen. The migrant individuals suggested were in all cases 1
 <sup>st</sup> generation migrants.
