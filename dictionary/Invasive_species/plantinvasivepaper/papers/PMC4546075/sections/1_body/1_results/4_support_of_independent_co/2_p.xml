<p>We postulated that the two regional clusters detected in the STRUCTURE and DAPC analyses, southern and northern Europe, could be the result of independent introductions into Europe. In our approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) modelling, posterior probability values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) consistently supported a scenario where the separation of the European regional clusters occurred after their separation from the Kashmir populations (scenario 1 in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), although with a type II error of 0.152. This order of separation is expected in a scenario with a single colonisation event. However, the median values of the time since the separation of the different clusters were 992 (separation of European clusters, q
 <sub>0.05</sub> = 292, q
 <sub>0.95</sub> = 3220) and 4850 generations (separation of Kashmir cluster, q
 <sub>0.05</sub> = 1670, q
 <sub>0.95</sub> = 9260) respectively. Similar estimates of separation time were obtained when only the European populations were analysed, where the time back to separation of the southern and northern European regions had a median value of 342 generations (q
 <sub>0.05</sub> = 77.5, q
 <sub>0.95</sub> = 2310). In both cases ABC modelling supported a separation of the two European regions predating their introduction in Europe during the 19
 <sup>th</sup> and 20
 <sup>th</sup> centuries although a postintroduction separation was not fully excluded by the analysis of European populations only.
