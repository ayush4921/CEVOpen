<p>The distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations, as analysed by AMOVAs, showed that within each species similar amounts of variation were present within and among populations in the native and invasive ranges (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The AMOVAs also showed that the distribution of genetic diversity differed drastically from species to species (Additional file
