<p>Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed significant genetic structure among the 13 populations and higher hierarchical levels (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). As expected the differentiation was higher between continents, Kashmir and Europe, than among populations within continents, but also higher among the seven municipalities than among populations within municipalities (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This suggests either limitations to gene flow, high genetic drift or the remnants of earlier founder effects not only between Kashmir and Europe, but also among different municipalities. Analysing the European data only showed that differentiation was lower among populations within municipalities than among municipalities (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Significant differentiation was found between northern and southern Europe, but differentiation among populations within regions was higher than between regions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Looking at Kashmir only, differentiation at the population level was somewhat lower (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), indicative of a less restricted gene flow in the native range, although the difference between Kashmir and Europe could also be the result of the European populations not yet having reached drift – migration equilibrium.
