<p>We additionally evaluated our data for genetic structuring using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), which is free of the assumptions of HWE and no LD present in STRUCTURE. The number of DAPC clusters best describing the different data sets was not clear-cut for the full and European data sets (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), but the automatic selection implemented in 
 <italic>find.clusters</italic> suggested similar or higher numbers of clusters to those found by the STRUCTURE analysis (all data K = 2, European data K = 5, Kashmir data K = 2). As our primary aim was to evaluate how the violation of STRUCTURE assumptions affected the clustering we compared the results from the STRUCTURE analyses with the highest support to those from the DAPC analyses with the same number of clusters. The DAPC results showed a high degree of correspondence with the outcome of the STRUCTURE analyses suggesting that the effect of LD and deviation from HWE on the analyses had been minor.
