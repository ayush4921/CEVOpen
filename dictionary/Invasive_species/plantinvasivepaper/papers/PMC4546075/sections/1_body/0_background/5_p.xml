<p>In its native range 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> grows at altitudes of 2000 – 4000 m a.s.l. from Kashmir to Garhwal in the Northern Indian state of Uttarakhand [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first documented European introduction of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was from Kashmir to the British Isles in 1839, where it was initially grown in the Kew Gardens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Originally an ornamental garden flower, it was first recorded as a naturalised plant in 1855 [

 <sup>th</sup> and 20
 <sup>th</sup> century the species gradually spread across the continent [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The increasingly more northern reports suggest spread may have happened in a step-by-step fashion from the range frontier, which, if true, should be evident through decreasing genetic diversity in more northern latitudes. The species is now widespread in Europe and found up to 64° N [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Seeds and seedlings have been brought to Europe on several occasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but it is not known from which introduction(s) 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> populations presently found in Europe descend.
