<p>Invasive plant species are becoming increasingly common and can threaten biodiversity across the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Apart from being of biological importance – frequently having a negative effect on local plant communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] – invasive species also provide particular opportunities to study ecological and evolutionary processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Being just a subset of the species-wide gene pool, possibly suffering severe loss of genetic diversity upon the invasion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], they are nonetheless able to thrive in a novel environment and thereby provide useful study systems for responses to rapid environmental changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].
