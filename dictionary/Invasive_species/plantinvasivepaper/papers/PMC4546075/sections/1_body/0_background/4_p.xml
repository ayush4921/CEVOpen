 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> Royle (Balsaminaceae), the Himalayan Balsam, is an invasive species in Europe (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]), North America and New Zealand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>] with the ability to outcompete native species, particularly in riparian habitats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is pollinated by insects but can also self-pollinate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Dehiscence of the seed capsule spreads seeds up to a distance of 5Â m while long-distance dispersal is primarily carried out by man or water currents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Being an annual species it can, upon senescence, leave riverbanks exposed to winter erosion and during the growth season its roots can block and threaten land drainage schemes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].
