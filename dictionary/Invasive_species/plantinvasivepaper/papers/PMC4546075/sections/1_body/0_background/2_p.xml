<p>The successful invasiveness of some species in spite of low genetic diversity is commonly referred to as the genetic paradox of invasive species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It has, however, been shown that high genetic diversity is not a prerequisite for an invasive species to be successful [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and some studies suggest phenotypic plasticity is instrumental for invasiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Others instead stress the importance of rapid evolutionary responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Molecular population genetics can be instrumental in exploring the importance of genetic components of invasiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. For example, although loss of genetic diversity is expected upon colonisation of new areas, it has been suggested that high genetic diversity, resulting from multiple introductions, could be what allows a species to become invasive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].
