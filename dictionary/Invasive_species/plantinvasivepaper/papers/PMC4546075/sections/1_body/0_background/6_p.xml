<p>Most studies on 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> so far have described the spread of the species on a local or countrywide scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], or have tried to elucidate the mechanism for its invasiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. In addition, differences in growth and phenology of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> have been shown to be correlated with latitudinal origin, suggesting adaptation to the length of the growing season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Recently, the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on a local or countrywide scale has been described for British [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], Lithuanian [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] and Finnish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] populations. To our knowledge, however, there have been no population genetic studies sampling 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> across a larger part of its European distribution.
