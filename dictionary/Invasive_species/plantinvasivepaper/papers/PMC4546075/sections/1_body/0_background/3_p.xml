<p>Phylogeographic analysis of intraspecific genetic variation can be used to explore the migration history of a species, including species that have recently colonized an area (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] and references therein). For invasive species, phylogeographic analyses can provide information about the source population(s) in an invader’s native range, as well as elucidate patterns of spread within the species’ novel range (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]). Additionally, phylogeographic patterns and the distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations can shed light on human facilitation of spread and thus aid in developing suitable management strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].
