<p>Although our PCA showed a gradual transition from more southern to more northern populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) this was not supported by the STRUCTURE analyses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Instead, STRUCTURE separated the European gene pool into a northern regional cluster, consisting of central Sweden and Norway, and a southern regional cluster, with all remaining European populations, with no gradual transition in cluster identity among the populations studied. The discrepancy between the STRUCTURE analysis and the PCA could be the result of limitations in handling patterns of isolation by distance by STRUCURE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] or by differences in how missing data was handled in the two methods. The presence of isolation by distance has also been shown to bias tests of AMOVA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and our AMOVA support of a regional division should thus also be interpreted with caution. It is also worth noting that the AMOVA of European data found more differentiation within the regions detected by STRUCTURE than between regions thus supporting the PCA results rather than those from the STRUCTURE analysis.
