<p>A number of studies comparing the genetic diversity of invasive plants in their native and introduced ranges have been carried out in a range of different species (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The different studies have used contrasting types of genetic markers and different approaches to sample the species in their native and introduced ranges. More studies will be needed in order to test the effects of factors such as growth habit, mode of reproduction and life span of the species on the population genetics of plant invasion. In spite of this some general trends can be discerned and tentative conclusions can be drawn from the studies available in the literature.
