<p>We see our estimates of migration rates primarily as an indication of populations more likely to have experienced gene flow. As could have been expected, most of the migrants detected were from neighbouring populations (from Trondheim2 to Trondheim1, 1.8 km, and from Lund1 to Lund2, 2.3 km). The longer migrations detected (600 km or more), if not a consequence of few markers and low diversity, should be the result of man-mediated dispersal. The latter seems a likely scenario between Lund1 and Amiens1 where as many as eight individuals were identified as possible first generation migrants. High within-municipality F
 <sub>ST</sub> values from Lund and Amiens were partially the reason why within-municipality F
 <sub>ST</sub> values were higher in Europe than in Kashmir and it is possible that man-mediated dispersal to single populations in these municipalities has contributed to the high F
 <sub>ST</sub> values observed. The ornamental qualities ascribed to 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the presence of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in such isolated locations in Britain such as the Isles of Scilly, Shetland and Orkney [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] point to the importance of anthropogenic spread of the species. This study further supports the role of man, in particular when it comes to repeated introductions and long distance spread, in playing an important role in shaping the distribution of genetic diversity in 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>.
