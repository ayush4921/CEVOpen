<p>From our F
 <sub>ST</sub> – R
 <sub>ST</sub> comparisons, mutation seems not to have played a major role in the differentiation of European populations during the evolutionary short time since their introduction, nor in the differentiation of the Kashmir populations. Of the six cases where F
 <sub>ST</sub> differed significantly from R
 <sub>ST</sub> four involved the population Kashmir2. Interestingly, we found significant differences also between Kashmir2 and the two other Kashmir populations, located only a few kilometers apart, even though it seems unlikely that these populations have been separated long enough for mutation to cause significant amounts of differentiation.
