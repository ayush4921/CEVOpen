<p>The present study lends support to the notion that high genetic diversity is not a prerequisite for becoming a thriving invasive species. 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> thus adds to the list of successful invaders shown to have limited genetic diversity in their invasive compared to native ranges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. Most of the invasive species with a low genetic diversity in their invasive range are, however, species that reproduce apomictically or autogamously. Among the studies reviewed 
 <italic>Acacia saligna</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] was the only outcrosser to have a genetic diversity that was lower in its invasive compared to native range than the equally outcrossing 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> studied by us. The low genetic diversity of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is also remarkable in the light of possible repeated introductions.
