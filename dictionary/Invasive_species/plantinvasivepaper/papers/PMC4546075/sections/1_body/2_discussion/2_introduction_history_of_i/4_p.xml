<p>Although there are records of seeds and seedlings being brought to Europe from Russia and India in addition to the first introduction to the Kew Gardens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], it is not clear from which introductions present day European plants of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> descend. In addition, it is not clear whether the Finnish populations studied by Nagy and Korpelainen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] belong to the Northern European cluster detected in this study. Comparisons of the populations studied here with British and Finnish populations will be needed to elucidate the relationship between the populations in this study, the original introduction to Kew Gardens and the multiple introductions suggested by Nagy and Korpelainen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].
