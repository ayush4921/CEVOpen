<p>The fact that the Kashmir populations in this study are not the source population of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in Europe limits our ability to make inferences about colonisation processes, such as the exact amount of loss of genetic diversity during colonisation. We note, however, that all but four of the alleles detected in the European populations were also present in the Kashmir populations suggesting that the alleles present in Kashmir populations to a large extent represent those of the source of the European populations. While we sampled a large number of individuals from few populations in the species native range, Nagy and Korpelainen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] sampled mostly four or fewer individuals from a larger area covering both India and Pakistan. The two sampling regimes showed a similar number of alleles (using an overlapping set of markers) and similar amounts of within-population genetic diversity for India and Pakistan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and Kashmir (this study) suggesting that the Kashmir populations studied here well represent the average levels of genetic diversity of a significant part of the species’ native range. Additionally, the STRUCTURE analysis performed by Nagy and Korpelainen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] suggested that the nine populations sampled by them in India and Pakistan all belonged to the same cluster. Since our populations lie within the area studied by Nagy and Korpelainen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] it is likely our populations would have fallen within the same cluster, though the levels of genetic diversity need not to be comparable. Nepalese populations of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> have yet to be studied genetically, but our Kashmir populations most likely sufficiently well characterize populations in the species’ native range for us to draw tentative conclusions regarding the genetic differences between 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in its native and introduced ranges.
