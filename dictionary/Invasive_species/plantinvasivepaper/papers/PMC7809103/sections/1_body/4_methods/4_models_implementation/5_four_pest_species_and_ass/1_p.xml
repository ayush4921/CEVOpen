<p id="Par44">In four multi-pest species system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A), the relationships (a, b and c) existed for each of the four species (species 1: Loops B1, B2, and R1; species 2: Loops B3, B4, and R2; species 3: Loops B5, B6, and R3 and species 4: Loops B7, B8, and R4). The relationships (f) represented by the Loops B9, B10, B11 and R5 showed interaction relationships between the four species. The stocks and flows diagram obtained from the system made by four species occurred with a level of discrepancy between the carrying capacity (
 <italic>K</italic>) and the population size of individual species, which additionally is dependent on the intra and inter-specific competition and interations among and between these species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B).
