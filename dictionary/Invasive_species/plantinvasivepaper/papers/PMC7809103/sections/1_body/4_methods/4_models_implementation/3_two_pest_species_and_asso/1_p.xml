<p id="Par42">In two multi-pest species system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A), the three previous relationships intervened for each species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, Loops B1, B2, and R1 for species 1 and Loops B3, B4, and R2 for species 2). In addition, relationship (d: Loop R3, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A) described inter-specific competition effect of involved pest species on each other. The stocks and flows diagram of each of the two species occurred with level of discrepancy between the carrying capacity (

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B).
