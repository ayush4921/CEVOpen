<p id="Par10">For each pest species and its associated parasitoid populations, the outcomes of the models showed that both populations marginally increased at the beginning. After 4 months, the relationship became cyclical between a host (pest) and its associated parasitoids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A–D). As the population of parasitoids increased, the pest population decreased, which in turn caused parasitoids population to decrease. As parasitoids population decreased, the pest population was able to recover, and its population increased. Subsequently, the parasitoids population increased and the cycle began again. The three stemborer species had similar populations with a maiximum peak after 6 months of about 4900 individuals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A–C) while the maximum peak of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> poplulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D) was 17% less than those of stemborers
 <italic>.</italic> The peaks of the populations of parasitoids of the three stemborers species reach a level above 4500 individuals after 7 months while the population of parasitoids associated with 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> was below 4000 individuals during the same period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A–D).
