<p id="Par9">The four pest species (three stemborers + 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>), in addition to their associated parasitoids and the maize plants that serve as the resource for the pests, constitute the system under study. Several cases are considered because these insects occur at different spatial distributions aross different agroecological zones. The analyses were subdivided in four cases: (1) a single pest species feeding on maize plants and its parasitoids, (2) two species competing on maize plants and their parasitoids, (3) three species competing on maize plants and their parasitoids, and (4) four pest species together on maize plants and their parasitoids.
