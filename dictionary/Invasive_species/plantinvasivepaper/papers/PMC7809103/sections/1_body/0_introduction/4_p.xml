<p id="Par5">Although stemborer species and the fall armyworm have been considered a serious constraint to maize production, few studies have illustrated the interactions among these complexes of pest species. System dynamics, first developed by Forrester

 </sup> studied the stability of insect species competing for resource. The study revealed that when a species feeds on a resource, the species will be able to establish and sustain a stable population that fluctuates based on the resource availability. However, in a competing context with many species feeding on a single resource, it is observed that the combinations of three parameters (half-saturation, growth rate and mortality rate) determine which species has the upper edge on the resource. In another study, Neill

This work therefore aims at developing and evaluating models that represents the interactions of maize stemborer species and
