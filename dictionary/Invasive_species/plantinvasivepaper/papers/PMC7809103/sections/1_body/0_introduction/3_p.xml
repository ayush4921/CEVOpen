<p id="Par4">Invasive insect herbivores have the prospective to significantly hamper with prevailing insect parasitoids species in invaded areas; this mechanism can occur in different ways: (1) interferences with the volatiles that attract the insect parastoids to unsuitable the host; if the plants can be infested by both the native and invader, the later produces volatiles that are less attractive to parasitoids

 </sup>; and (2) the parasitoids can attempt to parasitize the invasive insect, with low chance to complete their development. This is considered as a waste of time and energy that can negatively affect the fitness of the parasitoids
