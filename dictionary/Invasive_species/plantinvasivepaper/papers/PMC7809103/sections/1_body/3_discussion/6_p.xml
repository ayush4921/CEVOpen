<p id="Par19">In conclusion, the present models predict the co-existence of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> with stemborer species in maize fields. 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> and 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> dominate over 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> but without extinction, except that 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> seems to be displaced by 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic>. Therefore, the invasion of 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <italic>. frugiperda</italic> in maize fields in Africa constitutes an additional pest to maize crop that need to be considered within the context of integrated pest management strategy. However, the underpinning mechanisms surrounding the co-existence and possible displacement of other species warrant additional studies.
