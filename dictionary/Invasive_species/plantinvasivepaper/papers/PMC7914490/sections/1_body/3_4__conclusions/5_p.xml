<p>This review promotes the idea that these issues can be overcome by utilizing experiential learning programs to educate and empower growers and paid professionals, such as a PCA and further having PCAs provide hands on grower guidance. Funding for these programs could be based on two models familiar to citrus growers: the California Citrus Research Board’s grower education program [

 <xref rid="B151-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Both models are funded through bin taxes on harvested fruit, thus oversight and buy-in to programs are prioritized within the grower community. If the PCA is regarded as a valued partner in the educational and extension process, they can be an effective advocate, educator, mentor, and assessor for growers and ultimately reach more growers and ensure effective adoption and use of a variety of management tactics. Thus, achieving the NOP’s philosophical goal of a production system managed to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological and mechanical practices.
