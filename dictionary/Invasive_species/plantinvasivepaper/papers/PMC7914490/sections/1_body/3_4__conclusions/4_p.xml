<p>One of the most significant gaps in the NOP guidelines is the lack of pest monitoring and identification. The benefits of monitoring are well establishedâ€”early detection of pest populations, determination of location and density, establishing growth trends, having a retrievable historical record, proper timing of cultural, biological and chemical management tactics, and follow-up assessment of efficacy. Including monitoring and identification in the crop pest, weed, and disease management practice standard will serve to elevate the importance of this activity, making it enforceable for certification and eventually normalizing its use.</p>
