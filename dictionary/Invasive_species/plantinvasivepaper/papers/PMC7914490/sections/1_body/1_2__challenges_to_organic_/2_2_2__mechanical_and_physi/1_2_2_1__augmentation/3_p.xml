<p>Augmentation by inoculation is a more effective technique than inundation but requires data on pest population field dynamics by way of monitoring to allow for timely applications. This information is often best acquired by a field representative from a biological pest management company [

Experience has shown that growers will apply purchased natural enemies in an inundative or calendar-scheduled manner in an attempt to reduce or overcome perceived pest problems.

They may do so without economic justification, appropriate expectations, or fear of negative consequences since the use of commercial natural enemies is perceived to pose no environmental risks. Informed field representatives or other advisors can be an effective buffer to these impulses.
