<p>Organic growers also face issues due to migratory insect pests or intrusions of off-site GMO crop elements such as pollen. Migratory species like whiteflies, thrips, and diamondback moth, can move suddenly and unexpectedly into an area changing the pest dynamics for a crop literally overnight. Other consequences resulting from an invasion of a migratory species is that growers inherit populations that may have developed pesticide resistance, thus rendering weaker organic insecticides with the same mode of action useless. Understanding resistance management and paying attention to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) [
