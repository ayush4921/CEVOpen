<p>Growers want to use chemical pesticides when they feel the need arises [
 <xref rid="B94-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. They may work at preventative measures, but growers will use chemicals in response to any perceived economic pest threat and not as a last resort. As much as academics want growers to adopt various ecologically based pest management approaches, growers need to know that their investment and income can be protected from pests at a momentâ€™s notice. Others argue that the suite of chemical options should be broadened for organic growers with mounting evidence that organic pesticides are ineffective, resulting in more applications, are harmful in other ways to the environment, have non-target issues, and are not imparting the perceived health benefits when compared to conventionally grown crops [
