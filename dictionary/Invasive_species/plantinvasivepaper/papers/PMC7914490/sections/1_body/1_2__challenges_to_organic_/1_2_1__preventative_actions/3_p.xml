<p>Soil and nutrient management are long-term investments using inputs to improve certain metrics associated with a healthy soil [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Soil and nutrient management are the subjects of active research especially in the area of inputs that provide multiple ecological services while building soil health, such as suppressing soil pathogens. However, there are few data-based recommendations for organic growers for soil inputs that are regionally and crop appropriate that dependably aid in insect pest suppression [

 <xref rid="B11-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent research activity has focused on the soil microbiome and providing inputs to enhance putative effects on above ground herbivores, but there remains very little evidence for data-based grower recommendations [

Soil and nutrient management require consistent monitoring and appropriate mitigations for detected deficiencies and soil monitoring/sampling activities are required by the Organic Systems Plan section G4.0 for annual certification renewal inspections [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Organic certifiers set the number of soil and tissue samples required from the grower before an inspection [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Private companies provide analytic services, that include how to take and receive the samples, results of the analyses that include deficiencies, and optional recommendations to mitigate identified deficiencies. Each sample ranges between USD 50 and USD 100 to process; however, recommendations for remediation are an additional cost per sample and can be more than twice the cost for an organic farm than a conventional farm.
