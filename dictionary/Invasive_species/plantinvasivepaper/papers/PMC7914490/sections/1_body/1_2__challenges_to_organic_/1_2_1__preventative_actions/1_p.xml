<p>Preventative measures such as crop rotation, soil and nutrient management, and cultural practices are listed as first lines of defense against pests in the Federal NOP. With the exception of resistant host plants as a cultural control, these measures are indirect activities aimed at pest management. They are expected to promote the vigor of the soil and crops, resulting in less damaging impacts from pests. Crop rotation and soil and nutrient management can be listed among the few NOP elements with extensive educational guides available to growers.</p>
