<p>Crop rotation has been shown to effectively reduce certain pest risks within specific crops [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Crop rotation allows growers to plan for specific management outcomes well in advance of pest outbreaks by alternating between host and non-host plants. However, not all growers have the capacity or opportunity for crop rotations due to space constraints, agronomic knowledge, their business model, the cost of leasing land to grow a no-value cover crop, or desire â€¦ they may want to grow only one type of crop. A key to the success of using crop rotation for pest management is monitoring, and in some cases, monitoring beyond the field boundaries. For example, in potato systems, crop rotations have been shown to be effective at controlling Colorado potato beetles but only when rotated fields of potatoes are at least 400 m from a field previously planted in potatoes [

Although crop rotation may benefit organic growers, there are few recommendations that can be made broadly to producers, which underscores the need for farm/crop-specific monitoring data at the individual and regional level for appropriate management decisions. Regional monitoring efforts will have to be time and labor efficient and likely rely on methods other than physical collecting (nets, beat sheets) such as the use of herbivore-induced plant volatiles that attract natural enemies to a lure [

Depending on the situation, extension offices could serve as the principal organizing agency as pest populations will cross a variety of property boundaries.
