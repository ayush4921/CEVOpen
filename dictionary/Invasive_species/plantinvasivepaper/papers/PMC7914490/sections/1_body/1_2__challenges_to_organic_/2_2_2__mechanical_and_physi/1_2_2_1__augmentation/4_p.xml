<p>Growers are best served for augmentation advice by biological pest management companies that offer field representative services who participate in grower educational programs and have a strong online presence with information based on academic research and documented field experience. Application of augmentation is a multi-step process that includes monitoring pests, pest identification, knowledge of pest phenology, choosing the appropriate natural enemy species and quantity, and effective deployment. Natural enemies are also highly perishable and there needs to be considerable hands-on training to ensure the product arrives in good condition and is applied in a manner maximizing their efficacy. As such, in-person field representatives are the best means for success of augmentative biological control programs.</p>
