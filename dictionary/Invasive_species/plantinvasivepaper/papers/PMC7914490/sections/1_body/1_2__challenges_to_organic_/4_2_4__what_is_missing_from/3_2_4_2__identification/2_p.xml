<p>Pest management products and methods that are taxa-specific and stage-specific require accurate identification for effective use, requiring growers identify pests to at least the taxonomic level of order. For example, certain Bt products target Lepidoptera, additionally, these products are typically more effective on early instars [

Species-level identification is necessary for literature searches, applying data-based recommendations, and especially for selecting appropriate natural enemy species for biological control programs [
