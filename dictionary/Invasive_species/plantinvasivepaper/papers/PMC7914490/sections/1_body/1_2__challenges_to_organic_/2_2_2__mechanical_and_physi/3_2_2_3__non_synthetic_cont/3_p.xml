<p>Pheromone mating disruption has been used successfully for lepidopteran pests in agriculture for decades and the examples are legion [

 <xref rid="B80-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, there are far fewer pheromone mating disruption applications for other taxa, often due to biological incompatibility such as asexually reproducing species or asexual generations within a species [
