<p>The current products of choice for organic growers are typically botanical or microbial pesticides, a growing and diversifying market [

The cannabis survey discussed above, which was not based solely on organic production but did include reduced risk chemical approaches, showed that “microbials” were the chemical category of choice for growers with “unknown organic products,” azadirachtin, and oils rounding out the top four insecticidal products [

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) have also become popular as an equivalent to a chemical control attack on pests because of their unique biology and ease of application. In some cases, EPN can be applied through traditional pesticide application or irrigation equipment, potentially facilitating their adoption by growers. However, organic growers face technical challenges because many commercial formulations of EPN are stabilized with fungicides that are not approved by the NOP or Organic Materials Review Institute [
