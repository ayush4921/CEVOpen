<p>Development of habitat on farms for the benefit of natural enemies is one of two facets of conservation biological control; the other being use of selective pesticides. In the literature, conservation biological control is known by many names: Ecological pest management (EPM) [

 <xref rid="B42-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and whole-farm management [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The basic premise is to enhance natural enemy activity and create a crop production environment that requires far fewer inputs, as opposed to augmentation requiring consistent inputs [

 <xref rid="B44-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. There are two aspects involved in habitat development: Planting insectary plants near or within a crop to aid natural enemies, e.g., hedgerows and buffer strips [

 <xref rid="B48-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and increasing overall crop diversity within a farm, which also includes insectary plants [

 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Extensive biological and cropping system knowledge are needed for effective implementation of habitat that will lead to predictable management outcomes for both these approaches.
