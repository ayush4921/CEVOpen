<p>Augmentation biological control methods, although marginalized by Van Driesche, et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Michaud [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], have remained popular in pest management programs and is a significant economic sector in pest management with substantial projected growth. A survey covering the years 2004–2006 determined that commercially available natural enemies comprised less than 10% of the biologically-based pest control market with an estimated gross annual value of USD 25–30 million at the wholesale level [

 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and practical problems such as the availability and quality of purchased natural enemies, access to professional consultations to ensure which species are appropriate for the problem, effective and timely deployment, and how to determine efficacy to justify costs [
