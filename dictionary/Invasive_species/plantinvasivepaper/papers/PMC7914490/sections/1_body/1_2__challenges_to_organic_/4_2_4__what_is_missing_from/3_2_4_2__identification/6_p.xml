<p>App-based monitoring and identification tools will continue to improve, but academic oversight should be a priority for their development and subsequent training in educational pest management programs. Some institutions have compiled lists of apps with basic descriptions [
 <xref rid="B112-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] but no serious vetting. The limitations of these apps are that they cost or require an account, they tend to focus on one crop such as corn or strawberries, and they do not provide tools for population analyses to aid in pest management decisions. If recommendations are provided for crop-specific pest problems, the resulting information is either from an already established institutional website or has no affiliation and may be suspect. In the long-term, developers of these apps may not remain in business, provide sufficient updates or adequate customer service. Thus, it is reasonable to look to land grant colleges and universities to develop apps to provide growers with trustworthy, no-cost, ad-free, data-driven, and tested tools suitable for their crops/region to aid in individual management decisions.
