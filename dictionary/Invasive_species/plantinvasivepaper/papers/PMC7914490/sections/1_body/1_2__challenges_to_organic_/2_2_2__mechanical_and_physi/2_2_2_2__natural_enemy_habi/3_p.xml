<p>Changing the Farmscape by adding additional crop species requires new knowledge for successful growing and this may make growers hesitant in making extensive changes to plantings [

 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] does not take into account the willingness or ability of a grower to alter their farming system to increase plant diversity [

The landscape context for a farming operation can impact the efficacy of adding hedgerows or insectary plants to enhance beneficial insect diversity, including natural enemies and pollinators. A hedgerow planting in an otherwise barren surrounding landscape may have little positive effect in promoting natural enemies due to lack of a recruitment reservoir [

 <xref rid="B59-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], habitat heterogeneity in and around farms had positive impacts on natural enemy activity in the studies cited, reinforcing the need to take the landscape context into account.
