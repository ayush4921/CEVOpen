<p>There is little published literature concerning increasing the capacity of growers and advisors to identify plant pests and diseases, especially new arrivals. Levy [

 <xref rid="B109-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], and Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] indicated that the ability of growers and industry personnel to identify insects was increased when training was provided during intensive educational outreach programs [
 <xref rid="B111-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. However, such training efforts are largely limited in scope to a specific crop, or specific suite of crop pests, and many organic growers incorporating other NOP standards that encourage crop diversification are at a distinct disadvantage in these educational settings because of the diversity of insects they may encounter in their own operations.
