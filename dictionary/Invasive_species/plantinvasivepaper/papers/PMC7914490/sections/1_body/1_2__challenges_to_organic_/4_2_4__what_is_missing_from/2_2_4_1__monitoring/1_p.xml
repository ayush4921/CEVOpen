<p>Monitoring or scouting is a time-consuming constraint on growers due to the need for consistency and follow up to determine treatment efficacy [
 <xref rid="B98-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Monitoring a cropping system requires extensive knowledge of weeds, pathogens, arthropods and vertebrates. For diverse cropping systems the knowledge burden is compounded by the number of different crops. The benefits of consistent monitoring allow for early detection that is necessary to time and select pest management actions, especially for tactics slow to develop, such as inoculation augmentation biological control, or conservation biological control tactics, such as insectary plantings [
 <xref rid="B59-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Determining if an insect pest population represents an economic concern is an additional layer of complexity that requires current and historical knowledge [
 <xref rid="B99-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Assessing economic injury levels and action thresholds require accurate, consistent field information [
 <xref rid="B100-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and most growers rely on “nominal thresholds” [
 <xref rid="B101-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] that are based on a grower’s experience rather than a formal economic injury level calculation [
 <xref rid="B102-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The lack of meaningful thresholds for most pests and cropping systems is a well-known gap that can be bridged by consistent monitoring, but the results of such monitoring need to be a part of the annual certification process to ultimately develop appropriate thresholds for individual farmers.
