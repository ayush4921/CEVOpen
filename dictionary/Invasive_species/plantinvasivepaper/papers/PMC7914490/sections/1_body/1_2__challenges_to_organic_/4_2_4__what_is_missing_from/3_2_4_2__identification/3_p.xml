<p>Much like monitoring, identification requires extensive knowledge for a daunting number of taxa. The process to achieving a taxonomic identification involves a hierarchy of expertise. If the grower or advisor/field representative is familiar enough with the pest, they can identify it on their own. If not, they may confer with peers to settle on an identification determination. Through experience, growers and advisors learn the common, predictable pests and anticipate them accordingly. But infrequent or unusual pests do show up in fields regularly, in which case, identification efforts move up to county departments of agriculture or extension office personnel. If the county personnel are not trained or certified to make an identification on a particular taxon, then those specimens are sent to the state agriculture department for identification. In some cases, federal USDA ARS or university expert identifications are sought, but can take considerable time and so hamper the immediacy of in-field problem solving.</p>
