<p>Non-synthetic controls include the use of lures, traps, and repellents. The use of lures typically involves a semiochemical or food attractant to draw in specific species or particular higher taxa (e.g., fruit flies) to entrap and kill them [

 <xref rid="B72-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The use of lures/traps has limitations due to their target species specificity, expense, and usually requiring the cooperation of neighbors to regionally suppress pest populations to acceptable levels, unless the pest species has limited dispersal ability [

 <xref rid="B74-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Repellents may be useful but require extensive research to make field applications reliable enough to offset the potential expense [
