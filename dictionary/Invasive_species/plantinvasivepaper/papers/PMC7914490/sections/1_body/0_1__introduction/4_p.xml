This paper reviews the challenges and gaps related to arthropod pest management with the header section titles based on and in the order of the published pest management guidelines of the Federal NOP. This is followed by an educational model for enhanced adoption and implementation of pest management tactics, with special attention paid to the activity of monitoring for pests. This review is developed from the experience and perspectives gained by the author in ~30 years of participating in pest management practices as an educator, researcher and advisor in a variety of specialty crop production systems, and as the director of an on-campus 11-acre California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) farm in California.</p>
