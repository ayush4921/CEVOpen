<p>Key elements for teaching monitoring include but are not limited to the following:

   <p>Identification of pest species, appropriate field sampling patterns, determination of the number of samples needed, recognition of life stages, and what to count [

   <p>Record keeping of scouting data includes developing a database and analysis tools that helps growers visually interpret their findings and provide easily retrievable information of the current season and past years.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>The use of electronic capture of real time field scouting data via apps on tablets and phones must be included as well. Such technology has already been instituted by many professional companies, but these are proprietary. Although there is a proliferation of farm aiding apps available for android and iPhones, there is little vetting for growers to ensure they are getting a quality product, maintaining privacy, or filtering unwanted influences on decision making as mentioned above. Most importantly such apps need to have a graphing tool to chart, in real time, population trends including natural enemy population dynamics such as seen with the iPM app [

   <p>Information on multi-trophic interactions in diverse systems that includes host plant ranges of key pests and their associated natural enemies, designating those that are generalists and specialists and possible crossovers among crop plant species.</p>

   <p>The use of qualitative rating systems is an excellent approach to capturing a variety of pest impacts that is easily taught and widely applicable across crops, pest species and not limited by the size of the operation. Some examples of its use include Capinera et al. [
    <xref rid="B140-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], Bellows et al. [
    <xref rid="B141-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], Schroeder et al. [
    <xref rid="B142-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>], Ward [
    <xref rid="B143-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], and Brainard et al. [

   <p>Predicting pest occurrences and subsequent in-field population dynamics is crucial to cost-effective pest monitoring. As an example, Kogan et al. [
    <xref rid="B145-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] outlined the successional colonization of annual crops by herbivores and natural enemies as a means to help predict certain pest groups in crops that have their succession clock restarted with every new planting. This concept may serve as a general guide to help growers better predict, time and prevent certain types of pest population issues such as seen with pests in nut crops [

   <p>Understanding degree days also is crucial in preventative/predictive pest management planning. The University of California’s Integrated Pest Management website has a degree day calculator that is region, crop and pest specific [
    <xref rid="B147-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. This interface helps growers determine heat unit accumulation for crop phenology and prediction of pest growth and development. Additionally, degree day accumulation prompts certain management actions, growers benefit from programs that include timely reminders such as seen with Washington State University’s Decision Aid System [
    <xref rid="B148-insects-12-00140" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. However, education programs must teach advisors and growers how to validate these models in their area to fine tune the predictive ability, thus, making the tool more useful for an individualized regional approach if a Decision Aid System is lacking for their locality.
