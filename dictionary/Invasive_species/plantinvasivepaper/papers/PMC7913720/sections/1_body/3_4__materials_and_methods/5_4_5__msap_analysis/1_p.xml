<p>The methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technique, a modification of the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers which replaced the frequent cutter MseI with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes HpaII (NEB) and MspI (NEB), was used to assess the epigenetic variation within and among populations. The MSAP protocol was performed with some modifications as the previous study described [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For AFLP analyses, ten DNA samples of each population multiplied by 10 selective primer combinations were chosen for the MSAP analyses (

The fragments were separated on 6% sequencing gels and silver stained. In order to reduce errors, the paired analyses with different enzymes of the same sample were run within the same gel. To assess the repeatability of our results, three individuals from each population were completely replicated starting from the restriction/ligation reaction of MSAP.
