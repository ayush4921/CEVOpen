<p>At the same time of collecting plant samples, we randomly selected five plots in each population group and removed the surface plant samples and litter layers. Soil samples were collected with a soil drill (diameter of 5 cm), and all the soil was mixed evenly. About 500 g of soil was obtained at each site. All samples were collected on the same day. After collection, the samples placed in a cooler on ice were brought back to the laboratory for mixing, sifting and root removal. The collected soil samples were used for analysis of physical and chemical properties. Soil temperature was measured in situ using a datalogger (FOTEL, Shanghai, China).</p>
