<p>Soil properties were determined within one month after sampling as previously described [

 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In brief, TC (total carbon) was determined by potassium dichromate-concentrated sulfuric acid oxidation method. TN (total nitrogen) was measured on an automatic kjeldahl nitrogen meter K1306 (Sonnen, Shanghai, China), AN (available nitrogen) was measured using the Illinois soil nitrogen test diffusion method, NH
 <sub>4</sub>⁺-N (ammonium nitrogen) and NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>-N (nitrate nitrogen) were extracted with 2 M KCl, NH
 <sub>4</sub>⁺-N was determined by the indiophenol blue colorimetric method, while NO

 <sup>−</sup>-N was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. TP (total phosphorus) was determined colorimetrically using the molybdate method. AP (available phosphorus) was determined colorimetrically based on the Olsen method. TK (total potassium) was extracted by incubation with sodium hydroxide, and AK (available potassium) was extracted by incubation with 1.0 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> ammonium acetate for 0.5 h, followed by filtration. Soil pH was measured on a 1:5 (

 <italic>v</italic>) ratio in distilled water using a pH meter. Soil moisture was determined after drying at 105 °C for 24 h. The soil C/N ratio was calculated as the TC to TN ratio. Soil temperature of each population was measured in situ using a datalogger.
