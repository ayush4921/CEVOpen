<p>The software Quantity One was used to identify and label distinct and independent bands of the electrophoresis. The AFLP and MSAP fragments (bands) were scored as presence (1) or absence (0) of DNA fragments (bands). All fragments from 100 to 600 bp were considered, and a data matrix of the AFLP and MSAP banding patterns of all populations was assembled for further analysis. Since the sensitivity of restriction enzymes HpaII and MspI to the methylation site is different, the HpaII only identifies cytosine lateral hemi-methylation (single chain), while the MspI only recognizes the inner cytosine full-methylation (double chain).The MSAP reactions can be divided into four distinct outcomes: I, fragments present in both profiles (1/1), unmethylated state; II, fragments present only with EcoRI/HpaII (1/0), hemi-methylation of external cytosine; III, fragments present only with EcoRI/MspI (0/1), full-methylation of internal cytosine; IV, fragments absent with both profiles (0/0), uninformative site. The first three results predict different methylation levels, while the last result may have different causes, including methylation mutations or DNA sequence mutations, and it is thus uninformative [
