 <italic>Deyeuxia angustifolia</italic> (Komarov) Y. L. Chang (
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>), a narrow-leaf small reed, is characterized as a hydro-mescophyte perennial herb, with life traits that include fast growth, clonal and sexual reproduction, a short juvenile period, high seed production and anemochory. In July 2017, 17 natural populations of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> were selected from the alpine tundra on the western slope of the Changbai Mountains (

The elevation of these populations ranged from 2041 to 2242 m. In each population, we selected 10 individuals for leaf sample collection. To ensure that the samples were not from the same physiological individual, we kept 1 m as a minimum distance between samples. Moreover, to avoid differences, the leaf samples used for molecular analysis were collected from the top two leaves of the plant. The collected leaves were quickly dried in silica gel for genomic DNA extraction.
