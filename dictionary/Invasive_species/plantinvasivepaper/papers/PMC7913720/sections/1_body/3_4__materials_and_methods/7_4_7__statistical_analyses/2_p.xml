<p>According to the binary AFLP and MSAP data matrix, the population genetics software GENALEX 6.5 [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] was used to analyze the main biodiversity indices within and between populations, including the Shannon’s information index (I), percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL); analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to study the distribution of genetic and epigenetic variation, with 9999 permutations. Pairwise population Φ
 <sub>ST</sub> values were used to evaluate genetic and epigenetic differentiation among all groups based on GENALEX 6.5. Nei’s genetic distance and Nei’s epigenetic distance matrix were obtained based on GENALEX 6.5. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was used to analyze genetic variation and epigenetic variation between populations. AMOVA and PCoA were also based on GENALEX 6.5 software. The MEGA X [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] software was used to conduct a cluster analysis on different populations using the unweighted pair group mean with arithmetical averages (UPGMA). Pearson correlation analysis between soil properties and genetic diversity index and epigenetic diversity index was performed in R (version 4.0.2) with the corrplot package. Mantel tests and partial Mantel tests were conducted with the vegan package in R, with 9999 permutations. Origin2018 was used for principal component analysis of soil properties. TC, TN, NH

 <sup>−</sup>-N, AP, pH, moisture and C/N ratio (means ± standard deviation) of each sample was performed with three technical repeats in the laboratory. For TP, TK, AK and AN, a single test of each sample was determined by the Public Technology Service Center of the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences with a 95% confidence level.
