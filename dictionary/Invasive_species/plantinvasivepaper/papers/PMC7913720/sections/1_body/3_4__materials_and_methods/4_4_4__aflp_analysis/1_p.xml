<p>The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting followed the previous protocol of our research team with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. For restriction digestion and ligation, 10 μL volumes containing 60 ng genomic DNA were combined with 1.0 μL 10 × T4 DNA ligase buffer, 0.25 μL EcoRI adapter (20 μM), and 0.25 μL MseI adapter (20 μM), 5 U EcoRI (New England Biolabs, NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA), 5 U MseI (NEB), 0.125 μL T4 DNA ligase (NEB) and double-distilled water. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 8 h, 16 °C for 4 h, inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min and stored at −20 °C. For the preselective amplification (PCR1), 25 μL reaction system was combined with 2 μL digestion–ligation products, 0.25 μL of each pre-amplification primer, 12.5 μL 2 × EasyTaq PCR Supermix for PAGE (Transgen, Beijing, China) and 10 μL double-distilled water. The pre-amplification conditions were pre-denaturation at 94 °C (5 min) followed by 35 cycles of 94.0 °C (30 s), 56.0 °C (30 s) and 72.0 °C (80 s), a final extension at 72.0 °C (10 min) and storage at −20 °C. The PCR1 product was diluted by a ratio of 1:30. For the selective amplification (PCR2), 25 μL reaction system was combined with 2 μL PCR1 products, 1.0 μL of EcoRI and MseI primer (

The selective amplification conditions were pre-denaturation at 95 °C (5 min) followed by 12 cycles of 94.0 °C (45 s), 65.0 °C (30 s) decreasing by 0.7 °C per cycle, and 72.0 °C (90 s), then followed by 23 cycles of 94.0 °C (45 s), 56.0 °C (30 s) and 72.0 °C (90 s), extension at 72.0 °C (10min) and storage at −20 °C. All the PCR reactions were performed in T100
 <sup>TM</sup> Thermal Cycler (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Based on the number of amplified fragments, 10 DNA samples of each population and 10 selective primer combinations were chosen for the AFLP analyses (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00291">Table S1</xref>). The fragments were separated on 6% sequencing gels and silver stained. To test the repeatability of AFLP results, six individuals from each population were completely replicated starting from the restriction/ligation reaction of AFLP. For every polymorphic locus, each allele must exist in more than two individuals (&gt;1% of all samples).
