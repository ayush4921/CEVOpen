<p>Finally, we found that the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> in the western slope of the Changbai Mountains was relatively low, which may be due to the short time of expansion into the tundra zone, and the clonal reproduction and genetic drift in the process of expansion. The epigenetic diversity is relatively low, but the level of DNA methylation is relatively high, and the main variations of the genetics and epigenetics of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> were from different populations. This may be due to geographical isolation. Sufficient nitrogen, higher soil moisture and lower soil pH may provide a suitable environment for the colonization and expansion of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> in tundra. Clonal reproduction and epigenetic regulation, especially DNA methylation, may be involved in the adaptation of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> to different environments, which may be a molecular basis for rapid adaptation to tundra environment.
