<p>Simple Mantel tests between genetic variation and epigenetic variation with geographical distance and environmental factors across all sites revealed that geographical distance (r = 0.647, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and environmental factors (r = 0.127, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.041) were significantly correlated with epigenetic variation (

In addition, there was no significant correlations between epigenetic variation with genetic variation, geographical distance and environmental factors. After eliminating the effect of genetic variation, partial Mantel tests results showed that environmental factors and geographic distance were not significantly correlated with epigenetic variation across all sites. While eliminating the effect of epigenetic variation, environmental factors (r = 0.132, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.033) and geographic distance (r = 0.649, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were significantly correlated with genetic variation across all sites. When we eliminated the effect of geographic distance or environmental factors, there was no significant correlation between genetic variation and epigenetic variation. In addition, when we eliminated the effect of geographic distance, environmental factors were not significantly correlated with genetic variation and epigenetic variation, but when we eliminated the effect of environmental distance, geographic distance was significantly correlated with genetic variation (r = 0.647, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and epigenetic variation (r = 0.251, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.015) (
