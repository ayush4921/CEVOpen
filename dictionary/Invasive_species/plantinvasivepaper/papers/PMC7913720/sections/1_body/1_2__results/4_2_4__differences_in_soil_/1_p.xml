<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the variation of soil properties in different sampling sites, and PCA explains 75.32% of the variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f003">Figure 3</xref>). PC1 (Principal component 1) and PC2 (Principal component 2) explain 63.54% and 11.78% of the variation, respectively. P09–P16 are obviously separated from other plots along the 1 axis of the principal component, which is mainly affected by the changes of soil temperature, total potassium, carbon–nitrogen ratio and pH, while other communities are mainly affected by the changes of soil moisture, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total organic carbon and total phosphorus. In addition, P17 was obviously separated from other communities along the 1 axis of the principal component. PCA results showed that there was obvious heterogeneity in the growth environment of
