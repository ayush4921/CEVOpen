<p>Using MSAP molecular marker technology, 10 pairs of selective amplification primers were used to analyze the epigenetic diversity and epigenetic structure of 17 natural 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> populations. A total of 2345 loci were detected, the Shannon’s information index (I) for each population ranged from 0.015 (P08) to 0.199 (P17), with an average of 0.054; the percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) ranged from 2.87% (P08) to 37.95% (P17), with an average of 10.59% (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00291-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results showed that the epigenetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> was low in the population level. AMOVA results showed that at the species level, 87% of epigenetic variation came from among population and 13% from within population (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Pairwise population AMOVA showed the similar results (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), and PCoA could explain 17.02% of epigenetic variation. PCoA analysis showed that, unlike genetic variation, P05 was significantly separated from other populations, while P01, P02 and P03 were separated from other populations along the 1 axis of the principal coordinate. In addition, P04 was separated from the rest of the population along the 2 axis of the principal coordinate. Based on Nei’s epigenetic distance, UPGMA clustering analysis was carried out on 17 populations of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>. The results showed that the 17 populations of D. angustifolia were clearly separated into two clusters (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00291">Figure S2b</xref>): the first cluster included P05 and the second cluster included all the other populations. PCoA and clustering analysis indicated that there was significant epigenetic variation in different populations.
