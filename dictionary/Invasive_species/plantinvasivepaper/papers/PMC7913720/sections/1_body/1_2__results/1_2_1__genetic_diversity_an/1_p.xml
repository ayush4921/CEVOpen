<p>Using AFLP molecular marker technology, 10 pairs of selective amplification primers were used to analyze the genetic diversity and genetic structure of 17 natural 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> populations (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00291-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 1776 loci were detected. The Shannon’s information index (I) for each population ranged from 0.009 (P08) to 0.164 (P17), with an average of 0.035; the percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) ranged from 1.75% (P08) to 31.14% (P17) with an average of 6.79% (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00291-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results showed that the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> was low in the population level. AMOVA was used to study genetic variation in 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>. At the species level, 95% of genetic variation came from among the population, and 5% from within the population (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00291-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). AMOVA results showed significant genetic variation among populations (PhiPT = 0.946, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Pairwise population AMOVA showed similar results (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00291">Table S5</xref>). We visualized patterns of genetic variation through principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) based on Nei’s genetic distance matrix (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), and PCoA could explain 30.43% of genetic variation. PCoA analysis showed that all 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> populations can be divided into two large groups along the 1 axis of the principal coordinate, and P01–P09 is the first large group, of which P01–P05 and P06–P09 can be divided into two groups along the 2 axis of the principal coordinate. P10–P17 is the second large group, and P10–P13 and P14–P17 are further divided into two groups along the principal coordinate 2 axis. Based on Nei’s genetic distance, the unweighted pair group mean with arithmetical averages (UPGMA) clustering analysis was carried out on 17 populations of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00291">Figure S2a</xref>). The results showed that 17 populations of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> were clearly separated into two clusters: the first cluster was separated in two subgroups, the first one included P04, P05, P06, P07, P03, P01, P02; the second one included P08, P09, P10, P11. The second cluster was also separated into two subgroups, the first one included P12, P13, P14, the second one included P17, P15, P16. PCoA and clustering analysis indicated that there were significant genetic variations in different populations.
