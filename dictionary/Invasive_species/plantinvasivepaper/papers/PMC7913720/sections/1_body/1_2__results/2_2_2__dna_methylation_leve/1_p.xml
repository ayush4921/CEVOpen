<p>DNA methylation levels were significantly different in the 17 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> populations tested. Among all populations, the percentage of unmethylated states was highest. In population P01, P03, P05, P06, P07, P08, P13, the level of total methylation was higher than that of semi-methylation, but in other populations, the level of total methylation was lower than that of semi-methylation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The full methylation levels were between 10.60% (P14) and 19.75% (P01), with an average of 14.35%; the semi-methylation levels were between 8.98% (P07) and 20.30% (P02), with an average of 14.00%; the total methylation levels were between 23.36% (P07) and 35.70% (P02), with an average of 28.35% (

 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> was relatively high in different populations, and there were different methylation patterns among different populations.
