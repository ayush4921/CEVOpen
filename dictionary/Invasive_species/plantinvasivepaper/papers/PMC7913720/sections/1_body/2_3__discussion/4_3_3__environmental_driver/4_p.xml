<p>In this study, we found that the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> was relatively low, and its adaptability could not be fully explained from the perspective of genetic diversity, but the soil properties in the tundra zone may be conducive to the colonization of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>. In addition, our results suggest that epigenetic regulation, especially DNA methylation, can provide the basis for rapid adaptation to the environments. Our conclusion is only applicable to the methods used in this study, but this does not fully explain its adaptive mechanism. Therefore, carefully designed common garden studies are needed to partition the contributions of genetic and epigenetic variation to adaptive phenotypes.
