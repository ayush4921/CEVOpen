<p>In plants, DNA methylation is involved in the response to environmental variations stimuli and/or stress. Changes in DNA methylation are associated with many biological functions and are considered as molecular tools for plants to adapt to different habitats and external stimuli [

 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Through MSAP molecular marker technology, we found that the total methylation level of the 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> genome was relatively high, with an average of 28.35% (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00291">Table S3</xref>), and the differences were significant among different populations. There was a significant correlation between DNA methylation level and soil temperature. Soil temperature was negatively correlated with the epigenetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00291">Figure S3a</xref>), and DNA methylation is more sensitive to environmental changes, which may be a molecular basis for the rapid adaptation of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> to the changeable tundra environment when genetic diversity is limited in a short period of time. Previous studies have shown that epigenetic effects can be long-term or short-term involved in plant adaptation [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In populations, epigenetics can provide phenotypic flexibility beyond genetic constraints, allowing rapid responses to variable or unpredictable environments, potentially compensating for low genetic variability. Therefore, in the case of relatively low genetic diversity and genetic variation, 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> may adapt to the environments through epigenetic regulation.
