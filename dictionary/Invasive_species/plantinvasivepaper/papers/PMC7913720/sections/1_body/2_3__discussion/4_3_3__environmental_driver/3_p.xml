<p>Simple Mantel tests and partial Mantel tests showed that there was no significant relationship between genetic mechanisms and epigenetic mechanisms on the population level (

 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], there is a significant correlation between geographical distance and genetic variation. Combining the results of PCoA and clustering analysis, we believe that changes in elevation gradients have caused differences in the geographic distances of different populations, and geographic distance will affect the environmental factors of habitats, which in turn affect genetic variation.
