<p>Total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen are positively correlated with genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f004">Figure 4</xref>), which indicates that nitrogen plays an important role in the expansion of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>. Since the western slope faces the wind and increases the accumulation of nitrogen, the growing season is mostly westerly, which means that precipitation brings more atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Previous studies have suggested that nitrogen deposition is an important reason for the upward expansion of low-altitude plants [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Zong et al. also believed that adequate nitrogen supply is essential for the upward expansion of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>, which enables it to reproduce and expand rapidly by increasing the number of tillers [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which can provide conditions for the colonization of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> in the tundra zone and increase the genetic diversity to some extent. There is a positive correlation between soil moisture content and genetic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The elevation of the tundra zone is relatively high, and the temperature decreases with the increase in elevation, so low evaporation leads to higher soil moisture content. 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> is a hydro-mesophyte perennial herb, so sufficient water is beneficial to its establishment and growth. There was a significant negative correlation between pH and the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00291-f004">Figure 4</xref>), which meant that the increase in soil pH would reduce the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>. A study on the tree species 
 <italic>Beilschmiedia roxburghiana</italic> also found similar results: as soil pH increased, the genetic diversity of trees decreased. One explanation for this is that with the increase in pH, the average niche width of species decreased, leading to the decrease in genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that lower soil pH may increase the niche width of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> and thus improve its genetic diversity, resulting in its better adapting to the tundra environment. Combined with the results above, the higher water content, soil nitrogen content and lower soil pH in the tundra zone are conducive to the colonization of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>, which will increase their genetic diversity to a certain extent, so as to better adapt to the environment in the tundra zone.
