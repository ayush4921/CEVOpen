 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>, a local herbaceous plant in the low altitude area of the Changbai Mountains, has gradually expanded upward to the tundra belt with relatively high altitude in recent years due to natural disasters (typhoons) and air nitrogen deposition. The molecular mechanisms of genetics and epigenetics may provide the basis for the adaptation of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> to the new environment. In order to understand how 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> adapts to the tundra environment through genetics and epigenetics, AFLP and MSAP analyses were carried out on 17 natural populations of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> in an elevation gradient on the western slope of the Changbai Mountains, so as to deepen our understanding of the ecological adaptability of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>.
