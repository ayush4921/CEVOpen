<p>The low genetic diversity of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> does not affect the upward expansion of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> into the tundra where the environment is more complex and changeable. There is now increasing evidence that heritable variation in ecologically related traits can be generated through a set of epigenetic mechanisms even in the absence of genetic variation [
