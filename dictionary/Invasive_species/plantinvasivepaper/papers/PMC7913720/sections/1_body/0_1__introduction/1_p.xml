<p>Global warming has many impacts on plants. In particular, a warmer climate may force plant species to migrate from low to high altitudes [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is a phenomenon that has been recently documented in some Chinese mountains and other parts of the world [
