<p>Studies shown that some invasive plants have similar or higher genetic diversity in the invaded region than in their original habitat, which may help them adapt to the environment [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00291" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies on the genetic structure of the invasive plant 
 <italic>Phyla canescens</italic> showed that the invasive populations in Australia and France had similar or even higher genetic diversity than those in their native areas [

Generally, species need to maintain enough genetic variation, that is, rich genetic diversity, to adapt to the environment and cope with natural selection. For invasive species, enough genetic variation is conducive to coping with the selection pressure in a new environment. Although environmental adaptation is accomplished by genetic changes of mutation, drift and selection are very slow for some introduced species, and epigenetic mechanisms can affect their ecological phenotypic diversity through rapid gene expression regulation [
