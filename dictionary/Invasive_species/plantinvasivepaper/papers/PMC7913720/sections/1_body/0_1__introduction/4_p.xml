<p>In this study, we sampled 17 natural populations of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> from different elevations on the western slope of the Changbai Mountains and surveyed the environmental factors of each sampling site in order to detect different environment conditions. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) were used to study the genetic and epigenetic variation of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic> and to unravel the role of genetic and epigenetic variation in the adaptation of 
 <italic>D. angustifolia</italic>.
