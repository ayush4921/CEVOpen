<p>Our study also provides clarity on the identity of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species in Eastern Africa. Firstly, our genetic results confirmed the presence of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Our results using native and non-native genetic material, together with previous work from the native range (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Catalano 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Palacios 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>), also indicate important genetic differences between 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> and 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, confirming that they are indeed distinct taxa. Secondly, we identified a few instances of hybridization between these two species. These hybrids are likely to be triploid and sterile and therefore unlikely to increase invasiveness.
