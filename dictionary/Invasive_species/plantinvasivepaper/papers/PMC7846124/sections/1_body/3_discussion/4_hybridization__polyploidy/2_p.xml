<p>Our results also show that polyploidization facilitates immediate reproductive isolation between 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. Polyploidy often also leads to higher levels of stress tolerance, growth vigour through increased plant size, seed size, flower size, niche breadth and phenotypic plasticity, among others, traits that will benefit invasive species (for a review, see 
 <xref rid="CIT0092" ref-type="bibr">te Beest 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>). This may well explain why only tetraploid 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, and not diploid 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic>, became invasive in Eastern Africa, despite the similar introduction histories of the two species to the region.
