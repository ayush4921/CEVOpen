<p>We found genetic diversity in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> populations to be high and similar among species and native and non-native regions, with the exception of 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> and 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> (also see 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Juárez-Muñoz 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">Sherry 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). We also identified 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> individuals that had more than two alleles at some loci in both native and non-native areas. These individuals were not initially classified as tetraploid 
 <italic>P. julifora</italic> based on morphology, but rather as hybrids from Australia, 
 <italic>P. flexuosa</italic> from Argentina, 
 <italic>P. laevigata</italic> from Mexico and individuals from South Africa that could not be identified to species level but are presumed to be hybrids. While polyploidy has been reported in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)
 </xref> proposed that 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> is the only polyploid species in the genus. Ploidal variation is an important mechanism that underlies reproductive isolation, and thus could be promoting genetic differentiation between 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and its congeners.
