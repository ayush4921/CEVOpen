<p>For Tanzania, the origin and identity of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is more complicated and the available evidence limited. The source(s) and species identity of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> individuals originally introduced to two arboreta in the 1960s remains unknown and have been speculated to include 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> from other non-native regions like India, Israel and/or South Africa (C. J. Kilawe and J. R. Mbwambo, Tanzania Forestry Research Institute, pers. comm.). However, it is thought that 
 <italic>P. chilensis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> have also been introduced to Tanzania (C. J. Kilawe, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania, and J. R. Mbwambo, Tanzania Forestry Research Institute, pers. comm.). Our genetic analyses showed that the trees we collected from two arboreta were 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, similar to 
 <italic>some</italic> genotypes from Ethiopia and Kenya but not closely related to native Mexican ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In other areas of Tanzania, not included in this study, where 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is invasive (i.e. Kahe, Mwanga and Simajiro), repeated introductions would have been made from Taita Taveta (C. J. Kilawe, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania, pers. comm.). It is therefore likely that these invasive populations are also 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> since trees collected in Taita Taveta were identified as this species and most individuals were assigned to the same genetic cluster than Tanzanian individuals (results not shown). Therefore, our genetic results showed that, unlike in Kenya and Ethiopia, Tanzanian 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> genotypes in arboreta are not closely related to the Mexican individuals, supporting the notion of additional and unknown sources for Tanzanian plantings.
