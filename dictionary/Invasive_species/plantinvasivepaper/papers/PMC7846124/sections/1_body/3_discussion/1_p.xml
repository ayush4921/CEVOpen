<p>While numerous studies have reported on the genetic relationships among 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species and population-level genetic variation (e.g. 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Ram√≠rez 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1999
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">Saidman

 </xref>), ours is the first to provide genetic insights on the taxonomic uncertainty of non-native 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. We found low genetic differentiation between most diploid 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, suggesting that hybridization between previously allopatric species may occur frequently when they are co-introduced into new ranges. Polyploid individuals were detected in both native and non-native areas, with tetraploid 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> being highly differentiated from the rest of the diploid species in the genus. Levels of genetic diversity suggest that invasive populations in Eastern Africa (Kenya and Ethiopia) resulted from multiple introductions of both 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic>. While hybridization is thought to promote invasiveness of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in countries like Australia and South Africa, this seems not be the case in Eastern Africa. Here polyploidy appears to benefit invasion success.
