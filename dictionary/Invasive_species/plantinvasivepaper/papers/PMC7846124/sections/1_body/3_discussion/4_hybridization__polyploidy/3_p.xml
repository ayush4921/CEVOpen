<p>Our findings may also have implications for the management of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions. For example, the fact that 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> is genetically highly differentiated from other 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species raises the question whether biological control agents that have been tested against (mostly diploid) invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species in Australia and South Africa could perform differently on invasive 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> in Eastern Africa. Moreover, hybridization between 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species may also reduce the likelihood of finding effective biological control agents against any particular taxon (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>). Lastly, given extensive hybridization between 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, it may be prudent to treat diploid species from the Americas as a single unit when developing regulations to govern management, and not to regulate individual species. This not only has obvious management advantages, but also circumvents potential legal challenges to such regulations (e.g. see 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Little 2019</xref>). However, even under such a classification scheme we think that future research should still aim to determine whether different taxa and their hybrids differ in invasiveness and their responses to different management practices.
