<p>The taxonomy of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> has been much debated (
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Saidman and Vilardi 1987</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">Saidman 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2000
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2001
 </xref>). Low genetic variability among diploid taxa has been postulated to blur species boundaries, with some authors considering Algarobia species to constitute a so-called ‘syngameon’, i.e. a hybrid swarm (
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Palacios and Bravo 1981</xref>). Pre-zygotic reproductive barriers (e.g. differences in phenology or the use of different pollinators) are thought to be weak in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>, while post-zygotic reproductive barriers (i.e. pollen inviability) may be more important (
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Palacios and Bravo 1981</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Naranjo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1984
 </xref>). Our DNA sequencing data indicated that many Algarobia species shared almost 100 % genetic similarity. These results suggest a recent radiation of these species and possibly incomplete reproductive isolation between them (also see 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Catalano 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>). This may lead to frequent hybridization and introgression between species in this section (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Hunziker 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1986
 </xref>), especially when they are co-introduced into new ranges (e.g. 
 <xref rid="CIT0098" ref-type="bibr">van Klinken 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Mazibuko 2012</xref>). Only 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> was found to be highly differentiated from the rest of Algarobia species included in our analyses.
