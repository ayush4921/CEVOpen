<p>Our study provides the first genetic analysis of the origins of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> in Eastern Africa. Importantly, in Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania, we included comprehensive sampling from areas where 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> individuals were first introduced, and became invasive, in the case of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>. We found that genetic material of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> appears to be similar for most Kenyan and Ethiopian individuals, and closely related to native Mexican ones. These results suggest that invasive Kenyan and Ethiopian genotypes could have a similar Mexican origin. In the case of 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> in Kenya, individuals were genetically similar to Peruvian individuals, indicating a South American origin. Additionally, similar levels of genetic diversity were observed between Mexican 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and invasive Ethiopian populations and Peruvian 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> and introduced Kenyan individuals. In contrast, invasive Kenyan individuals of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> had higher heterozygosity than native individuals from Mexico. It is surprising that is not the case in Ethiopia given similar introduction histories shared by these two countries. Similar or higher levels of genetic diversity in native and non-native populations may be indicative of multiple introductions or it may simply reflect a unique introduction from a source generated by admixture of multiple populations (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). Higher levels of genetic diversity than native individuals can also occur due to cultivation, and can generate genetic novelties (
 <xref rid="CIT0093" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2012</xref>). Compared to traditional statements that multiple introductions characterize the introduction of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species to non-native areas globally (
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2001
 </xref>), our study is the first to provide support to this hypothesis for 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> in Kenya and Ethiopia.
