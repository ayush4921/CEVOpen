<p>Taxonomic uncertainty in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was further illustrated by our genetic analysis of hybridization. We found consistent disagreement between taxonomic classification of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species based on morphological versus on genetic data. One possible explanation for this is that hybridization, followed by extensive backcrossing, can lead to individuals expressing the morphological traits of one parental species while retaining genetic information of the other (e.g. see 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Gaskin and Kazmer 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Boswell 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>). We also used leaf morphological traits (see 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Burkart 1976</xref>) to classify our species; however, these can be highly plastic (

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0103" ref-type="bibr">Verga 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). Future research should focus on identifying diagnostic traits, and their heritability, for different 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa.
