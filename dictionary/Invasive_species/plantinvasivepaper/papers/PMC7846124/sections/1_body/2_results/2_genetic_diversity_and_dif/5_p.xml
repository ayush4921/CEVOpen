 <sub>ST</sub>-based genetic differentiation between invasive Tanzanian and native Mexican populations was higher than between the latter and invasive populations from Kenya and Ethiopia, and was also higher than the differentiation between invasive Kenyan and Ethiopian populations (

 <sub>ST</sub> estimates (
