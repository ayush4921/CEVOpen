<p>Both Bayesian assignment tests and PCAs indicated that overall genetic structure largely reflected ploidal variation, with polyploid 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> being highly differentiated from the rest of the diploid 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species included here. A second level of hierarchical structure largely reflected series-level relationships, showing genetic differentiation between 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> and the remaining diploid species, while there was not a clear genetic structure among 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species from Argentina, Australia, Chile, Mexico and Prosopis spp. from South Africa. Interestingly, both analyses confirmed the presence of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, and also identified some admixed individuals, i.e. hybrids, in Kenya. Lastly, STRUCTURE, but not PCA, showed low genetic differentiation between native Mexican 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> populations and invasive populations from Ethiopia and Kenya (
