<p>Overall, native populations of pure 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, putative hybrids from Argentina and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals from South Africa had higher numbers of alleles per locus, levels of 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>, 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>E</sub> and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>O</sub> than native and non-native populations of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> and Australian putative hybrids (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Inbreeding coefficients (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>IS</sub>) were high in most native and non-native populations of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. The number of private alleles was similar among native and non-native populations of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species and putative hybrids from Argentina (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
