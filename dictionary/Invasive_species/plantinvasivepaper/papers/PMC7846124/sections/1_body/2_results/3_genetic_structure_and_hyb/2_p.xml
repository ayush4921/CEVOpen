 <bold>]</bold>. These analyses were able to identify only three genotype classes: pure parental species and their hybrids. For most comparisons including species from Argentina and Chile, individuals morphologically identified as one of the two species, aligned with the genetic data and were assigned as pure genotypes of the same species between 57.1–100 % of assignments. In contrast, individuals were also assigned as pure genotypes of the other species (3.7–21.1 % of assignments); or as having mixed ancestry (5.3–42.9 % of assignments). Only when including pairs of the species 
 <italic>P. flexuosa</italic>–
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. flexuosa</italic>–
 <italic>P. vinalillo</italic> from Argentina, were the models unable to assign individuals to any class. Interestingly, for two of the three putative Argentinean hybrids, morphological identification did not align well with the genotype classification. That is, morphological hybrids were genetically mainly classified as being one of the pure parental species (66.7 %). Lastly, an analysis between 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> individuals from Peru and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> individuals from Hawaii and Kenya classified all Peruvian individuals as pure parental genotypes. For 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> from Hawaii, half of the individuals represented pure genotypes that differ from Peruvian genotypes, few of them were classified as pure 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> genotypes from Peru (7.14 % of assignments) and the rest were found to have mixed ancestry (42.9 %). In contrast, almost all 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> individuals from Kenya were classified as pure Peruvian 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> genotypes (92.0 %) and a few as having mixed ancestry (8.0 %).
