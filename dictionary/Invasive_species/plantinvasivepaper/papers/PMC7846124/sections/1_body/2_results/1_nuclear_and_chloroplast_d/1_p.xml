<p>DNA sequencing data for the 
 <italic>ETS</italic>, 
 <italic>psbA</italic>-
 <italic>trnH</italic> and 
 <italic>rpl32-trnL</italic> gene regions indicate extremely low sequence variability across our initial subset of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species from native and non-native populations. The exception was 
 <italic>P. tamarugo</italic>, where we found 15 substitutions for the 
 <italic>psbA</italic>-
 <italic>trnH</italic> region, 17 substitutions for the 
 <italic>rpl32-trnL</italic> region and ~240 substitutions for the 
 <italic>ETS</italic> region. When excluding 
 <italic>P. tamarugo</italic>, we found only one substitution in the 
 <italic>psbA</italic>-
 <italic>trnH</italic> region between 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> from Peru and all other species, and one substitution in the 
 <italic>rpl32-trnL</italic> region between 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. flexuosa</italic> and all other species. For the 
 <italic>ETS</italic> region, we found only four substitutions between 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> from Kenya and all other studied species. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. from South Africa differed by three substitutions with all other species, while 
 <italic>P. glandulosa</italic> and the putative hybrids from Australia, and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> from Peru had one substitution each when compared with the rest of the studied species. Given this low differentiation between species in the Algarobia section we did not sequence additional individuals.
