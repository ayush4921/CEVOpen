<p>Sound taxonomic knowledge of invasive populations is crucial to detect new invasions, to determine the potential sources and pathways of introduction(s), to prevent or reduce the arrival of new invaders, to accurately model potential ecological niches and to implement management options such as biological control (

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Gaskin and Schaal (2002)</xref> found hybridization among 
 <italic>Tamarix</italic> species to be widespread in the invaded range, while levels of hybridization in the native range appear to be low. Under such complex scenarios, complementing ecomorphological approaches (i.e. morphological data and environmental requirements) with genetic information may be critical to delimit species boundaries (
