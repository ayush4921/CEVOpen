<p>Studies at large biogeographic scales, including both native and non-native ranges, may provide valuable information about the genetic diversity and differentiation of invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, the occurrence of hybridization, and may help clarify taxonomic uncertainties. In this study, we assessed the genetic diversity, differentiation and structure, and evaluated the occurrence of interspecific hybridization in native and non-native populations of several 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, with a special focus on non-native populations of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania). For the latter region, we also wanted to indirectly infer the introduction histories of both 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species by comparing levels of genetic diversity and differentiation between native and Eastern African populations.
