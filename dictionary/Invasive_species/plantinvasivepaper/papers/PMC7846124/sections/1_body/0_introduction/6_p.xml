<p>In Eastern Africa, various 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species were introduced and some became invasive. Importantly, there is no credible information available on the origin(s) of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> individuals, their introduction histories or their taxonomic classification in this region (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Choge 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). In Kenya, 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> were first introduced in 1973 to Mombasa (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Johansson 1990</xref>) with later introductions of various 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species during the 1970s and 1980s to different parts of Kenya, including Baringo County, Tana River and Taveta (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Little 2019</xref>). The aggressive spread of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> has been documented (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2002
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0500" ref-type="bibr">Mbaabu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2019
 </xref>; M. L. Castillo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, unpubl. data), while 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> has seemingly not become invasive (M. L. Castillo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, unpubl. data). The overlapping morphological traits and native-range distributions of these two species (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Burkart 1976</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Díaz Celis 1995</xref>) have often led to misidentifications in both native and non-native areas, with some suggesting that they should be treated as a species complex (
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2001
 </xref>). Intermediate morphotypes between 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> have been observed in Kenya, i.e. putative hybrids (W. Okellu, CABI, unpubl. data). In Ethiopia and Tanzania, morphological identification of invasive trees remains unclear and studies only refer to the taxon as 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> or 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0088" ref-type="bibr">Shiferaw 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2019
 </xref>). Hybrids between 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> are assumed to be absent or rare (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0088" ref-type="bibr">Shiferaw 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2019
 </xref>). In Ethiopia, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was first introduced in the early 1980s into the Afar Region, with additional introductions between the 1980s and 1990s (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Admasu 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Kebede and Coppock 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is now considered one of the country’s worst invasives. In Tanzania, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was thought to have been first introduced in 1953 to Mombo Arboretum and Tanga region (J. R. Mbwambo, Tanzania Forestry Research Institute, pers. comm.), with later introductions between 1988 and 1995 (
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Kilawe 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>). 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is considered to be at an early stage of invasion in Tanzania.
