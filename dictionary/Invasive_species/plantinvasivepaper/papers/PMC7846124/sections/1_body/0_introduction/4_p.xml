<p>The genus 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (Leguminosae), commonly known as mesquite, includes some of the worldâ€™s worst woody invasive species (
 <xref rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr">Shackleton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). The taxonomy of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species is problematic because diagnostic morphological traits are often lacking and because the native distributions of many species remain contentious (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2001
 </xref>). Following 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Burkart (1976)</xref>, the genus comprises 44 species from the Americas, South West Asia and North Africa, which are mostly found in arid and semiarid regions. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species have been grouped into five sections, from these, the section Algarobia is divided into six series based on leaf morphological traits (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Burkart 1976</xref>). The validity of these series has been questioned due to taxonomic uncertainty, interspecific hybridization and a probable polyphyletic origin (
