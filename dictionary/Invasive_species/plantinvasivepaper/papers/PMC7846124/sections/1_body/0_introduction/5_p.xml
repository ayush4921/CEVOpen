 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species have been intentionally moved around the globe for many reasons, including for soil stabilization and to provide fuel and livestock fodder. These movements have been characterized by multiple introductions, often of multiple species from various sources, to different localities (
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2001
 </xref>). Alien 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species are now present in 103 countries and are considered invasive in 49 of these (
 <xref rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr">Shackleton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). Given the problematic taxonomy of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species many studies simply refer to the taxon as 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in their non-native ranges. Taxonomic uncertainty is further exacerbated due to frequent hybridization between different species. For example, in South Africa, numerous species were introduced and became invasive, including 
 <italic>Prosopis glandulosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Prosopis velutina</italic> and 
 <italic>Prosopis laevigata</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Poynton 2009</xref>). Here, DNA sequencing data showed that extensive hybridization is occurring and were unable to identify ‘pure’ parental species (
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Mazibuko 2012</xref>). In Australia, introduced populations have been morphologically identified as Prosopis juliflora, 
 <italic>P. glandulosa</italic>, Prosopis pallida, 
 <italic>P. velutina</italic>, and their hybrids (
 <xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">van Klinken and Campbell 2001</xref>), with the most severe infestation being represented by a hybrid swarm between 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> × 
 <italic>P. velutina</italic> × 
 <italic>P. glandulosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>glandulosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">van Klinken 2012</xref>). In Hawaii, morphological hybrids between 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and the invasive 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> seem to be present in several locations (
