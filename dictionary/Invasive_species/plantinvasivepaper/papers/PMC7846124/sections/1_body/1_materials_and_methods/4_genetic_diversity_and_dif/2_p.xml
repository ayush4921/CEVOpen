<p>We also estimated genetic differentiation between native and non-native populations of various 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, putative hybrids from Argentina and Australia, and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals from South Africa as described above (i.e. 18 populations and the same number of individuals per population as detailed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, a matrix of pairwise genetic distances (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub>) was calculated using the R package 
 <italic>PolySat</italic> with 95 % confidence intervals calculated via bootstrapping across loci. For diploid individuals, pairwise 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> values were calculated following 
 <xref rid="CIT0105" ref-type="bibr">Weir (1996)</xref>. For this, the FreeNA software (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Chapuis and Estoup 2007</xref>) was used to calculate corrected and uncorrected 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> estimates since it applies an ‘excluding null alleles’ (ENA) correction to account for the presence of null alleles. The 95 % confidence intervals for 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> values were obtained by 10 000 simulations. 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> estimates depend on within-population genetic diversity and therefore, on sample sizes (
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Meirmans and Hedrick 2011</xref>). Therefore, we also calculated pairwise 
 <italic>G″</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> estimates, which includes a correction for sampling bias, using the GenoDive software (
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Meirmans and Hedrick 2011</xref>). In addition, a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed including native and non-native 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> populations of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania and using the 
 <italic>pegas</italic> R package (
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Paradis 2010</xref>). For 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, a matrix of pairwise distances between individuals was generated using Bruvo distances (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bruvo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2004
 </xref>), while for 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic>, Euclidian distance based on the allele frequencies was used to generate pairwise distances between individuals.
