<p>Principal component analyses (PCAs) were also performed. A first PCA included native and non-native populations of all 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, their putative hybrids and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals. We used the 
 <italic>PolySat</italic> R package (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Jasieniuk 2011</xref>) to generate a matrix of pairwise distances between individuals using Bruvo distances since this method can incorporate distances between microsatellite alleles without information on allele copy number (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bruvo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2004
 </xref>). In a second ‘
 <italic>diploid-only</italic>’ PCA (i.e. excluding 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> individuals), we generated a matrix of Euclidian distances between individuals considering allele frequencies.
