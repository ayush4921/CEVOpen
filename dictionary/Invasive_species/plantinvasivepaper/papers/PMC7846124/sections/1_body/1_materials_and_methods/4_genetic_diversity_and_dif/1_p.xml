<p>Departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested for all loci for all diploid species (i.e. excluding 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>) using the R packages 
 <italic>adegenet</italic> version 2.0.1 (
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Jombart 2008</xref>) and 
 <italic>pegas</italic> version 0.11 (
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Paradis 2010</xref>) and significance was tested using a permutation test (10 000 permutations). We calculated various statistics of genetic diversity separately for all native and non-native populations of various 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, putative hybrids from Australia and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals from South Africa. For these analyses, all putative hybrids from Argentina were analyzed as a single taxon, and species for which we were only able to collect one or two individuals at a particular location were not included in the analysis. A total of 18 populations were included in the analyses. In addition, to evaluate whether genetic diversity differs between native and non-native populations of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>, we grouped all native-range individuals of all 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, putative hybrids and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals, referred to hereafter as ‘Native 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>’. Separately, we grouped all non-native-range individuals (i.e. introduced and invasive) of all 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, putative hybrids and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals, referred to hereafter as ‘Non-native 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>’. Then, we estimated genetic diversity indexes separately for each group and compared them. To assess levels of genetic diversity, numbers of alleles per locus, observed heterozygosity (
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>O</sub>), expected heterozygosity (
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>E</sub>) and inbreeding coefficients (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>IS</sub>) were estimated using the SPAGeDi version 1.5 software for polyploid 
 <italic>P. julifora</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Hardy and Vekemans 2002</xref>). For all diploid individuals, 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>O</sub> and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>E</sub> were estimated with the software GenoDive version 3.0 (
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Meirmans 2020</xref>), and numbers of alleles per locus and 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>IS</sub> values were estimated with the 
 <italic>diveRsity</italic> R package version 1.9.90 (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Keenan 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). Since there is a positive correlation between population size and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>E</sub> (
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Nybom 2004</xref>), GenoDive and SPAGeDi analyses included corrections for sample sizes for 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>E</sub> calculations. Lastly, allelic richness (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>) and the number of private alleles were calculated with the software ADZE version 1.0 (
 <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">Szpiech 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>). ADZE uses a rarefaction approach to calculate sample size-corrected estimates for these metrics. The number of individuals included in these analyses per population is reported in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.
