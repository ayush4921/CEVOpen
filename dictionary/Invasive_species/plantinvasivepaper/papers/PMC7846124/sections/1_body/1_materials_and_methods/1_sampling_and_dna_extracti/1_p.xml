<p>Leaf material of different 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species was collected from various native and non-native areas worldwide in 2016 (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). For this, sampling in the native areas was done within the two known centres of diversification of the genus, the Argentine–Paraguayan–Chilean region and the Texan–Mexican region. We aimed to include a high number of species, rather than sampling comprehensively across the distributions of only a few species. From the native range, we sampled individuals of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>P. laevigata</italic> from Mexico; 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> from Peru; 
 <italic>Prosopis alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Prosopis chilensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Prosopis flexuosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Prosopis nigra</italic>, 
 <italic>Prosopis strombulifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Prosopis torcuata</italic> and 
 <italic>Prosopis vinalillo</italic> and putative hybrids from Argentina, as well as 
 <italic>Prosopis tamarugo</italic>, 
 <italic>P. chilensis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. alba</italic> from Chile. A total of 67 sampled individuals from native areas in Argentina and Chile could not be morphologically identified to species level (hereafter referred to only as 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp.). The native ranges of sampled species are provided in
