<p>We tested the morphological assignment of diploid individuals to pure species and putative hybrids using microsatellite data and the NewHybrids version 1.1beta software (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Thompson 2002</xref>). This software identifies six genotype classes (i.e. pure species 1, pure species 2, F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, species 1 backcrosses and species 2 backcrosses) without information on the allele frequency of the parental species. The program provides probabilities of an individual belonging to any of the genotype classes and therefore how well our 
 <italic>a priori</italic> morphological assignment of individuals aligned with the genetic data. An analysis was done between all possible pairs of species from Argentina: 
 <italic>P. alba</italic>, 
 <italic>P. chilensis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. flexuosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic>, 
 <italic>P. vinalillo</italic> and their putative hybrids. In the case of Chile, the analysis was done between 
 <italic>P. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>P. chilensis</italic> individuals. A last analysis was done between Peruvian 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> individuals and Hawaiian and Kenyan 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> individuals. A burn-in period of 30 000 generations and 50 000 MCMC iterations was used. We used ‘Jeffrey’s like priors’ and a posterior probability of 0.8 was used to assign individuals to the six genotype classes. Individuals that could not be assigned to genotype classes were considered of ‘mixed’ ancestry.
