 </xref>. From these markers, the following four loci were excluded from subsequent analyses: I-P00930c as it was monomorphic; I-P07653, GL23 and Prb8 as these showed extensive patterns of non-specific binding in numerous samples. Samples that failed to amplify at more than five loci were removed from all subsequent analyses (including the single 
 <italic>P. tamarugo</italic> individual), leaving a total of 1072 individuals. Individuals not identified as 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> and that had more than two alleles at least one locus were excluded from subsequent analyses because their ploidy could not be reliably determined (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14;
