  <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) showing genetic structure among native and non-native populations of different 
   <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa and their putative hybrids. Countries from which non-native populations originated are indicated by asterisks (*). PCA was performed using Bruvo distances calculated in 
   <italic>PolySat</italic> (
   <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bruvo 
    <italic>et al.</italic> 2004
   </xref>). PCA 1 and PCA 2 captured 63.6 % and 11.0 % of the variation, respectively.
