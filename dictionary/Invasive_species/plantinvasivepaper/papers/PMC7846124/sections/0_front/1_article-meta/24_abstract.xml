 <p>Uncertain taxonomy can complicate the management of invasive species. Using population genetic data Castillo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> aimed to clarify the taxonomic placement of selected invasive 
  <italic>Prosopis</italic> populations. They found tetraploid 
  <italic>P. juliflora</italic> to be highly differentiated from all other diploid species of the genus. Diploid species, on the other hand, had low genetic differentiation, supporting anecdotal evidence that suggests these species often form hybrid swarms in their non-native ranges. For regulatory purposes all invasive diploid 
  <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa should be treated as a single taxonomic unit.
