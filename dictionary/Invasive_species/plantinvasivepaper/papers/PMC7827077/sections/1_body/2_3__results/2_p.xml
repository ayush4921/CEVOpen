<p>The species cumulative curve (individual-based rarefaction) was based on the number of species data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00045-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) showed non-asymptotic curve in each collection site referred to sampling insufficiency in all of the collection sites. Cumulative SHE profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00045-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) indicated that all of the indices were likely to curve asymptotically with a short period of initial variation, but all indices represented by high value, non-stable curve of SHE and more heterogeneity (represented by dots on the line) between collection sites (biotope) indicated that many more species of longhorn beetle remained undiscovered.
