<p>Cluster analyses of Bray–Curtis similarity, based on species composition and abundance of longhorn beetle species, showed similar percentages between types of forest communities: ME–L and MD–M = 50%; ME–H and ME–M = 49%; ME–L and DE–M = 44%; and similarities between P–M and DE–M, and MD–M = 48% and 43%, respectively; HE–M and DDI–M = 47%; within the group of DE–M and MD–M, DDI–M, and DDE–L = 47%, 47%, and 41%, respectively; DDE–L and DDI–M, and DDI–L = 40% and 40%, respectively, and DDI–M and DDI–L = 43%, while MD–L, P–H, and HE–H had very low percentage similarities compared to other communities (
