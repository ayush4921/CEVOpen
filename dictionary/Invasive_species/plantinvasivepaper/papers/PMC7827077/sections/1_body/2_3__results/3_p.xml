<p>The biodiversity comparison between the collection sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00045-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) and accumulation curve of the diversity index (Shannon_H index) revealed good proportion within all the collection sites between abundance among species by the asymptotic curve. Of these sites, no. 15 (Loei Forest Unit) had the highest diversity, followed by no. 36 (Panernthung) and no. 1 (Mae Fang Hotspring), while the lowest diversity was in site no. 7 (Kew Maepan).
