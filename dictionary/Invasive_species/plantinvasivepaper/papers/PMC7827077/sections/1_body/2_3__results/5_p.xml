<p>A total of 199 morphospecies from 1376 specimens were captured in this study. Of these, 9 species were the most abundant; represented by 30–66 specimens, 29 were represented by 10–29 specimens and 51 by 3 or 4 specimens. In contrast, 81 species (40.7%) were represented as singletons (single individual) and 29 (14.5%) as doubletons (only two individuals collected) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00045-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). Observed species richness in each collection site ranged from 3 to 50 species. The estimated species richness (Chao1 estimator), which represented the number of species, was 6 and 1275 species at Vachiratharn water fall and Loei Forest Unit, respectively (
