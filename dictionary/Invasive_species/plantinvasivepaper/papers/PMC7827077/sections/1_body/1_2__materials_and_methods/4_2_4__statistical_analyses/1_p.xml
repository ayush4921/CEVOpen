<p>Observed species richness and relative abundance of longhorn beetles by monthly samples from each site were recorded. Relative abundance was calculated by the total number of species occurrence divided by the total number of collections and presented in percentages. Frequency of species occurrence (SO) was calculated by the number sites with positive species divided by the total number of collection sites (

The Shannon_H index, Simpson_1–D, Evenness_e^H/S and Dominance_D were used to measure the biodiversity of the longhorn beetles in each collection site, and Chao1 richness estimator was used to estimate the total number of species in each one. The species accumulation curve (individual-based rarefaction), based on the Shannon_H index and taxa was used for comparing biodiversity between collection sites and to assess sampling adequacy. The SHE analysis that calculated the log for species abundance (ln S), Shannon H index and log for evenness (ln E = H − ln S) in all of the samples, from the first and last sample, were applied to assess variations of the community and species composition. The general linear model (GLM) was used to test the relationship between species richness of the longhorn beetle and elevation gradient. The matrix plot of monthly variation in species richness and abundance of the longhorn beetles in each national park was based on abundance data, and visualized as a contour map. Longhorn beetle species were represented by ≥ 10 individuals that were used for ordination analyses and the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and the site/species matrix was used to analyze species distribution related specifically to collection sites and environmental variables (forest types, elevations, and geographic regions). Correspondence analysis (CA) was used to interpret the relationship between longhorn beetles and forest types. Similarity among sampling sites was based on species composition data. Cluster analyses of the paired group (UPGMA) was based on the Bray–Curtis similarity index, with 1000 bootstraps carried out. All statistical analyses were performed by PAST version 4.03 [
