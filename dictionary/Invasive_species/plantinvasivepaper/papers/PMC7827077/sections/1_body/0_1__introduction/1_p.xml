<p>Understanding the biodiversity and ecology of insects, especially their seasonal activity and distribution patterns that are the largest components in the ecosystem, is necessary due to their impact on agriculture and economics. Beetles are largest order of insects, and longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) are one of the larger families, with a wide-geographic distribution and more than 37,000 species in 5000 genera recorded. This group of beetles is charismatic, has high biodiversity with various ecological niches, and is of significant economic importance. Most of the members are phytophagous or xylophagous, with many species being pests of agricultural crops, ornamental trees and lumber products, thus causing millions of dollars in damage each year [

 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Approximately 200 species worldwide have been reported to have impact on agriculture, forestry, and horticulture, causing production losses by destroying plants by direct feeding or transmission of plant diseases [

 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Exotic invasive species have the potential to become devastating pests because they are difficult and costly to detect. A total of 19 exotic invasive longhorn beetle species have been reported in Europe, America, and Canada [

 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Asian native species, 
 <italic>Psacothea hilaris hilaris</italic> (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae), has been reported as an exotic invasive pest of 
 <italic>Morus,</italic> mulberry and 
 <italic>Ficus</italic> trees in Italy and Germany [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some longhorn beetle species are reported as being agriculture and eco-friendly: 
 <italic>Alosterna tabacicolor</italic> is the main pollinator of Orchid (
 <italic>Dactylorhiza fuchsii</italic>) in Poland [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and during the larval stage, longhorn beetles play a critical role in nutrient cycling in forests [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, morphological study and material composition of larvae mouthparts have been performed in some species, which could be applied for developing bionic technologies and structural concepts [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, secretion from the jaws of longhorn beetle larvae can be applied for developing wood preservatives [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, longhorn beetles also cause economic loss in agriculture and forestry. Thus, a better understanding of their ecology, distribution, and environment relationship is necessary for preventing this problem.
