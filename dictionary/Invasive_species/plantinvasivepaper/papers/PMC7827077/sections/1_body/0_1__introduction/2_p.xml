<p>Although several studies have been carried out in many countries on the biodiversity and ecology of longhorn beetles in many aspects, such as host/plant relationship, distribution, seasonal activity of some economic importance species [

 <xref rid="B18-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the biodiversity of these beetles in Thailand is unknown. Over 10,000 insect species and 151 longhorn beetle species were catalogued from this country [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there have been no reports on the biodiversity or ecology of longhorn beetles in Thailand, and only three previous taxonomic studies: the first being in 1973 of 62 species reported in the northeast [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the second in 1975 of 87 species discovered in Chiang Mai province, in the north [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the third in 2011 of 308 species also reported from the north, including 86 newly recorded species for the country [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, this is the first report on the biodiversity and ecology of longhorn beetles in Thailand. The objective of this study was to analyze the biodiversity and distribution of longhorn beetles in spatial and temporal variation, associated with environmental factors across an elevation gradient and seasons in six regions of Thailand.
