<p>When the community structure of Cerambycidae from this study was considered, the subfamily level was compared with previous work from northern Thailand [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the proportionate number of species in each subfamily had a similar trend, with the greatest number of species were in the subfamily Lamiinae, followed by Cerambycinae and Prioninae, respectively. However, in a different number of subfamilies, three species in the unique subfamily, Dorcasominae, were found, while it previously showed that the subfamily Philinae and Aseminae had no positive result in these studies. Regarding different collecting methods, only the malaise trap was used in this study, but previous studies combined collecting techniques such as sweeping, light trap and direct searching in habitats appropriate for Cerambycidae.
