<p>The species richness and abundance of longhorn beetles peaked during the hot season (Marchâ€“April) and early wet season (May). These seasonal patterns being similar to those reported by [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] from a study on cerambycids in northern Thailand. Likewise, a study report from a tropical dry forest in Mexico indicated that the greatest species richness and abundance of cerambycids were found during the rainy season [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while a study from Illinois, USA, reported that the flight seasons of cerambycids start in mid-March, with abundance and species richness increasing to a peak in mid-July, and declining through to the end of August [
