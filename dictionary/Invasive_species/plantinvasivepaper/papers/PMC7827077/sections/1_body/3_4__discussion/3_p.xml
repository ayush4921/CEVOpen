<p>This study found that many species were captured in small numbers that represented a high percentage of singletons (40.7%) and doubletons (14.5%) (

 <xref rid="B41-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The small number of longhorn beetles caught during this study may be explained by the limitation of the collecting method used. Malaise traps are unbiased and passive, and do not use attractants or bait.
