<p>The dominant collection sites with the greatest species richness and diversity index of the longhorn beetle (45% or 90 species of the total species from three localities) were Loei Forest Unit, Mae Fang Hotspring and Panernthung, which are located in lowland and mid-elevation (273â€“950 m asl). The first two sites were buffer zones located at the boundary of orchard areas and the third one was in natural forest. Both orchard areas or cultivated land and natural forest support high biodiversity of the longhorn beetle [

 <xref rid="B58-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] on the distribution of saproxylic beetles was reported similarly, with higher species richness in temperate lowland than in montane forests [
 <xref rid="B59-insects-12-00045" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In general, it can be assumed that cerambycid feeding on living, dying or dead wood as well as flowers is because these food supplies are more available in cultivated areas, which are associated with the cultivated activity of their local inhabitants. Moreover, both dominant sites of Loei Forest Unit and Mae Fang Hotspring were affected by wildfires that resulted in increase of food sources, i.e., tree decomposition [
