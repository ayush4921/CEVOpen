<p>The collection sites in this study were located at various elevations that ranged between 10 and 2200 m, and classified into three zones, lowland (10–500 m asl), mid-elevation (501–1000 m asl), and highland (1001–1300 m asl). The results of this study indicated that the relationship between species richness and elevation was significantly negative with hump-shaped patterns and the number of species increasing by elevation at the initial phase; then peaking at the middle-elevation before decreasing at the high elevation. These characteristics are accepted as a general pattern [

Middle elevations have many factors which make them suitable for insects such as optimal temperatures, greater host plant diversity or food availability. Furthermore, herbivorous beetles are a dominant group at this elevation in that they synchronize with host plants and correlate to precipitation, and the longhorn beetle has support of a biological niche [
