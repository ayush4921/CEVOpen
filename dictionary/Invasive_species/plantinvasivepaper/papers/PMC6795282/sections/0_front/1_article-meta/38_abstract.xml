 <p>The human-mediated introduction of species outside their native range is considered to be one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, yet a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of global invasions is currently lacking. Here, we use a novel database of naturalized and invasive plant species richness to analyse the effects of biogeographical, physical environment and socio-economic factors on the numbers of naturalized and invasive plant species relative to native species in 838 terrestrial regions. We demonstrate that the numbers of naturalized and invasive plant species relative to native species richness is highest on (sub)tropical islands, and that socio-economic factors foster invasive spread after naturalization. To meet international biodiversity targets and to halt the detrimental consequences of plant invasions, it is essential to disrupt the connection between socio-economic development and rising levels of plant invasions by improving pathway management, early detection and rapid response.</p>
