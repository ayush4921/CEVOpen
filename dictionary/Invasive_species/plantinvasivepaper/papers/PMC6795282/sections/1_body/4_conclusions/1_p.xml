<p>Of the five hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the geographic patterns of alien species richness and which we tested with our data set, we could clearly confirm the mainland–island differentiation. We did not find support for the expectation that socio-economic pressures are more important for naturalized than invasive species (
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Williamson 2006</xref>), as we found that socio-economic pressures explain more of the variation in RRI than in RRN. The expectation that regions in the southern hemisphere are more invaded could only be confirmed for RRN on islands, and the Old vs. New World dichotomy could not be confirmed at all. We found no evidence that time elapsed since colonization of islands influences the current RRN or RRI. Further, the percentages of naturalized species that have become invasive (median for islands: 11.2 %; median for mainland regions: 9.2 %) support one of the oldest and most widely cited ‘rules of thumb’ in invasion ecology, i.e. the tens-rule (
