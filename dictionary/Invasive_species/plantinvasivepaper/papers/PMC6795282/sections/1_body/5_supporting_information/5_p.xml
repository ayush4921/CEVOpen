 <bold>Figure S4</bold>. Relative importance of biogeographic (orange), physical environment (green), and socio-economic (grey) variables for explaining absolute numbers of naturalized (A) and invasive (B) species per region. Mainland vs. island region and region area were core predictors included in all predictor subsets fitted for this analysis, and therefore no assessment of relative importance applies to them.
