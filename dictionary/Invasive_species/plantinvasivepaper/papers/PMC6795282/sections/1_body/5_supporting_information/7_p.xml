 <bold>Table S2.</bold> The generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) of absolute numbers of naturalized (A) and invasive (B) plant species per region world-wide. GLMMs use a Poisson-distribution as response and a total of 14 predictor variables. Note that data on human colonization were only available for islands. Predictors were assessed for significantly different effects on mainland vs. island regions by means of interactions with this binary factor, and subjecting these interactions to a backward model search based on lower AIC; for the retained terms each of the two separate coefficients for mainland and island regions states the predictor effect at an absolute scale. Random effect intercept terms with sovereign state, TDWG continent and zonobiome as (orthogonal) grouping factors acknowledge for political/socio-economic, biogeographic, spatial and climatic correlations among regions, with an additional observation-level random effect term accounting for Poisson-distribution overdispersion. Numerical predictor variables were standardized. Estimated standard deviations of random effects: A: sovereign states: 0.38, TDWG continent: 0.58, zonobiome: 0.31, observation-level: 0.70; B: sovereign states: 0.68, TDWG continent: 0.62, zonobiome: 0.36, observation-level: 0.44.
