<p>Our regression models show that the global RRN is determined by an intricate mix of biogeographical, environmental and socio-economic variables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Current values of socio-economic factors (per-capita GDP, population density, proportion of agricultural land) that reflect the intensity of anthropogenic disturbances and propagule pressure (

 </xref>) are particularly strong predictors of RRN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). With regard to biogeographical factors, we find a strong island–mainland difference, with islands in the southern hemisphere having higher RRN than those in the northern hemisphere. Conversely, for mainland regions, there is no difference between hemispheres, and there is also no significant difference in RRN between the Old and New World. With respect to climate, the relationship of RRN to mean temperature is unimodal with the highest values of RRN found in regions in the mid-temperature range (e.g. Mediterranean and warm-temperate regions). Furthermore, although humid islands have lower RRN than more arid islands, there was no corresponding effect for mainland regions (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>). The importance of other factors in explaining RRN also differs substantially between island and mainland regions. Greater topographic heterogeneity (measured as the standard deviation of elevation within a region) is related to higher RRN on islands, but to lower RRN in mainland regions. This indicates that mountainous regions on mainlands harbour relatively fewer naturalized plants than lowlands, while this is not the case for islands. For islands, increasing distance to the nearest continent increases RRN, while year of pre-historic and of modern colonization show no effect.
