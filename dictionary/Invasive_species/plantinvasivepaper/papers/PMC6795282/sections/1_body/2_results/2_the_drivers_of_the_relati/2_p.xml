<p>The RRI also shows substantial differences between mainland and island regions, but these patterns are partly driven by other factors than in the case of RRN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). For RRI of both mainland regions and islands, indicators of human pressure (per-capita GDP and proportion of agricultural land) are highly important predictors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, RRI increases with increasing proportion of agricultural land in mainland regions, but not on islands (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>). Higher topographic heterogeneity decreases RRI, both in mainland regions and on islands, indicating that mountains—which are less modified by humans—have lower proportions of invasive alien species. In contrast to plant naturalizations, average annual temperature has a marginal effect on RRI on both island and mainland regions. Isolated (sub)tropical islands show the highest RRI of all regions as exemplified by Hawai’i, Mauritius and the Seychelles.
