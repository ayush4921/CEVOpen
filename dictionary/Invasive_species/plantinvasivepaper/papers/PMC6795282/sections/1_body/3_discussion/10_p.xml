<p>While our analyses are based on a unique and robust data set, they also have specific limitations that warrant discussion. Since we lack explicit data on propagule pressure and colonization pressure for plants, we use proxy variables (e.g. human population density, per-capita GDP). Propagule pressure and colonization pressure are known to be key factors for explaining the success of alien plants and should thus be taken explicitly into account to disentangle region invasibility and invasion success as measured with the metrics we have used here (

However, data that allow direct quantification of propagule pressure (e.g. numbers of introduced propagules or plants, number of introduction events) and colonization pressure (number of introduced species) are not available for plants on a global scale, and even largely absent for smaller regions. Thus, using proxy variables for propagule and colonization pressures is currently the best possible approach. Further, the addition of explanatory variables that might allow to capture currently under-investigated potential drivers of global plant invasions (e.g. improved measures of land-use intensity and colonization pressure) might allow for more nuanced insights into invasions; however, gaps and biases in available data have to be overcome to make it possible. Finally, sampling intensity varies between regions and influences recorded numbers of naturalized and invasive plants. While such variation in sampling intensity cannot be completely excluded, the GloNAF database is by far the most complete source using a wide range of data sources and following standardized criteria (
