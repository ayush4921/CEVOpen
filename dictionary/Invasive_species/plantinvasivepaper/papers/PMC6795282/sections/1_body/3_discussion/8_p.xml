<p>The relative importance of physical environmental factors declined from ~30 % of the explained variation for RRN to ~20 % of the explained variation for RRI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Warm-temperate and sub(tropical) regions exhibit the highest RRN compared to regions in the tropics or in cooler regions, whereas temperature has a marginal effect on the RRI on islands and in mainland regions. In addition, humidity plays an important role in explaining RRN on islands. This indicates that climate is an important filter for the relative richness of alien plants, in particular for naturalized species.
