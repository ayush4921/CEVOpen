<p>We found no significant differences in RRN and RRI between the Old and New World, adding a new perspective to the expectation of 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">di Castri (1989)</xref> that Europe is predominantly an exporter of alien species, at least if native species richness is considered (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Lonsdale 1999</xref>). At least in the recent decades, Europe has been a net importer of alien plant species (

 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">van Kleunen 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)
 </xref> that Pacific islands—which are mostly located on the southern hemisphere—have received many more naturalized plants than they have exported to other regions.
