<p>Our analysis yields the first global-scale insights into the patterns of the relative richness of naturalized and invasive plant species compared to native species richness and the underlying factors. We found that both RRN and RRI are substantially higher on islands compared to mainland regions, and that on more than a quarter of the islands, naturalized alien species numbers already exceed the size of the native species pool. This pattern in relative richness of alien plant species is distinct from the one of absolute alien plant species richness (
