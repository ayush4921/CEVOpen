<p>We selected indicators of human socio-economic activities that are known to affect alien species invasions: land use, i.e. the proportion of agricultural land (

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Klein Goldewijk 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). This is a spatially (5ʹ longitude/latitude grid) and temporally high-resolution data set representing 12 000 years (10 000 BC to 2000 AD) of human-induced global land-use change. Data on current climatic conditions (mean annual temperature, mean precipitation) were extracted from the WorldClim database (
