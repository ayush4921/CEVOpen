<p>To avoid the influence of different interpretations of the term invasive and to ensure a geographically balanced sampling, we based our consensus list of invasive alien plant species on three global data sources which contain standardized information on invasiveness: (i) the CABI Invasive Species Compendium (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cabi.org/isc/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cabi.org/isc/</ext-link>), which contains 672 plant data sheets with information on invasiveness in national and subnational regions, (ii) the ISSG Global Invasive Species Database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd</ext-link>), which contains information on invasiveness of 2530 plant species, and (iii) the invasive plant species database by 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Weber (2017)</xref> with information on 107 invasive plant species. By using these global data sources, we are convinced that remaining uncertainties (e.g. different interpretations of invasiveness) are moderate. We extracted invasive plant species from these three data sources, standardized their scientific names (see below) and then built a consensus list for each GloNAF region including the invasive species recorded in these data sources. This approach yielded data of invasive alien plant species numbers for 359 regions of the world.
