 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Pyšek

 </xref>). In total, GloNAF includes 1082 regions with a varying degree of completeness of information. In many cases, regions with different degrees of spatial resolution overlap or are nested (e.g. US federal states nested in the USA). Therefore, we have selected a subset of 838 spatially non-overlapping regions (composed of 495 continental regions such as countries or federal states, and 343 islands) based on data availability and the criterion of highest available spatial resolution. For 761 regions there is information on naturalized plant species richness, and for 359 regions on invasive plant species richness (

While the number of regions containing data on invasive species is substantially smaller because of a lack of data mostly for smaller subnational regions and islands, global data coverage remains high (c. 90 % of global terrestrial area) (cf.
