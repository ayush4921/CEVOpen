<p>For relative importance analyses, we grouped all base and higher-order terms of a predictor and performed an 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> partitioning by averaging over orders (
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Lindeman 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1980
 </xref>) using the function 
 <italic>calc.relimp</italic> from the R-package 
 <italic>relaimpo</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Gr√∂mping 2006</xref>). For variation partitioning based on adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, we defined three major groups of variables (again including all higher-order terms of predictors), comprising (i) all biogeographic variables; (ii) all physical environment variables; and (iii) all socio-economic variables. Mainland vs. island region and region area were used as core predictors included in all predictor subsets fitted for these analyses and ensured that interaction terms were supplemented by their respective base 
 <italic>terms.</italic>
