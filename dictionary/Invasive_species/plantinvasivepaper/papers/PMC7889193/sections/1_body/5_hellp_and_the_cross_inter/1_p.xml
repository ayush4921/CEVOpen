<p>In addition to HELLF and HET-S, HELLP constitutes a third amyloid-activated cell-death execution protein of 
 <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>. The 
 <italic>hellp</italic> gene occurs in a two-gene cluster immediately adjacent to a gene encoding an NLR termed PNT1 displaying an N-terminal PP-motif, a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation domain of the NB-ARC type and a C-terminal TPR domain (tetratricopeptide repeats) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). The PP-motif region of HELLP forms a prion termed [π] and induces toxicity of full-length HELLP. The N-terminal PP-motif region of PNT1 also forms a prion and similarly induces toxicity and membrane localization of HELLP. Importantly, there is no cross-seeding between the respective prions formed by the HET-S, HELLF and HELLP PFDs (respectively [Het-s], [ϕ] and [π]). This absence of cross-seeding would indicate that NWD2/HET-S, FNT1/HELLF and PNT1/HELLP correspond to three parallel independently regulated cell death pathways, in which each NLR induces activation of only its cognate execution protein, as opposed to branched pathways where a given NLR could also induce other cell-death execution proteins. This last situation, at least based on bioinformatic predictions, seems however to occur in other species for which NLRs displaying similar N-terminal motifs are predicted to activate several distinct cell-death execution proteins (encoded by unlinked genes) [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While, the similarity of the PP-motif with the RHIM motif was noted previously this new study establishes now a functional link between RHIM and PP. Indeed, RHIM motifs of the human RIP1 and RIP3 kinases were found to behave as prions when expressed in Podospora and these prions termed [Rhim] show partial cross-seeding with [π] prions. Cross-infections are however not as efficient as in the case of homotypic [π]/[π] interactions or interactions between different [π] prions of fungal origin. These observations (in agreement with the fact that the sequence signatures of the PP and RHIM-motif differ) suggest that while there exists some level of structural relation between RHIM and PP-amyloids there must also exist marked differences lowering the cross-seeding ability. Nevertheless, the partial cross-seeding between RHIM and PP strengthens the hypothesis that these two motifs are evolutionarily related and that this type of motif has a long evolutionary history as amyloid signalling motif, involved in regulated cell death. The alternate explanation for this sequence similarity would be convergent evolution. But this hypothesis is challenged by the sequence diversity of amyloid motifs as found in fungi and bacteria (as developed below) which indicates that there are multiple evolutionary solutions to the problem of generating a short prion amyloid signalling motif (rather than a unique motif onto which different evolutionary paths would necessarily converge).
