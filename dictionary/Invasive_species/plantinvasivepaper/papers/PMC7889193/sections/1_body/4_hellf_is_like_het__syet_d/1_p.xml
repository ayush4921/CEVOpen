<p>Accumulation of sequenced fungal genomes allowed for the identification of hundreds of HeLo domain-containing proteins, homologous to HET-S/HET-s. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analyses resulted in the discovery of 155 homologs carrying PFDs constituted of two pseudo-repeats (R1 and R2) – an organization similar to the HET-s PFD. The pseudo-repeats (of about 21 amino acids of length) of these 155 PFDs shared sequence homology with one strongly conserved glycine residue, forming a functionally important β-arch for the [Het-s] prion, and a general pattern of hydrophobic-polar residues [

Although the HRAMs are defined by a small number of strongly conserved positions – carrying HRAM-specific residues – it has been hypothesized that the motifs adopt a common amyloid fold, structurally related to the HET-s β-solenoid.
