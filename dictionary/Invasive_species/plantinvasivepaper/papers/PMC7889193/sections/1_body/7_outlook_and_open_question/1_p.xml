<p>We discuss here recent findings concerning the molecular mechanisms of NLR-associated amyloid signal transduction [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the evolutionary history of this class of functional amyloids [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We reflect on the origin of a signal-transducing paradigm, where signal transmission is achieved through ‘structural templating’ (or replication of a protein fold), from the early observation of non-Mendelian inheritance phenomena in 
 <italic>P. anserina</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], through the discovery and characterization of the [Het-s] prion [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], to the very recent identification of signal-transducing amyloids in multicellular prokaryotes [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Parallel important work on RHIM and RHIM-like amyloid signalling motifs in mammals, viruses and flies further stresses the general importance of these mechanisms of signal transduction in immune pathways [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
