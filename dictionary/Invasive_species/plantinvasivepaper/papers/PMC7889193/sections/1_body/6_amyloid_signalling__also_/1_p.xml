<p>It is important to note that the fungal amyloid NLR-signalosomes (and NLRs in general in fact) appear as far as it can be estimated from current genomic coverage limited to filamentous fungi [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Genomes of unicellular (ascomycete and basidiomycete) yeasts species do not display genes encoding amyloid signalling motifs or NLRs as identified in filamentous fungi. This is consistent with the proposed role of these NLRs in regulated cell death in the context of host-defence. While it is clear that unicellular species may also display regulated cell death pathway, immune cell death makes immediate sense in the context of multicellularity. In this context, it is of note that some bacterial proteins received a PROSITE annotation with RHIM motifs. These annotations due to the small size of the motif signature could represent false positives or 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> hits oras sequences analogous to animal or viral RHIM motifs. This observation primed a bioinformatic quest for related sequences in prokaryotic genomes [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Specifically, it was noted that the RHIM-related motif occurs in a genomic setting reminiscent of the gene organization of fungal amyloid signalosomes, that is in gene clusters associating an NLR-encoding gene and a second gene, encoding a potential effector protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, tentative amyloid signalosomes were identified based on these criteria of resemblance in overall architecture to fungal amyloid signalosomes. Amyloid motifs were clustered according to sequence similarity into 10 families designated BASS (for 
 <underline>b</underline>acterial 
 <underline>a</underline>myloid 
 <underline>signalling s</underline>equences). These BASS motifs occur in proteins encoded by adjacent or overlapping genes at the N-terminus of NLRs and at the C-terminus of a protein domain termed BELL (for bacterial domain analogous to HELL). This small domain predicted to form an Î±-helical bundle with a hydrophobic transmembrane helix shares some sequence features with the fungal HeLo and HeLo-related domains and homologous domains involved in the control of regulated cell death in animals and plants. However there is no direct detectable sequence homology between the BELL and HeLo domains, therefore functional and structural characterization of these domains are required to precisedefine its relation to HeLo. It is currently hypothesized that BELL functions analogously as a membrane-targeting cell death-inducing domain. Interestingly as described in fungi where amyloid signalling motifs occur most frequently but not exclusively in HeLo-related domains (HeLo, HELL and sesA), the BASS-motifs do not occur only in association with BELL domains but also less frequently in association with other domains that have been implicated in host defence such as CHAT protease domains (Caspase HetF Associated with Tprs) or bacterial TIR domains (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor). The classification as 10 families is likely to represent a conservative estimate as a cut-off for the number of occurrences has been applied in the motif identification process. A lower cut-off or future expansion in genome coverage might increase the number of BASS families. Based on the current estimates however, there appears to be a greater diversity of amyloid signalling motifs in bacteria than in fungi, which in turn display more motif families than metazoans. This distribution is not surprising considering the differences in global phylogenetic diversity in these lineages and should probably not be taken as an indication that this form of signalling has experienced greater evolutionary success in multicellular bacteria than in fungi or metazoans.
