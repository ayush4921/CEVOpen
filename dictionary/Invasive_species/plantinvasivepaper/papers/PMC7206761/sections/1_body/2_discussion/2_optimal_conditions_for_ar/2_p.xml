<p id="Par17">Seed survival curve typically shows a lag phase before seed viability starts to decline rapidly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This was the observed response for 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds to selected artificial aging conditions, in both the analysis of seed viability (which took two working days in a 3 days’ time interval) and seed germination (which took 70 days of germination control every 3 days) coinciding in duration of the lag phase and survival loss in the two 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> populations. Viability measures may be equally accurate and may be less time-consuming than germination measurements, as also exposed in Xu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Although both populations showed similar seed viability (around 70-80%), population 2 showed a 25% germination, revealing that 45% of viable seeds did not germinate, which may correspond to dormant seeds. Viability test is also preferable in comparison to germination test as it reflects seed lot viability regardless of their dormant state [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The characterization of the tipping point in the modeled sigmoidal curve of viability loss before the sharp decline is essential, corresponding to exhaustion after the resistance phase in seed stress responses, characterized by a failure of protection and repair and critical cell death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. To characterize the duration of the resistance phase, L
 <sub>5</sub> (the aging time when 95% of the initial viable seeds remain viable) is here proposed. Company et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] have proposed P
 <sub>20</sub> (the aging time to decrease a 20% seed survival) to characterize the first survival loss in the curve but this measure may fall very close to the L
 <sub>50</sub> and will not provide new information. The aging time that causes a 50% decrease in seed survival has been largely accepted as a measure of seed longevity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Besides this measurement, the point where seeds no longer germinate (P
 <sub>0</sub>) was proposed by Dowsett et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] to be a better measurement of seed longevity due to the rapid decline in germination. In this way, Company et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] also proposed the use of P
 <sub>80</sub> (80% of seed mortality). We suggest that L
 <sub>95</sub> (the point where only 5% viability is observed) may be a better indication of the lethal seed aging time when estimating parameters from a fitted curve. The triplet of parameters: L
 <sub>5</sub>, L
 <sub>50</sub> and L
 <sub>95</sub> may provide information on sensitivity, medium aging time, and maximum resistance of a seed lot.
