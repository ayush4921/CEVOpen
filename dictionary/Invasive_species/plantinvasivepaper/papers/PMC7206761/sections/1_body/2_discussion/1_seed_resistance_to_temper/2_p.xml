<p id="Par15">When contrasting aging tolerance of 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds with conventional artificial aging protocols for commercial seeds, 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> appears to have an increased tolerance. Considering that the general temperature for artificial aging is between 41 and 43 °C for 48 to 72 h [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds may be considered resistant, as under those temperatures, viability was maintained above 80% at least for 10 days. Moreover, 80% of 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds survived after a heat shock of 3 h at 60 °C, whereas imbibed seeds from other species may not even survive a 30-min shock at this temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ex</italic>-
 <italic>situ</italic> seed longevity was found to be correlated with drought exposure during the post-zygotic phase in dry and warm environments using 16 closely-related populations of the genus 
 <italic>Silene</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Post-zygotic 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> phase occurs during summer, coinciding with low water availability and the highest yearly temperatures, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] which may contribute to explain increased ex situ seed longevity in comparison with other commercial species subjected to similar AA tests.
