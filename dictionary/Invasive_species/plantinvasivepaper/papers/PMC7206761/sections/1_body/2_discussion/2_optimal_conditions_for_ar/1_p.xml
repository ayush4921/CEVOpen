<p id="Par16">The optimal conditions for AA test in 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> were selected considering speediness, simplicity and sensitivity. The chosen conditions for artificial seed aging were 55 °C over water (87% RH) using imbibed 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds. The chosen temperature and relative humidity offer the possibility to test seed longevity within a week, as longevity is lost in 3–5 days. Moreover, 55 °C constitutes the inflection point in the viability loss-aging time curve suggesting high sensitivity to changes in seed longevity at this temperature. Besides the advantageous temporal scale of using 55 °C and a water solution, it also requires less preparation than using a saturated salt solution and avoids the risk of salt crystallization over seeds. Finally, seed imbibition and disinfection did not lead to any significant difference and offered substantial practical benefits as seed softening, disinfection facilities and seed disposal in the aging containers pipetting seeds instead of nipping them one by one.
