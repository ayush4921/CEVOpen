<p id="Par18">Dowsett et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] suggested that artificial aging tests may have a valuable role in understanding the biology of weed species. Besides understanding their biology, artificial aging tests may contribute to design effective management policies and eradication strategies. Recently, Company et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] evaluated the potential competitive displacement of the invasive species 
 <italic>Cortaderia selloana</italic> over the native 
 <italic>Saccharum ravennae</italic> using seed germination and viability tests under AA conditions and revealed that no long periods of subsequent monitoring are needed after eradication of 
 <italic>C. selloana</italic>, as this species presented low seed longevity. The two 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> populations where the AA test was tested showed different seed longevities towards an increased seed vigor in population 1, that may require increased eradication efforts. Accelerated aging tests on 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> may allow rapid assessment by managers and policy makers of seedâ€™s vigor at different zones and may contribute to design effective monitoring programs taking into account seed longevity estimations with appropriated budget allocation. Moreover, post-eradication soil seed bank vigor monitoring may contribute to define re-invasion risks and estimate weed eradication programs [
