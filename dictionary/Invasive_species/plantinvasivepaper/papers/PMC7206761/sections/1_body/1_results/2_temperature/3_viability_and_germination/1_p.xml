<p id="Par11">The seed survival curves in terms of viability and germination tested in the two different populations of 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> triggered two differentiated responses. Initial seed moisture content was not significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05) between the two populations: with 13.54 ± 0.82% and 14.22 ± 0.64% in population 1 and population 2 respectively. Population 1 followed a sigmoidal pattern with an abrupt fall within the 40 and 80 aging hours range, whereas population 2 showed a slow viability loss without a resistance phase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Initial viability was found very high (around 70–90%), whereas initial germination percentage fell to 20% in Population 2. The viability loss was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of dying seeds in both populations (patchy and patchy-weakly embryos, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Those dying seeds were unable to germinate as shown by the null germination rates found after 72 aging hours (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Germination time was initially similar between the two populations and maintained at 40 days until 24 aging hours. Whereas population 1 maintained mean germination time after 48 aging hours, population 2 showed a significant decay at this time. Similarly, a strong decrease in the mean germination rate was observed past the 48 aging hours (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
