<p id="Par7">The different experimental conditions tested lead to the understanding of the importance of several factors determining artificial aging seed survival curves in 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic>. All artificial aging tested conditions lead to a loss in the initial seed viability, but its timing was strongly influenced by the induced conditions. When it comes to keeping the aging environmental stable, some treatments were found more feasible than others, which helped to decide the best artificial aging environment for 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds in terms of speed, feasibility and simplicity. The final aging protocol (resumed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was defined at 55 °C and 87% RH and revealed differential seed survival curves between the two tested natural populations.
