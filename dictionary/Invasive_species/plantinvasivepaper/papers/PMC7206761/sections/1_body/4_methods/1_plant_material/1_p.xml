<p id="Par21">A first lot of 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds was selected to test the aging conditions from a natural population growing in Premià de Mar (Spain, 41° 29′ 24.2″ N 2° 21′ 49.3″ E). Once aging conditions were set, seeds from two natural populations of 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> were selected because of their large number of individuals and their large seed availability (population 1: 41° 28′ 25.5″ N 2° 17′ 54.7″ E; population 2: 41° 28′ 30.3″ N 2° 18′ 04.6″ E). These populations were used to test the accelerated aging test. From each population, within the period of natural seed rain, 600 fruits were collected to ensure representativeness. Fruits were opened and all the obtained seeds were pooled (more than 10.000 seeds per population). Seeds were kept at darkness and room temperature until analysis (3–4 weeks). Prior to start the accelerated aging tests, seed moisture content (%) was measured for both populations as: FW − DW*100/DW, where FW stands for 50 seeds fresh weight and DW for those 50 seeds dry weight (obtained after 72 h at 70 °C) with five replicates. In the two populations, accelerated aging through viability tests and germination was tested as described in the following sections.
