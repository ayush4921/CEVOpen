<p id="Par24">The role of aging temperature, RH and seed imbibition and disinfection on the seed survival curve in terms of seed viability was tested. The general aging procedures suggest the use of 41–43 °C in a high humidity environment for a specified duration (48–72 h) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, seeds from some Aizoaceae species are known to resist even higher temperatures for a short period of time [

Considering this, aging was tested at the following spectrum temperatures: 43, 45, 50, 55, 60, 95 °C using a laboratory oven under high humidity conditions using distilled water aging solution inside the containers that generated an atmosphere of 87% RH.
