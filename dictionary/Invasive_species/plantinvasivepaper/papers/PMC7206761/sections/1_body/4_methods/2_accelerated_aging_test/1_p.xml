<p id="Par22">Different containers were tested regarding their surface/volume ratios to maximize seed disposition and effectivity and preservation of the aging conditions. It was concluded that a commercial polypropylene hermetic container of 1.1L capacity with a 20 × 5 cm surface (PlasticForte, Spain) was ideal to generate a controlled atmosphere that maintains the desired RH and hold the seeds at a determined point with 70% of the capacity filled with aging solution (Fig.
