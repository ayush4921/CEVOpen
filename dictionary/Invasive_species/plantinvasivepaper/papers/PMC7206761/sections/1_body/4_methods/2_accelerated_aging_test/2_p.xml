<p id="Par23">The preparation of the aging containers was performed as follows: first, containers and sized meshes were disinfected with 70% ethanol and filled with 700 ml of aging solutions: water or NaCl saturated solution (See relative humidity experiment below). Mesh was fixed using masking tape. Seeds were submerged in 0.1% bleach for 30 s and 10% ethanol for 30 s more and washed multiple times with distilled water. Containers were only opened when the aging treatment ended at the chosen time: from 3 to 18 days. At that moment, seeds were prepared for the viability test as described in the succeeding sections. Zero aging hours corresponds to viability (through tetrazolium viability test) or germination assessment on non-artificially aged seeds for viability and germination tests respectively.</p>
