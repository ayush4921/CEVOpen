<p id="Par20">The inflection point found with temperature-aging time analysis led to the definition of a rapid and sensitive method for 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seeds artificial aging at 55 °C under 87% RH, where viability is lost within a working week, allowing managers to easily test seed vigor and longevity to assess invasive potential and contribute to design effective monitoring programs taking into account seed longevity estimations with appropriated budget allocation at different invaded areas. 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> seed thermosensitivity has been addressed suggesting that soil solarization treatments that mimic the described conditions may be effective for this species’ soil seed bank eradication. The optimization of artificial aging tests in non-crop species may provide new insights into seed longevity regulation and develop efficient management practices for ex situ germplasm conservation.
