<p>Field investigations were performed in the LTDB in July 2010, August 2014, and from June to October 2018. We did not use snorkels or scubas or other professional diving equipment during our investigation. Fortunately, the ponds, lakes, channels, or rivers in our investigations are not deep. For example, the average depth of the largest lake in the LTDB, Lake Taihu, is only 1.9 m, allowing us to use free-diving to conduct our investigation without rakes to minimize sampling errors. The sampling quadrats were randomly selected, with an area of 1 Ã— 1 m
 <sup>2</sup>, and were approximately 5 km apart (

Location information, water properties, habitat types, and surrounding terrestrial vegetation types were recorded. Plant specimens were collected, classified, and then identified according to the

Water quality indicators including the pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and salinity were determined by a YSI multiparameter water quality analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, United States). The sample information is listed in the
