<p>The relative coverage (RC) and relative abundance (RA) of each species in a sampling plot were measured. The RC was estimated by visual assessment, and a species’ RC = projective coverage/all projective coverage, and a species’ RA = number of a species/numbers of all species in a sampling plot. The RC and RA of a species were calculated in every individual sampling plot, and their sums were used to calculate the relative importance value (RIV). The species’ relative frequency (RF) was calculated as RF = number of a species/number of all plants in all sampling plots of a specific year. The RIV of a species, that is, dominant advantage species index, is the sum of the species’ RCs and RAs in all sampling plots and RF of a specific year according to the following formula (
