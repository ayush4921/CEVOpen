<p>The data were tested to meet the assumptions of a normal distribution and homoscedasticity of variances before the statistical analysis, and these assumptions were verified by the Shapiro–Wilk test and Levene’s test, respectively. A one-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) in plant biodiversity indices among the years 2010, 2014, and 2018. Simple linear regression models were constructed to analyze the relationships among the year, plant biodiversity indices, population, and GDP. Multiple regression models were constructed to analyze the relationships among plant biodiversity indices and the coverage of two invasive plants, 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> and 
 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic>. Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS Statistics 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). Mapping was performed in ArcGIS 10.3 (Esri Corp., Redlands, CA, United States).
