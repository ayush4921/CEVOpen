<p>A previous study showed a strong relationship between the human population and invasive plant species richness (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2009)</xref> showed that the GDP is the dominant factor in the initial blooming date and that the GDP per capita is the dominant factor for blooming duration in Lake Taihu. Similarly, the population and GDP had negative impacts on the aquatic plant biodiversity in the LTDB in this study (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Previous studies have shown that biodiversity loss reduces the ecosystem function (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Schnitzer et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), and the loss of aquatic plant biodiversity may change the freshwater ecosystem function in the LTDB permanently. Human activities are not well quantified; thus, we are not implicating the population or GDP growth as accounting for these changes. The good linear regressions of the aquatic plant biodiversity with the population and GDP data does not indicate that these characteristics are the exact causes of the two relationships; they are simply proper indicators that may provide awareness of the relationship between the biodiversity and anthropogenic activities.
