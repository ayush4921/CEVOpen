 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic> was introduced into China as an ornamental plant in the early twentieth century and quickly spread after its escape from domestic surroundings (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ding, 2019</xref>). The plant has a fast growth ability, high sexual and asexual reproductive capacities, a relatively short growth period, and low genetic differentiation, causing the plant to become the most widely distributed invasive aquatic plant worldwide (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN, 2013</xref>). The plant can cover the water surfaces to form a continuous floating mat, which is extremely harmful to aquatic habitats (

 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> using insects on have been proven to be successful in Louisiana, United States (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wainger et al., 2018</xref>), but a similar biocontrol method has not been applied in the LTDB, and the potential impact of introduced insects on the local environment remains unknown. 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bicudo et al. (2007)</xref> also showed that removal of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> from a reservoir was inefficient and led to a more turbid state.
