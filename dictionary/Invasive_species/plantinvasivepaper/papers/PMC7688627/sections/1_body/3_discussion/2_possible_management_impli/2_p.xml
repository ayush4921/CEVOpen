 <italic>Cabomba caroliniana</italic> is a perennial submerged plant species that is native to the United States and South America and is often introduced as an aquarium plant in the rest of the world (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">McCracken et al., 2013</xref>). The plant was introduced into China as an ornamental plant in the 1980s (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2003</xref>). Owing to its unique leaf shape and ease of cultivation, it was sold in aquarium markets in southern China and later turned into a weed that was difficult to control. The plant was widely used in the construction of wetland parks and river channel restoration in China due to its high water purification, pollution tolerance, and esthetic values before it was included on the list of invasive species (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2012</xref>). Currently, 
 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic> is in the early stage of its invasive outbreak in China, as it was only recently recognized as an invasive plant (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Ecology and Environment MEE, 2016</xref>). No extraordinary removal measures have been developed, and salvage requires a high amount of manpower. During this process, the species easily forms stem fragments that may produce new populations with water flow, benefiting its spread (

 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic> may indicate that the plant has not yet reached its distribution limit.
