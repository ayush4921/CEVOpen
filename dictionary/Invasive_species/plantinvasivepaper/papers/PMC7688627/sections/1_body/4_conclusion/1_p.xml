<p>In this study, the aquatic plant biodiversity in the LTDB was obtained in 2010, 2014, and 2018. The results showed that the aquatic plant dominance has transformed from native plants to the invasive plants 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> and 
 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic>. The aquatic plant biodiversity has experienced a decreasing trend, which may result in changes to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems in the LTDB. Additionally, the results of this study indicate that anthropogenic activities may have accounted for these changes.
