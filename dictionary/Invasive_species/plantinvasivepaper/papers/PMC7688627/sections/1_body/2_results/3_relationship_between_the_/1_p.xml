<p>As invasive 
 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic> and 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> had become the dominant aquatic species in the field quadrats in this study (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the linear regression of the coverage and the three α-species aquatic plant diversity indices of the two species in the aquatic plant sampling plots in 2010, 2014, and 2018 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The results indicate that with increasing coverage of the two plants, a negative trend appeared for the three α-species aquatic plant diversity indices regardless of the different years, and in some sampling plots, an invasive plant sometimes created a mono-species community.
