<p id="Par35">A great variety of medicinal plant species, mainly of Amazonian origin, is sold at the medicinal plant stalls of the VOP. Just 30 of the 126 plant species we encountered overlapped with Van den Berg’s earlier market survey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and we reported a larger number of species and vernacular names not previously recorded at VOP. Also, there was a greater number of introduced species than in 1984 (Van den Berg); however, if this is due to changed environmental factors or to differences in methodologies remains unclear. In the case of vernacular names, we found that vernacular names of plants did not change much in the last three decades. Furthermore, the diverse origin of vernacular plant names reflects how the need for words to describe natural phenomena in the colonized and foreign land impelled Portuguese-speaking peoples to use their own reference words to name native Brazilian plants, but not without taking up several Tupi plant names. Although we only found a few plants with African-derived names, African heritage was not that much embedded in terms of language, but in associated ceremonial uses. In summary, the species sold at the VOP and their vernacular names, as well as the uses associated with these species found in literature, attest to the fact that Belém harbors an intricate syncretism of ethnobotanical knowledge of indigenous, Afro-Brazilian and European origin.
