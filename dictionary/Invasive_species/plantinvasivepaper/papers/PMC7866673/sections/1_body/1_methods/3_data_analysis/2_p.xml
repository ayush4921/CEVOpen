<p id="Par17">To check the phytogeographical distribution, its status in Brazil, and the origin of each plant species, we used the Tropical Plant Database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], Missouri Botanical Garden Plant Finder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], GBIF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], PROTA4A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], PROSEA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], Van Andel et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], the Flora do Brasil 2020 online checklist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the Flora of China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], Kew Science Plants of the World online [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], the Catalogue of Life Annual Checklist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], Tropicos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the Naturalis Bioportal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and Herbarium voucher labels at MG. To compare our results to the VOP ethnobotanical inventory in the 1980s, we updated the taxonomy of the plant species found at the medicinal and religious plant stalls by Van den Berg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and checked if they were native or introduced. Comparing detailed medicinal or ritual uses of plants between 1984 and 2018 was not part of our research aims.
