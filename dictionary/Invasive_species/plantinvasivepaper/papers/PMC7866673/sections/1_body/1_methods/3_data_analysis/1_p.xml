<p id="Par16">We organized the following information for each recorded specimen in an Excel sheet: family, genus, species and collection number, vernacular name, language, plant part sold, status in Brazil (native or introduced). We verified the spelling of the names, first with the help of the vendors in the market, and later by using Corriente [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], Navarro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], DATAPLAMT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Dicionário ilustrado Tupi Guarani [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and Michaelis Dicionário Brasileiro da Língua Portuguesa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The Tupi and Portuguese dictionaries, along with the Online Etymology Dictionary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], Corriente [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], Sebba and Corbacho [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and Fernandes and Soares [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] were used to determine the etymology of the vernacular plant names. Names with Latin, Greek, Phoenician (in the case of Malaga), and Arabic etymologies were listed as Portuguese, as these words were implemented into Portuguese language prior to entering Brazilian Portuguese vocabulary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].
