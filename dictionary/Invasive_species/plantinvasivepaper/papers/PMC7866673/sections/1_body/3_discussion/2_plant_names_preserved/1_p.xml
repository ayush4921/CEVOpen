<p id="Par26">Of the species our survey shared with Van den Berg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the majority of vernacular names overlapped, indicating that there has been little change in names over three decades at the VOP. The small proportion that did not overlap could, again, be related to shifts in health perceptions and the occurrence of diseases over time. For example, in our study 
 <italic>Cissus verticillata</italic> was called, among other names, 
 <italic>insulina</italic>, which could be due to a higher occurrence of diabetes in Belém than at the time of Van den Berg’s study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, such differences in associated names were minor. This is in line with our expectations, as plant names tend to present a remarkable continuity over time, even for centuries, as was previously found in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and neighboring Suriname [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Acmella oleracea</italic> was named 
 <italic>jambu</italic> in our survey, and we traced back this name to circa 375 years ago in the 
 <italic>Historia Naturalis Brasiliae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], where it was documented for the same species, in a slightly different spelling (
 <italic>nhambí</italic> and 
 <italic>nhambu</italic>).
