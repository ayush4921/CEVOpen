<p id="Par32">Further, the vernacular name 
 <italic>manjerona-de-Angola</italic> has been documented before in Belém, but associated with 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L. instead of 
 <italic>Lippia thymoides</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A closely related plant, 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke, is used as medicine and in rituals along the western coast of Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. We suggest that 
 <italic>L. multiflora</italic> was replaced in use by 
 <italic>L. thymoides</italic> in Belém, and it is possibly used in Afro-Brazilian ceremonies.
