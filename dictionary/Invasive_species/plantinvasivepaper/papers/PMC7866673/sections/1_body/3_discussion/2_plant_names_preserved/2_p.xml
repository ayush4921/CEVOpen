Apparently, Belém’s cultural and linguistic context and its natural surroundings have not changed enough in the past decades to stimulate large shifts in vernacular plant names. Even though Belém is a large and expanding city, its surroundings are still inhabited by peoples who have valued and traded in these herbal medicines in the past decades. Their ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants, including vernacular names, is an essential element to their survival and a source of income. Thus, as people worked with these medicinal plants consistently over the past decades, and languages remained the same, it resulted in the preservation of these vernacular names.
