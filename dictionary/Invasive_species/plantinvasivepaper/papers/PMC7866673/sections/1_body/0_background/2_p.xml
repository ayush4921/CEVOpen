<p id="Par10">There has been an increasing number of ethnobotanical market surveys in the past decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although there are a number of studies that compare different markets to each other in terms of availability of plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], few studies have repeated ethnobotanical surveys in markets that were already monitored decades before to examine changes in species composition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Likewise, few market surveys have included an analysis of vernacular names of medicinal species being sold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The availability of plant products at markets changes over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], indicating the importance of periodically conducting market surveys for a more complete picture of plant availability and to assess possible impacts of social and environmental factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the analysis of vernacular names associated with plant species can inform us more about people’s cultural and botanical history in the study area [
