<p id="Par11">The famous open-air market Ver-o-Peso (VOP) is located in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River in the state of Pará, Brazil. This popular market functions as a source of medicinal plants for nearby smaller markets and is known for its wide variety of herbal medicine [

This study provided an overview of the most popular species; however, this approach possibly underestimated the total medicinal species composition of the market. Furthermore, it remains unknown to what extent the botanical composition of this major Amazonian market has changed over the past 34 years.
