In particular, root extracts significantly reduced the carbon source utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers, but enhanced phenolic acid.

The mechanisms underlying successful plant invasion is a long-standing topic which is debated in ecology [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The theory of &#x02018;novel weapon hypothesis&#x02019; (NWH) states that plant invasive success depends upon the ability to release novel phytochemicals into the invaded community [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to the NWH, invasive success depends on plant biochemical weapons, including allelopathic and antimicrobial root exudates, that directly inhibit native plant growth or mediate new plant&#x02013;soil microbial interactions. Today, allelopathic effects of invasive species on co-occurring native plants are widely recognized as the major factors responsible for successful invasion in plant communities [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the large number of previous studies investigating the allelopathic potential of invasive plants [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it is unclear about the role soil properties and microbial community play in mediating the impact of invasive species on plants. Addressing the effects of alien invasion on soil biota may improve our understanding of the key role soil organisms play in ecological systems, mediating biotic interactions.</p><p>It is important to notice that aboveground and belowground systems are not closed and isolated compartment, but they are rather linked together, exchanging energy and materials. Soil microbes play a crucial role in soil nutrient cycling and soil health [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Invasive plants can outcompete and displace native species thanks to allelopathy, which changes soil conditions via underground root exudates [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Invasive species root allelochemicals released into the soil can change soil properties, in turn affecting the composition and diversity of soil microbial community [<xref rid="pone.0246685.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the effects of root allelochemicals from invasive plants on the soil physical and chemical properties and soil microorganisms in order to improve our understanding of plant invasion mechanisms. Yet, we have a limited knowledge of the relative contribution of direct and indirect allelopathic effects between invasive and other species.</p><p><italic>Rhus typhina</italic> L.

We highlight that interactions between plants and soil microbes are critical for the successful invasion of alien plant species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Liang Jin and Jianfeng Zhang for providing valuable comments on this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0246685.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Vitousek</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>. <article-title>Biological invasions and ecosystem processes: towards an integration of population biology and ecosystem studies</article-title>. <source>Oikos</source>. <year>1990</year>; <volume>57</volume>, <fpage>7</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>13</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/978-1-4612-4018-1-17</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0246685.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Elton</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name>. <source>The ecology of invasions</source>. <year>1958</year>; <publisher-loc>London.

Authors use a water extract from R. typhina roots. The extract was obtained after grinding the dried roots, incubating the root powder in water for 48 h under shaking, concentrating the extract in a rotary evaporator and freeze drying. The extract was then used to prepare solutions at different concentrations. Solutions were used to water pots containing plants. All the following analyses (plant growth, soil properties, microbial community diversity) were done on soil and plants sampled from these pots.</p><p>The work is well described; however, I have a big concern about the pertinence of using the root extract.</p><p>Author should explain how this root extract added to the soil can mimic what R. typhina is really releasing in the soil during its growth. In fact, the extract contains the molecules that water could extract from the whole root, but there is no proof that those molecules are the ones that R. typhina roots exudate in the soil. In the introduction, authors cite the &#x0201c;novel weapon hypothesis&#x0201d; and say that &#x0201c;Our results support the &#x02018;novel weapons hypothesis&#x02019;&#x0201d;. The cited hypothesis is proposed by Callaway and Ridenour (2004) who say &#x0201c;that some exotics transform from native weaklings to invasive bullies by exuding biochemicals that are highly inhibitory (allelopathic) to plants or soil microbes in invaded communities&#x0201d;. The hypothesis is based on molecules released as exudates. Also, the cited works in the discussion are about root exudates, rhizospheric soil, leaf leachates. Authors describe the effects on T. erecta growth and on soil bacteria, but those effect are due to molecules extracted from roots non exudated by roots. There is a big difference between root exudates and root extract.</p><p>Also, the choice of the control is not convincing. In my opinion, a more appropriate control would be not water but root extract from a plant that do not have an allelopathic effect on T. erecta, like one historically living in the same habitat. Authors should be sure that the effect on soil microbial activity is due specifically to R. typhina molecules and not to a general shift in microbial population due to the addition to the soil of any root extract.</p><p>In some points of the discussion authors over-interpret their data:</p><p>lines 202-203: they state &#x0201c;Taken together, our results indicate how allelopathy impacts both plant and soil community, revealing that plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions can mediate invasion success&#x0201d;. I agree on the first part on the sentence, since root extract do have an effect on plant growth and on microbial population. However, data do not help us understanding whether the effect on plant is direct or mediated by microbes.</p><p>Line 204: &#x0201c;our results show that plants have the potential to alter soil&#x0201d;: this sentence is misleading: written like this means that plants, in their active growth, can alter soil, but results are on root extract not on exudates.</p><p>Lines 206-207. &#x0201c;This study suggests that invasive species can increase their own fitness relative to other plant species by modifying soil conditions and microbial community&#x0201d; and Lines 238-239 &#x0201c;are the main factors shifting soil microbial activity and mediating the impact of invasive plants on the growth of other plants.&#x0201d; Again, there is not proof in the work that effect on plants is either direct or mediated by other factors.</p><p>Citation of literature is sometimes not appropriate</p><p>Line 209: Tian et al 2017: this work is about the effect of N fertilisation on soil microbial community, not on allelopathy</p><p>Lines 226-228: &#x0201c;These results are partially in agreement with previous studies indicating that root extracts serve as soil carbon substrates for specific soil microbial communities (Fan et al. 2010, Wu et al. 2013, Li et al. 2017)&#x0201d;. None of these cited papers deal about root extracts: they describe works on exudates and rhizospheric soil.</p><p>Minor points</p><p>Line 41: either remove &#x0201c;is&#x0201d;, or add &#x0201c;which&#x0201d; before &#x0201c;is&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 64: Substitute &#x0201c;As&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;It is&#x0201d; or rephrase the sentence</p><p>Line 98: &#x0201c;five plant&#x0201d; modify in &#x0201c;five plants&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 137: remove &#x0201c;in&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 138: change &#x0201c;concentration extracts&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;extract concentrations&#x0201d;</p><p>Lines 146-147: according to Table 1, plant height is not significantly different from control at 10 mg/mL.</p><p>Line 164: table 2 shows soil properties data not AWCD.</p><p>Line 230: Olchowik et al. 2012 demonstrated the presence of tannins in leaves: there is no indication of their presence in roots</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manuscript Invasive species allelopathy decreases plant growth and soil microbial activity aims at demonstrating the capaicty of the invasive shurb R. typhina to inihibit other plants growth to invade the soil. Data reported support the hypothesis that R. typhina roots extracts inhibited T. erecta growth via altering the physico-chemical soil conditions, as well as the microbial community.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and presented in intellegible fashion. Beside I am not English mother-tongue, it seems that the manuscript has been written in standard English.</p><p>The conclusion are supported by the reported data.</p><p>However more information on the conditions in which T. erecta has been grown during the experimental condition,such as light humidity, temperature, photoperiod.</p><p>More information about the use Community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) should be provided for reader who are not familiar with such method.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
