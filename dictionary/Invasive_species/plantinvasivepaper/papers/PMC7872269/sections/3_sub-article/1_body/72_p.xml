<p>Reviewer #2:Â The manuscript Invasive species allelopathy decreases plant growth and soil microbial activity aims at demonstrating the capaicty of the invasive shurb R. typhina to inihibit other plants growth to invade the soil. Data reported support the hypothesis that R. typhina roots extracts inhibited T. erecta growth via altering the physico-chemical soil conditions, as well as the microbial community.</p>
