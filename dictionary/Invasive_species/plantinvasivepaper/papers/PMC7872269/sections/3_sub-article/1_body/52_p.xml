<p>Reviewer #1:Â The aim of the work is to demonstrate the allelopathic effect of the plant Rhus typhina on Tagetes erecta and soil microbial population. Authors use a water extract from R. typhina roots. The extract was obtained after grinding the dried roots, incubating the root powder in water for 48 h under shaking, concentrating the extract in a rotary evaporator and freeze drying. The extract was then used to prepare solutions at different concentrations. Solutions were used to water pots containing plants. All the following analyses (plant growth, soil properties, microbial community diversity) were done on soil and plants sampled from these pots.</p>
