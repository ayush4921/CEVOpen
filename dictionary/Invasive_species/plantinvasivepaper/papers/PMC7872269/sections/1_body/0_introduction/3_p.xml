 <italic>Rhus typhina</italic> L. (Anacardiaceae) is a perennial shrub that make clones through production of underground root buds and forms large, dome-shaped canopies of a single genet, with progressively younger ramets developing around the periphery [

 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>typhina</italic> is classified as one of the most destructive invading exotic species and poses a great threat to terrestrial ecosystems due to his great ability to adapt and reproduce fast and its resistance to eradication once is established [
