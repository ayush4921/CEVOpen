<p>Invasive species degrade the environment, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem processes, threatening livelihoods worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying successful plant invasion is a long-standing topic which is debated in ecology [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The theory of ‘novel weapon hypothesis’ (NWH) states that plant invasive success depends upon the ability to release novel phytochemicals into the invaded community [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to the NWH, invasive success depends on plant biochemical weapons, including allelopathic and antimicrobial root exudates, that directly inhibit native plant growth or mediate new plant–soil microbial interactions. Today, allelopathic effects of invasive species on co-occurring native plants are widely recognized as the major factors responsible for successful invasion in plant communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the large number of previous studies investigating the allelopathic potential of invasive plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it is unclear about the role soil properties and microbial community play in mediating the impact of invasive species on plants. Addressing the effects of alien invasion on soil biota may improve our understanding of the key role soil organisms play in ecological systems, mediating biotic interactions.
