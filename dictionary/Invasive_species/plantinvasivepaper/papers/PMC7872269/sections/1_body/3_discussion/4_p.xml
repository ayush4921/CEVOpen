 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous experiments indicate that invasive plants increase utilization of nutrients with allelopathic substance that also inhibit native plant growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. According to this evidence, our study suggests that changes in soil pH, TN, SOC and EC are the main factors shifting soil microbial activity.
