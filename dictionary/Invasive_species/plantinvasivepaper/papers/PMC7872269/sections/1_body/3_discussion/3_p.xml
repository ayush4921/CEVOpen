AWCD reflects single carbon source utilization ability and metabolic activity of soil microbe, and the lower the value, the lower the metabolic activity of soil microorganism [

All six groups of substrate utilization are altered by root extracts, with carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers decreasing and phenolic acid increasing in treated soils. This indicates that soil microbial communities feed less on carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers but more on phenolic acid in soils with root extracts. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids are the two major types of phenolic acids produced by
