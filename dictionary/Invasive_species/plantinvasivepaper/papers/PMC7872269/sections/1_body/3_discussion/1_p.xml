<p>Our findings of allelopathic effects of invasive species on plant growth and soil microbial activity shed new light on the poorly understood mechanisms underlying the role plantâ€“soil interactions play in shaping invasion success. Invasive species root extracts decrease plant biomass, soil SOC and TN, increase soil EC and pH, and alter microbial carbon source utilization. Taken together, our results indicate how allelopathy impacts both plant and soil community further facilitates the successful invasion.</p>
