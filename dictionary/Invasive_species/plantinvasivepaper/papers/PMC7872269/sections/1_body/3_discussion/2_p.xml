<p>Consistent with previous studies [

 <italic>typhina</italic> may result in dramatic changes in soil community activity by alter soil properties, and in turn to alter the growth of other plants. According to the NWH, invasive species disturb native species growth via root allelopathy [
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], altering soil microbial communities [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Chemical allelopathy is suggested as a fundamental mechanism by which invasive plant species displace native ones [
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some studies found that successful invaders suppress neighboring plant species growth through allelopathy, via altering soil community’s composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Allelochemicals produced by alien invaders may disrupt regular decomposing processes in soil community when they are released into the novel ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study, conducted in controlled growth chambers, provides evidence that allelopathic effects change with concentration of root extracts. In particular, soil microbial community functional diversity, as characterized by CLPP, is sensitive to root extracts.
