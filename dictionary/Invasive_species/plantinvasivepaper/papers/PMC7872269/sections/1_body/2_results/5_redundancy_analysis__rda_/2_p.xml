<p>RDA analysis based on carbon sources and soil physicochemical characteristics under different concentrations of extracts was performed through the graph of triplots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246685.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Eigenvalues for the first, second, third and fourth axes were 0.5792, 0.2411 and 0.0845, respectively. Axis 1 explained most of the variation in soil microbial carbon utilization (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). All the soil data together could explain 91.9% of soil microbial carbon utilization variation (Monte Carlo permutation test with 999 permutation, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001). Conditional effects showed that the main factors affecting soil microbial carbon utilization were pH (51.8%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), SOC (22.4%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and EC (14%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). According to soil pH, the order of affecting soil microbial categorized carbon utilization by concentration of extracts was 10, 7.5, 2.5, CK and 5 mgÂ·mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. Results also showed that soil pH mainly decreased microbial utilization to Amino acids and Amines, and SOC mainly enhanced utilization of carboxylic acids, polymers and carbohydrates, and EC mainly positively affected utilization of phenolic acid (
