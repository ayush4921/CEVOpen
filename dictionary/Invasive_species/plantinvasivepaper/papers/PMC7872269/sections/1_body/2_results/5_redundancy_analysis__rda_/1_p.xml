<p>We report results of RDA in biplot graph with response variables (31 kinds of soil microbial carbon utilization) and explanatory variables (soil physicochemical characteristics) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246685.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Eigenvalues for the first, second, third and fourth axes were 0.5201, 0.2927, 0.0345, respectively. Axis 1 significantly explained most of the variation in soil microbial carbon utilization (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001). All the soil physicochemical characteristics could explain 85.20% of soil microbial carbon utilization variation (Monte Carlo permutation test with 999 permutation, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001). Conditional effects show that the main factors driving soil microbial carbon utilization were pH (32.3%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008), TN (29%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and EC (19.7%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).
