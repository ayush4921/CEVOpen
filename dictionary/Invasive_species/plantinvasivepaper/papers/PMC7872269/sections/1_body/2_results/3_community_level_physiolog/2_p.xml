<p>All 6 groups of carbon source were metabolized in Biolog Eco-plates in different concentrations of extracts (

 <italic>typhina</italic> roots significantly reduced the carbon source utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers, and significantly enhanced phenolic acid (all 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to control. Amino acids and amines firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing of extract concentrations (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The carbon source mostly used in controls was polymers and the least was phenolic acid, same patterns of response for phenolics acids than aminoacids. Among the treatments, phenolic acids were the most common, especially at 5 mg·mL
 <sup>-1</sup>, while amines were the least used, especially at 10 mg·mL
 <sup>-1</sup> (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
