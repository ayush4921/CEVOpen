<p>Average well color development (AWCD) was determined as follows: AWCD = Σ(C
 <sub>590</sub> –C
 <sub>750</sub>)/31. C
 <sub>590</sub> and C
 <sub>750</sub> are optical density value in 590 nm and 750 nm from each well, corrected subtracting the blank well (inoculated with distilled water) values from each plate well. Diversity indices of AWCD were calculated as Shannon index (
 <italic>H</italic> = -Σ(
 <italic>Pi</italic>×ln
 <italic>Pi</italic>)), Pielou evenness index (
 <italic>E</italic> = 
 <italic>H</italic>/
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> = 
 <italic>H</italic>/ln
 <italic>S</italic>), and Simpson diversity index (
 <italic>D</italic> = 1-Σ
 <italic>Pi</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>). 
 <italic>Pi</italic> = C
 <sub>590</sub>-C
 <sub>750</sub>/∑(C590—C
 <sub>750</sub>), 
 <italic>S</italic> were calculated as the number of oxidized carbon substrates (Qu et al. 2020).
