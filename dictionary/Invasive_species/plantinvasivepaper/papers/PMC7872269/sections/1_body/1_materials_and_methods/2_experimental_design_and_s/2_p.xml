<p>After 60 days, plant and soil samples were collected for analyses. Soil samples were screened through sieves with 2 mm mesh and divided into two parts after removal of coarse roots and stones. One part was air dried and used for physico-chemical analyses whereas the other one used for EcoPlates (Biolog, Hayward, CA, USA) and microbial activity analyses. All samples were stored at 4Â°C before analysis.</p>
