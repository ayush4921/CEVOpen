<p>While α-amylase is strongly inhibited by the samples including H-Anvi and T-Anvi with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.72 and 3.48 mg/mL, respectively. Notably, H-Anvi is recorded as over twice stronger than palmitic acid, a well-known α-amylase inhibitor. The extracts including E-Anvi and B-Anvi display insignificant suppression on α-amylase. At the concentration of 10 mg/mL, they exhibit the inhibition percentages of 31.93% and 17.52%, respectively. W-Anvi has no effect on α-amylase (
