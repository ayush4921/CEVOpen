<p>In the tyrosinase enzymatic assay, the results show that almost samples have inhibitory effects. Among them, the strongest sample is E-Anvi with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.58 mg/mL. The following samples including T-Anvi, H-Anvi, and B-Anvi have IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.57, 6.22, and 9.40 mg/mL, respectively. W-Anvi has no effect on the enzyme (
