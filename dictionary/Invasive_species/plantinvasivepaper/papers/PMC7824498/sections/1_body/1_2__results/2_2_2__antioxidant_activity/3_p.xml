<p>In the DPPH assay, all samples have scavenging effects on DPPH. In which, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are ranged from 13.96 to 386.91 µg/mL. H-Anvi and W-Anvi repeat the weakest activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 126.27 and 386.91 µg/mL, respectively. While T-Anvi and B-Anvi display similar activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of more than 30.00 µg/mL. Significantly, E-Anvi exhibits the highest scavenging capacity against DPPH with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 13.96 µg/mL, which is approximately twice stronger than BHT (
