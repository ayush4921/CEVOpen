<p>In the reducing power assay, by comparing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between samples and controls, we obtain that E-Anvi shows the most substantial power (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 124.11 µg/mL), 1.4-fold stronger than the positive standard, BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 175.52 µg/mL). The following extracts are T-Anvi (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 257.35 µg/mL) and B-Anvi (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 340.62 µg/mL). The weakest samples including H-Anvi and W-Anvi reveal trivial reducing power (
