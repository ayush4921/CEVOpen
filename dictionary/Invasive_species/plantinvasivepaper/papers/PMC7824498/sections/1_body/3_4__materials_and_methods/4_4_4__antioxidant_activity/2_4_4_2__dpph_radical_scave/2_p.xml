<p>The anti-radical (ABTS and DPPH) ability was evaluated following the below formula:
 <disp-formula>Anti-radical ability (%) = (C − S)/C × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>C: Absorbance of reaction with negative control (methanol) after subtracting control’s blank (without radical solution), S: Absorbance of reaction with sample/or positive control (BHT) after subtracting sample’s blank (without radical solution).
