<p>The in vitro α-amylase inhibition assay was determined according to the method reported by Quan et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For preparation, phosphate buffer saline (0.2 M, pH = 6.9) and α-amylase (5 units/mL in buffer), starch substrate (0.5% in distilled water), iodine (0.25 mM in distilled water) solutions were included. Samples/or controls were prepared in the buffer. Initially, the incubation of 40 µL of mixture including sample/or control and prepared enzyme (1:1, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) was conducted at 37 °C for 9 min. The enzymatic reaction on substrate was generated by providing 30 µL of starch working solution. The reaction was continued at 37 °C for 7 min before stopping by 20 µL of HCl (1 M). To detect the remaining amount of substrate in the final solution, one hundred microliters of prepared iodine solution were added. The final reaction mixture was recorded at 565 nm. DMSO (50% in buffer) was negative control and palmitic acid was standard inhibitor. The inhibition percentage was determined as follows:
 <disp-formula>% inhibition = S/C × 100
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula>S: Absorbance of reaction with sample/or inhibitor after subtracting an absorbance of the enzymatic reaction without inhibitor, C: Absorbance of reaction without sample/or control and enzyme after subtracting an absorbance of the enzymatic reaction without inhibitors.
