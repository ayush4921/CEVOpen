<p>The mass was scanned in the range of 29 to 800 amu. The results of chromatogram, mass spectrum (electron ionization), linear retention index (LRI), and Kovats index (KI) of each detected compound were collected. The outcomes were compared to the standard sources comprising the library of JEOL’s GC-MS Mass Center System Version 2.65a, and the online database of National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda MD, USA (Pubchem—

Based on the GC-MS results, palmitic acid was detected as the most dominant compound in H-Anvi. Therefore, a calibration curve applying different concentrations of palmitic acid standard (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) was established to determine the content of palmitic acid in 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic>. The result was expressed as milligrams per one gram of sample dry weight (mg/g DW).
