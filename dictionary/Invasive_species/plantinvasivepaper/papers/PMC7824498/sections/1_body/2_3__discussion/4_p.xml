<p>Besides the antioxidant activity, flavonoids in 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> may be a main contributor to anti-tyrosinase ability of the total crude and ethyl acetate extracts in this study (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Previously, flavonoids were recorded having inhibitory effects against tyrosinase through in silico and in vitro screenings [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, unlike the antioxidant capacities, the enzymatic reactions are much more complicated and difficult to predict, which are influenced by various features in chemical structures [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For example, the rings A and C, (-OH) substituent at the position of 7, and the ring B linked to (-OH) groups at the position of para or para and meta in the flavonoid structures lead to the competitive inhibition against tyrosinase [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the case of anti-α-amylase activity, the inhibition may depend on different factors such as the position of (-OH) substituents, methoxy groups, lactone rings, or the interaction between compounds in the mixture [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Via the results of α-amylase inhibitory assay (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the hexane extract from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> shows the strongest suppression. Thus, the GC-MS analysis was performed to find out the major compounds involving in the prevention against α-amylase in this extract. Among the most dominant compounds, palmitic acid shows the highest peak area and accounts for 0.86 and 0.05 mg per 1 g of 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> dry weight and hexane dried extract, respectively (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), whilst other compounds in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> were neither successfully isolated nor be purchased, thus need further clarification. Notably, palmitic acid is an acknowledged α-amylase inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], thus it was used as a positive control in this study. Remarkably, the hexane extract reveals over twice stronger inhibitory effect than palmitic acid by comparing their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Because palmitic acid is a major compound (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) in the plant, it is suggested that this compound may play an important role in the biological potential of the invasive weed, beside the α-amylase inhibitory effect as shown in this study. The hexane extract’s activity may be strengthened due to the interaction between four dominant compounds consisting of palmitic acid, γ-sitosterol, phytol, and 8-methyl-1-undecene (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In which, γ-sitosterol is also a high potential anti-diabetes substance, which has been affirmed through in vitro and in vivo tests on rats in recent studies [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, this compound may play an influential role in the anti-α-amylase ability of the hexane extract.
