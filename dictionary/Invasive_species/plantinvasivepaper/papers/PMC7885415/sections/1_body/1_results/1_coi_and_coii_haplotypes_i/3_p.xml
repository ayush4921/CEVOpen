<p id="Par17">A total of 450 COII sequences (518 bp) were obtained from the 463 BMSB individuals (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which formed 29 haplotypes including 20 novel and 9 previously reported (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). BLASTn search [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] showed that the new haplotypes did not share any identical sequences in the 518 bp overlap COII region with that of the previous reported sequences.
