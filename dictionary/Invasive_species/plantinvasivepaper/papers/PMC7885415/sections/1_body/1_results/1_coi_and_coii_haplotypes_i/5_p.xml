<p id="Par19">Overall, high haplotype diversity was observed in China. The main haplotypes from China were H1, H33, H22, H3 for COI and h3 and h1 for COII (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The predominant haplotypes from Japan were H23, H45, N22, N40 for COI and h11 for COII (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Outside of the native regions, low haplotype diversity was observed, and H1, H3 for COI, h1, h3 for COII were the main haplotypes detected in those countries. Only one haplotype of each (H1 and h1) was detected in Georgia, Romania, Turkey and the USA (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
