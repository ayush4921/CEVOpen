<p id="Par20">In total, 428 individuals were identified with both COI and COII sequences (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and thus used for COI-COII combined haplotype analysis. The combined COI-COII haplotype analysis produced 59 haplotypes, in which only five were previously reported and 54 were novel (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). All these newly identified haplotypes were detected in China and Japan except a single haplotype in Slovenia (N47h3). The predominant haplotype H1h1 (62.6%) was observed in all the countries except Japan (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The geographical distribution of the identified COI-COII combined haplotypes is shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. In the native countries of BMSB, high haplotype diversity was observed with 24 haplotypes in China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and 32 in Japan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), with no haplotypes shared between the two countries (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In comparison, out of the 32 haplotypes identified in Japan, 31 were uniquely detected in Japan, and one haplotype, H41h15 was shared with an individual from Hungary (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Similarly, 22 out of 24 haplotypes detected in China were unique, and two haplotypes (H1h1 and H3h3) were also predominantly shared with the BMSB samples from those invaded countries (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In the invaded countries, H1h1 was the predominant haplotype, identified in more than 90% of the studied samples from most of the BMSB-invaded countries, including Chile, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey and the USA (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
