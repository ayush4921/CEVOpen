<p id="Par22">In the neutrality test, the Fu’s Fs statistic values were very low in the two native countries of BMSB, China and Japan, with − 7.852 (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) while for the BMSB-invaded countries, Fu’s Fs statistic value was − 1.174 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) for group A (Chile, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey and the USA) suggesting that group A was under population expansion. In comparison, the haplotype diversity was slightly higher with an average of 0.63 for group B (Austria, Serbia, and Slovenia), but with Fu’s Fs values of 1.453 (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 10), indicating that group B was under bottleneck.
