<p id="Par25">The haplotype network of the BMSB individuals further revealed the widespread occurrence of H1h1 and H3h3, except the populations from Japan, whereas all the other haplotypes were mainly detected in the native countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The analyses showed that there were three ancestral lines found in this study namely h1, h3 and h11. Most of the other haplotypes mutated from these three lines with differences of several base pairs. Moreover, an interesting phenomenon was observed that some haplotypes (N3n3, N5n3, N4n4, N5n5) detected only in the Hainan population (China) was highly isolated and closer to Japanese populations rather than to Chinese populations. To further explore the distribution of those haplotypes, the combined COI and COII dataset from the present and previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] were analysed together and resulted in a total of 80 haplotypes. The haplotype network analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) indicated similar genetic relationships as previously reported except that a few BMSB specimens from Italy had close relationship with Japanese populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
