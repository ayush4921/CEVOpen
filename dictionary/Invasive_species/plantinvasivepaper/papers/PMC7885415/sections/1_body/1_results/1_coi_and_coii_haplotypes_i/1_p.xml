<p id="Par15">A total of 441 COI sequences (657 bp each) were obtained from 463 BMSB individuals collected from the 12 countries (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We identified 51 haplotypes using COI, consisting of 36 newly identified and 15 previously reported haplotypes (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). For the sequences sharing 100% identity in the same region (657 bp) with those previously reported, the same haplotype names were given while new names were given accordingly for the rest of the sequences obtained in this study. All the new haplotypes identified were confirmed by BLASTn search [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The result showed that all the new haplotypes were unique in the COI region (657 bp). Further analysis showed that the haplotype N22 shared the same sequences with two shorter reference sequences, KY710432 (651 bp) and KY710450 (648 bp). However, it is not clear whether the missing bases from the two reference sequences are the same or different from the sequence we obtained, thus the sequence was considered as a new haplotype. The analysis also indicated that it might not be accurate to assign the same haplotype name for the sequence with different length.
