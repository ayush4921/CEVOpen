<p id="Par18">The geographical distribution of the identified COI and COII haplotypes are shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Of the identified haplotypes, H1 (61.9% of the total individuals) and h1 (61.7% of the total individuals) were predominant for COI and COII, respectively, and were detected in all the countries studied except Japan (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Haplotypes H3 (7% of the total individuals) and h3 (16% of the total individuals) were the second most predominant haplotypes detected in China, Austria, Chile, Hungary, Italy, Serbia, and Slovenia. In addition, haplotypes H8 and H48 for COI were only detected in Austria. The newly identified haplotypes were mainly observed in the native countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a for China and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b for Japan) except N47 in Slovenia (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). All the novel COI and COII haplotypes identified were detected from the two native countries, China (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and Japan (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).
