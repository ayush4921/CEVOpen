<p id="Par16">There are three Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) for the COI sequences of BMSB specimens submitted in Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD)Â [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]: BIN AAM9563 (containing 682 sequences), ADT6053 (one sequence) and AAK5312 (six sequences). Further comparison with those COI sequences in BOLD showed that all the sequences obtained in this study belong to BIN AAM9563, with over 98% identity. In contrast, the sequences shared over 94 and 82% identity to the sequences of two other BINs, ADT6053 and AAK5312, respectively.
