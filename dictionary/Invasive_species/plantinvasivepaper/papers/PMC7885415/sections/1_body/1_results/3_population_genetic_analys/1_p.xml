<p id="Par21">Japan and China had the highest haplotype diversity (
 <italic>Hd</italic>), with 
 <italic>Hd</italic> values of 0.942 and 0.858, and nucleotide diversity (
 <bold>
  <italic>π)</italic>
 </bold> values of 0.00238 and 0.00327, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Outside of the native regions of BMSB, the highest haplotype diversity was observed in Austria (
 <italic>Hd</italic> = 0.686, 
 <bold>
  <italic>π</italic>
 </bold> = 0.00206), Serbia (
 <italic>Hd</italic> = 0.556, 
 <bold>
  <italic>π</italic>
 </bold> = 0.00095) and Slovenia (
 <italic>Hd</italic> = 0.514, 
 <bold>
  <italic>π</italic>
 </bold> = 0.00115). In contrast, little to no haplotype diversity was observed in the BMSB samples collected from Chile, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey and the USA. Therefore, two genetic groups were defined based on the 
 <italic>Hd</italic> values obtained from the haplotype analysis: group A (Chile, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey and the USA) and group B (Austria, Serbia and Slovenia). It is noteworthy that in Hungary five sampling sites were studied, of which at two sites no haplotype diversity was observed, while the other three sites showed variable diversity with an 
 <italic>Hd</italic> value from 0.038 to 0.5 and a 
 <bold>
  <italic>π</italic>
 </bold> value from 0.00085 to 0.0017036, with an overall 
 <italic>Hd</italic> value of 0.107 and a 
 <bold>
  <italic>π</italic>
 </bold> value of 0.00028. This indicates that the invasion of BMSB in Hungary may have come from genetically distinct populations.
