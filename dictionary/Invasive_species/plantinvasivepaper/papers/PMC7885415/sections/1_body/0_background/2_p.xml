<p id="Par13">BMSB is native to China (including Taiwan), Japan and the Korean peninsula [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and has invaded 30 countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] including most of the states in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], many countries in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Chile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Climate modelling predicted that New Zealand at high risk for BMSB establishment should a successful invasion occur [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The climatic suitability of this species is wide, ranging from 30 to 50 degrees of latitude, with an annual mean temperature range between 10 °C and 30 °C (NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostics Center, Boulder, Colorado). It covers wide geographical regions including northern Europe, north eastern part of North America, southern Australia, and the North Island of New Zealand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. BMSB has increasingly been intercepted at the border and post-border scenarios due to the rise of international travel and trade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] since 2005 when BMSB was first intercepted at the border of New Zealand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. BMSB is considered as “high risk” organism, and there were 1620 recorded interceptions of BMSB at the border of New Zealand since 2005 (accessed in June 2020) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As agricultural exports comprise a significant proportion of the New Zealand Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the establishment of the pest would be highly detrimental to the country. The study by New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) predicts a worst-case scenario of 3.6 billion New Zealand dollars in agricultural losses by 2038 if BMSB successfully establishes in New Zealand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to study the genetic diversity of BMSB to trace the origin of captured individuals to better manage the border biosecurity risks and predict the pathways for trade.
