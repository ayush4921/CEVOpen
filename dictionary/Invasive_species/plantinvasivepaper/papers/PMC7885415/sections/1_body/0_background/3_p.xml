<p id="Par14">Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence analysis is one of the most widely used methods to examine genetic diversity and determine the locality of origin of an invasive species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and has been applied in a number of studies for BMSB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Previous studies on BMSB populations from Asia and the USA have sequenced the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase II (COII) and the ribosomal 12S genes to trace the origin of the invading BMSB populations in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additional studies, focusing on BMSB populations in Europe, used Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], or in combination with the COII gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and revealed additional information on the genetic diversity of BMSB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of BMSB populations around the world, we collected BMSB adult specimens from different geographical locations, including the countries where BMSB is native to, China and Japan and the countries which have been invaded by the pest, such as the USA, Chile, and several European countries. In the current study, two mitochondrial barcoding genes, COI and COII, were sequenced from 463 BMSB specimens collected from 43 regions/provinces in 12 countries (2 native and 10 invaded) across four different continents to develop new insights into BMSB genetic diversity and their potential pathways of invasion.
