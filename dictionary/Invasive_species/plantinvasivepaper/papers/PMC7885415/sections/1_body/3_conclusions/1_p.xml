<p id="Par32">The present study has revealed genetic diversity among BMSB populations using combined COI and COII datasets and provided better understanding of their potential invasion pathways. The genetic diversity among the BMSB populations from the native regions was much higher than those from the BMSB-invaded countries. The haplotype analysis further indicated that the invasion of BMSB has occurred multiple times in the past, probably at least partially due to international trade and travel. BMSB populations from the invaded countries, such as Chile, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey, and the USA were genetically close, but well separated from the Chinese populations. However, the BMSB populations from Austria, Serbia and Slovenia were more closely related to the Chinese populations. The results indicated that some individuals of the recent invasions into Chile, Hungary, Georgia, Turkey, Romania and Italy potentially originated from the USA without ignoring the likely chances of possible invasions from China due to the presence of the ancestral predominant haplotype H1h1. Moreover, the BMSB populations from Austria, Serbia and Slovenia were possibly of recent invasions from China. In conclusion, we believe that the novel haplotype information and the genetic diversity among the global BMSB populations will lay down the foundation for future population genomic studies and could help in formulating effective BMSB management strategies. This study will also help in tracing the origin of BMSB intercepted at the border in those countries, such as New Zealand, where the species has not yet established.</p>
