<p id="Par31">This study further revealed that the predominantly common haplotypes H1h1 and H3h3 exist in China and the invaded countries. The reasons for this need further investigation, though one possibility could be due to the dominant distribution of these haplotypes in Asia, and thus they have higher chances to be transported passively to other regions. It is not clear whether there is a possibility that these BMSB haplotypes can adapt more easily to new environments than other haplotypes. Since the COI and COII haplotype analyses are only based on the information from the female lineages, further study on the genomic level using high-throughput sequencing techniques might be able to provide more information on the genetic diversity of the BMSB populations and may help clarify the past invasion scenarios in the future.</p>
