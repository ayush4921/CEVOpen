<p id="Par29">The haplotype diversity of BMSB from the native regions is much higher than that of the invaded populations. The haplotype diversity (
 <italic>Hd</italic>) of BMSB populations from China and Japan was 0.858 and 0.942, respectively, which clearly indicates that the genetic diversity of these two populations was much higher than that of the most of the BMSB populations in the invaded countries (
 <italic>Hd</italic> &lt; 0.182). This conclusion agreed with the observations from the study by Xu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another interesting result from our study was the absence of shared haplotypes from the two neighbouring native countries of BMSB, China and Japan, which was congruent with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The haplotype network highlighted that China and Japan had their own haplotype clusters, suggesting that there is limited or no interbreeding, probably the geographical barriers of the strait restricted gene flow among populations. It is also possible that China and Japan have put in place a strict quarantine inspection for BMSB to prevent human-mediated transportation with current intensive trade activities. As a result, these BMSB populations could have been evolving independently. The Principal Coordinates Analysis also supported this conclusion, in which, most of the Japanese and Chinese populations were clustered by themselves except populations from regions of Akita (JP) and Hainan (CN). This phenomenon was also found in Zhu’s study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] that the BMSB from Hainan and Japan were in the same clade.
