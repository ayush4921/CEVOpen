<p id="Par26">This study revealed 51 COI haplotypes (36 novel) and 29 COII haplotypes (20 novel) from 463 BMSB individuals of 12 countries. However, most of these haplotypes (80%) were detected only once (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), indicating that these new haplotypes are less abundant in the populations we studied. The haplotype analysis of mtDNA sequences of the BMSB populations from 12 countries provided genetic information for the identification of the pathways of invasion and the possible sources of origin.
