<p id="Par28">The combined data for COI and COII led to the observation of several ancestral lineages, including h1 (H1h1), h3 (H3h3, H22h3, H33h3) and h11 lines (H45h11, N22h11, N40 h11). The haplotype networks support that most of the less abundant haplotypes were possibly evolved from these lines.</p>
