<p id="Par33">BMSB specimens were collected from 43 regions/provinces in 12 countries (Austria, Chile, China, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey, and the USA). All BMSB specimens were stored in 95% ethanol at − 20 °C and the species identity was confirmed by morphological characteristics by MPI entomologists. Total genomic DNA was extracted from each individual specimen using QIAGEN DNeasy® Blood &amp; Tissue Kit with QIAGEN RNase A (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, the USA). The DNA quality and purity were determined using NanoDrop™ (CA, the USA) and quantified using QuantiFluor™ (CA, the USA) (Additional file
