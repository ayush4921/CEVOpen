<p id="Par36">All the COI and COII sequences obtained in this study were checked and edited in Geneious software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to remove poor quality sequences. A 657 bp COI and a 518 bp COII regions were used for further analysis, thus no missing data and ambiguous base-calls such as Y, W, N. S in the sequences obtained. Using the previously reported BMSB haplotypes as a reference, an in-house python script was developed to allocate the haplotype name for each obtained sequence. The script automatically allocated haplotype name to each individual of this study by searching the database. Sequences identical with those previously reported were assigned the same haplotype name (with a prefix H for COI or h for COII). The remaining sequences which did not share 100% sequence identity with the previously reported were given a new haplotype name (with a prefix N for COI and n for COII). Finally, a Microsoft Excel file was created (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and the number of haplotypes per population was calculated in Microsoft Excel. To further confirm those new haplotypes, all the sequences detected in this study were also BLAST searched in GenBank database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To better illustrate the population genetics, the COI and COII sequences were concatenated into one linked longer haplotype, namely COI-COII combined haplotype. All the subsequent genetic analyses were conducted based on the COI-COII combined haplotypes.
