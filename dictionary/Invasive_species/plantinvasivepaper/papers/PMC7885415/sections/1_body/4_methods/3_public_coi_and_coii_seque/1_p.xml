<p id="Par35">A comparative barcoding analysis of COI and COII genes from the BMSB cohort of the current study and the publicly available COI and COII sequences from BMSB were conducted. The reference COI and COII sequences were created, respectively, by the following steps. Firstly, previously reported COI and COII barcode sequences of BMSB were downloaded from the GenBank. The COI (UID: 1674561291, 1,591,437,641, 1,334,761,755, 1,304,534,304, 1,240,496,350, 1,201,369,261, 1,024,298,892, 985,693,878, 443,298,673, 537,366,792, 552,099,040) and COII (UID: 1334762135, 552,098,974) sequences were aligned separately using Geneious software v10.2.5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Secondly, for COI, a 657 bp region was selected for further analysis while a 518 bp region was selected for COII. Sequences not from the same region of COI or COII were discarded. Finally, the aligned sequences were trimmed to 657 bp for COI and 518 for COII and duplicated sequences removed. The remaining unique sequences were used as the reference dataset for haplotype assignment.
