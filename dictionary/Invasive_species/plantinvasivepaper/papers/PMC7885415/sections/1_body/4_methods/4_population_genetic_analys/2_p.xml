<p id="Par38">Genetic differentiation among the BMSB populations was estimated by the fixation index (F
 <sub>ST</sub>), and the overall genetic variance was calculated by AMOVA (Analysis of molecular variance). Both calculations were fulfilled using Arlequin 3.5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To show the genetic relationships among the populations, a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was conducted based on the F
 <sub>ST</sub> data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) using GenAlEx 6.5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The relationships among the COI and COII combined haplotypes were examined using a parsimony network by applying the method described by TCS analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] based on the COI-COII combined haplotypes and visualized using PopART [
