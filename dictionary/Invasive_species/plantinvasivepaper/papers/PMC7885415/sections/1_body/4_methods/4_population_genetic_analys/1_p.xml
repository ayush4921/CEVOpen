<p id="Par37">The genetic diversity as the percentage of each haplotype present from different regions and/or countries was estimated by calculating the number of haplotypes detected at the country, divided by the total number of individuals sampled using Microsoft Excel. Population genetic diversity, as indexed by the number of haplotype (
 <italic>Hn</italic>), haplotype diversity (
 <italic>Hd</italic>) and nucleotide diversity (
 <bold>
  <italic>Ï€</italic>
 </bold>) was estimated using DnaSP v6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to quantify the degree of genetic diversity. Analyses of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were conducted separately for each population as well as for populations in one country and one genetic group. To examine the historical demographic expansion, a neutrality test was performed under DnaSP v6. Based on the 
 <italic>Hd</italic> values, the BMSB populations in the invaded countries were divided into two groups: genetic group A (Chile, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Turkey and the USA) and genetic group B (Austria, Serbia and Slovenia). Therefore, the neutrality test was also performed among the BMSB populations from China, Japan, group A, and group B.
