 <caption>
  <p>Haplotype network derived from the TCS analysis using COI-COII combined haplotypes (1175â€‰bp fragment) of BMSB around the world. Each circle represents one kind of haplotype. The size of the circle represents the frequency of each haplotype. The colour represents the countries where the samples were collected. The tick marker on each line represents a base pair difference. The figure was constructed based on the haplotypes obtained in the current study and those from the study of Cesari et al. [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The haplotypes obtained from Cesari et al. [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] are labelled with TH
