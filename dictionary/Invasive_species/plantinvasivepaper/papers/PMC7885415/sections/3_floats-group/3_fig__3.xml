 <caption>
  <p>Geographical distribution of mtDNA COICOII haplotypes (1175â€‰bp fragment) of BMSB in native countries in the current study, (
   <bold>a</bold>) China, and (
   <bold>b</bold>) Japan. Provinces where BMSB was collected from are shaded in grey. COI-COII combined haplotypes were formed by combing COI and COII haplotypes. The size of pie is proportional to the frequency of haplotypes. Each colour represents a different haplotype. The figure was generated using Tableau 2019 (
