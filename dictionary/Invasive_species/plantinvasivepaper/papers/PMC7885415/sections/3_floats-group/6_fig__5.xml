 <caption>
  <p>Haplotype network derived from the TCS analysis using COI-COII combined haplotypes (1175â€‰bp fragment) of BMSB around the world. Each pie represents one haplotype with the haplotype name next to it. The size of pie is proportional to the frequency of haplotypes. The colour represents the countries where the samples were collected from. The tick marker on each line represents a base pair difference. The figure was constructed based on the combined COI and COII haplotypes obtained in the current study</p>
