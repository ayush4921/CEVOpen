<p>Our study suggests that in semi-protected areas like national wildlife refuges and preserves, where introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> has invaded, the outlook is dire. Left unchecked, nonnative haplotypes grow very rapidly. The end result is likely to resemble areas like the Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey Meadowlands which are now dominated by 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. In protected areas where chemical control may not be an option, management of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> poses a great challenge. The management of this species through biological control does not appear promising, as most herbivores prefer and perform better on the rare native haplotypes (
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Lambert1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>; GP Bhattarai, WJ Allen, LA Meyerson, JT Cronin unpublished data). Biological control using fungal pathogens is under consideration 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> but this approach is likely also to be limited by the need for within-species specificity. Mechanical removal during the early stages of invasion has been employed 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Hazelton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> but those methods are costly, labor intensive, and potentially damaging to the hydrology of the system and neighboring plants 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Hazelton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Unfortunately, this may be the only option available to managers of these sensitive lands. In areas where 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> is just beginning to arrive, managers must respond immediately to the threat.
