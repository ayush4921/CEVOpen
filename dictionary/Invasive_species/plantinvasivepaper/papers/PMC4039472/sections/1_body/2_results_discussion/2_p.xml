<p>Although it would have been desirable to statistically test whether the growth rates of the Eurasian and Gulf-Coast haplotypes responded differently to hurricane frequency, we did not have sufficient replication for the Gulf-Coast haplotype to allow for this comparison. However, we were able to compare the best-fit model for the growth rate of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> with and without sites representing the Gulf-Coast haplotype. Exclusion of sites with the Gulf-Coast haplotype did not alter the results (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2,6</sub> = 26.87, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.90, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098478-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, a comparison of the growth rates of sites occupied by Gulf-Coast haplotype with those of sites occupied by Eurasian haplotype indicates that growth rates were not significantly different (Eurasian: 0.13±0.03 [mean ± SE]; Gulf-Coast: 0.10±0.03 [mean ± SE]; 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>11</sub> = 0.69, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.50). These results suggest that the Gulf-Coast haplotype is not only spreading rapidly in marshes along the Gulf Coast of the US but also is responding to disturbance events similarly to the well-known Eurasian invader.
