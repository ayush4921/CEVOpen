<p>The strong positive correlation between hurricane frequency and the patch growth rate of the Eurasian and Gulf-Coast haplotypes reveals the importance of large-scale disturbances on biological invasions. Severe destruction of natural vegetation accompanied with drastic changes in habitat characteristics including hydrology, salinity, and geomorphology

 <italic>P. australis</italic> is one of the early species to recover after a major hurricane 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Chabreck1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. An extensive underground system of rhizomes and roots representing over two-thirds of the total biomass of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> may enable this species to survive catastrophic disturbances and re-sprout much earlier than the native vegetation. In coastal-area marshes, storm surge brought about by hurricanes often results in temporary flooding and elevated salinity 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Chabreck1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Increased salinity in freshwater and brackish marshes may on its own, or in combination with the damage from winds, inhibit the recovery of native species. In the case of the Eurasian and Gulf-Coast haplotypes of 
 <italic>P. australis,</italic> which have been shown to tolerate mesohaline levels of salinity 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Vasquez1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Howard1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, storm surge may greatly increase their competitive advantage over native species. Alternatively, excessive rainfall during hurricanes which could account up to 40% of total annual precipitation in a site may reduce salinity in hypersaline marshes

 <italic>P. australis</italic> in these environments. Increased concentration of organic matter in the wetland following a hurricane event

 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Michener1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Blood1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> may also benefit the growth of plant species like 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> that are amongst the first species to recover from a hurricane. The fact that we found no effect of tropical storm frequency on 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth rates suggests that these lower wind-speed storms may not sufficiently free up resources, or alter salinity and nutrient levels, to an extent that favors increased growth of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. Although we could not estimate the emergence rate of new stands from aerial images (because patches appeared and merged too quickly), it is likely the case that increased hurricane activity also caused an increase in the proliferation of new 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches.
