<p>The invasion of the Eurasian haplotype of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in the Atlantic Coast of the US has been attributed to increased anthropogenic disturbance and nutrient enrichment following coastal development 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Bertness1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Holdredge1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Construction of highway networks has also been linked to the spread of the introduced haplotype in Canada 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Lelong1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In our study, we specifically selected sites from marshes that were relatively undisturbed by humans to minimize the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the expansion of patches. Our study provides compelling evidence that large-scale disturbance events can be of overriding importance in the spread of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in semi-protected areas in the coastal regions. Hurricane frequency over the past several decades explained over 80% of the variation in the growth rates of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches across the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the US. In this case, 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth rates were greater along the Gulf and southern Atlantic Coast where hurricanes occurred more frequently. This geographic pattern in growth rates appears to be driven by factors associated with hurricanes, not other climatic or environmental variables associated with latitude because growth rates were unrelated to latitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098478-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and climatic variables in our statistical models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098478.s001">Table S1</xref>). However, the contribution of specific components of hurricane disturbance (e.g., storm surge, nutrient fluxes, changes in salinity) on the growth rate of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> has yet to be evaluated.
