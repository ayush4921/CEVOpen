<p>Average annual growth rate of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches within a site varied from 6.3% to 35.3% among our sites. The best-fit model for explaining the variation in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth rates among sites included only hurricane frequency (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098478.s001">Table S1</xref>; 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth rate = 
 <italic>a</italic>[hurricane frequency]+
 <italic>b</italic>[hurricane frequency]
 <sup>2</sup>+ 
 <italic>k</italic>; Akaike weights = 0.61, Evidence ratio = 4.72, Normalized evidence ratio = 0.83). The growth rates of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches in semi-protected coastal marshes of the US (Eurasian and Gulf-Coast haplotypes combined) increased significantly, but nonlinearly, with hurricane frequency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098478-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Eighty-one percent of the variation in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth rate was explained by just this one abiotic factor. Interestingly, the occurrence of lower-intensity storms did not contribute in an appreciable way to the growth of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098478.s001">Table S1</xref>). Hurricane frequency was greatest in the south and decreased with increasing latitude (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) but storm frequency was independent of latitude (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.16, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098478-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Despite these latitudinal patterns, latitude was uncorrelated with 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth rates (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.20, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098478-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Growth rates of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches were also independent of the climatic variables (
