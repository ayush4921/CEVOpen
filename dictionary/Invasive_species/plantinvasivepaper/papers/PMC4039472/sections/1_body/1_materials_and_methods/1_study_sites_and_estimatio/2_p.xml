 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches were identified initially based on morphological characters and, then, confirmed by an analysis of the chloroplast DNA 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Saltonstall1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Marsh sites were â‰¤25 km from the ocean or gulf and could potentially flood from the storm surge. Most of the sites were tidal but the sites along the Gulf Coast experience smaller tides in comparison to those in the Atlantic Coast. These sites were separated from each other by at least 40 km and none shared the same drainage system.
