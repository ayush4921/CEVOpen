<p>All storm events with wind speeds ≥35 knots (64.9 km/hr), the minimum for categorization of a tropical storm based on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Available2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, were included in the analysis. For each site, storms were categorized as either tropical or sub-tropical storms (35–64 knots, or 64.9–118.5 km/hr) or hurricanes (above 64 knots or 118.6 km/hr) based on a popular convention. A total of 79 tropical and sub-tropical storms and 21 hurricanes (average wind speed = 99.47 km/hr, SE = 3.11, range = 65–231.5 km/hr) passed through our sites during the study period. Annual frequencies of tropical storms and hurricanes were determined for each site.
