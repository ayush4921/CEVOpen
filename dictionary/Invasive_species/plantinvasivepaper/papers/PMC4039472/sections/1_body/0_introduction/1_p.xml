 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Pyek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and because their occurrence is often linked to climate change, the rise in invasions is expected to continue into the future

 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, successful invaders can have dire consequences for the persistence of native species, food-web structure, ecosystem functioning

 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and, ultimately, the economy 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Pimentel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Mechanisms promoting establishment and spread of invasive species in particular habitats (local scale) have been well studied and include possession of traits that facilitate establishment and invasion (e.g., strong dispersal ability, high reproductive rate, superior competitive ability) and release from natural enemies
