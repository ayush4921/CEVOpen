<p>In spite of the serious ecological and economic impacts of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> invasion, almost nothing is known about the factors responsible for the continent-scale patterns of spread of these invasive haplotypes in North America. Using historical aerial images (spanning 5–27 years), we determined the growth rate of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches within each of 13 marsh sites (9 inhabited by the Eurasian and 4 inhabited by the Gulf-Coast haplotype) distributed along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the US (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0098478-t001">Table 1</xref>). For each site, we estimated wind speeds of all storms, counting only those that qualified as a tropical or subtropical storm (maximum sustained wind speeds of 65–119 km/h) or hurricane (≥119 km/h). By dividing storms into these two wind-speed categories, we were able to test the 
 <italic>a priori</italic> prediction that growth rates of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches were more strongly related to the frequency of more intense storms.
