  <title>Effect of hurricane frequency on 
   <italic>P. australis</italic> growth.
  </title>
  <p>Annual growth rate (proportional change in 
   <italic>ln</italic> area) of 
   <italic>P. australis</italic> patches as a function of hurricane frequency in the coastal marshes of the United States. Filled and open symbols represent sites occupied by Eurasian and Gulf-Coast haplotypes respectively. Solid curve is the best-fit model representing all sites (
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>2,10</sub> = 21.66, 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 
   <italic>R
    <sup>2</sup>
   </italic> = 0.81). The diamond-shaped symbol was identified as an outlier based on the examination of standardized residuals. The relationship was still significant when it was removed from the analysis (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.89). The dotted curve represents the best-fit model for only the sites occupied by the Eurasian haplotype (
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>2,6</sub> = 26.87, 
   <italic>P = </italic>0.001, 
   <italic>R = </italic>0.90).
