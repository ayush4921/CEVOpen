<p>Interestingly, our study revealed the importance of precipitation variables as a limiting factor in calibrating the ecological niche model of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Several previous studies observed that precipitation was the most important predictor to assess the distributional potential of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in diverse regions across the world, including MÃ©xico [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is a container-breeding mosquito, where drought and rainfall conditions can affect the aquatic ecosystem. For example, drought disrupts the aquatic ecosystem by increasing the larval density, which subsequently enhances interspecific competition and resource limitations. The latter drive increased larval development time and mortality, decreased adult longevity, and decreased adult size [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections models; 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was limited by covariates of precipitation, temperature, and elevation; however, the ecological niche of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections was not limited by elevation. This was an important finding, suggesting possibilities of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in both lower and higher altitudes. The latter finding also raised the possibility of releasing 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes in plateau areas where arboviruses spread [
