<p>Finally, knowing the potential distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México offers an overview of how to create vector control measures in each of the invasion zones. Likewise, this study stands out as one of the first to validate the ecological niche models of the key disease vector 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> using newly updated sets of occurrences from recent surveillance programs in México. The new potential distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> offers an opportunity to start with preventive measures in areas with a high probability of establishment in México. It is still necessary to validate all the areas in México with the probability of finding 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection, mainly in the southeast of México. Interestingly, a recent study [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] identified natural coinfection of native populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> with two 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains (
 <italic>wAlbA</italic> and 
 <italic>wAlbB</italic>) in three suburban localities of the city of Merida, Yucatan. This latter study [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] estimated natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections of 40% in local populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Therefore, our results can be applied in vector control measures in México for future decision-making. In summary, our future studies will consider further detailed mapping of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains, considering other additional host parameters and future climatic conditions.
