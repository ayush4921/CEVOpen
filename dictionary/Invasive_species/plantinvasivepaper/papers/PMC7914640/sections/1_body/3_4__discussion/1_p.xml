<p>The dispersal of invasive mosquitoes constitutes a dynamic ecological process that is strongly influenced by human activity on both local and global levels. Modification of the landscape, environmental pollution, the introduction of non-native species, and climate change are the main factors that cause important alterations in the bionomics of vectors over time. The Asian tiger mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been identified in 17 states of MÃ©xico [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This mosquito species is considered an important invasive species since it has successfully colonized many sites outside its native habitats in Asia [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to adapt to new invasive habitats across the world: (a) eggs are more resistant to desiccation, which allows them to survive in inhospitable environments, in addition to favoring their transport via diverse human activities; (b) active transportation and human activities, which allow voluntarily or involuntarily transport from one place to another; (c) the presence of the aquatic and terrestrial stages help to streamline their transport [

 <xref rid="B47-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In anthropized landscapes with intense human activity, the mosquito species initiate a process of adaptation to the new environmental and habitat conditions that can be reflected in different degrees of synanthropy between arbovirus vectors such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.
