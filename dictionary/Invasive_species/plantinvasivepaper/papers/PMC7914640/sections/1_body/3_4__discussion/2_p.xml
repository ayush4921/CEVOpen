<p>The introduction of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the southern United States caused the rapid removal of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in many places and the reduction of its distribution across the southeast of the country from Texas to Florida [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in transmitting the dengue is different, public health programs should target the control of both vector species to reduce the transmission of dengue, even if the virus is potentially transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is a permanent resident of our region since its invasion of the Americas in the 1980s, indicating its increased associations in disease transmission across the region. The interactions of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and other mosquitoes can modify the vector capacity of the species involved in ways not always predictable [
