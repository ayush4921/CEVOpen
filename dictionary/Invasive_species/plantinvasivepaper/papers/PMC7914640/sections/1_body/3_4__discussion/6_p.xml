<p>The World Mosquito Program uses 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to prevent the transmission of mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. There are several pieces of evidence from the international pilot studies that showed the importance of broad-release trials of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to decrease the risk of arboviruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Multiple trials in various countries demonstrated that this control approach is a safe and an effective way to prevent the spread of diseases across entire cities and regions [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two strategies using 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are available: (a) suppression (i.e., this strategy involves releasing a very large number of male mosquitoes carrying 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>), and (b) replacement (i.e., this strategy requires releasing both male and female mosquitoes carrying 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>). However, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> lacks these associations with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the field; 
 <italic>wAlbA</italic> and 
 <italic>wAlbB</italic> strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were naturally identified from the vector 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B61-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was associated with a decrease of dengue virus transmission in mosquitoes from La Reunion Island [
 <xref rid="B63-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In México, there are only three reports of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> collected from different sites [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that these reports corresponded to the southeast region of México, specifically the Soconusco de Chiapas. The model of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections offered a proxy for the potential distribution of the naturally-infected populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México. The model anticipated higher probabilities of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in southeastern México, which corresponded to Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Chiapas. Perhaps this is a reason for the reduced populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the southeast of México. A recent study found 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> naturally infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the Soconusco region, Chiapas [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These findings corroborate that the natural populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México and the World may be influenced by two aspects: (1) the nature of the interspecific competition and co-occurrence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and (2) the effect of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections on 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations. This study addresses a new line of research. Predictions of the spatial distribution of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México infer the geographic regions where the human populations could be protected from the medically important arboviruses transmitted by this species, particularly if the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> reduces the arbovirus transmission and acts as a natural antiviral control agent. Our modeling efforts also provide some recommendations to determine the target priorities for 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based control programs and release trials to save money and efforts for efficient control programs.
