<p>The ecological niche models of Pech-May et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated a 79.7% coverage in México. The important overlap with the Asian niche model (i.e., ecological niche calibrated in Asia and projected to México) suggested a high potential for the species to disperse to sylvatic regions in México. Post-validation occurrences demonstrated the presence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in areas that previously reported a high probability based on a previous study [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], such as the Yucatan Peninsula. Currently, the potential invasion zones of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in 2020 are unpredictable, and there are still too many behavioral, ecological, demographic, and genetic analyses concerning the competition that are being presented in each area. In addition to all these factors, it would still be necessary to assess the species occurrence and vector competence in rural and urban areas of México.
