<p>The sensitivity of the Pech-May et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ENM was 191/198 = 0.96 compared to the sensitivity of the post-analysis validation (2015â€“2020) of 113/118 = 0.96 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). Most of the validation occurrences (91.41%) corresponded to a 100% predicted suitability of the Pech-May et al. [
