<p>We used four sets of variables in estimating the ENM of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 1972 candidate models were built for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, however, 1479 of these models were statistically significant. Finally, only one model met the three selection criteria and was identified as the best candidate model based on its performance (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Precipitation was the primary contributor to the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> model; precipitation of the driest quarter (Bio 17), precipitation of the driest month (Bio 14), and annual precipitation (Bio 12) were the most influential variables in calibrating the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> model. The ENM of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México anticipated its distribution on the Gulf Coast of México, including the Yucatán Peninsula. The distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> also covered the states of the Pacific Coast (Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas) and Central México (Puebla, Morelos, México, and Guanajuato) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The MOP results suggested high levels of environmental similarities in all areas in México, except parts of Northern México (e.g., Chihuahua, Sonora, and Coahuila) where strict extrapolation occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). The highest values of standard deviation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f002">Figure 2</xref>c) and uncertainty index (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f002">Figure 2</xref>d) corresponded to the southeast of México (Yucatán, Campeche, Chiapas, Veracruz, and Oaxaca), the Pacific Coast (Guerrero), and Northern México (Coahuila, Sonora, and Sinaloa).
