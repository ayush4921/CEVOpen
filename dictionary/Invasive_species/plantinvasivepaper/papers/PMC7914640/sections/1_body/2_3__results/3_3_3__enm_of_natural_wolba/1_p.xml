<p>The same four sets of variables were used in constructing the ENM of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in the host 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 1446 models were statistically significant; however, only 17 candidate models were statistically significant models meeting omission rate and AICc criteria (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The ENM of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections anticipated occurrence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in most of the Yucatán Peninsula, Tabasco, north of Chiapas, the Chiapas border with Guatemala, and Veracruz (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). The MOP results suggested high levels of environmental similarities in all areas in México except parts of the southeast of México (Yucatan Peninsula, Chiapas, Tabasco, and Veracruz), and Northern México (Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Coahuila) where strict extrapolation occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). The highest values of standard deviation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f006">Figure 6</xref>c) and uncertainty index (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f006">Figure 6</xref>d) corresponded to the southeast of México (Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Chiapas, Tabasco, and Veracruz), and Central México (Guerrero).
