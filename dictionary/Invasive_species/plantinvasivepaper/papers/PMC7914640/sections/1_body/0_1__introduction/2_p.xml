<p>Novel analytical tools were developed to calibrate and project the potential distribution of the species based on machine learning algorithms [

Ecological niche modeling has been used to project the geographic distributional potential of numerous vectors and vector-borne diseases (VBDs). These diseases included dengue, Zika, chikungunya [
