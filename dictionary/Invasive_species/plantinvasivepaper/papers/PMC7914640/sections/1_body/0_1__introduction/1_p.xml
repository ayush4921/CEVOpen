<p>The Asian tiger mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse 1894) (Diptera: Culicidae), originated in Asia and is now distributed throughout tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This mosquito is an invasive species since it has successfully colonized many regions outsides its native habitats [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is also established at temperate latitudes in Europe and North America [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> invaded the Americas in 1985 via two main independent routes: United States and Brazil [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was first reported in Coahuila, México in 1993 [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Today, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been identified in 17 Mexican states, including Campeche, Chiapas, Coahuila, Hidalgo, México, Morelos, Nuevo León, Oaxaca, Puebla, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz y Yucatán [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is of particular public health concern, particularly as the species is a potential vector of 22 arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, Chikungunya, and Zika [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. México reported a total of 11,200 and 5667 cases of chikungunya and Zika in 2015, respectively [
