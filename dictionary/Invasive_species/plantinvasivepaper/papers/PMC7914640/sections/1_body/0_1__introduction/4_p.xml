 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is continuously invading new areas in México. Therefore, we need to continuously update the ecological niche model (ENM) of this important vector by considering the availability of new data and development of the ecological niche modeling “toolkit” to better calibrate and evaluate these models. As part of gaining a better understanding of the distributional potential of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México, this study had three objectives: (1) to update the ENM of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and estimate the population at risk; (2) to validate the ENM from 2015 to 2020 to assess the temporal differences in the ecological niches; and finally, (3) to construct the ENM of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections based on occurrences of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México. The results of this study could be used to prioritize vector control measures in México and delineate the target populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> spp. for future decision-making.
