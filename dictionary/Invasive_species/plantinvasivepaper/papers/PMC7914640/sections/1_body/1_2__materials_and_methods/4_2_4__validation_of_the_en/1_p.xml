<p>The ENM of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for 2015 was constructed using the database of the previous study [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with 198 unique occurrences. We used a single set of the same 13 variables used in the previous study [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to replicate the previous constructed ENM [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of driest month, precipitation seasonality, aspect, slope, topographic index, and elevation [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The steps of estimating the accessible area “
 <bold>
  <italic>M</italic>
 </bold>” and constructing the ENM followed the previously described methodology using the 
 <italic>kuenm</italic> package [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This model was denoted as “Pech-May et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ENM”; while the ENM obtained in this study was denoted as “2020 ENM”. We selected a threshold that predicted the presence of 90% of occurrences. We then converted the values that were greater or equal to this threshold value into “1” (presence) and the values less than this threshold value into “0” (absence) to get a binary map of the distribution [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Model validation is often an integral part of ENM development; this consists of evaluating the model based on independent records that were not included in the previous model calibration step. The latter evaluation approach identified the proportion of correctly predicted presence records and thus the quantification of omission errors [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We also evaluated the geographical projection of the three variants of ecological niches: (a) conserved niche was defined as the ecological niche that remains constant in both models: Pech-May et al. ENM [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and 2020 ENM, (b) gain of niche of Pech-May et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ENM compared to that of 2020 ENM, and (c) loss of niche of Pech-May et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ENM compared to that of 2020 ENM. The ENMs in both models were calculated in pixels occupied/all pixels.
