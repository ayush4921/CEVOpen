<p>To identify extrapolation risk in the model transfers, we performed a mobility-oriented parity (MOP) analysis comparing the environmental breadth of predictors within “
 <bold>
  <italic>M</italic>
 </bold>” (10% reference points sampled) with that in the projection area using the MOP function [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] available in the 
 <italic>kuenm</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The risk of extrapolation analysis defines the areas with strict extrapolation (i.e., places where environmental conditions are non-analogous to those in areas across which the models were calibrated) to avoid the risk of over-prediction in non-analogous environments. The uncertainty maps were constructed using the MOP analysis and the standard deviation (SD) obtained from the final models in 
 <italic>kuenm</italic>. The MOP raster output was reclassified into five categories; the first category represented a strict extrapolation (i.e., zero value), and the fifth category represented the highest environmental similarities between calibration and projection areas. The standard deviation raster was reclassified into five categories too; category “1” represented the lowest values of SD, and category “5” represented the highest values of SD. We subsequently combined the two classified rasters as an estimate for the uncertainty index; the final raster output was reclassified into three categories: low, medium, and high, to present lower, medium, and higher values of uncertainty index, respectively.
