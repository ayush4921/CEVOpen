<p>A Mexican database of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurrences were obtained from previous literature [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These occurrences presented sites of adult sampling obtained from Pech-May et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and records from all recent surveillance programs of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México from 2015 to 2020 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00143-f001">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 316 occurrences were included in the original dataset. We eliminated duplicated occurrences and reduced the effects of spatial autocorrelation by thinning occurrence records via a distance filter of 5 km between records using the 
 <italic>spThin</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The final database included 231 occurrence records. We randomly split occurrence records into three subsets using the “random k-fold” method: 65% of occurrences for model calibration, 25% of occurrences for internal testing, and the remaining 10% of occurrences for final evaluation [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The latter method partitions occurrence localities randomly into a user-specified number of (k) bins as described in detail in the previous protocol [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
