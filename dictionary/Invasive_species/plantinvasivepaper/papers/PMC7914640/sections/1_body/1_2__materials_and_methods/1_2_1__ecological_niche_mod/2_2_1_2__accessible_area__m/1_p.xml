<p>The accessible area “

 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A 200 km radius buffer was created around each occurrence point to extend the limits of the entire calibration region considering the broad invasion potential of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The selection of this radius buffer was based on the spatial resolution of environmental variables and the environmental heterogeneity present in areas where the species occur. Accessible area “
 <bold>
  <italic>M</italic>
 </bold>” represents the areas to which a species has had access over a relevant time-period because of its movement and colonizing capacities and the structure of barriers and distances [

 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We defined the ecoregions as relatively large units of land containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximated the original extent of natural communities before major land-use changes [
