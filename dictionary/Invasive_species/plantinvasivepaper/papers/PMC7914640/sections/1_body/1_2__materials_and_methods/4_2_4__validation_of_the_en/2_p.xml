<p>We further visualized the environmental space of both models in the software Niche Analyst (NicheA) version 3.0 [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] available at 
 <uri xlink:href="http://nichea.sourceforge.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://nichea.sourceforge.net/</uri>. This software allows visualization of environmental distribution as a minimum volume ellipsoid in three dimensions of environmental space (i.e., the first three principal components out of the principal component analysis of the 13 environmental variables described above). We calculated the niche overlap using the kernel density function implemented in the 
 <italic>ecospat</italic> package in R [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to estimate the density of the species in environmental space as per a previous protocol [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
