<p>Sixteen variables were used to construct the ENM of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in México. These variables included fifteen bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim version 2 and the elevation. We used WorldClim 2 because WorldClim data performed substantially better than other available climatic data in different modeling purposes (

 <xref rid="B34-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). We excluded four variables from the bioclimatic variables (Bio 8, Bio 9, Bio 18, and Bio 19) owing to their known spatial artifacts, following the protocol implemented in previous similar studies [

 <xref rid="B36-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The elevation variable was also selected in light of its important contribution in constructing the species ecological niche model [

 <uri xlink:href="http://cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm/</uri>. All these variables had a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.008333° ≈ 1 km). We used the iterative jackknife function implemented in the software MaxEnt 3.4.1 [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to identify four candidate sets of predictors to improve the model calibration process of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> by reducing the spatial autocorrelation of presence data and the multi-collinearity of the bioclimatic variables [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Variables were selected considering their contribution to models and their collinearity. Final sets of variables included 16 variables in set 1, 15 in set 2, 8 in set 3, and 10 in set 4 (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): (a) set 1 (15 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim and elevation); (b) set 2 (15 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim); (c) set 3 (7 bioclimatic variables and elevation); and (d) set 4 (9 bioclimatic variables and elevation).
