<p>The occurrence records of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in the host 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were obtained from previously published studies in México [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in mosquito populations were determined based on PCR amplification of a 600 bp fragment corresponding to the 
 <italic>wsp</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The previous studies [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] identified natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in 21 unique sampling sites across México. These unique occurrences were randomly divided into three categories: model calibration (65%), internal testing (25%), and model evaluation (10%) using the methodology protocol implemented in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For creating the accessible area “
 <bold>
  <italic>M</italic>
 </bold>” [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we used a binary map delineating the species distribution described above. We considered the accessible area “
 <bold>
  <italic>M</italic>
 </bold>” as the space in the hyper-volume, where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> had a prediction of 90% in México. We used the four sets of climatic variables described above to construct the ecological niche model of natural 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00143-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We used the MaxEnt algorithm via the 
 <italic>kuenm</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to construct ENM as previously described above in the previous sections. To identify extrapolation risk in the model transfers, we performed MOP analysis as previously described using the 
 <italic>kuenm</italic> R package. The uncertainty map was constructed using MOP analysis and the standard deviation (SD) raster obtained from the final models in 
 <italic>kuenm</italic>. These rasters were classified as previously described above in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> model. The two classified outputs were combined to provide a proxy of the uncertainty index. This final raster was reclassified into three categories: low, medium, and high, to represent lower, medium, and higher values of uncertainty index, respectively.
