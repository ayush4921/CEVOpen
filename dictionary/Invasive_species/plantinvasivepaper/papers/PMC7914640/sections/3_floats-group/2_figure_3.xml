   <bold>Validation of the Pech-May et al. [
    <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ecological niche model (ENM) of 
    <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in México.

   <bold>a</bold>) The calibration (dotted green circles) and validation (dotted red circles) occurrences of 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> overlap with the Pech-May et al. [
   <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ENM; the values (0–100) represent the probability of 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurrence in a particular area multiplied by 100. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The relationship between the percentage of validation occurrences on the vertical axis and the model prediction values on the horizontal axis. The red bars present the percentage of validation occurrence records for each prediction value (i.e., this shows that most validation records occurred in the upper 10th percentile of the predicted suitability values). The square at the bottom left corner of the map presents a close-up map showing the overlap between the occurrence records and the prediction in the background.
