   <bold>Comparisons of ecological niche models of 
    <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in México.
   </bold> The relationships between the Pech-May et al. [
   <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ecological niche model and the 2020 ecological niche model. The green areas represent the areas where congruent predictions occurred between the two models, the red color represents the areas where 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is anticipated to occur by the Pech-May et al. [
   <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ENM only, and blue color represents the areas where 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is anticipated by the 2020 ENM only. The square at the bottom left corner of the map presents a close-up map showing the relationship between some of 2015–2020 occurrences and the Pech-May et al. [
   <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] prediction.
