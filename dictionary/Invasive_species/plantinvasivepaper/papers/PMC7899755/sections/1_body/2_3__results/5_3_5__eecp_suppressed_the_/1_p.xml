<p>The levels of IL-6, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in the LPS groups were evidently increased. Treatment with EECP resulted in a decrease in these proinflammatory cytokines when compared with the LPS group (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(c)</xref>). Furthermore, a decrease in the production of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> was also demonstrated by RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(d)</xref>). More importantly, treatment with a higher concentration of EECP significantly reversed the increase of NLRP3, as shown by Western blotting analysis (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>).
