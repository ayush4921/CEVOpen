<p>Mitochondria are the center of energy and metabolism in eukaryons. They are also cellular organs with a critical adjusting function in apoptosis signaling processes. To determine the effect of EECP on mitochondria, the mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production were analyzed. The functions of mitochondria were damaged, and ROS production was obviously increased after EECP treatment with the LPS group in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS (
