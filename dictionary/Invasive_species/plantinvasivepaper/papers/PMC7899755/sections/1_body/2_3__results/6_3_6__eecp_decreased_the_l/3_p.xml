<p>The protein expression levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS were also assessed. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(e)</xref>, it was observed that expression levels of the key enzymes of glycolysis were downregulated in the EECP treatment groups compared with the LPS group. The EECP administration alleviated glycolysis by suppressing the levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA.
