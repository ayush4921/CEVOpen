<p>To further confirm the effect of EECP on the migration, invasion, and clone formation of MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS, a transwell experiment and angiogenesis assay were performed. In comparison with the control and LPS groups, treatment with different concentrations of EECP obviously suppressed the cell migration and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS. Pretreatment with different concentrations of EECP also dramatically decreased the numbers of colonies formed compared with the LPS group (
