 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, there was dramatic decrease in cell viabilities after treatment with different concentrations of EECP, and EECP was found to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner when compared with the LPS group. There was no significant different in cell viabilities between the control and LPS groups (
