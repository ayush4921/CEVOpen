<p>To confirm whether EECP inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration through inhibiting glycolysis, the scratching assay was performed by adding 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) into cells. EECP significantly suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell migration without 2-DG in the medium. However, the inhibitory effects in EECP groups were not significant compared with the LPS group after adding 2-DG into the medium, suggesting that EECP's exhibitory effects on MDA-MB-231 cells were probably via the glycolysis pathway (
