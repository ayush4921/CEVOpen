<p>The levels of the key enzymes of glycolysis—HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA—in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS were firstly measured using ELISA kits. The levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA after EECP treatment were obviously decreased compared with the LPS group, especially after treatment with a higher concentration of EECP (Figures
