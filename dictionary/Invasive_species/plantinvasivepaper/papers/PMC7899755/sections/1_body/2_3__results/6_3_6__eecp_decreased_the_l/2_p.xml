<p>The decrease in the levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS was further confirmed by RT-PCR (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(e)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(h)</xref>). As expected, EECP treatment dramatically decreased the mRNA levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA in a dose-dependent manner compared with the LPS group.
