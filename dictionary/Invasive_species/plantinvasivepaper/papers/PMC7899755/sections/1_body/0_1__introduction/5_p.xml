<p>The mitochondria are the center of energy and metabolism in eukaryons. Warburg revealed the unique energy metabolism in cancer cells, suggesting a shift in energy production from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Alterations in the glucose metabolism are characterized by increased uptake of glucose, hyperactivated glycolysis, decreased OXPHOS component, and the accumulation of lactate. Cancer cells rely on higher rates of aerobic glycolysis as their primary source of energy; thus, aerobic glycolysis becomes a hallmark of cancer cells. Key enzymes of glycolysis, namely, hexokinase 2 (HK2), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), are critical glycolysis regulators [
