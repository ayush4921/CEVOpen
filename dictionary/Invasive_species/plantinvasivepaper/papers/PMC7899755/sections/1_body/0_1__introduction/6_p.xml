<p>The levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA have been individually reported to be correlated with cancer cell growth [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Propolis has excellent antitumor activities, and whether propolis could target crucial glycolytic enzymes to inhibit tumor cell proliferation is still unclear. In the present study, the roles of Chinese propolis on key glycolytic enzymes—HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA—were assessed in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
