<p>When the MDA-MB-231 cells reached 80%—90% confluence, they were divided into 3 groups for treatment: (a) culture in L15 medium (control group), (b) culture in L15 medium with 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL LPS (LPS group), and (c) culture in L15 medium with 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL LPS and EECP (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (test group). EECP was dissolved in ethanol and applied to the cells, with a final ethanol concentration in the culture medium of &lt;0.1% (v/v). Ethanol at a concentration of 0.1% (v/v) did not affect the cell viability.
