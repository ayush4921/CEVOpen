<p>The fluorescent probes, DCFH-DA and JC-1, were used to test ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The levels of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential were quantified using the software accompanying laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200, Japan). ROS results were shown as the relative fluorescence intensity ratio compared with the LPS group, and mitochondrial membrane potential results were shown as the ratio of red to green fluorescence as compared with the LPS group.</p>
