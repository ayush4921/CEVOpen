<p>Chinese propolis was collected from Nanyang in Henan province, located in North China in 2017 (voucher specimen no. CP17110702), and the main plant origin of the propolis sample collected was poplar (
 <italic>Populus</italic> sp.). The propolis was firstly frozen and then extracted with 95% (v/v) ethanol. The extracted propolis was then ultrasonicated at 40°C for 3 h. The supernatant of the extracted propolis was filtered with filter papers to remove the residues, and then the propolis was extracted again three times. Thereafter, all of the supernatants were combined and evaporated with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 50°C. Then, the concentrate was further evaporated in an oven at 50°C until reaching a constant weight and was stored at -20°C. The ethanol extracted Chinese propolis (EECP) was redissolved in ethanol before use. The major chemical constituents of the EECP were analyzed via HPLC-DAD/Q-TOF-MS as previously described [
