<p>MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 6-wells plates. The medium was replaced with fresh complete medium or medium containing 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL LPS alone or LPS with EECP (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) when cells reached 70% confluence. The cells were further incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, the cells were treated with trypsin, resuspended in serum-free medium, and seeded into the upper chamber of the Transwell. Serum-free medium containing 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells was added to the upper chamber for migration assays, whereas 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were used for Matrigel invasion assays. L15 medium with 20% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 95% (v/v) ethanol for 10 min, then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 30 min and pictured under a microscope. The migration and invasion rates of cells were counted using Image J software.
