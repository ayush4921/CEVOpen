<p>Cell viability was measured using the CCK-8 kit. Cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. When cells reached 60-70% confluence, they were treated with or without EECP (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). At 12, 24, and 48 h, cell viabilities were measured following the manufacturer's instructions. The optical density was determined at 450 nm.
