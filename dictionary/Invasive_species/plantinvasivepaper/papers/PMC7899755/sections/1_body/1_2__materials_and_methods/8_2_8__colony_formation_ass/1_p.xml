<p>MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Then, cells were treated with EECP (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h. After that, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. The medium was changed every three days. Ten days later, cell colonies were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 95% (v/v) ethanol. Then, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and captured under an inverted optical microscope. ImageJ software was used to count the numbers of cells.
