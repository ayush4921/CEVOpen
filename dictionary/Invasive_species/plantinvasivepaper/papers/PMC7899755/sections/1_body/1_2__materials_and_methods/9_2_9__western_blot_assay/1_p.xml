<p>After treatment with EECP (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h, the total protein was extracted using a commercial protein extraction kit. The protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit. Subsequently, equal amounts of protein (30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) were separated via 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Skim milk (5%) was used to block the nonspecific binding sites for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (HK2, PFK, PKM2, LDHA, and NLRP3) were incubated with the membranes at 4°C overnight, and horseradish peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated secondary antibodies were then applied for another 1 h of incubation at room temperature. The immunoreactive signals were detected under an Amersham Image 600 (USA), and the relative quantity of protein was analyzed using ImageJ software.
