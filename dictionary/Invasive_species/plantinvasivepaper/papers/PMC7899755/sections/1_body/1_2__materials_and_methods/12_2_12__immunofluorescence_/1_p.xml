<p>After treatment with EECP (25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) at room temperature for 15 min, then blocked with 5% donkey serum (v/v) for 20 min. After adding the primary antibodies for PKM2 and LDHA (1 : 100) and secondary antibody (1 : 200) (FITC-IgG), a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200, Japan) was used for fluorescence detection. For analysis, ImageJ was used as software. Images are representative of three independent experiments.
