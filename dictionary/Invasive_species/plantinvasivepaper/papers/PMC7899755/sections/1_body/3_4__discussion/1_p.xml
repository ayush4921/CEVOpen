<p>Although propolis has been shown to have excellent antitumor activities, previous studies assessing antitumor mechanisms by targeting key enzymes of glycolysis were limited. In the present study, we evaluated the antitumor mechanisms of Chinese 
 <italic>populus</italic> propolis in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS by studying key glycolysis-related enzymes: HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA. Propolis treatment was able to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, as well as suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines. More importantly, propolis treatment obviously inhibited the levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA.
