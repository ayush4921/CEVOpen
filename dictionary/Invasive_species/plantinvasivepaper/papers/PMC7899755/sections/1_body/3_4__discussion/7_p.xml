<p>2-DG, a glucose analog, inhibits glycolysis via its actions on hexokinase [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We used 2-DG to inhibit glycolysis in MDA-MB-231 cells to assess the effects of propolis. The results showed that propolis treatment no longer inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration compared with the LPS group after inhibition of glycolysis, indicating that propolis exerts the antitumor activity by targeting glycolysis.
