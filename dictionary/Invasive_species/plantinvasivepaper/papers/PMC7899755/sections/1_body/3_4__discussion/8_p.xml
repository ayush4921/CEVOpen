<p>ROS are a key determinant of cancer's metabolic phenotype [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Maintaining ROS within a narrow range allows malignant cancer cells to enhance their growth and invasion while limiting their apoptotic susceptibility [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Cancer cells actively modify their metabolism to optimize intracellular ROS levels and thereby improve survival [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Propolis treatment evidently increased the ROS level and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS. The present results are consistent with our original findings, indicating that propolis increases the ROS level to promote cancer cells apoptosis.
