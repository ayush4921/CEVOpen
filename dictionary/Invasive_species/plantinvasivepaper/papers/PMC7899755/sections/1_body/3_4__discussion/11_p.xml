<p>There are still some limitations in our study. First, although propolis has significant inhibitory effects on glycolytic key enzymes in MDA-MB-231 cells, the effects of propolis on these key enzymes in other tumor cell lines should be further demonstrated. Second, whether propolis attenuating glycolytic key enzymes suppresses the tumor growth signaling pathway such as PI3K-Akt or propolis inhibiting the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway attenuates glycolytic key enzymes should be further studied.</p>
