<p>The incidence of BC has grown rapidly in recent years. BC can severely decrease a patient's quality of life and has high lethality in women. Tumor glycolysis is crucial for the efficient management of cellular bioenergetics and uninterrupted cancer growth [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although glycolysis is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation in terms of the net yield of ATP, cancer cells adapt to this mathematical disadvantage by increased glucose uptake, which in turn facilitates a higher rate of glycolysis. Glycolysis in tumor cells produces pyruvate, which is converted to lactic acid in the cytoplasm. These acidic products alter the microenvironment to accelerate tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis and instigate immunosuppressive networks that are pivotal for cancer cells to escapes immune surveillance [
