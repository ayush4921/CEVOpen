<p>Taken together, the results of this study show that propolis treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells in an inflammatory microenvironment was able to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by targeting key enzymes of glycolysis. As a natural product rich in flavonoids, propolis demonstrated good anti-inflammatory activity in the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. It was also noted that propolis could target key enzymes of glycolysis to suppress proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that propolis could damage the mitochondrial function by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing ROS production. As a result, Chinese
