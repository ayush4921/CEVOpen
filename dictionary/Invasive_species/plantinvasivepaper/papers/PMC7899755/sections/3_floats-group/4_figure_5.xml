  <p>EECP decreased the levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with LPS, as detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. (a) The protein expression levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA in MDA-MB-231 cells. (b)–(e) Quantification of the relative expression levels of HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA in MDA-MB-231 cells. (f) Expression levels of PKM2 and LDHA, as detected by the immunofluorescence assay. (g, h) Quantification of the relative expression levels of PKM2 and LDHA in MDA-MB-231 cells. Values represent the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments (
