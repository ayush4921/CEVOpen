<p>The comparison between native and invasive plant species is a widely adopted method to infer traits that determine invasive success. However, the information gleaned often seems inadequate to evaluate attributes of invasive species (van Kleunen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). First, the choice of a target native species is critical, because a comparison between invasive and co‐occurring native species with different life cycles is likely to yield misleading results (Daehler, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Vilá &amp; Weiner, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In addition, a comparison between invasive and noninvasive alien species would be more appropriate to identify traits contributing to invasive success (van Kleunen, Dawson, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). A comparative study considering invasive, noninvasive alien, and native plant species, all of which are congenic, is required to gain insight into the traits that determine invasiveness.
