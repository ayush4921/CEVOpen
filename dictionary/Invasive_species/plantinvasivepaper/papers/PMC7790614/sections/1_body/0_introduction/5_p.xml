<p>Since plants are sessile organisms, seed dispersal and germination are critical life stages for habitat selection and thereby influence species range (Donohue et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). A widely held hypothesis suggests that invasive plants tend to have smaller fruits or seeds than native species, thus facilitating seed dispersal and rapid range expansion (Coutts et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Rejmánek &amp; Richardson, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). However, diverse fruit traits other than seed size can affect dispersal efficiency (Römermann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), and these traits could be plastic to environmental conditions, as are other morphological and functional traits. Given the ecological significance of dispersal strategies, fruit characteristics, and their plasticities in plant invasiveness, these characteristics should be evaluated more extensively (Doudová et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
