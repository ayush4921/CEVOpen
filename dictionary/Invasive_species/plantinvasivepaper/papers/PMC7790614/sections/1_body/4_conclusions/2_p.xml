<p>Our results demonstrated that the invasive success of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> is likely attributable to its higher plasticity regarding the number of inflorescences. However, the phenotypic plasticity of most measured traits likely does not contribute to the invasive success of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic>, since the trait values of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> were between those of noninvasive 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic>. Invasive 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> exhibited achene traits indicative of reduced dispersal ability compared with that of the noninvasive alien 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>, in contrast with a previous hypothesis.
