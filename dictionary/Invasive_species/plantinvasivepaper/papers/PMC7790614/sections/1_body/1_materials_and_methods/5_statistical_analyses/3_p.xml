<p>All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical package version 3.2.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). To compare morphological and functional traits among treatments and species, three‐way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted using aov function. The measured traits were the dependent variable, and the fertilization treatment, competition treatment, species, and their interactions were independent variables. In order to interpret the species by treatment interactions, we conducted two additional analyses. First, to examine whether testing species exhibited differential trait values in each treatment, differences between species were evaluated for each treatment with post hoc Tukey mean comparison test (tukeyHSD function). To assess differential treatment effects among species, we conducted two‐way ANOVA for each species with environmental treatments and their interactions as independent variables. The total biomass, shoot biomass, and cross‐sectional area of achenes were log‐transformed to meet the normality assumption. To examine whether
