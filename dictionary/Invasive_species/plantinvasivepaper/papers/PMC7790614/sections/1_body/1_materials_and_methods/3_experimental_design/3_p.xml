<p>To evaluate the effects of competition and fertilization, we employed a full factorial design with four treatment combinations. As a competition treatment, we transplanted one individual seedling of each 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species to the center of pots containing 
 <italic>Festuca arundinacea</italic> (tall fescue). 
 <italic>F. arundinacea</italic> was chosen as a competing species because it has been widely used to recover anthropogenically disturbed areas in Korea. Before transplantation, 1 g of 
 <italic>F. arundinacea</italic> seeds was sowed in each pot following the distributor's recommendations and grown for one and a half months in the common garden. To simulate the high‐nutrient content of soil in agricultural areas, half of the pots in each competition treatment received 1 g of slow‐release fertilizer pellets (Osmocote Plus N:P:K 13 – 13 – 13 + 2MgO + trace element, Everris International B.V.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Pots containing plants were randomly positioned using a completely randomized design. Thirty individuals of each plant species were used for each of the four treatments, resulting in a total of 360 plants. We harvested half of the plants to measure plant growth and functional traits 6 weeks after the treatment application. The remaining plants were grown until they completed reproduction to measure fecundity and achene traits.
