<p>After 6 weeks of treatment, we collected whole plants, washed their roots to remove all soil, and dried them in a dry oven (Hanbaek, Co. Ltd.) at 65°C for three days to weigh their dry mass. The R/S ratio was calculated as the dry mass of the root divided by the aboveground biomass. Before harvesting, we took one fully expanded leaf from each plant and scanned it to measure the leaf area (Digimizer software ver. 4.6.1; MedCalc Software bvda). Leaves were dried at 65°C for 3 days, and the SLA was calculated as the leaf area divided by the dry mass. We estimated the leaf chlorophyll content using a SPAD‐520 plus chlorophyll meter (Spectrum Technologies). The SPAD values exponentially correlate with the chlorophyll content.</p>
