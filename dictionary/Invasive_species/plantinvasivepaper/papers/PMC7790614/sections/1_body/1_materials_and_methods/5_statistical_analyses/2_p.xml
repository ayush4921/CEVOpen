<p>In order to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity of 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species, we computed the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) of each trait following Valladares et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). For each species, we calculated relative distances of trait values between all pairs of individuals that were grown in different environments. The RDPI for the competition was the average of the relative distances between competition treatments in the absence and presence of fertilization. Similarly, the RDPI for the fertilization was the average of the relative distances between fertilization treatments in the absence and presence of the competition.
