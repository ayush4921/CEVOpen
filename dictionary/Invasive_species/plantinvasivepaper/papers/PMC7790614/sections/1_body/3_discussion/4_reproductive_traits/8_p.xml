<p>The pappus length and achene size of the investigated species responded to nutrient addition differently. The pappus length of native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> increased under the fertilization treatment, which likely increased its dispersal potential. In contrast, 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> had shorter pappi and larger achene areas when grown in nutrient‐rich soil; therefore, its dispersal ability is expected to decrease under such conditions. The plasticity of the achene morphology in 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> likely allows it to occupy favorable habitats, thereby increasing its population size and expansion rate.
