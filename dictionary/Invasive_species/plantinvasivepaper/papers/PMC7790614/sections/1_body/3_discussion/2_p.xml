<p>Invasive 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> exhibited higher phenotypic plasticity in most measured traits compared to the noninvasive alien 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> or native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic>. However, differential plastic responses to environmental treatments rarely altered the ranking of trait values among the three 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species, except for the number of inflorescences. The trait values and plasticity of the pappus length and achene size also differed among the investigated species and could potentially affect the dispersal efficiency.
