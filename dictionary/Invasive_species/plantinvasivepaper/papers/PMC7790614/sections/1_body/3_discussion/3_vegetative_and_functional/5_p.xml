<p>The representative functional traits of invasive plant species include high SLAs and low R/S ratios, which are associated with greater resource capture abilities and faster growth rates (Gallagher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; van Kleunen, Weber, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Leishman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The R/S ratios of the three investigated species were not plastic in response to environmental treatments, and invasive 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> exhibited lower R/S ration than did native and alien noninvasive 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species across treatments. The homeostatic maintenance of a low R/S ratio would be beneficial particularly in a high‐nutrient environment (Gioria &amp; Osborne, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>); this likely explains the plastic increase of shoot biomass observed in 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic>. The three investigated species exhibited similar SLAs in the no‐competition treatment, while the SLA of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> was larger than that of the other species in the competition treatment. Since the effects of high SLA on the resource capture ability would be manifest in a high‐nutrient environment without competition (Gioria &amp; Osborne, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), the contribution of SLA to the competitive ability of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> would be limited.
