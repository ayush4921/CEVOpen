<p>The trait values of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> were similar to or even lower than those of noninvasive alien 
 <italic>B. pilosa,</italic> though 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> exhibited higher plasticity in most of the vegetative and functional traits. For instance, the plant height and biomass of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> increased when plants were grown without competition, but 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> had a shorter stature and similar biomass relative to those of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37071-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,d). Leaf chlorophyll content showed a similar pattern, such that the chlorophyll content of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> increased in response to the nutrient addition but remained lower than that of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>. As van Kleunen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) pointed out, the comparison of invasive versus noninvasive alien species is more appropriate for the identification of candidate traits determining invasive success than is the comparison of invasive versus native species. Our result suggests that the high plasticity of vegetative and functional traits likely play a limited role in the invasive success of alien 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> even though it would contribute to the competitive advantages of invasive 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> over native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic>.
