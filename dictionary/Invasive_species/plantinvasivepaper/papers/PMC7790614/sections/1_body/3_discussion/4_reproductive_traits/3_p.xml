<p>A previous meta‐analysis showed that the fitness components of invasive plants tended to be more plastic than those of native and noninvasive alien plants in response to nutrient availability (Davidson et al.,

For instance, alien and native weedy species exhibited similar responses to fertilization and competition (Dawson et al.,
