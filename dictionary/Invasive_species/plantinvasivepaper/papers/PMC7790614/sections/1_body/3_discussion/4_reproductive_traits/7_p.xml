<p>Long‐distance dispersal has been suggested as a key characteristic of the rapid range expansion of invasive species (Coutts et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). However, it should be noted that the fitness advantage of more distant dispersal depends on the ecological context. For instance, seeds that disperse further from maternal plants likely have a higher probability of facing novel environmental conditions. Because annual and biennial plants die after reproduction, no competition between maternal plants and offspring occurs. Thus, if the habitats of maternal plants provide favorable conditions for plant growth, annual plants would reap greater benefits from a short dispersal distance than from distant dispersal to novel environmental conditions. Through short‐distance dispersal, a population possibly accumulates large numbers of fruits that are sufficient to disperse into a novel habitat and establish there (Coutts et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Hemrová et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Since 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> mainly occurs in agricultural fields with nutrient‐rich soil, a shorter dispersal distance and the accumulation of propagules would better promote its rapid expansion than would long‐distance dispersal.
