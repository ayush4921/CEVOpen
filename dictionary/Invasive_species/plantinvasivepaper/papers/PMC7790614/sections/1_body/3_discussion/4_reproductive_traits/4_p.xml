<p>In this study, the total biomass and inflorescence number exhibited similar plasticity patterns in response to the experimental treatments. However, only the inflorescence number showed differential trait values among the tested species. The total biomass of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> and 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> was similar even though the plasticity of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> was higher than that of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>. While fecundity is a more appropriate fitness measure than biomass for annual plant species (Crawley,

 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Our results suggested that the choice of fitness components might lead to contrasting conclusions, and diverse fitness components should be examined to evaluate the significance of traits associated with invasive success.
