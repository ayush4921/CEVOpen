<p>Invasive plants tend to have smaller seed sizes, potentially increasing their dispersal distance (Rejmánek &amp; Richardson, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). In 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species, however, the length of pappi, in addition to the achene size, should be considered to evaluate the dispersal potential, since pappus length would affect the attachment and retention of achenes to animal furs (Couvreur et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Kiviniemi &amp; Telenius, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Sorensen, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). Studies comparing seeds from multiple species found that seeds with more extensive spines were transported longer than seeds with short awns (Ansong &amp; Pickering, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Couvreur et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), indicating that a longer seed appendage likely has a positive effect on seed dispersal. In this study, the achenes of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> were smaller and featured longer pappi than those of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37071-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i,j). Given that dispersal distance via adhesion has a positive relationship with the length of seed appendages but a negative correlation with the achene size, the noninvasive alien 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> had a higher dispersal potential than did invasive alien 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic>. The achenes of 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> had the longest pappi and largest achene size among the three tested species, so it remains unclear whether it has a lower dispersal potential than the other species.
