<p>Invasive 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> produced more inflorescences than did native and noninvasive alien 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species, though this difference was manifested only when plants were grown without competition. Such a fecundity advantage would enhance the invasive success of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> and provide a competitive advantage over native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic>. 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> exhibited a similar number of inflorescences across environmental treatments.
