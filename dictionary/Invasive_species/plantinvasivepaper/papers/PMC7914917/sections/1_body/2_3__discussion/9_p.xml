<p>Concerning the anti-proliferative activity of the thionins, it should be noted that the cytotoxic effects of 6-Cys thionin viscotoxin from 
 <italic>Viscum album</italic> are well-known. Still, the properties of 8-Cys thionins are relatively less studied despite the proposed anti-cancer drug prototypes that represent one more novel aspect of this investigation. We examined NsW2 for cytotoxic properties on two tumor lines and one non-tumor cell line. NsW2 showed an activity level comparable with purothionins and phoratoxins, according to IC

 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but there was no significant difference between the cell lines tested. Most biological activities of thionins are directly related to their interaction with plasma membranes. However, there are also some secondary effects, including interactions with nucleic acids, that are certainly not associated with cell membrane disruption.
