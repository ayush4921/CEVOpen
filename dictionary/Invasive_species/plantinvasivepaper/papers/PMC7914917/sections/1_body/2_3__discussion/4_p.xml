<p>Sequence analysis of the dominant nigellothionins (NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4) identified single amino acid substitutions mostly inside the C-terminal fragment, and in the second α-helix. It is unusual that a substitution, localized in position 19 of the polypeptide chain and inserted into a β-hairpin connecting two α-helices, is critical for biological activity—the hydrophobic Met and Ile residues in the NsWs are absent for all other plant thionins containing preliminary positive charged or neutral amino acids. This site is the most divergent, as described earlier. In addition, all of the sequenced nigellothionins have a high positive charge (+9.0 … +11.0) at neutral pH value; thus, they could be classified as the members of thionin class I subfamily, and their functions might be similar to purothionins from cereals [

 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, the surface topography for thionins might be similar to the α-hairpinins that determine biological activity: thus, the β-hairpin site inside the structure of plant hairpin-like peptides is a key factor of target biological activities, including antibacterial [
