<p>Thionins can rapidly permeabilize fungal membranes, as indicated in fluorescent dye experiments [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous studies have reported antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> for the nigellothionins NsW1 and NsW2 [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, four pathogenic yeast isolates were subjected to NsW2 treatment, and three of them were sensitive to peptide action. The anti-yeast activity of thionins is established. 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is also used in functional studies as a model organism [
