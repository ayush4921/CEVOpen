<p>Nigellothionins also possess antifungal effects, but they disappear on the second day of incubation. This can be explained by fermentative hydrolysis of peptides by fungal proteases [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. EcAMP1, a plant antimicrobial peptide with α-helical structural motif, was previously shown to penetrate fungal conidia [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, we can speculate about peptide redistribution among fungal cells and the surrounding media. When NsW2 partially enters the cells, it inhibits fungal growth in a high-concentration manner. The extracellular quantity of this peptide decreases, and the peptide might still act in a “low concentration” manner. Still, the activity of the peptide could not be detected via the disc-diffusion assay.
