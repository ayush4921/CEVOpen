<p>Plant thionins possess various functional effects, including antimicrobial and antitumor; the primary mechanism of action is associated with membrane activity [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previously, we isolated and identified two major thionins (NsW1 and NsW2) from black cumin (
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>). These molecules were found to have antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We also found plasma membrane permeability and deformation of the cellular surface on yeast [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The extraction procedure included water-acidic treatment followed by acetone precipitation of proteins and peptides. After desalting, the extract was fractionated by three-step liquid chromatography (affinity, size-exclusion, and reversed-phase HPLC), and thionins were isolated [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It was found that fraction four from affinity chromatography was poor in high-positively charged proteins, so the fractionation procedure was simplified by the reduction in gel filtration. 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds are rich in basic high-molecular-weight proteins, and some of them are storage proteins [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previously, we reported antimicrobial peptides NsLTP1, belonging to the lipid-transfer proteins, and NsD1/D2, the representatives of plant defensin families. These peptides have been isolated from a total fraction eluted by 100 mM NaCl from heparin-sepharose column (affinity medium-pressure chromatography) [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. NsLTP1 was isolated using a two-step chromatography approach without molecular weight separation. As a result, its quantity and purity were low [
 <xref rid="B25-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. NsD1/D2 was not visualized at all. Thus, cation-exchange low-pressure separation onaCM52 column was used to optimize a scheme and remove all storage proteins identified as 7S and 11S globulins according to N-terminal sequencing results (our unpublished data).
