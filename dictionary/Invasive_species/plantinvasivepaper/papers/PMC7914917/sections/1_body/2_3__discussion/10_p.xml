<p>It was shown that the critical dose directly associated with toxicity and membrane lysis is 1 μM [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here, we report a significant decrease in cellular viability at a thionin concentration below 1 µM (0.2–0.55 µM). The cytotoxic effects of β-purothionin from wheat (
 <italic>T. aestivum</italic>) can form ion channels in artificial membranes at 1 µM [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These results correlate with those previously determined for other tumor cell lines (Jukart, RD, AsPC-1, and Colo357) that were inhibited at IC50 from 0.36 to 0.75 μM [
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We suggest an alternative mechanism of thionin toxicity, which takes place at their low concentrations in contrast to the principal membrane-associated mechanism. Here, we confirm this by the heterochromatin condensation in buccal epithelial cells in response to NsW2 treatment at concentrations less than 1 µM. These data indicate that, at low concentrations, NsW2 enters the cellular nucleus and forms complexes with nucleoproteids via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Supportive evidence was obtained in a previous study on direct suppression of some oncogenes in rhabdomyosarcoma cells encoding matrix metalloproteinases (
 <italic>MMP-7, MMP-13</italic>), miRNA (
 <italic>Mir21</italic>), transforming protein RhoA (
 <italic>RhoA</italic>), and apoptosis inhibitor-1 (
 <italic>IAP-1</italic>)—possible regulators of transcriptional activity in eukaryotic cells [
