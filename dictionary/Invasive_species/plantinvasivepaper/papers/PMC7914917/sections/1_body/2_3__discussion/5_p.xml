<p>The antifungal activity of thionins is well-known. Most studies are devoted to thionin interactions with phytopathogenic fungi. However, there are few studies on their activity against opportunistic fungi and representatives of genus 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> causative agents of invasive mycosis and allergy. Nigellothionins NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4 were tested against four 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species. All nigellothionins were active against three of four strains tested, and the activity levels were similar for all peptides. The minor differences of their activity observed might be related to local substitutions in the peptidesâ€™ sequences, as indicated above. There was only one study of thionin activity against a representative of the genus 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. Molina et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] tested wheat (
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) type I thionins on a wide range of fungi, including 
 <italic>A. nidulans</italic>; the fungus appeared to be sensitive to a mixture of thionins.
