<p>Here, we report a diversity of high cationic biologically active thionin peptides localized in black cumin (
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>) seeds. We also characterize the structure of these active thionin peptides and their biological activities towards eukaryotic organisms (fungi and yeasts) and cell lines in vitro.
