<p>To identify possible relationships and the specific mode of NsW2 action on eukaryotic cell lines, we also tested this thionin on human buccal epithelium cells to evaluate heterochromatin condensation as the indicator of replication activity inside the cells. The reliable effect of NsW2 was detected at 0.4 ÂµM (
