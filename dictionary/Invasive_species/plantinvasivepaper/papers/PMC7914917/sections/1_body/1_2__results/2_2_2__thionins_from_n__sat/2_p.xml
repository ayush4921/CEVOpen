<p>Antifungal activity of NsW2 and NsW4 against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. was equal, whereas NsW2 was less active towards 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> 2K and 
 <italic>A. oryzae</italic> 1K but not on 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> 3K. The activity of all peptides tested against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was comparable to reference polyene cyclic antibiotic AmB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00166-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, none of the major nigellothionins inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> or of the control antifungal drugs.
