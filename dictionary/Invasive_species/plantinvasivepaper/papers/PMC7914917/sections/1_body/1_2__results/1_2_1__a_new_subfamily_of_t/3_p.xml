<p>Three major compounds (NsW1, NsW2 and NsW4) were collected for further experiments. It was shown that there is no contamination, and peptides are chromatographicaly pure (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00166">Figure S2</xref>.). The total yield of these peptides per 1 g of seeds was 15 µg NsW2, 11 µg NsW1 and 2.7 µg NsW4.
