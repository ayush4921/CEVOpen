<p>We observed a different pattern of cellular response to the NsW2 peptide incubation. HCT-116 cells showed an obvious concentration-dependent reaction on NsW2; the viability of HPF and B16 cells decreased by up to 50% and remained at the same level regardless of the increase in NsW2 concentration. The cell lines’ sensitivities to doxorubicin were not different. Thus, there is a relatively direct proportion between NsW2 and doxorubicin action towards HCT-116 cells, whereas the reactions of HTC-116 and HPF on doxorubicin were similar. Cell viability after NsW2 treatment decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. B16 cells were resistant to this compound up to 0.8 µM (
