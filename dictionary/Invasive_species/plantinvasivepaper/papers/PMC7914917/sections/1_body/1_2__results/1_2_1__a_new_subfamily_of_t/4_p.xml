<p>The complete sequences of the predominant thionins (NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4) were determined by Edman automated sequencing. All these peptides consist of 46 amino acid residues, including eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide bridges. They are identical and have local structural differences represented by single amino acid substitutions (Ile19Met, Ala27Ser, Ile35Ser, Trn36Ser, Lys39Trn, and Arg42Pro) (

Searching the sequence homology of NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4 to other thionins annotated in UniProtKB/SwissProt databases showed the differences in sequence similarity (
