<p>NsW2 was active against all clinical fungal cultures tested. The level of growth inhibition by NsW2 against most fungi was approximately equal between the variants and comparable to the cultures from the collection (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00166-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It is important to note that nigellothionin NsW2 was active towards the clinical isolate of 
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> while it was inactive on the culture from the collection. 
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> has an exceptional position within the genus 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> due to its intrinsic resistance against the polyene AmB. Our results confirm the complete resistance to AmB for both of the 
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> cultures previously tested [
