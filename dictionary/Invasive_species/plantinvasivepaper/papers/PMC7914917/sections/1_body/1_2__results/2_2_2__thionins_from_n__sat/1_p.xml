<p>Three nigellothionins (NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4) isolated from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds were tested against conditionally pathogenic 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> strains to reveal their antifungal activity (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00166-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All thionins tested have a comparative antifungal activity towards three of four fungal species (
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> 3K, 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> 2K, and 
 <italic>A. oryzae</italic> 1K).
