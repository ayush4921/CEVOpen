<p>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis treatment is initiated after conidia germination in patients; thus, it is important to identify a compound with fungicidal activity against the hyphal elongation of germinated conidia of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species. We monitored growth dynamics for three clinical isolates (
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> 1133, 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> 163m, and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> 905m) under the nigellothionin time-dependent decreasing of activity after 1, 2, and 5 days of incubation. The effectiveness of the NsW2 decreased over time. All fungal cultures tested were inhibited by thionin after 1 day of incubation.
