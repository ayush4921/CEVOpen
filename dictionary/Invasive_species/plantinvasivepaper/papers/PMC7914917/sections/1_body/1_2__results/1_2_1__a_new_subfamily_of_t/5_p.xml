<p>Surprisingly, hellithionin D isolated from purple-red (
 <italic>Helleborus purpurescens</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was not similar to 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> thionins even though both plants belong to the 
 <italic>Ranunculaceae</italic> family. At the same time, viscotoxin-A3, a member of the 6-cysteine thionins subfamily, demonstrates 70% homology with nigellothionins, which is very unusual. Concerning local differences in the amino acid sequences, a site between Cys4 and Cys5 represented by two α-helices connected with β-turn shows the maximal structure variability in plant thionins. For instance, α-purothionin [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] has a maximal variable amino acid substitutions in relation to nigellothionins and all other homologous peptides. One more differential peculiarity is associated with Pro42Arg substitution in the NsW2 structure relative to other nigellothionins and thionins from other plants. The C-terminus for all plant thionins is represented by a random coil that is consequently unstructured. However, this fragment contains two proline residues providing a spatial turn. The above-mentioned substitution can affect the three-dimensional orientation of the NsW2 peptide. These traits might be critical with respect to further structure-functional investigations in terms of modes of action of nigellothionins. Finally, we note that nigellothionins are much less similar to all homologous species found and phylogenetically stand out on a separate branch (
