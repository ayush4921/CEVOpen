<p>All compounds obtained were initially characterized and identified by HPLC/ESI-MS and N-terminal sequencing (20 amino acid residues were determined) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00166">Figure S1</xref>). Fractions were eluted from the HPLC column during the time interval of 25 to 31 min. The molecular masses were measured in a range of 5.0–5.3 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequencing coupled with BLASTP searches allowed us to identify all samples as thionins (called NsW1–9) with an 8-Cys motif (class I/II), characteristic of the family of antimicrobial peptides annotated as defense molecules of plant innate immunity. They are constitutive and inducible (PR-proteins class 13) [

 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two out of three major peptides (fractions 3 and 6) were identified as NsW1 and NsW2, reported in our previous paper [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; another peptide (fraction 4) is a novel peptide termed NsW4. A single amino acid substitution Met19Ile at position 19 was found in NsW2–4. A unique Lys1Gly substitution was found in NsW8–9. NsW8–9 differ from other homologues isolated from all plant thionins reported previously [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, black cumin (
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>) seeds contain a group of highly homologous peptides belonging to the thionin family with an 8-cysteine motif; most of these are expressed in low quantities. Based on their partial sequences, we hypothesize that these peptides compose a subfamily.
