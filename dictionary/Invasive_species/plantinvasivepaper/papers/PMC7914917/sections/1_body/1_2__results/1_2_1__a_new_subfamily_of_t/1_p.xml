<p>Here, we used an approach similar to that used in our previous work when two antimicrobial thionins (NsW1 and NsW2) were isolated [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One significant change was applied. Fraction 4 (where thionins were found) did not contain any high-molecular-weight proteins; this allows us to reduce the size-exclusion chromatography step. The resulting scheme of the thionins isolation from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extract consists of affinity FPLC and reversed-phase HPLC of the most bounded fraction 4 (eluted by 1 M NaCl) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00166-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Nine fractions were collected: three major (3, 4, and 6), and six minor (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9).
