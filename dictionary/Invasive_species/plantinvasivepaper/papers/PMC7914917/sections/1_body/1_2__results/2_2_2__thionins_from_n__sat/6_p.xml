<p>NsW2 was tested against triazole-resistant yeasts with decreased susceptibility to statins. Thionin showed moderate activity against 
 <italic>Sacharomyces. cerevisiae</italic> 77S, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus laurentii</italic> 801M, and 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> 1447N (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00166-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). It is worth noting that 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> 1402m was not sensitive to this compound. All other cultures tested were suppressed by the addition of the NsW2 peptide. The inhibition zones were similar to AmB.
