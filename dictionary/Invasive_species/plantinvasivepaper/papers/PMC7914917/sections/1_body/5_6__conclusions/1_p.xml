<p>In conclusion, black cumin (
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>) seeds contain homologous antimicrobial peptides (NsW1–9). These peptides belong to the thionins family from class I and can be classified as members of a subfamily called nigellothionins based on their high similarity. A complete amino sequence was determined for three of the nigellothionins (NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4). These have low similarity with other plant thionins containing 8-cysteine motifs inside two β-turn-linked α-helices. NsW1, NsW2, and NsW4 showed significant inhibition of the collection 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species comparable to commercial antibiotic Amphotericin B. NsW2 was active against azole-resistant clinical isolates of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> at a micromolar range of active concentrations. We report different levels of susceptibility of the microorganisms tested to the thionin action involving a stable time-dependent decrease in activity. These effects are explained by membrane-associated interactions with the target cells. The nigellothionin NsW2 demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity against tumor and normal cell lines as well as heterochromatin condensation at active concentrations less than 1 μM. Our data provide new insights into the possible alternative mode of action different from direct interactions with the cell membrane, which might occur via cell penetration.
