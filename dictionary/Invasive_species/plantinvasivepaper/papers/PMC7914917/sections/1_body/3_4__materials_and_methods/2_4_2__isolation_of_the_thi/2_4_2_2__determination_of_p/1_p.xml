<p>Purity of collected peptides was checked by RP-HPLC on an analytical column Luna C
 <sub>18</sub> 100 × 2.0, 3 µm, 100Å (Phenomenex, Torrans, CA, USA). Mobile phase was the same as the previous experiments. Analysis was carried out at a flow rate of 0.27 mL/min in linear gradient of Solvent B (5–50% for 10 min; 50–75% for 3 min; 75–90% for 1 min; 90% for 3 min; 90–5% for 3 min, after that the column was re-equilibrated with 5%B for 4 min). Purity was estimated using the ChemStation for LC systems software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
