<p>To reduce disulfide bonds, peptides were dissolved in 40 µL of 0.5 M Tris–HCl buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 2 mM EDTA (disodium salt), pH 8.2, and incubated at 40 °C overnight. Five microliters of 2-propanol and 4 µL of 0.7 M 1.4-dithiothreitol in water were added to the reaction mixture, vortexed and incubated at 40 °C for 4 h. For alkylation, 4 µL of 50% (
