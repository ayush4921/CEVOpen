<p>Re-chromatography and mass-spectrometric analysis of the components collected after reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a LC-MS/MS API 2000 chromatograph (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The separation was carried out using a Waters C
 <sub>18</sub> 3 × 100 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, 3 μm (Waters, Wexford, Ireland) analytical column in isocratic condition, at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and monitoring of absorption at 210 nm. Sixty percent acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA was used as a mobile phase. The 50 μL of the sample was applied using an autosampler instrument. Data were obtained in a positive auto MS mode at a temperature of 250 °C and an ion spray voltage of 4500 V.
