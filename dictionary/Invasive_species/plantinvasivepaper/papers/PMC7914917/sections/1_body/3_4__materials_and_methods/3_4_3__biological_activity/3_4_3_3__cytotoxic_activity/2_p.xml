<p>Briefly, cells (5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> in 190 mL of culture medium) were plated in a 96-well plate and treated with 0.1% DMSO (blank control) or with nigellothionin NsW2 (0,1 to 50 µM; each concentration in duplicate) for 72 h. After incubation with the peptide, 20 µL of aqueous MTT solution (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/mL) was added into each well for 2–3 h. Formazan was dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured. The cytotoxicity at given NsW2 concentrations was calculated as the percentage of absorbance in wells with peptide-treated cells to that of blank control cells (100%). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% growth inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of NsW2 that inhibited MTT conversion by 50%. All experiments were repeated three times, and each time in triplicate [
