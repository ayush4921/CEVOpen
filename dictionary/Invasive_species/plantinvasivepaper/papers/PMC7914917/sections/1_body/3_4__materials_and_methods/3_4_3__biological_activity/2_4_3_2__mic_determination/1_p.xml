<p>Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were detected in a serial dilution assay with the purified compounds according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) protocol [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Tests were carried out by taking a 100 mL stock solution of the peptide in a two-fold serial dilution at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 64 mg/mL (0.1–12 µM) in DMSO (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The assays were conducted in 96-well microtiter plates (BioCell Technology, Irvine, CA, USA) in RPMI 1640 (PanEco, Moscow, Russia) medium without the addition of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>. Amphotericin B (AmB) was used as a positive control; the nutrient medium was used as a negative control. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. MIC values were defined as the lowest concentration of compounds at which the microorganisms treated demonstrated no visible growth after 48 h of incubation. Assays were performed three times in triplicate
