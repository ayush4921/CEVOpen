<p>The analysis of heterochromatin granulation located in nuclei of human buccal epithelium cells was performed as described by Shckorbatov et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The increase in heterochromatin granule quantity (HGQ) indicates the decrease in transcriptional activity in the nuclei of cells. The cells treated with 0.08–1.9 µM of NsW2, as well as control cells, were stained with orsein for 20 min. The cell nuclei were inspected by means of microscope with 400-fold magnification.
