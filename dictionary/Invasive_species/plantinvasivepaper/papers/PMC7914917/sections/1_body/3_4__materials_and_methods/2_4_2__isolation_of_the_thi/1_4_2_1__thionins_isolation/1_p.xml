<p>Isolation of the thionins from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds was conducted as described previously [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with minor modifications. After the crushing of the seeds, followed by acetic extraction and precipitation with ice-cold acetone, a total pellet was air-dried and redissolved in excess of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Then, initial separation by solid-phase extraction was carried out using reversed-phase HPLC on an Aquapore C8 column (10 × 100 mm
 <sup>2</sup>) (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The mobile phases were 0.1% TFA (Solvent A) and 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA (Solvent B). After washing of all unbounded organic salts and other hydrophilic components, proteins and peptides were eluted with 75% solvent B. The extract was evaporated using a Speedvac concentrator (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and lyophilized. A protein–peptide extract was then redissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and applied on a Heparin-HiTrap Sepharose 5 mL (GE HealthCare, Chicago, IL, USA) affinity column for further fractionating by the charge in a stepwise gradient of NaCl. Four combined fractions were obtained: unbound compounds 0 mM NaCl (fraction 1); 100mM NaCl (fraction 2); 500 mM NaCl (fraction 3); 1000 mM NaCl (fraction 4). Fraction 4 (thionin-rich fraction, 1 M NaCl) was separated by analytical reversed-phase HPLC on an XBridge C
 <sub>18</sub> (4.6 × 250 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, 5 µm, 300 Å) column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) in a linear Solvent B gradient (10–50% B) for 60 min at a flow rate of 0.95 mL/min and 42 °C. The elution of peptides was monitored at 214 nm [
