<p>The cytotoxicity of Nigellothionin NsW2 was determined by the MTT-test (formazan conversion assay). The following cell lines were used for the experiments: HCT-116 (human colon carcinoma, ATCC) and B16 (mouse melanoma). Human postnatal fibroblasts were used as a normal cell line. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control. Cells were cultivated in Dulbecco modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere. Experiments were carried out on cells in the logarithmic phase of growth. The peptide was dissolved in DMSO as a 10 mM stock solution followed by serial dilutions in water immediately before the experiment.
