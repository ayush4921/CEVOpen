  <p>Cytotoxic activity of NsW2 in vitro. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control. Concentration dependence is shown by a solid line with black dots; the activity of doxorubicin is shown by a dashed line with white dots (♦) HPF cell line; (◊) HPF cell line with doxorubicin; (■) B16 cell line with NsW2; (□) B16 cell line with doxorubicin; (●) HTC-116 cell line with NsW2; (○) HTC-116 cell line with doxorubicin. Error bars represent mean ±S.E. (three independent experiments performed in triplicate).</p>
