<p id="Par32">Herein the obtained black colored biochar is graphitized by a two-step process that involves an acid treatment and is followed by a heat treatment at different temperatures in the N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. To start with, 3M of the hydrochloric acid solution was added to the above-mentioned biochar and was kept undisturbed for 6 hours at room temperature and the solution was washed several times with DD water to remove unreacted biochar and to maintain pH level at ~7. Further, the biochar was dried at 90 ± 3 °C for overnight. The obtained black colored powder was mixed well-using agate mortar and then annealed at ~450 °C, ~850 °C and ~1000 °C temperature for 3 hours in an argon atmosphere and the final obtained porous graphitic carbon samples were labeled as EC-GC4, EC-GC8, and EC-GC10 respectively.
