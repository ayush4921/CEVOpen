<p id="Par31">The biochar from the invasive plant was prepared using the ‘ancient Indian oil lamp heating method’. In this, the stems and leaves of the 
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic> (EC) plants were taken as the precursors for the preparation of biochar. Then the ECs plant parts were chopped into tiny pieces and were washed with deionized water and ethanol at 60 ± 2 °C to remove all the unwanted impurities. Then the cleaned ECs were dried under shadow for 2 days and then dried in direct sunlight for 12 hours and further, the ECs pieces were heated overnight using the ancient Indian oil lamp method. In this low-temperature carbonization process, the invasive ECs have been converted into black colored biochar which could be used further for the extraction of porous graphitic carbon materials.
