 </sup>. From this, 349.7 mg of CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>I was taken and dissolved in 1 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF). Then 0.203 mg of lead (II) chloride (PbCl
 <sub>2</sub>) was slowly added and the mixture was stirred and heated at 90 ± 2 °C for 2 hours and the obtained final mixed halide perovskite (CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub>) solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Further, the CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> solution was stirred vigorously with 0.001 g of EC-GC10 porous graphitic carbon sample dissolved in chlorobenzene and was ultrasonicated for 10 minutes. The obtained final heterogeneous mixture solution was kept for further process to be used as an interfacial layer of PSCs.
