<p id="Par2">Lower cost, shorter payback time and an unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) escalating from 3.8% in 2009 to 24.2% (2019) have turned the attention of researchers and industrial community towards perovskite solar cells (PSCs) within a decade

 </sup>. Outstanding photovoltaic properties such as high charge carrier mobility, long electron-hole diffusion length, high absorption coefficient with tuneable bandgap property, low-exciton binding energy, and easy solution preparation techniques make it to compete with traditional commercial silicon solar cells

 </sup>. In general, a typical PSC is composed of an electron transport layer (ETL), an active absorbing layer, a HTL, and a counter electrode. Nevertheless, the use of expensive and unstable conducting polymers based hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) and poly [bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) which costs around ~$ 500 and ~$ 3,000 per gram respectively and also their instability issues towards thermal and moisture strictly restricts their usage in practical applications

 </sup>. Similarly, the use of expensive noble metal electrode precursors such as gold (Au), silver (Ag) and aluminium (Al) with energy-intensive techniques for the deposition of back contact further hinders the onsite commercial production
