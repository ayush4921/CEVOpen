<p id="Par4">With all the above previous reports, the present study focuses to enhance the air and moisture stability of the carbon based PSCs at low-cost for the onsite photovoltaic application. Herein, we have demonstrated the facile preparation of graphitic carbon from an invasive waste plant (
 <italic>Eichhornia Crassipes</italic>) which can be effectively used as an efficient hole transporter/back electrode – a dual role in PSCs. In general, 
 <italic>Eichhornia Crassipes</italic> (Family: Pontederiaceae) commonly called water hyacinth is an aquatic weed that can easily spread and interfere in an ecosystem by posing a serious threat to the native biodiversity, leading to economic loss worldwide. Moreover, the influence of this plant on freshwater results in a waning of oxygen level which leads to the death of huge aquatic plants and animals. Furthermore, it also results in a drop in temperature, pH value, and nutrient levels. In fact, this 
 <italic>Eichhornia Crassipes</italic> plant has been included by the world conservation union (IUCN) in the list of 100 most dangerous invasive species
