<p id="Par14">Some previous reports on the addition of excess chlorine ions into the perovskite structure have mentioned that this has resulted in providing a significant impact on their morphology with improved crystallization which in turn plays a pivot role in achieving better photovoltaic performance

 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>Cl precursor into the CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> perovskites. The optical properties of the prepared mixed halide perovskite (CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub>) has been depicted in the Supplementary Information Figs.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref>. Furthermore, high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images have also been used to analyze the morphological features and are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c,d)</xref>. The results show, the presence of a well-crystallized polygonal perovskite structure having a ‘d’ spacing value of about 0.67 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane which correlates with the plane value observed in XRD result. Moreover, the results observed in the present work also correlate with the previous works of Qi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. and Spencer 
 <italic>et al</italic>., in which they have stated that the incorporation of chlorine specifically has an impact on the structural and morphological properties of the perovskite films, which could result in achieving an improved optoelectronic characteristics and this may help in achieving an enhanced PV performance
