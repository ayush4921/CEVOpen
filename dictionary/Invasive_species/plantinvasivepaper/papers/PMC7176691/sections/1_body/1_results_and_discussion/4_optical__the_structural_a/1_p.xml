 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> perovskite is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a)</xref>. The intense peaks centered at 13.97°, 28.35°, 31.76°, and 40.42° correspond to (110), (220), (330) and (440) planes respectively and all the obtained peaks are in accordance with the previously reported works on methylammonium lead halide perovskites.
