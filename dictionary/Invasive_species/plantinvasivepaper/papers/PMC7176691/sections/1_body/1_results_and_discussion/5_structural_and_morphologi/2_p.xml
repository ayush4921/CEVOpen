<p id="Par16">The diffraction pattern of the graphitic carbon encapsulated perovskite (EC-GC10@CH

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref>. In this, an additional diffraction peak found at 2θ = 26.12° (002 plane), could be ascribed to the existence of the hexagonal graphitic carbon [JCPDS file no 75–1621]

 </sup>. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 13.97°, 28.35°, 31.76°, and 40.42° corresponding to (110), (220), (330) and (440) planes respectively of tetragonal perovskite structure were also observed. Here the intensity of all the perovskite peaks is comparatively less when compared to that of pure perovskite peaks, which could be due to the occupation of the graphitic carbon atoms in the apical sites of the perovskite, this also substantiates the formation of encapsulated EC-GC10@CH

 <sub>3</sub>PbI

 <sub>x</sub> structure. Due to the availability of 6p electron in the Pb
 <sup>2+</sup>sites, there is strong coordination between Pb
 <sup>2+</sup> ion with C=O group in the porous graphitic carbon, and this is believed to be the reason behind the encapsulation mechanism
