<p id="Par7">Raman spectroscopy is found to be an effective and accurate identification method than XRD in identifying the amorphous and crystalline nature of the several types of carbon such as diamond, graphite, diamond-like carbon, and carbon nitride, etc., and to ascertain the amount of defects in carbon materials due to the structural changes in the graphitic microstructures

 </sup>. The peak position and the heights of the prepared graphitic carbon (EC-GC4, EC-GC8, and EC-GC10) samples analyzed using Raman spectra shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, comprises of two predominant bands namely D-band (D for the disorder) and G-band (G for Graphite). Indeed, the G peak centered at 1586 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1603 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for samples EC-GC4, EC-GC8 and EC-GC10 respectively correspond to the vibration of sp
 <sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms which indicates the existence of nanocrystalline graphitic carbon atoms

 <sup>−1</sup>, 1358 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1356 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for the samples EC-GC4, EC-GC8 and EC-GC10 respectively attribute to the defect induced disordered graphitic (D-band) microstructures corresponding to the vibrations of sp

 </sup>. Consequently, the ratio of D to G peak intensities (I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub>) was measured to probe the defects in the prepared graphitic carbon samples. The I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> value of the prepared samples was found to be 0.96, 0.93 and 0.75 respectively. Hence, the observed changes in the height and sharpness of the D and G peak with respect to the annealing temperature reveals the graphitic nature of the prepared samples. As the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> value of the EC-GC10 is found to be less when compared to that of the other samples, it suggests that ~1000 °C annealed sample has sp
 <sup>2</sup> hybridization with a high degree of graphitization. The as-prepared porous graphitic carbon indicates the existence of nanocrystalline graphite, which could provide more active sites which in turn facilitates the charge transfer behavior in carbon microstructures. The obtained Raman spectra correlates with the XRD results of the prepared EC-GC samples and the observed structural property with good crystallinity may be usefully used in the PSCs for improving the device performance
