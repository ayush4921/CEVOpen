 <sub>SC</sub> (20.50 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and FF (53.51%) when compared to that of the one with an interfacial layer (device-1
 <sup>c</sup>). The obtained PCE difference may be attributed to the better charge collection and lower recombination phenomena exhibited by the introduced interfacial layer in the fabricated device structure

 <italic>et al</italic>., shows that a better interfacial contact promotes fluent charge transfer at the interface and leads to a higher FF value for carbon-based PSCs
