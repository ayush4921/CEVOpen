<p id="Par6">The structural properties of the graphitic carbon extracted from an invasive plant waste by a simple green approach technique have been studied using the X-Ray diffraction (XRD) method. The XRD pattern for the prepared samples EC-GC4, EC-GC8 and EC-GC10 are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In this, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.50° for the ~450 °C annealed sample (EC-GC4) corresponds to the (100) plane. When the annealing temperature increases to ~850 °C (EC-GC8), a new peak is observed at 2θ value (22.27°) which corresponds to graphitic hexagonal (002) plane

 </sup>. The additional new peak confirms that the graphitization process has occurred in the sample EC-GC8. Further, the sample EC-GC10 annealed at the temperature of ~1000 °C, displays three dominant diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.27°, 33.91° and 47.67° which corresponds to the reflections from (002), (100) and (110) planes respectively. In this, the intensity of the graphitic plane (002) is more when compared to that of the EC-GC8 sample and a shift in the 2θ value from 26.50° to 33.91° of the (100) plane is observed, signifying the improved crystallization of the graphitic phase

 </sup>. The increase in the peak intensity reveals that the samples EC-GC8 and EC-GC10 annealed at ~850 °C and ~1000 °C achieved a better crystalline nature than the sample EC-GC4 prepared at ~450 °C. The (002) peak indicates the presence of graphitic carbon,  and the (002) peak comes from the sp
 <sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon. With an increase in annealing temperature from ~850 °C to ~1000 °C, the (002) peak becomes more prominent, indicating the improvement of the graphitization degree with respect to the annealing temperature. This graphitic crystalline nature might have been enhanced due to the removal of impurities and ash from the sample because of annealing effect
