<p id="Par22">In addition to this, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(c)</xref> shows the comparative J-V curves of the carbon/nickel sulphide composite based HTM devices (device-1
 <sup>d</sup>) and commercial carbon based device(device-1
 <sup>e</sup>) along with the prepared EC-GC hole transport based devices. From the J-V curves, it could be inferred that the CC based HTM device shows an enhanced V
 <sub>OC</sub> (0.749 V) and FF (63.77%) compared to that of all the other devices and this may be mainly due to the presence of small graphite flakes and carbon black which has better conductivity

 </sup> and tends to provide much more favorable interfacial contact sites between the perovskite and the back electrode which improves the charge transport behavior

 </sup>. In general, the used commercial carbon paste contains TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles as a binder along with graphite and carbon black

 </sup>. With this, the lowering of HOMO energy level (with respect to the vacuum level) of the hole transport material in perovskite solar cells has been found to increase its open circuit voltage (V
 <sub>OC</sub>)

 </sup>. As the HOMO level of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> is lower compared to carbon, here the increase in open circuit voltage for the commercial carbon paste basded device could be due to this shift induced by the addition of TiO
 <sub>2</sub>. The fabricated devices-1
 <sup>a–c</sup> exhibited a higher ‘J
 <sub>SC</sub>’ which may be mainly due to the increased charge carrier mobility resulting from the reduction in the recombination of electron-hole pairs. Herein, the introduced bio extracted porous graphitic carbon may act as a key factor in facilitating charge extraction/injection effectively at the perovskite/HTM interface and thereby enhances both the efficiency and stability of the fabricated devices

 </sup>. Similarly, the obtained J-V results have been compared with our previously reported work on PSCs fabricated using an inorganic nickel sulphide carbon composite (carbon/NiS) based HTM as they have a favorable deep-lying HOMO (valence band edge value) with work function from 5 eV–5.6 eV

 </sup>. It has been found that the device with highly transparent carbon/NiS used as a counter electrode achieved a higher FF (65.69%) compared to all the other demonstrated devices but exhibited only a low PCE of 3.19%. Further, some of the recent reports based on perovskite solar cells fabricated using different carbon-based HTMs are given in Table
