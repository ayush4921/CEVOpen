<p id="Par9">Conductivity measurements for the prepared graphitic carbon samples have been carried out under room temperature using a Hall Effect measurement (ECOPIA, HMS 2000) system. Annealing graphitic carbon samples increases the fraction of sp
 <sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon which influences the nature of charge transport. An increase in conductivity with respect to the annealing temperature is witnessed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which also confirms that these are influenced by the thermal and structural ordering. XRD and Raman results confirm the increasing order of graphitization with respect to the annealing temperature

 </sup>. From the observed conductivity tests, the positive sign of bulk concentration indicates that the majority carriers are holes and it is a p-type material. The mobility of charge carriers is found to increase with increase in annealing temperature. The resistivity value is observed to decrease with increase in annealing temperature and the values are 1.49 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> Ω cm, 1.46 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> Ω cm, 8.68 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> Ω cm as shown in Fig.
