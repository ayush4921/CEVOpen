<p id="Par17">From the high-resolution TEM images shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(c,d)</xref>, the perovskite crystals can be clearly seen in the darker region entrapped inside the capsules of 2 nm size lighter contrast graphitic carbon which has been marked with red dotted lines. The magnified images of the highlighted region show the lattice fringes having a ‘d’ spacing value of 0.61 nm, corresponding to the (110) interplanar spacing of tetragonal perovskite crystal plane which correlates well with the XRD results. From this, we could observe that the fringe spacing of perovskite obtained in the EC-GC10@CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> is less when compared to that of the CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> perovskite layer (0.67 nm) and this reduction may be due to the encapsulation obtained using graphitic carbon. This accumulative morphological evolution of the EC-GC10@CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> layer may be attributed to the slow crystallization induced by the encapsulation of porous graphitic carbon.
