<p id="Par11">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to study the elemental composition and to analyze the chemical states of the elements present in the prepared EC-GC10 sample. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d)</xref>, shows the survey spectrum (200–800 eV) of the graphitic carbon sample, which has peaks corresponding to C1
 <sub>S</sub> (288.9 eV) and O1
 <sub>S</sub> (536.87 eV). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(e)</xref>, displays the C1
 <sub>S</sub> spectrum recorded in the range from 282 to 292 eV and has been deconvoluted and shown as three dominant peaks. The presence of peaks centered at 284.3 eV, 285.7 eV and 287.3 eV corresponds to sp
 <sup>2</sup> C=C, sp
 <sup>3</sup> C–C and C=O respectively, and this reveals the presence of hybridized graphitic carbon
