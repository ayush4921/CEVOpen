<p id="Par28">In the present study, cost-effective and environmentally beneficial porous graphitic carbon has been synthesized from an invasive plant species of 
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic> and has been used for the sustainable fabrication of HTM/electrode in PSCs. The champion device exhibited a maximum PCE of 8.52% which may be attributed to the structural (graphitic nature) and morphological (porous nature) properties of the bio-prepared graphitic carbon. In addition, the introduced EC-GC encapsulated perovskite interfacial layer, helps in fighting the moisture degradation of CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> - perovskite structure and in reducing the recombination loss at the perovskite/HTM interface. The champion device exhibited better air stability, retaining its PCE up to 94.40%  of its initial PCE value even after 1000 hours, when exposed to the ambient environment and this could be attributed to the degree of graphitization obtained on annealing. The better performance of the fabricated devices against air and moisture is attributed to the naturally extracted EC-GC material which helps in facilitating the charge extraction/injection effectively at the perovskite/HTM junction. As a summary, an invasive plant extracted carbon has been used to play a dual role as HTM and as an electrode, and also together as an interfacial layer in a perovskite device.
