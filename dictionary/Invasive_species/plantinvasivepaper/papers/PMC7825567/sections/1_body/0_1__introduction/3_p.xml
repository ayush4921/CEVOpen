<p>A non-
 <italic>Candida</italic> fungal pathogen that also affects the immunocompromised is 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans.</italic> In the developing world, there are ~1 million cases of cryptococcal diseases per year, resulting in 675,000 deaths [

 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> is a major cause of fungal meningitis worldwide. 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> is further distinguished from 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species by 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic>’ ability to develop a capsule. The capsule acts as the main virulence factor of 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> by preventing the macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils in the immune system from effectively containing the fungus [

 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to its antiphagocytic functions, the capsule protects the fungus against desiccation in the environment [

 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> has also been reported to be able to develop increased resistance to common antifungals. A study in Uganda indicated that the MIC
 <sub>90</sub> of fluconazole to 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> increased from 8 μg/mL to 32 μg/mL between 1998 and 2014 [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, 31% of clinical isolates from that study were no longer susceptible to fluconazole [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While there are limited clinical antifungals available to manage these fungal pathogens, the increasing frequency of drug-resistance to available antifungals and their limitations including host toxicity, range of cellular targets, and oral bioavailability [
