<p>The effect of α-Cyperone on the 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> capsule was determined using a capsule inducing growth medium. It was achieved by incubating 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> cells in microtiter wells containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) for two days [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Since the MIC concentration of α-Cyperone was fungicidal, a sub-MIC concentration of α-Cyperone (16 µg/mL) was used. Culture wells without α-Cyperone (+solvent) served as the control. Triplicate wells were used and the experiment was repeated at least twice. Capsules were seen using India ink staining under a microscope (60 objective × 10× ocular lenses) and images were recorded using a camera attached to the microscope. The sizes of the capsules and cells in both the control and α-Cyperone treated cultures were calculated in µm using the scale bar function for scale measurements in the ImageJ software as described [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction (GraphPad). 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.0001 was considered statistically significant.
