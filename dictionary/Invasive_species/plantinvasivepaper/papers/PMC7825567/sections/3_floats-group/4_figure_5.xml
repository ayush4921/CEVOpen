  <p>α-Cyperone affects drug-resistant 
   <italic>C. auris</italic>, but has no effect on bacteria. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Inhibition of 
   <italic>C. auris</italic> growth as determined by a growth monitoring system (Bioscreen-C). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Absence of antibacterial activity of α-Cyperone against 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
   <italic>S. aureus.</italic> Sterile discs containing α-Cyperone (60 µg/disc) was placed immediately after spreading the bacterial cell suspension (100 µL, 10
   <sup>9</sup>/mL) on tryptic soy agar medium. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and photographed. Lack of inhibitory zones around the discs was observed.
