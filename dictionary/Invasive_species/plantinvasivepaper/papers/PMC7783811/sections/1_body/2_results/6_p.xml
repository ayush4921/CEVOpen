<p id="p0060">Finally, the root extract was used to test the susceptibility of 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> larvae at the concentrations of 2.8, 4.2, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Results showed that percentage of mortalities were as follows; 35, 40, 45, 50 and 70, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The concentrations reflected an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.00 ppm, and LC
 <sub>95</sub> of 13 ppm. The lowest concentration (2.8 ppm) produced 35% mortality, whereas the highest concentration (8 ppm) reflected 70% mortality and the R-square was 0.96.
