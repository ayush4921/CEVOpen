 <italic>N. glauca</italic> specimens were collected from Al-Baha region in the south-west of Saudi Arabia. Specimens of leaves, stems, flowers, and roots were chopped and spread on a tarp, and allowed to air dry, and then further ground to pass through a 2.4 mesh screen using a Gehl Mix-All model 55 (Gehl Company, West Bend, WI, USA). The dry ground plant material was stored carefully in polyethylene bags in the dark at ambient temperature prior to use.
