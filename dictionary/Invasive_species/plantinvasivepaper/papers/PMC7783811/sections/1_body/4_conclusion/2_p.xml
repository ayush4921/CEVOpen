<p id="p0085">Although, 
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> plant is toxic to humans and animals, using its poisonous extracts might be a better approach in pest management with less harm to both environment and human health. Therefore, the current study investigated the larvicidal effect of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> aqueous extracts against the red palm weevil larvae (
 <italic>Rhynchophorus ferrugineu)</italic>. It concluded that 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts showed remarkable potentiality as insecticidal substances that can be used as an ecofriendly integrated approach for the management of 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic>. However, further investigation on identifying 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> active compounds and their mechanisms of action against 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> is recommended.
