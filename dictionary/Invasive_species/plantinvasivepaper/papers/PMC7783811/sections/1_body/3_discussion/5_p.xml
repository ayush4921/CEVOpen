 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Zammit et al, (2014)</xref> the plant parts containing more of the poisonous anabasine complex are fruits and leaves, while roots, flowers and stems contain fewer amounts of it (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Khafagy and Metwally, 1968</xref>). This result in agreement with the current findings as leaf extract showed the highest larvicidal effect against
