<p id="Par40">We hypothesized that aphid colony duration in Greece is shorter as the climate there is warmer. Our empirical data indicate the opposite: duration of aphid colonies in Greece was significantly longer than in the CR. This does not support our hypothesis. Therefore, colony duration does not seem to be the reason for the low numbers of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in Greece. In the future, there is a need for more extensive studies, including more years, more countries, more species of plants per year and country, to deal with the potential biases in this study. It is a pity that limitations on funding prevented the simultaneous monitoring in both countries in the same years and for more years. In the absence of this constraint, our results might have been more robust. However, even the results presented here indicate that more extensive studies are unlikely to add anything new, as the paucity of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean area is most probably due to factors not yet considered.
