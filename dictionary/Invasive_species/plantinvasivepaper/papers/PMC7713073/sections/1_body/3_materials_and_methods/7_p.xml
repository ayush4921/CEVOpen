 </sup> was used. This model gave us an unbiased estimate of the end of the existence of an aphid colony. Of course, we also recorded the real end of the colony, but this date was affected by many random factors. So, we preferred to extrapolate forwards based on the data on the colony population dynamics and on the model predictions. The instant, when the model predicted a colony size equal to 1, was assumed to be the end of the colony.
