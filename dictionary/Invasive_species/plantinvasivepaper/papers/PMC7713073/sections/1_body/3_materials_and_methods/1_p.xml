 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We spent a total of five months there during 2017 and 2018, from April to mid-June each year, which is when the aphid colonies there are present. The data for the Czech Republic was collected at two places, around Kyšice village near Plzeň and in the surroundings of České Budějovice in 2019, from the end of April to the beginning of August (Fig.
