<p id="Par33">In order to measure colony duration only those colonies were monitored that were in a very early stage in their development (this means that only up to ten aphids were present on a plant and there were no remnants of dead aphids). For all the colonies monitored, their GPS coordinates were recorded and a colour label with a specific code was attached to the plant. These coordinates only served to distinguish individual colonies and are not reported here. From the length of the transects it follows that the colonies were very close to each other and their position in space is clear from the position of the city.</p>
