<p id="Par31">Colony duration is expected to be shorter in Greece than in the Czech Republic, because the climate in Greece is warmer than in the Czech Republic. This is commonly known, but is further confirmed by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, where 10-year averages (± SDs) of monthly temperatures are plotted for Eleftheroupoli in Greece, which is close to Néa Péramos (as a representative of the Mediterranean climate see, e.g.,
