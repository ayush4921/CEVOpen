<p id="Par38">After careful checking whether all the assumptions of the tests used were satisfied, we used a single factor ANOVA and a subsequent Tukey HSD test (if ANOVA indicated presence of significant differences) were used to test for differences between aphid colony duration using the three datasets. We performed these analyses not only for data on the duration of aphid colonies, but also for the aphid population growth rate, 
 <italic>r</italic>, and the parameter 
 <italic>a</italic> in Eq.Â (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). This was because we were interested in whether the differences between these values (if present) may have affected colony duration: e.g., difference in 
 <italic>r</italic> might have speeded up the growth of aphid numbers in the colony, which in turn might have affected colony duration.
