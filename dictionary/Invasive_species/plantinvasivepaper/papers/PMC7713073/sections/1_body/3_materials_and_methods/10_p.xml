<p id="Par39">The monitoring of colonies of only host alternating species of aphids on trees might have biased the result because trees are much larger than herbaceous plants and therefore the duration of the colonies might be longer on trees than on herbaceous plants. Of the haphazardly selected plants, the duration of colonies of aphids on trees were only recorded in Greece in 2017. Therefore, to address this possible bias, the analyses mentioned was carried out twice: once including trees and once without, to determine whether including aphid colonies on trees biased the result.</p>
