<p id="Par8">Therefore, we hypothesized that the reason might be due to biotic factors. Here we focus on the most likely: diet and life histories. We hypothesized that the limiting factor can be the duration of colonies of prey (i.e., number in one patch, usually on one plant) that may shorten as one approaches the equator. It is well known that there exists a sharp change from mild Central European climate with long vegetative season to harsh Mediterranean conditions with a short vegetative season, which is reflected in the composition of animal communities

 </sup>, one result of which may be shortening of the duration of aphid colonies. As indicated by mathematical models of ladybird—aphid systems, short duration of the prey (aphid) colony may lead to a lower fitness and subsequently low population densities of the predator

 </sup>. Thus, abundance of this predator is most likely to be positively correlated with the duration of the prey colonies necessary for the completion of its larval development.
