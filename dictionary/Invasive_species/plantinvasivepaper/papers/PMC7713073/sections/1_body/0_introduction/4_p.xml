<p id="Par5">We use the invasive ladybird, 
 <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> (Pallas), as a model species, mainly because its spread in North America and most of Europe is a matter of serious concern

 </sup>. The original area of its distribution is east Palaearctic (Japan, Korea, China, southern Siberia). The early attempts to introduce this species, a voracious predator of aphids and some other insect pests, from its native area into areas with a climate suitable for its survival, were not successful

 </sup>. Later this species was mass-produced and used as an efficient means of biological control in glasshouses, mostly against aphids. Some of these domesticated populations escaped from glasshouses and spread into the surrounding environment, first in North America

 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> started to spread into areas with mild-climates around the world: first in Europe after escaping from glasshouses in the Netherlands, then in South America and also in tropical areas
