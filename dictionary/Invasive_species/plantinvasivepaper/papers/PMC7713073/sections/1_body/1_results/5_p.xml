<p id="Par14">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a shows the average values of the intensity of regulation (parameter 
 <italic>a</italic>) on individual species of plants. It is the equivalent of carrying capacity used in logistic equations. The average values of parameter 
 <italic>a</italic> fluctuated greatly both between individual species of plants, and between countries and years. Single factor ANOVA revealed significant differences between the values of 
 <italic>a</italic> (F = 1.81, p &lt; 0.05). It is not clear, why these values were high for some species and low for others. Single factor ANOVA also revealed significant differences between the values of 
 <italic>a</italic> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,c (F = 4.80, p &lt; 0.05; F = 5.24, p &lt; 0.05).
