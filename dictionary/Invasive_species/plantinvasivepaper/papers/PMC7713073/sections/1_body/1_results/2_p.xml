 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the duration (in days) of aphid colonies in both countries and years. The numbers displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a are the averages for aphid colony duration on individual species of plants. We also analysed the raw numbers in addition to the averages and the results were very similar, so only average numbers are presented. Single factor ANOVA revealed significant differences between the three datasets (F = 5.30, p &lt; 0.05). The subsequent Tukey HSD test revealed that colony duration in the Czech Republic in 2019 on herbaceous plants (48 days) was significantly shorter than in Greece both in 2017 and 2018, while there was no significant difference in colony duration in 2017 and 2018 in Greece (60 and 59 days, respectively).
