<p>Based on the data collected, there can be two conclusions: 
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>(A)</label>
   <p id="Par24">Colony duration 
    <italic>is</italic> significantly shorter in the Mediterranean. However, if the data were collected in different years, then it is not possible to determine whether the observed shorter colony duration in the Mediterranean was caused by different sites (Mediterranean vs. temperate region), or by different years of monitoring and further years of monitoring are required, before the claim that H0 is supported by the data is substantiated. This, however, is not our case.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(B)</label>
   <p id="Par25">Colony duration 
    <italic>is not</italic> significantly shorter in the Mediterranean (there is either no difference, or the opposite holds—
    <italic>the latter is our case</italic>). Then again there are two options: 
    <list list-type="order">
     <list-item>
      <p id="Par26">
       <italic>There is no effect of year.</italic> In such a case, we should 
       <italic>reject H0</italic>. In our data, the non-significant effect of year in the Greek data 
       <italic>supports</italic>, but does not 
       <italic>prove</italic> no effect of year. The latter is because: (1) we compared only two years and (2) the same test was not performed in the temperate region, for which there is only one year of data.
      </p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <p id="Par27">We suspect 
       <italic>there might be an effect of year</italic> (and based on our data we cannot exclude this with certainty—see above). Then, if the data were collected in different years (as in our case), our conclusion must be weaker than rejection, hence 
       <italic>our data do not support H0.</italic>
