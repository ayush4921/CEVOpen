<p>As explained above, based on (B1), the conclusion cannot be stronger. Thus, to be safe, we stay with the conclusion based on (B2). This conclusion is not a statement of the obvious. Longer colony duration in the Mediterranean (although based on data from different years) is an unexpected result, based on a large amount of data. So our data 
 <italic>do not support the idea that shorter colony duration is the reason for the paucity of Harmonia in the Mediterranean</italic>, as colony duration was not 
 <italic>shorter</italic> there.
