<p id="Par16">It might be argued that the hypothesis that differences in colony duration cause the paucity of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean is irrelevant, because a considerable percentage of ladybirds complete their whole development on trees, where aphids, if they are not host-alternating, are present during the whole season. Considering this argument, two cases may occur: (1) if most ladybirds develop on trees that host non-host alternating aphid species, then colony duration cannot be responsible for lack of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean area, because these aphids occur on such trees throughout the vegetative season and so can the ladybirds. Thus, colony duration has no effect in this case. (2) If a considerable number of ladybirds develop on herbaceous plants, then our findings (longer colony duration in Greece than in the Czech Republic) also show that colony duration cannot be responsible for lack of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean area.
