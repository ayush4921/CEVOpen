<p>The role of gender in the pathogenic mechanisms of anaphylaxis in general, and of insect-venom anaphylaxis in particular, is still largely unknown. It was suggested that the higher incidence of anaphylaxis to venom in men can probably result from differences both in occupation and degree of exposure. Occupational anaphylaxis has been reported especially for beekeepers, beekeeping being an activity mainly carried out by men. Moreover, since more men than women work outdoors and do sports, they are stung more frequently than women and might therefore be at a higher risk of allergic reactions. Mastocytosis, a risk factor of venom allergy, prevails in males rather than females [

Despite theoretical premises and certain clinical observations indicating estrogen as having an important role in allergic diseases, the influence on hypersensitivity to stinging insectsâ€™ venom is not unequivocal and remains still open. Other investigators, conversely, found out that women are more often affected by Hymenoptera Venom Allergy (HVA) than men [

The number of deaths clearly evidenced the higher risk in the elderly. Comparable observations were described in Colombia, where the 50-year-and-older group accounted for the 73% of the fatalities [

However, it was highlighted that a clinically important number of children do not outgrow allergic reactions to insect stings, and there is a prolonged benefit in children to the use of venom immunotheraphy, leading to lower risks of systemic reactions to stings [

Fatalities due to hornet, wasp, and bee stings in Spain were concentrated in summer (July and August) as well as late spring and early fall. In fact, stinging insect colonies are typically at their maximal size in late summer and/or autumn, with ranges varying depending on the species. Bumblebees, wasps, and hornets are eusocial insects with a colony-based annual life cycle and a caste-based social system, with queens, workers, and males reaching peak abundance at different stages in the cycle.
