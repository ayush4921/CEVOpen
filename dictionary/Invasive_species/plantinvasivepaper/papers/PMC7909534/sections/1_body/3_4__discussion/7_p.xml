<p>A very high rate of insect sting fatalities involved residents of Galicia and Asturias. X23
 <sub>MR</sub> was estimated in Galicia at 1.82, 1.10, and 2.22 deaths per million inhabitants in 2014, 2016, and 2018, respectively. X23
 <sub>MR</sub> were estimated in Asturias at 1.88 and 0.97 deaths per million inhabitants in 2014 and 2017, respectively. To the best of my knowledge, this is the highest described so far in scientific literature. Galicia had a total of 167,977 hives in 2018, corresponding to 5.9% of the total in Spain, with a density of 5.7 and 6.2 hives per km
 <sup>2</sup> and per 100 inhabitants, respectively, very close to the Spanish average. Asturias had a total of 48,990 beehives in 2018, corresponding to 2.1% of the total in Spain, with a density of 4.6 and 4.8 hives per km
 <sup>2</sup> and per 100 inhabitants respectively, values under the Spanish average. There is not a high presence of beehives in either community.
