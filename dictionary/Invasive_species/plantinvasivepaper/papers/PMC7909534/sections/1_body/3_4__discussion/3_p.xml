<p>In these species, there is no colonial life in winter. Old queens, workers, and males die in the autumn or winter, and only the newly mated queens survive. New queens hibernate and start new nests and colonies next spring. In winter, beehives show few or no signs of activity. Inside, there are a few thousand workers forming a cluster with the queen bee. As a result of this increased activity both in insects and humans doing outdoor activities, the possibility of coming into contact with a stinging insect becomes much greater during the late summer. Related to the place of occurrence, fatal stings occurred in a wide range of situations, including: 7.6% at home; 1.2% at school, other institution, and public administrative areas; 5.1% at street and highway; 8.9% at farm; and 8.9% at other specified places. However, the 67.9% of the fatalities are recorded at “unspecified places”. The frequent use of the above imprecise category gives little insight into the circumstances and the contexts in which such events occur, limiting the development of prevention initiatives.</p>
