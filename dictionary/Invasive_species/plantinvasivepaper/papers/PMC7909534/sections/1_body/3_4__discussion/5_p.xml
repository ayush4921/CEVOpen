<p>A more detailed and specific breakdown of the distribution of the deaths due to stinging insects at the sub-state level by year and across communities reveals some striking features. The communities concentrating the high beehive stock in Spain show a decline of X23
 <sub>MR</sub> in the last ten years of the period studied (2009â€“2018). A very high rate of insect sting fatalities involving residents of Galicia and Asturias occurred in recent years (2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018).
