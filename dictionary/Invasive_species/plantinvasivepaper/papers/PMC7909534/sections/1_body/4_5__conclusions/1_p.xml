<p>The deaths resulting from contact with hornets, wasps, and bees (ICD-10 code X23) in Spain, both at the state and sub-state level (1999–2018), were examined. Over the 20-year period studied, a total of 78 fatalities were recorded and annual mortality rates varied from 0.02 to 0.19 per 1 million inhabitants, placing Spain at low levels compared to other countries. The majority of deaths occurred in males (85.9%), in the 65-or-over age group (52.6%), at “unspecified places” (67.9%), and in the months of July and August (50%). At the sub-state level, the X23 deaths were more highly concentrated in the communities of Galicia (35.8%), Andalucía (21.7%), and Castilla y Leon (12.8%), with 28, 17, and 10 victims, respectively. A more detailed and specific breakdown of the distribution of the deaths due to stinging insects by year and across communities reveals some striking findings. Galicia showed high X23
 <sub>MR</sub> values with 1.82 (in 2014), 1.10 (in 2016), and 2.22 (in 2018) per million inhabitants. X23
 <sub>MR</sub> were estimated in Asturias at 1.88 and 0.97 deaths per million people in 2014 and 2017, respectively. To the best of my knowledge, these are values never found before in the available literature. One limitation of the present work is that cases involving hornets, wasps, or bees could not be separately identified, with data provided by death certificates. In this context, the different news that appeared in the media should not be ignored, since they allow to raise awareness of insect-related incidents with precise details about the fatality. Between 2014 to 2018, I recopilated eight fatalities happened in Galicia which appeared in mass media and where wasps/hornets were always involved, showing enough evidence in most cases to signal the Asian hornet as the insect causing the death. So far this year (2020), three deaths in Galicia and one in Asturias have been reported by mass media. Given the scope of the effects of the Asian hornet, it has a definitely much wider impact than just for honeybees and their keepers. Due to its habits, abundance, and broader distribution, the risk that 
 <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> poses to human health is unmatched by other native species. Although administration have minimized the consequences of stings on human health at the beginning of the invasion, the presence of the invasive species 
 <italic>Vespa velutina</italic>, which has settled and spread widely in the north of Spain, deserves special attention and management by the authorities. The research conducted here is useful to health administrators and policy planners in prioritizing areas with high mortality due to Hymenoptera insects. In light of these findings, there is evidence to consider the 
 <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> with high medical importance and consequences, and to abandon the notion that the invasive species poses no greater risk to human health than a bee. Insect-venom anaphylaxis remains a major challenge for clinicians. More research is needed to identify the source of this variation and its relationship to different possible explanations.
