<p>The reviewed incidence of insect-sting mortality around the world is statistically low, but not negligible, ranging from 0.03 to 0.48 fatalities per million inhabitants per year [
 <xref rid="B23-biology-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Spain, the data is scarce. The Spanish Society for Allergology and Clinical Immunology indicates the mortality rate at 0.08 per million inhabitants per year, which means that around 3 or 4 people could die each year from this cause in the event that after sting they did not receive immediate medical attention [
