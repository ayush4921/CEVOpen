<p>Once 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> began to senesce in the field in mid-July 2014, the pots containing the 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> rhizomes were stored in an uninsulated barn during the winter to prevent the rhizomes from freezing and dying. The pots were then pulled out of storage in early April 2015. Sixteen worms were again added to 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> present pots, and 100 g of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> was again added weekly to 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> present pots in the summer of 2015 until 12 June, when the 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> plants were harvested. Roots were washed and biomass was dried in the drying oven for 24 h (leaves) or 72 h (stems, rhizomes, roots and reproductive) at 60 Â°C, and weighed to 0.01 g.
