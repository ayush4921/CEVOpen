<p>In order to assess leaf nutrient content, we followed the methods described in 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Khasanova 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)
 </xref> for CN analysis. Plant biomass was washed with DI water and oven-dried at 65 °C. Subsamples of dried plant tissue were ground with a ball mill, then 2 ± 0.1 μg samples were weighed for total N and C concentration by micro Dumas combustion on a CN analyzer (Costech Analytical, Valencia, CA).
