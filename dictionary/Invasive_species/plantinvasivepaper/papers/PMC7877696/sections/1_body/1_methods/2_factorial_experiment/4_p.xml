<p>Pots with a 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> present treatment received 16 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> worms (~100 earthworms per m
 <sup>2</sup>). This is consistent with natural populations, which can have in excess of 100 individuals per square metre (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2007
 </xref>). We observed earthworms feeding by pulling leaf litter down into the soil, found less leaf cover on top of pots [see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">
  <bold>Supporting Information—Fig. S1</bold>
 </xref>], and observed earthworms and their burrows in ‘
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> presence’ treatments at harvest (C.G. Cope, pers. obs), suggesting that our 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> presence treatment was effective in adding earthworms to the experimental plants and initiating leaf litter feeding, as expected. We observed no earthworms or their burrows in 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> absence treatments.
