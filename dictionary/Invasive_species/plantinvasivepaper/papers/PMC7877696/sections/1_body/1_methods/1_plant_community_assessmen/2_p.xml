<p>We analysed only plots with information on the presence or absence of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> and/or earthworms to maintain parallel structure to the potted experiment (discussed subsequently). There were a total of 187 plots that met these criteria. Eighty-seven of these plots had zero percent cover of 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic>. We then compared the percent cover of 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic>, as well as the percent soil nitrogen and two different measures of inorganic phosphorus in parts per million (ppm) across plots with or without these predictor variables (see analysis below).
