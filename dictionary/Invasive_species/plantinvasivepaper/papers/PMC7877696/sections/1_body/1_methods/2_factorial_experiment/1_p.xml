<p>The experiment was located at Case Western Reserve University’s Squire Valleevue Farm (‘University Farm’ below) in Hunting Valley, OH, USA (41°29′ N, 81°25′ W) over 2 years (2014–15). The experiment was organized in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design, with 6 replicates per experimental treatment, for a total of 48 pots. Each treatment included the presence or absence of the three factors of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Treatments were randomized within 6 replicate blocks in a common garden. We used 57-L pots (45 cm diameter at top × 42 cm deep). Pots were covered with 30 % shade cloth (Greenhouse Megastore, Danville, IL, USA) to mimic early forest understory conditions in northeastern Ohio. At midday on a sunny day, when ambient PPFD was ~1800, this resulted in an approximate PPFD of 500 under the shade cloth. Plants were kept well-watered throughout the experiment.
