<p>In addition, we conducted a contingency table analysis and found that the presence of one invader did not influence the presence of the other (χ 
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.53, df = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.22). Thus, we treated the presence of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> and earthworms as independent variables in the following analysis. We used the presence/absence of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (rather than percent cover) for parallel structure with the experimental design, described below. Next we modelled percent cover of 
 <italic>Pododphyllum peltatum</italic> as a response variable in a linear model with a Guassian error distribution and log transformed percent cover, with a small constant added (0.001) to prevent zero values of percent cover from being dropped from the model. We included predictors: 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> presence, earthworm presence, soil nitrogen and all of their interactions. Because our analyses indicated that soil phosphorus was not independent of earthworms, we did this analysis only for soil nitrogen
