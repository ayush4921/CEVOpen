<p>Overall, we found some evidence for a potential interaction between the invasive earthworm, 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> leaf litter presence, though there was no direct evidence that this interaction was driven by allelopathy. We observed no colonization of 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> roots by AMF in any experimental treatment, either via staining or qPCR. We found that the total biomass of 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> was significantly reduced when 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> earthworms, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> and activated carbon were present (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), contrary to the prediction of an allelopathy effect in the absence of activated carbon. Contrasts showed a significant negative effect of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> on 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> biomass when both 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> and activated carbon were present (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007,

 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> on 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> biomass in the presence of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (
