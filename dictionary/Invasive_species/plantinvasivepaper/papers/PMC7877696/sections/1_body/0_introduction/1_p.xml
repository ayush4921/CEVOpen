<p>Assessment of effects of invaders have generally focussed on single invasive species, despite the frequent observation of systems with multiple invaders (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Kuebbing and Nunez 2015</xref>). Interactions between multiple invaders could be additive (e.g. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Milton 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2007
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Cushman and Gaffney 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shaben and Myers 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Braga 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2019
 </xref>), sub-additive (
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Yang 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>) or super-additive (
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Green 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>) and mostly focus on plantâ€“plant interactions (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Kuebbing and Nunez 2015</xref>). We propose that invasive earthworms, like 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (Lumbricidae), might interact with invasive plants because of their feeding mode of pulling leaf litter down into the soil (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Edwards 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Fahey 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>), potentially redistributing allelochemicals and nutrients produced by invasive plant leaf litter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> leaf litter produces allelochemicals that suppress plant mutualists belowground (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cantor 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>). Invader interactions belowground might particularly influence plant physiology, because photosynthetic rates are limited by phosphorus availability (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Rychter and Rao 2005</xref>), and phosphorus uptake is mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal mutualists in many cases. Photosynthetic rates are also limited by nitrogen availability, which is a component of RuBisCO, the enzyme that fixes carbon in C
 <sub>3</sub> plants (
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">von Caemmerer and Quick 2000</xref>). By partnering field and experimental data, we explore this potential interaction between invasive earthworms and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> leaf litter under realistic field conditions, as well as characterizing physiological mechanisms in a manipulative experiment.
