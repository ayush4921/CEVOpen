 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> is an invasive earthworm (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2007
 </xref>), which is likely to interact with 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, because it feeds by pulling leaf litter down into the soil (
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Zicsi 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>). 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic>â€™ feeding behaviour may break down nutrients in leaves faster than decomposition alone, altering nutrient cycling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, arrow 4) (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Costello and Lamberti 2009</xref>). Both 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> are native to Europe and were introduced to the USA through European settlers in the 1800s (
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Nuzzo 1993</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2007
 </xref>) and have become widespread problems throughout much of the Eastern USA, where they often co-occur (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Nuzzo 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2009
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zelles 2012</xref>). A meta-analysis has indicated that greater invasive earthworm biomass correlates with greater invasive plant cover, consistent with invasive earthworms facilitating invasive plants (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Craven 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2017
 </xref>). Because of this high degree of co-occurrence, we propose that 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> earthworms may amplify the effects of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> allelopathy through their feeding mechanism of pulling litter into underground burrows. 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> might thus increase the distribution of leaf litter over the roots of native plants, and thus increase the negative allelopathic effects of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (
