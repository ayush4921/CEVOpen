<p>Plant responses to multiple invaders are likely to be mediated by plant physiology, as others have seen for responses to single invaders, like 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Brouwer 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2015
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hale 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2016
 </xref>). In prior studies on native herbaceous perennial 
 <italic>Maianthemum racemosum</italic>, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> has been shown to reduce carbon storage by suppressing fungal mutualists (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Brouwer 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2015
 </xref>), reducing the native plantâ€™s photosynthetic rate (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hale 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2016
 </xref>). We found no AMF colonization in our experimental plants, and no direct effects of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> on native plant physiology. Here, we found that the internal CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration in the leaves was reduced in the presence of the invasive earthworm 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic>. This suggests that 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> alters plant physiology by changing nutrient availability. If these invasive earthworms increase nitrogen availability to the plant, this could influence 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> production or activation of RuBisCO, the enzyme used to fix CO
 <sub>2</sub> in the leaf (
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Spreitzer and Salvucci 2002</xref>). The higher leaf nitrogen content in the presence of 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> is consistent with this explanation and the observation that 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> enhances soil nutrient cycling (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Costello and Lamberti 2009</xref>). This could increase the rate of CO
 <sub>2</sub> usage, decreasing internal CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations (C
 <sub>i</sub>). Therefore, if stomatal conductance stays the same, lower C
 <sub>i</sub> could indicate greater carbon drawdown within the leaf. This makes sense if earthworms like 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> make nitrogen more available to the plants, increasing leaf RuBisCO content and thus drawdown capacity. However, this faster C
 <sub>i</sub> drawdown does not lead to greater net photosynthetic rates. A possible reason for this could be that photosynthetic rates are limited not just by RuBisCO availability, but also by the rate sugars move through the plant. If there is a backup of sugars near the photosynthetic machinery, there could be a reduction in photosynthetic rates (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2007
 </xref>). In sum, 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> directly impacts 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> physiology (lower CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration in the leaf), but does not lead to improvements in plant performance (e.g. greater maximum photosynthetic rate or plant biomass).
