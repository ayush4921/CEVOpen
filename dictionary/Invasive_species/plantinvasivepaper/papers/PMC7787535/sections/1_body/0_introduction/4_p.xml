<p>Tackling future biological security challenges within the UK will require evidence-based policy, coupled with rational precaution. One of the key themes of the 
 <italic>UK Biological Security Strategy</italic> is ‘a strong science base’, and it highlights that all actions in biosecurity must be “underpinned by high quality science and evidence if it is to be effective” [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite this, many biological security topics are neglected and there is a risk that policy-makers will not use evidence to inform decisions, due to lack of awareness or “evidence complacency” [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, researchers may fail to effectively communicate the nuances of policy-relevant topics.
