<p>Diseases are potentially severe threats to biological security. These include new diseases that spread from animals to humans, new plant and animal diseases, existing human, plant and animal diseases that spread into new areas, pathogenic agents that become resistant to existing treatments (e.g., drug-resistant 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>), diseases that continue to have severe impacts on people despite existing treatments (e.g., HIV-AIDS), and diseases that change in severity when introduced into new settings (e.g., amphibian chytridiomycosis). There were several questions about the impacts that such diseases could have (questions 18–21) and the potential shifts that could occur due to changes in climate, land use and disease vectors (questions 22–24) [

Influenza virus was the focus of several questions as its potential to change virus genotypes and phenotypes, as well as its mode and speed of spread makes it a serious pandemic threat. There were also several questions about disease surveillance, the possibility of using new technologies for detection (questions 28–31), and methods of preventing or managing disease outbreaks (questions 32–35), including methods of developing new technologies for managing outbreaks. Unless specifically stated otherwise, these questions refer to diseases of people, wild and domesticated animals and plants. We expect that the ongong Covid-19 pandemic will significantly impact research priorities. Many of the questions outline here, specifically on disease surveillance, detection and quarantine, will be salient and of immediate use to existing efforts to mitigate Covid-19. Others, such as questions relating to an influenza pandemic, may well help the uK prepare for the next major disease outbreak.
