<p>It has long been understood that simply informing people that something poses a risk does little to convince them to change their behaviour [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The adoption of, and compliance with, biological security practices is a critical, yet understudied, subject [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some issues have attracted increasing attention, including the role of social media in amplifying the perception of risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] the impact of governance arrangements [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the opinions of farmers on biological security measures, with case studies conducted in the UK [

They are as much about the need to determine what is a valid security concern as they are about proposing new ones. These questions are addressed to a wide audience, from farmers to scientists, policy-makers and members of civil society. The focus spans the organisational, social and technical aspects of risk. The questions range from assessing the current state of public perception and policy (questions 7–8) to determining the most effective communication and behavioural change actions (questions 9–14) [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and how these can be implemented into fair and effective processes (15–17).
