<p>Biological research and associated technologies have the potential to be deliberately misused. Historically, several countries, including the UK (until the late 1950s), have had offensive biological warfare programmes and there have been occasional instances of bio-terrorism by non-state actors [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. There are acknowledged weaknesses in the BTWC regime. The BTWC has no meaningful verification measures such as declarations or on-site inspections. An attempt to develop these and other associated measures collapsed in 2001 when the US rejected a draft protocol that emerged from the Ad Hoc Group negotiations. Given this gap, and the fact that many BTWC States Parties do not have effective national implementation mesures in place, action against misuse continues to be necessary. This is all the more important in the context of scientific and technological advances that may make destructive capabilities available to a wide range of actors. Such developments include access to table top DNA synthesis, cheaper and easier genetic engineering [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A robust assessment of biological security should consider rapidly-changing scientific and technological landscapes [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], types of actors and access, as well as procedures to recognise and mitigate deliberate attacks.
