<p>Rapid changes in bioengineering technologies present both biosecurity threats as well as the possibility of new tools to address these challenges. We take a broad definition of bioengineering as “the application of ideas, principles and techniques to the engineering of biological systems” [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. CRISPR/Cas mediated gene silencing and gene editing (and related technologies) have the potential to modify existing pathogenic organisms and resulting toxins—or to create new ones—in ways which might advance understanding of and response to disease threats, but which might also facilitate misuse or result in increased toxicity and/or virulence. New means of sharing information covertly, such as the ‘dark web’ (Tor anonymity network), have opened up additional acquisition pathways [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which could be put to malicious use by hostile individuals or groups. Furthermore, new technologies may require new policies, such as the harmonisation of regulations on synthetic biology [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given the uncertainty of future biotechnological capabilities [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the questions in this section are forward-looking. They also incorporate a broad range of different topics in biotechnology, including challenges that stem from the convergence of biotechnology with other technologies such as cyber-biosecurity (encompass[ing] cybersecurity, cyber-physical security and biological security as applied to biological and biomedical-based systems) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] threats, synthetic biology and de-extinction [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The questions cover the challenges and opportunities posed by new technologies (questions 1–3) and the mitigation options for managing emerging technologies (questions 4–6).
