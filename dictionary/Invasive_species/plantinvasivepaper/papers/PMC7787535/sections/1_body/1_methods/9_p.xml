<p>The morning sessions of the workshop had small groups working in parallel explicitly on the different categories. This was completed over two sessions to reduce the number of questions and improve the formulation of those that remained. The afternoon sessions concentrated on further refining and reducing the questions while ranking them into categories of gold, silver and bronze. These sessions were conducted across two clusters of topics: one including bioengineering, securing against misuse, and policy and law; and the other comprising invasives, pandemics, plant disease and zoonoses. The penultimate list was composed of 80 gold, 47 silver and 46 bronze questions. This list was then further sharpened during a plenary session. One gold question was dropped to bronze and 10 to silver. 8 silver questions were promoted to gold, as well as 3 bronze, resulting in the final list of 80 gold questions. The final list was then regrouped into a more appropriate split of topics across: bioengineering, communication and behaviour change, disease threats, invasive alien species, policy and governance and securing against misuse.</p>
