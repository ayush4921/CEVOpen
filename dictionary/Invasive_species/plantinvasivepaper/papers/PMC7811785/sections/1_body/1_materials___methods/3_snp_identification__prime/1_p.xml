<p>The complete 
 <italic>matK</italic> gene, extracted from the cpDNA of the three focal species, was aligned using MUSCLE to identify SNPs (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S1</xref>). The selected SNP for 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> was then confirmed by aligning the available 
 <italic>matK</italic> sequences of other 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species on NCBI to those of the focal species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S2</xref>). Based on SNP data, primer pairs were designed using Primer3 to distinguish 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> from other 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species (
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Untergasser et al., 2012</xref>). Primer sequences included matK_463F (5′-CATCTGGAAATCTTGGTTCAG-3′), matK_1162R (5′-GATGCCCCAATGCGTTACAA-3′), CD_SNP_F1 (5′-AATTCTTGCTTCAAAAGG GTCC- 3′), CD_SNP_R1 (5′-TTCCATTTATTCATCAA AAGATAC-3′), CD_SNP_F2 (5′-AATTCTTGCTTCAAAAGGGTCG-3′), and CD_SNP_R2 (5′-TTCCATTTATTCATCAAAAGATAG- 3′). The multiplex PCR of matK_463F, matK_1162R, CD_SNP_F1, and CD_SNP_R1 was designed to yield the 323 bp band for 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic>, the 421 bp band for other 
 <italic>Carduus</italic>, and the 700 bp band for all examined samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S3</xref>). By contrast, the combination of matK_463F, matK_1162R, CD_SNP_F2, and CD_SNP_R2 yielded a 421 bp PCR product for 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> and a 323 bp band for other 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S3</xref>). Reactions were conducted in 25 µl solution consisting of 50 ng of template DNA, 2.5 µl of 10× reaction buffer, 0.5 U of E-taq DNA polymerase, 50 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM dNTPs. Concentrations of outer primer pairs (matK_463F and matK_1162R) and inner primer pairs (CD_SNP_F1 and CD_SNP_R1, CD_SNP_F2 and CD_SNP_R2) were 0.75 pM and 0.5 pM, respectively. The PCR procedure consisted of 1 min at 94 °C, followed by denaturing for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 40 s at 55 °C, an extension stage of 50 s at 72 °C, and an additional extension of 7 min at 72 °C.
