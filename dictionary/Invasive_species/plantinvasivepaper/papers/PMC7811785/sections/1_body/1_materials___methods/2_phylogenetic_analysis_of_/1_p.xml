<p>A total of 78 protein-coding regions were extracted from the complete cpDNA of the focal species and other related taxa (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S1</xref>). Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE embedded in Geneious Prime (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2004</xref>). We used jModeltest (
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Posada, 2008</xref>) to find the best model for the aligned DNA sequences; GTR + I + R was selected as the most suitable model and was used in Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses. The ML analysis was conducted with the IQ-tree web server (

 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Trifinopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). We used MrBayes v3.2 (
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>) for BI analyses. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was run for 1,000,000 generations, and a tree was assembled every 1000 generations. A 25% burn-in setting was used for summarising trees. Figtree v4.0 (

Other datasets, including whole chloroplast genomes (excluding one IR region), non-coding regions of cpDNA, and hotspot regions derived from the cpDNA of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species, were used in phylogenetic analysis in addition to protein-coding regions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">TableÂ S1</xref>). Analytical procedures for these additional datasets were identical to those used for the protein coding regions; however, we used the TVM+I+G model for the whole chloroplast genome (excluding one inverted repeat [IR] region) and all non-coding regions, and the TVM+G model for the hotspot regions dataset.
