<p>Phylogenetic analyses of the Asteraceae have identified ambiguous relationships between 
 <italic>Carduus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cirsium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Silybum</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Panero, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Arnelas et al., 2018</xref>); for example, ITS data suggests that 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> is polyphyletic (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">HÃ¤ffner &amp; Hellwig, 1999</xref>). Although three coding regions (
 <italic>matK</italic>, 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>, and 
 <italic>ndhF</italic>) were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, the position of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> remained unresolved (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). We used 78 protein-coding regions to clarify these relationships; however, the phylogeny of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> and related taxa remains unclear (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). Specifically, 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> was found to be close to 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> whereas 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> form a clade with 
 <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic>. While non-coding regions can be useful in reconstructing the phylogeny of lower taxa, we were unable to recover the monophyly of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> using data from non-coding regions, including the eight hotspot areas as well as the combined data from coding and non-coding regions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S4</xref>). These issues suggest the need for additional studies on the phylogeny of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> and other members of the subfamily Carduoideae using supplementary molecular data and morphology.
