<p>Chloroplast genomes are highly conserved in angiosperms with respect to gene content and order (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Sugiura, 1992</xref>). This conservative tendency was observed in the three newly sequenced 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> cpDNA genomes, compared to other Asteraceae members (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Other cpDNA sequences have revealed unique genomic events in Asteraceae. For example, the 
 <italic>atpB</italic> gene, which encodes the CF1 ATPase beta subunit, is annotated as a pseudogene in 
 <italic>Aster spathulifolius</italic> due to a deletion within the coding region (Choi and Park, 2015). Similarly, 
 <italic>trnT_GGU</italic> was completely deleted or pseudogenised in the tribe Gnaphalieae (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Duplication of 
 <italic>trnF_GAA</italic> has been identified in 
 <italic>Taraxacum</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Salih et al., 2017</xref>). No comparable genomic events are present in 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> or other members of subfamily Carduoideae (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S7</xref>). However, nucleotide diversity data pointed to potential regions for further study of phylogeny and population genetics, and the development of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic>-specific molecular markers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). The number of species we examined for this study was low relative to the approximately 32,000 known Asteraceae species. Therefore, additional studies that include the majority of Asteraceae species should be conducted to explore the overall evolutionary trends in the chloroplast genomes of this globally-distributed family.
