<p>We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to sequence and characterise the chloroplast genomes of 
 <italic>Carduus crispus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic>, which exhibit both invasive tendencies and potential medical utility (particularly 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic>). We then conducted comparative genomic analyses to explore genomic diversity among the three species with respect to highly variable regions, and the types and numbers of repeats. In addition, we reconstructed the formerly ambiguous relationship between 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> and related taxa based on 78 protein-coding regions and non-coding sequences. Finally, we developed a specific molecular marker for 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> based on a SNP in the 
 <italic>matK</italic> gene. This molecular marker provides useful information for managing 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> invasions, particularly with respect to the identification of immature (vegetative) individuals, which tend to be morphologically similar to other 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species (i.e.,Â having winged stems with apical spines and spiny leaves). This molecular marker may also support positive identification of 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> for medical usage.
