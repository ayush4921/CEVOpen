<p>In this study, we provided the first complete cpDNA sequences for 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species. Despite the absence of significant differences (i.e., inversions, deletions, and duplications) between the chloroplast genomes of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> and those of related taxa, the newly acquired cpDNA sequences have value as a resource in future studies of the evolution of the chloroplast genome in Carduoideae and Asteraceae. Additionally, the 78 protein-coding regions of the chloroplast genome revealed uncertainty regarding the position of 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> within the subfamily Carduoideae, and suggested the need for additional studies to reconstruct relationships not only among thistles, but among other members of the Asteraceae as well. The methods and protocols used in developing molecular markers for 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> are easy to apply and may be useful as a standard method in other studies of Asteraceae species.
