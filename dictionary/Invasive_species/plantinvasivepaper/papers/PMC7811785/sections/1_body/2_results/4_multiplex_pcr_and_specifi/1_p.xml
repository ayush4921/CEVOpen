<p>The results of multiplex PCR for the two groups of primer pairs yielded similar products, both of which were designed to identify 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic>. In the first group, a 323 bp band was found in 
 <italic>C. crispus,</italic> whereas a 421 bp band was identified in 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5A</xref>). By contrast, the combination of matK_463F, matK_1162R, CD_SNP_F2, and CD_SNP_R2 yielded a longer PCR product for 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> in comparison with the other species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The designed primer pairs were specific to all 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> samples examined in this study (
