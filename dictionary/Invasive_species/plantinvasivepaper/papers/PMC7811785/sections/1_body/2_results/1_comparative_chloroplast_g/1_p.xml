<p>Differing numbers of reads were obtained from NGS data, resulting in varying cpDNA coverage rates among the three focal species (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Total cpDNA length differed among species, ranging from 152,342 bp to 152,617 bp, and included a large single copy (LSC), a small single copy (SSC), and two IR regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, all three species had identical numbers of protein coding (80), tRNA (30), and rRNA (4) genes (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">TableÂ S3</xref>). The IR-LSC and IR-SSC junctions were located in the 
 <italic>rps19</italic> and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> coding regions, respectively, but were longer in 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> (
 <italic>rps19</italic> = 61 bp and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> = 568 bp) than in the other two species (
 <italic>rps19</italic> = 60 bp and 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> = 565 bp). In addition, pairwise identity indicated that 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> is more similar to 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> (99.6%) than 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> (99.2%). Observations of nucleotide diversity indicated that 119 of 131 surveyed regions differ among the three focal species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). Compared to coding regions, non-coding sequences had higher Pi values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). The highest Pi values were found in the 
 <italic>psbC-trnS</italic> (0.0171) and 
 <italic>psbH-petB</italic> (0.0161) regions. The highest value in coding regions was 0.00696 for 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). High nucleotide diversity regions (Pi values &gt;0.008) included 
 <italic>psbI-trnS_GCU</italic>, 
 <italic>trnE_UUC-rpoB</italic>, 
 <italic>trnR_UCU-trnG_UCC</italic>,
