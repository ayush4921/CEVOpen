<p>Analysis of SSRs yielded 43 SSRs in 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic>, 40 in 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic>, and 31 in 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S4</xref>). SSRs occupied the same position in all three species and were mostly located in non-coding regions. Although four types of SSR (i.e., mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides) were identified, most SSRs were mononucleotides composed of A and T nucleotides (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S4</xref>). All 31 SSRs found in 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> were also present in the other two species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S4</xref>). By contrast, 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> had three unique SSRs and shared nine SSRs with 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic>. There were no unique SSRs in 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> or specific shared SSRs between 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> and either 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> or 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic>.
