<p>Among the focal species, 16 repeats were identified for both 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus,</italic> compared to 15 for 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S5</xref>). There were more repeats in coding regions than in non-coding areas, with the exception of 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic>. Three types of repeats (i.e., forward, reverse, and palindrome) were identified in 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic>; by contrast, only forward and palindrome repeats were found in 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic>. Forward repeats were more abundant than reverse and palindrome repeats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Among recorded repeats, nine were common among all three species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3C</xref>). 
 <italic>Carduus acanthoides</italic> had four unique repeats, whereas 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> each had a single unique repeat. 
 <italic>Carduus acanthoides</italic> shared one specific repeat with both 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic>, whereas 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> shared five specific repeat regions (
