<p>The ML and BI analyses, based on 78 protein-coding genes from 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> and related taxa, yielded identical topologies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). In particular, both analyses confirmed the monophyly of Asteraceae subfamilies (i.e., Carduoideae, Chichorioideae, and Asteroideae). In contrast to the high support for Carduoideae and Cichorioideae (Bootstrap = 100/Posterior Probability = 1), low support was found for Asteroideae clades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). Notably, monophyly of the three 
 <italic>Carduus</italic> species was not supported by either analysis. For example, 
 <italic>C. acanthoides</italic> was sister to 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic>, whereas 
 <italic>C. crispus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tenuiflorus</italic> were sister to 
 <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic>. Additional ML and BI analyses of full cpDNA sequences and non-coding regions suggested similar relationships (
