  <p>Allometric relationship between sapwood area and stem diameter of the sampled 
   <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees (left) and stem diameter distributions of instrumented trees (right). [Note: tree numbers 1–3 were from the first batch experimental sites, and trees 4–6 were replications of experimental sites for both habitat types, i.e., floodplains and dryland sites].
