<p id="Par5">Species of the genus 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>, and their hybrids, are among the most aggressive IAPS worldwide, particularly in semi-arid and arid regions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, native to Central and South America were introduced to different parts of the world, including Africa, India and Australia, to provide shade, shelter, fodder, fuel wood and timber, and to increase soil stability in degraded ecosystems
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. However, several of the planted 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, including 
 <italic>Prosopis juliflora</italic> (Swartz D.C), have become invasive, thereby displacing native vegetation, reducing biodiversity and negatively affecting rural livelihoods

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species have been reported to be highly water-consuming plant species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. Studies conducted in South Africa revealed that the invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> tree species and hybrids significantly impact groundwater levels
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>, due to the very deep taproots. Groundwater abstraction (i.e. the process of extracting ground water) by 
 <italic>Prosopis sp</italic>. affects both surface runoff, groundwater recharge and evaporation losses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. So far, studies on the eco-hydrology of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> have been conducted in its native range in the Southern Arizona, USA
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> (mainly 
 <italic>Prosopis glandulosa</italic> Torr.) and in the introduced range in South Africa

 </sup> (complex of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species and hybrids) where 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees shed their leaves during the cold season. However, no study has investigated water consumption of the evergreen 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, the dominant invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species in semi-arid and arid ecosystems in the tropical regions of Eastern Africa. The evergreen leaf habit of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> may lead to year-round groundwater abstraction by this species. Thus, the overall water consumption of the evergreen 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> is likely to be higher than that of leaf-shedding 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. In this paper, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal water use of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> trees in the flood plains and the adjacent drylands of the semi-arid Afar Region, Ethiopia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also assessed evapotranspiration of a dense 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> stand in the floodplains. To upscale water consumption by 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> to the regional level, we combined the stand level water use measurements with the fractional vegetation cover of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> in the Afar Region that was mapped and published by Shiferaw et al
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, we estimated the annual costs of water use by 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> at the regional level.
