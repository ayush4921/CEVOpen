 </sup>. Due to their invasive character, these plants can become the dominant species both at the local as well as at the landscape scale. Some of the well-known examples of changes in vegetation composition due to plant invasions originate from invasions of grasslands or shrubland by woody IAPS in arid and semi-arid environments, such as in South Africa

 </sup> found that individual native and invasive trees tended to have similar sap flow rates, but that invasive-dominated ecosystems were more likely to have higher sap flow rates per unit area than native-dominated ecosystems because invasive species grow in denser stands than natives species and dense stands consume more water than sparsely stocked stands.
