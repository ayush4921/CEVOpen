<p id="Par40">In general, tree water use is expected to vary between the wet and the dry season. In semi-arid to arid regions such as Afar, water availability during the wet season is high and VPD is relatively low. During the dry season, when soil moisture is low and VPD, temperature and solar radiation are high, tree water use should decline to prevent canopy desiccation. However, in contrast to the studies cited above, in savannas of northern Australia tree water use was found to either not differ between wet and dry seasons

 </sup>. This result was explained on the basis of the fact that rooting depth allowed the plant access to sufficient water stored in the soil also during the dry season to enable transpiration to proceed. Similarly, the study found that the evergreen 
 <italic>P.juliflora</italic> used more water and transpired more during the dry season than during the rainy season. Tanaka et al

 </sup> showed that water use of trees in a hill evergreen forest in Thailand peaked in the late dry season. The factors contributing to higher water use of trees in drylands relative to the floodplains may thus also explain why 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in Afar consumes more water during the dry than during the wet season. Hence, the findings suggest that the evergreen leaf feature of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> not only leads to water abstraction from the groundwater during both the wet and the dry season, but also it even increases water abstraction during the dry season, which significantly exacerbates regional water shortage.
