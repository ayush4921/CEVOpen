<p id="Par41">Total ET is acquired from three different sources, namely soil evaporation, interception loss and transpiration, which are mainly influenced by the vegetation composition. For example, the degree of ground cover has a substantial influence on soil evaporation

 </sup>. In this study, however, soil evaporation contributed little to total ET, which might be due to the fact that the soil is very dry and understorey transpiration is low because of absence of undergrowth in the study area. However, the degree of soil evaporation, in turn, is determined by the meteorological conditions
