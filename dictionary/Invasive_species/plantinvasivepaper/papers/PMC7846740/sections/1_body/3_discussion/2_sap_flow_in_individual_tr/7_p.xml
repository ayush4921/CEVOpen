<p id="Par44">Finally, comparing three scenarios for crop specific coefficients (grass reference at standard height of 0.5 m, bare soil and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded areas scenarios), bare soil have a crop coefficient (Kc) of 0.3 to 0.5 while well-watered grass has 0.7 to 1.0
 <sup>3</sup> whereas 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded areas exhibited a Kc of about 0.77 all year round, indicating that invaded areas extracted more groundwater on an annual basis as grass-dominated habitats in the study area consume water only during the 2–3 months of the rainy season and would dry up during dry seasons, unlike the areas invaded by evergreen 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in Ethiopia.
