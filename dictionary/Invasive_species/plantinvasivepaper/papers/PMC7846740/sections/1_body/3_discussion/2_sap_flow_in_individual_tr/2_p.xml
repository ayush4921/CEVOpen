<p id="Par39">The higher solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit and air temperature in the drylands may thus favor higher water use by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees growing in this habitat, relative to trees growing in the floodplains. The higher sap flow of evergreen 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees in the drylands of Awash River Basin may therefore be explained by the fact that the study area is a flat plain which may provide a sufficiently large groundwater reservoir from which deep-rooting trees of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> can take up water also during the dry season, as groundwater can be found within the range of 10–20 m depth and the depth increased as we move away from the river (expert consultation). Le Maitre et al.

 </sup> reported that in South Africa tree water use of leaf-shedding 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species is higher in riparian settings or shallow water tables where water availability is greater, relative to dryland settings. They therefore concluded that the impact of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> on ecosystems services is greater in riparian than in dryland ecosystems. Similarly, in the southern parts of the USA water use by 
 <italic>Prosopis velutina</italic> Wooton tended to be higher in the floodplains than in adjacent dryland (Scott et al., 2006). In contrast, the present study revealed that sap flow of the evergreen 
 <italic>Prosopis juliflora</italic> trees was higher in the drylands than in the floodplains of Awash River Basin. This contradicts the general assumption that trees growing in areas with wet soils consume more water than trees growing in dry soil. While rainwater is the preferred source of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> when available, Dzikiti et al.

 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill. was largely independent of topsoil water content, because tree has the flexibility to resort to groundwater if necessary.
