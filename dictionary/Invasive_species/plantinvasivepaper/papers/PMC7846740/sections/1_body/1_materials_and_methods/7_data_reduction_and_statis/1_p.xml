<p id="Par26">LoggerNet 4.1 (Campbell Scientific, Inc, Logan UT, USA) was used for downloading sap flow data from data loggers to the laptop and for converting the data to 30 min interval values. EddyPro 6.0 (Licor Nebraska, Lincoln, USA) was employed for processing the high frequency EC data used for calculating ET. Sap flow rates were calculated following Burgess et al

Multiple linear regressions were carried out using either sap flow or ET as response variable and solar radiation, soil moisture, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit and potential ET as explanatory variables at a time in an open source R software version 3.3.3
