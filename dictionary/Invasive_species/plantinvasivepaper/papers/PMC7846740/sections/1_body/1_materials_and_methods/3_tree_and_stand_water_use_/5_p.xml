<p id="Par18">Air temperature and humidity were measured at high frequency using a temperature and humidity Probe (Model HMP155A-L, Campbell Scientific, 2013). The high frequency data were further corrected for 1) lack of sensor levelness (coordinate rotation), 2) sensor time lags, and 3) fluctuations in the air density using the EddyPro version 6.0 software (Li-COR, Nebraska, USA). Sensor separation corrections were not necessary as the IRGA and sonic are a single unit.</p>
