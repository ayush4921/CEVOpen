<p id="Par6">Water consumption of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> (hereafter 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>) was measured in the Amibara District (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) of the Afar Region, Ethiopia (9.16° to 9.21° N and 40.08° to 40.12° E at 740 m a.s.l.). The study area is located in the Awash River Basin and includes both the floodplains of the Awash River and the adjacent dryland. Although relatively water scarce, the Awash River Basin is the most developed and utilized river basin in Ethiopia
