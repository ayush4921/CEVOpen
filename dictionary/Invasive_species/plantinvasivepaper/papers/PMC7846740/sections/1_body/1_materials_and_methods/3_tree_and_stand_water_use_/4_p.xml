<p id="Par17">To study the dynamics of total actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> stands, an open path eddy covariance (EC) system was installed on Site 1 and data were collected for 11 months from January to November 2017 as it was not possible to continue measuring for more periods due to equipment limitations. The EC was borrowed from Addis Ababa University only for one year so ETa from the other sites could not be measured. The EC system was the IRGASON system which comprised a sonic anemometer (Model: CSAT3A Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan UT, USA) that measured the wind speed in 3-D at 10 Hz frequency. The H
 <sub>2</sub>O/CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations of the atmosphere were measured using an Infrared Gas Analyzers (Model: EC150, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA). The collected data was stored by a data logger (Model: CR3000: Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA) on a Compact Flash card module (NL115 or CFM100). To quantify the changes in the energy balance of the study site, two other components of the surface energy balance were measured. These include the net radiation, which was measured using a single component net radiometer (Model: NR-LITE2: Manufacturer: Kipp &amp; Zonnen, Delft, The Netherlands) that was mounted at the top of the tower (~ 7.5 m above the ground). The IRGASON sensor was installed outside the surface roughness layer of the canopy at an average height of about one meter above the 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> tree canopy. This ensured a uniform fetch around the tower with a flux foot print of about 100 m radius.
