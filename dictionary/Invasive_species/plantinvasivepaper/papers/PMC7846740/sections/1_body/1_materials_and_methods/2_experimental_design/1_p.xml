<p id="Par8">To investigate the temporal and spatial variation in water use by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> across the landscape, data collection was done in the two most heavily invaded habitat types in the Afar Region. These include the floodplains of Awash River and the adjacent non-riparian drylands. Sap flow monitoring stations were established at two sites in the floodplains of the Awash River and at two sites in the dryland area where soil moisture levels were low (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The study areas were representative of other parts of the Afar Region that are invaded by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>.
