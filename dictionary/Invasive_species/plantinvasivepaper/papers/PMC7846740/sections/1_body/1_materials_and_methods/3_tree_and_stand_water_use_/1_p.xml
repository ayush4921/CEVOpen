 </sup>. In total, four sap flow stations were established (Sites 1 to 4) with three trees instrumented per station. Trees with different stem diameters were selected to capture the variation in transpiration rates in the study region. Stem diameter of the instrumented trees was measured just below the branching at about 60 cm above the ground at all sites. Each sap flow station comprised a CR1000 data logger and an AM16/32B multiplexer, as specified by Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA. Each system was powered by a 70 Ah (12 V) rechargeable battery using 50 W solar panels. Four sets of heaters applied heat to each tree for 0.5 s every hour through a custom-made relay control module. Moreover, a pair of equally placed (0.5 cm) T-Type thermocouples was installed on either side of the heater to measure the sapwood temperature before and after pulsing the heat. With a precision drilling rig, two 2.0 mm diameter holes were carefully made for the thermocouples to minimize errors due to probe misalignments. Heater holes were about 1.8 mm diameter to ensure a tight fit to facilitate heat transfer to the wood during pulsing.
