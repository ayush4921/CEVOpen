<p id="Par32">The daily average of ET
 <sub>a</sub> ranged from 1.5 to 9.5 mm, with an annual average of 3.7 mm/day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, top). Moreover, the sap flow and ETa measured at site 1 revealed a similar pattern during the course of the year, although the daily values for ETa were almost always higher than those for sap flow. The average ETo for the 11 months was estimated at 4.99 mm/day. The lowest amount of ET was recorded in January and February due to the low atmospheric evaporative demand while the highest was in June, August and September (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, bottom) during summer. Comparing 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> ETa with the potential evapotranspiration (ETo), the annual average crop coefficient (K
 <sub>c</sub>) of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was found about 0.77 for 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded areas.
