<p id="Par31">On the other hand, each of the 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees in the floodplains used less water than the trees in the dryland (Appendix 2). Sap flow was plotted across both habitat types and average sap flow (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), indicates that dryland has shown higher sap flow for 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> than floodplains of the same species.
