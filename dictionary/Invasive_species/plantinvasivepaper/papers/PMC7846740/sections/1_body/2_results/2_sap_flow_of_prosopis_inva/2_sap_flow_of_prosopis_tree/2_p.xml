<p id="Par30">When comparing seasonal variability between the dry season (January-March) and the rainy season (July–September), 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees were found to use more water during the dry season (7.5 l/tree/day) than during the rainy season (6.0 l/tree/day; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). During the rainy season, the trees sampled in the floodplains used about 5.0 l/tree/day whereas the trees in the drylands used about 7.1 l/tree/day. On the other hand, during the dry season trees in the floodplains and in drylands used about 5.1 and 10.0 l/tree/day, respectively. Similarly, average sap flow across invaded areas reached 3.0 and 3.8 mm per day during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
