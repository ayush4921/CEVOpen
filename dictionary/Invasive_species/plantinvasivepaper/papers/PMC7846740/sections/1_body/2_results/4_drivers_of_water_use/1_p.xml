<p id="Par33">Regression analyses of possible drivers of water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> revealed that ETa was explained by wind speed, soil moisture, VPD, and ETo (all p &lt; 0.0001; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>A). Sap flow at individual tree level was significantly explained by soil moisture and, VPD and to a lesser extent also by solar radiation and wind speed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>B). Analyses separated by habitat indicated that soil moisture, wind speed, VPD and solar radiation explained a significant amount of variation in sap flow at tree level in drylands, while only VPD and wind speed explained a significant amount of variation in sap flow of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in floodplains (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>C &amp; 3D). When combining results from floodplains and drylands, sap flow dynamics at tree level was significantly affected by solar radiation, wind speed, soil moisture and VPD (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>E). Crop coefficient of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was also estimated at 0.77 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>A), which is the slope of ETa plotted against ETo.
