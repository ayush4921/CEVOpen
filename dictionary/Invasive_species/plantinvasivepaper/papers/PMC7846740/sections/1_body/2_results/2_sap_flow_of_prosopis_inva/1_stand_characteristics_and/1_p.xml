<p id="Par28">Sap wood area were found proportional with stem diameters of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> tree with R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.94 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, left). Moreover, stem diameters of the instrumented trees were similar between the floodplains and the dryland sites. There was a highly significant relationship between sapwood area and stem diameter of the sampled 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees. The stem diameter distributions were assumed to be representative for trees in the invaded areas (both floodplain and dryland; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, right).
