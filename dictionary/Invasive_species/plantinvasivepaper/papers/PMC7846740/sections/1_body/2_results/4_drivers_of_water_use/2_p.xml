<p id="Par34">When comparing climatic factors as drivers of water use and measured water uses (in terms of sap flow and ETa), ETa was found the lowest when wind speed was low while sap flow of trees in the drylands changed with VPD, soil moisture, and with solar radiation, but not with wind speed. It was also observed that the higher the solar radiation, the higher the sap flow (Fig.Â
