<p id="Par27">Sap flow varied with the daily solar radiation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and was the highest at high air temperature and low relative humidity (Appendix 1). The highest solar radiation was registered between 10:00 and 16:00, reaching up to 1000 W/m
 <sup>2</sup> around noon, and the daily average varied between 8.1 and 26.5 MJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>/day. The highest relative humidity was observed from 03:00 to 07:00 while air pressure was more or less constant throughout the day and was about 91 kPa (Appendix 1). When comparing sap flows of trees in floodplains and drylands, the sap flow was lower in the floodplains than in the drylands though the diurnal trends showed similar patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
