<p id="Par29">Water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees varied with stem diameter, habitat type (dryland and floodplains), and the seasonal changes in the climatic conditions of the study area. On average, the sampled 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees used about 6.8 ± 2.9 l/tree/day. The instrumented 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees in the floodplains consumed on average less water (5.1 ± 3.4 l/tree/day) than those in the drylands (8.5 ± 5.8 l/tree/day) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). On the other hand, the relationship between stem diameter and sap flow indicated that stem diameter explained about 48% of the variation in sap flow (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, left). After normalizing the daily sap flow by sapwood area, the sap flux density also indicated the same trend that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees in the dryland area exhibit higher sap flux density than those in the floodplains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, right). Daily average sap flux density (SFD) explained about 64% of the water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> across the different habitat types. In both cases, we found that trees in the drylands consume more water than those in the floodplains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Moreover, regression analysis of sap flow as dependent and tree diameter and habitat type as explanatory variables also confirmed this with R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.48, F-stat of 9.22 and significant level of 0.013, which is less than the common 
 <italic>p </italic>value of 0.05 at 95% confidence level. This result, indicates that the water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees in dryland differs significantly from that in the floodplains.
