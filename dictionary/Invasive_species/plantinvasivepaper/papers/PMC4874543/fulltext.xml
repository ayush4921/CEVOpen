The native European plant <italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> occurs as two cytotypes with different life histories (monocarpic diploids, allo-polycarpic tetraploids). However, only tetraploids have been found in its introduced range in North America, where <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> has become a most prominent plant invader. Here, we focus on the ploidy level of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and origin of neighbouring community in explaining the high impact during the invasion of new sites in the introduced range. We conducted a mesocosm experiment under open-field conditions with the diploid (EU2x) and tetraploid (EU4x) cytotype of <italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> from its native European (EU) range, and with the invasive tetraploid (NA4x) cytotype from the introduced North American (NA) range in competition with EU (old) or NA (new) neighbouring plant communities. In the presence of competition, the biomass of EU neighbouring community was reduced to a comparable level by all three geo-cytotypes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. In contrast, the biomass of the NA neighbouring community was reduced beyond when competing with tetraploid, but not with diploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. The fact that the biomass of all three geo-cytotypes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> was correlated with the biomass of the EU neighbouring community, but not with that of the NA neighbouring community suggests that different mechanisms underlie the competitive interactions between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and its old vs. new neighbouring communities, such as competition for the same limiting resources at home vs competition through novel allelo-chemicals or differential resource uptake strategies in the introduced range. We therefore caution to simply use the ecosystem impact assessed at home to predict impact in the introduced range.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>National Centre of Competence in Research (SNSF-NCCR) &#x02018;Plant Survival&#x02019;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller-Sch&#x000e4;rer</surname><given-names>Heinz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>National Centre of Competence in Research (SNSF-NCCR) &#x02018;Plant Survival&#x02019;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaffner</surname><given-names>Urs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>31003A_125314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller-Sch&#x000e4;rer</surname><given-names>Heinz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF grant number 31003A_125314 to HMS) and the National Centre of Competence in Research (SNSF-NCCR) &#x02018;Plant Survival&#x02019; (to US and HMS).

Studies on the interactions between invasive alien plant species and components of native ecosystems conducted over the past decades have greatly increased our understanding of invasion processes, but our ability to predict when, where and why invasive alien species will exert large and substantive impacts on ecosystem functioning remains limited [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>While evidence is increasing that some species traits indeed correlate with increased rates of spread of invasive alien species (e.g. Schlaepfer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), it remains to be shown whether these or any other species traits may contribute to the dominance of an alien species when competing with a complex of resident plant species in the introduced range [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Strong impacts have been shown to occur when invaders greatly differ in their traits from those of the natives in the invaded community [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This, for instance, may enable invasive plant to exploit nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or soil water [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that residents are not able to tap in the introduced range [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Differences in resource acquisition between invasive alien plant species and resident species may then explain the increased impact of a plant invader in the introduced compared to its native range [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Strauss et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that invasive alien grass species causing high impacts are more distantly related to native grasses than are alien but noninvasive grass species in California. Invasive alien plants may also interfere with residents due to &#x02018;novel biochemical weapons&#x02019; released by invaders in the introduced ecosystem, ranging from changes in nutrients to changes in trophic structure, while these allelochemicals are relatively ineffective against their old neighbours with which the invader shares a co-evolutionary history [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, altered biotic interactions between invasive alien plants and native mutualisms can reduce the performance of residents [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], improve nutrient availability for invaders [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and are also reported to lead to increased reproduction of plant invaders in the introduced range [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The concept that recipient communities are likely to be disrupted by novel invaders may be more general. These novel interactions can result from a pre-adaptation, an inherent character of invasive alien plant species, e.g. weedy demographic traits [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which enables invaders to build up high local population densities and thereby to impose high ecosystem impact. Alternatively, increased impact has also been explained by the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, which posits that invasive species might divert available energy and resources to compete with na&#x000ef;ve neighbours when they arrive in the introduced range without their enemies [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Blumenthal et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that plants had fewer enemies in the novel environment as compared with the native environment, however, they did not find evidence of higher impact.</p><p><italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> (syn. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>maculosa</italic> Lam., Asteraceae), is a widespread, short-lived forb native to Europe that was introduced into North America as a seed contaminant some 150 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In Europe (EU), it exists as two cytotypes, diploids (2n = 2x = 18) and allo-tetraploids (2n = 4x = 36), which occurs in predominantly single-cytotype populations [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, so far, only tetraploids have been recorded from its introduced North American (NA) range, despite the higher frequency of diploid populations at home, a largely sympatric and similar geographic distribution of diploid and tetraploid populations in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and evidence for multiple introductions into North America [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which all assumes that both cytotypes have been introduced. The performance of the three <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> geo-cytotypes (EU2x, EU4x and NA4x) has been well studied in the absence of competition [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Experimental evidence showed that the characteristics of tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>, e.g. rapid growth, perennial life cycle, higher reproduction, increased phenotypic plasticity and increased drought tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as compared to diploid conspecifics may have better pre-adapted them for invading the introduced range and may also explain the absence of the diploid cytotype in North America [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Evidence for post-introduction evolution in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> by genetic drift or selection is mixed. Ridenour et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that NA <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> plants grew faster than plants from EU populations, but this may not result in increased biomass of mature plants or increased reproductive output [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hahn et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found earlier flowering and increased seed mass in North American tetraploids compared with European tetraploids and higher seedling emergence of tetraploid NA compared to tetraploid EU <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. Those results have been explained as a trade-off between growth and defence traits (evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA)-hypothesis) [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], suggesting post-introduction evolution in introduced tetraploid populations. Thus, present results indicate that a combination of pre-adaptation due to polyploidy and further post-introduction evolution that favoured the North American tetraploids may have contributed to their invasion success. However, whether the three geo-cytotypes differ in their impact on the resident plant community and whether the impact is affected by the origin of the competing plant community (native vs. introduced range) and thus may differentially impact the geo-cytotype&#x02019;s ability as a driver of invasiveness has not been assessed simultaneously so far.</p><p>In an open-field mesocosm experiment, we set out to explore the performance of a community of old European vs. new North American plant communities when competing with one of the three geo-cytotypes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>, and when growing in the absence of competition with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. Specifically, we tested (1) whether the tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> are more competitive than the diploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>, irrespective of the origin of the tetraploids and the origin of the neighbours (evidence for an inherently higher competitive ability, i.e. pre-adaptation), (2) whether tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> are particularly competitive when growing with a species mixture consisting of new, na&#x000ef;ve plant species from the introduced range (evidence for a context-dependent pre-adaptation) or (3) whether the NA tetraploids reveal a higher impact on resident communities in general or the NA community specifically than the EU tetraploids (evidence for post-introduction evolution). Based on findings from an earlier pairwise competition study between tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and individual EU vs. NA neighbours [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we also assessed (4) whether the two neighbouring communities vary in their relationship between the biomass of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of the neighbouring communities, and (5) whether this relationship differs among the three geo-cytotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statements</title><p>Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture issued a seed import permit to the CABI Centre in Del&#x000e9;mont for our study.

Tetraploids reduced the biomass of the resident community more significantly than diploids, but this difference was only observed when competing with NA natives. Since the growth rate of the EU vs. NA neighbouring community in the non-competition containers did not differ consistently, our results indicate that tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> inflict an over-proportional impact on NA neighbouring community compared to EU neighbouring community (hypotheses 1 &#x00026; 2). The fact that the biomass of all three <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> geo-cytotypes was correlated with the biomass of the EU neighbouring community, but not with that of the NA neighbouring community (hypotheses 4 &#x00026; 5), suggests an inherently different mechanism underlying the competitive interactions between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and its old neighbouring community in Europe vs. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and its new neighbouring community in North America. This pattern is unlikely to be influenced by individual neighbouring species. While a marginally significant variation in impact was found among the NA species used in this study (see the REI results in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">M&#x00026;M</xref>), no significant variation in impact was found among sixteen NA species (including the species used in this study) in a previously conducted pairwise competition experiment ([<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]); also, EU species did not differ in impact neither in this study nor in the previously conducted experiment ([<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]).</p><p>Based on the results of a short-term greenhouse study, Sun et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] proposed that the relationship between the biomass of the invader and the biomass of resident plant species might shed light on the type of interspecific interaction in operation. They found a significant negative linear relationship between the biomass produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of its old neighbours at home that share a co-evolutionary history with the invader, suggesting that they compete for the same limiting resources. In contrast, the biomass of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> explained very little of the variation in biomass of the na&#x000ef;ve neighbours in the introduced range, indicating that the impact is driven by other forms of negative interactions (cf. below). Similarly, we also found significant negative relationships between biomass of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of EU neighbouring community for all three geo-cytotypes. In contrast, the lack of a significant relationship between biomass of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of North American neighbouring community suggests that the negative interactions of all three geo-cytotypes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> with its na&#x000ef;ve neighbours was driven by other mechanisms than resource competition, such as by exploitation of resources that are not utilized by neighbours [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or by interference competition [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This indicates that the different impact types of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> in its home vs. introduced range are more likely driven by the native community origin (hypothesis 4) rather than the geo-cytotypes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> (hypothesis 5).</p><p>Despite the fact that both diploid and tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> appeared to interact with NA native communities differently than with EU native communities, the diploids which did not become invasive in North America [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], did not inflict an increased impact on NA native communities. In the absence of competition, the tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> grew significantly larger than diploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. However, it is not clear whether this may explain the increased impact of tetraploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> on NA neighbouring community, since in the competition containers all <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> geo-cytotypes reached a comparable biomass at the end of the experiment.</p><p>In our experiment we observed no evidence for post-introduction evolutionary change in impact of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. On the other hand, in the presence of competition a significant increase in early reproductive capacity in NA4x <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> populations was found, compared to the two cytotypes from the native range, and no differences were observed between the two cytotypes within Europe. In line with the study by Callaway et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but in contrast to that by Hahn et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we observed a higher early reproductive capacity of NA4x <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> only in the competition treatment.</p><p>It should be noted though that we only tested a limited amount of populations of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> of the three geo-cytotypes in the experiment. Nevertheless, the increased impact of 4x <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> (no differences between EU4x and NA4x) on NA plant species as detected in this experiment is unlikely to be driven by post-introduction evolution of increased impact of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>, as we found no significant difference in impact between EUU4x and NA4x <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. This pattern is well in line with earlier results of a greenhouse experiment [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as well as with a field study [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The results of this study indicate that the invasive tetraploid cytotype of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic> not only harbours traits that increase its population build-up [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but also traits that inflict an inherently higher impact on na&#x000ef;ve neighbours than diploid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>stoebe</italic>. Our study also proposes that assessments of impact of alien plant species preferentially should be conducted in a competitive environment using the na&#x000ef;ve neighbours from the introduced range. Up to date, only a small proportion of studies on invasive plant species specifically addressed impact by taking a biogeographic approach [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similarly to our findings, Callaway et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] showed that <italic>Rhaponticum repens</italic> (L.) Hidalgo (formerly <italic>Acroptilon repens</italic> (L.) DC.), a highly invasive forb in North America, had stronger competitive effects against native North American species than against species native to Uzbekistan, the home range of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>repens</italic>. The effects of leachates collected from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>repens</italic> roots were weak but more negative on species from North America than on species from Uzbekistan. Canopies of <italic>Prosopis juliflora</italic>, a native leguminous tree of the New World but an invader in many other regions, had facilitative effects on the diversity of other species in its native range. However, in India and on Hawaii, USA, where <italic>P</italic>. <italic>juliflora</italic> is an aggressive invader, canopy effects were consistently and strongly negative on species richness [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> (L.) R. M. King and H. Robinson had stronger competitive effects on native species from China (the invaded range) than on <italic>native</italic> species from Mexico (the native range of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>odorata</italic>) under high nutrient conditions, and the germination and growth of species native to China was far more inhibited by extracts from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>odorata</italic> leaves than those of species native to Mexico [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Hence, while still more studies comparing the impact of an invasive plant at home and away are needed, there is a growing body of evidence that the biogeographic origin of species does indeed matter for understanding the impacts of invasive plant species (cf. Richardson and Ricciardi [<xref rid="pone.0155712.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] for the recent controversy in invasion science on &#x0201c;does origin matter&#x0201d;).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Christian Stickelberger, Nicolas H&#x000e4;fliger, Francois Schindelholz, Aline Junod, Mazzal Stokvis and Elham Tarboush for assistance with field work and John L.
