<p>The study was conducted in a fallow field next to the CABI Centre in Delémont (47°22'N, 7°19'E), Switzerland. Due to legal constraints, studies with populations from the introduced range have to be conducted under controlled conditions. We thus chose to set up the experiment in 50 L containers (49 cm surface diameter and 40 cm depth) that were sunk completely into the ground. Soil was excavated to a depth of 0.5 m, roots and rocks were removed, the soil mixed with 10 L vermiculite (Vermisol
 <sup>®</sup>, 4–8 mm grain size, VTT AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) and filled into the containers. Eleven treatments were set up by growing the EU and NA neighbouring community (10 individuals from seven EU or NA species) in the presence of the three

 <italic>stoebe</italic> geo-cytotypes (10 individuals from one of the three geo-cytotypes) and also in the absence of

 <italic>stoebe</italic>; the three geo-cytotypes of

 <italic>stoebe</italic> were also grown alone. Each treatment was replicated nine times, resulting in a total of 99 containers.
