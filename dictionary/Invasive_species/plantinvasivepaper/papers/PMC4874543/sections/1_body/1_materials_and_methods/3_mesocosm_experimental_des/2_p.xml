 <italic>stoebe</italic> from EU and NA were grown from seeds in March 2012. We sowed seeds of all species into seedling trays and grew germinated individuals in “conetainers” (2.5 cm surface diameter and 16.5 cm depth; Stuewe and Sons, Corvallis, OR) filled with commercial potting soil (Selmaterra, Eric Schweizer AG, Thun, Switzerland) mixed with sand and vermiculite (Vermisol
 <sup>®</sup>, granular form, VTT AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) in the ratio 4:2:1. The seedling trays and conetainers were kept in a CABI greenhouse and exposed to natural light condition, which was supplemented by metal halide bulbs (18h-light, 6h-dark) for seven weeks. In May 2012, we transplanted seedlings of the seven EU/NA species into the containers at an average distance of 12–14 cm. We used two individuals each of the species in the functional groups “grasses” and “midseason forb with spreading rhizomes” in a native resident community (

 <italic>stoebe</italic> seedlings randomly drawn from all populations of the same geo-cytotype were transplanted into containers with or without neighbouring community. The pattern of the spatial arrangement of the plants was the same in each container (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155712.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Containers were weeded weekly to avoid the emergence of seedlings of other species from the soil seed bank, and irrigation was maintained for four months (i.e. May-August).
