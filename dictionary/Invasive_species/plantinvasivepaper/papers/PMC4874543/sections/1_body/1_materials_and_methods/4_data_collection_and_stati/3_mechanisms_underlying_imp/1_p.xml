As to the random structure, we compared a random intercept and slope model and a random intercept model using geo-cytotype as a factor, and used the likelihood ratio test from maximum likelihood (ML) fits for significance. They indicated no difference between the common slope and the slopes of each of the geo-cytotype (P &gt; 0.1). Eventually, model-II simple linear regression (geometric mean regression) using standard major axis (SMA) method [
