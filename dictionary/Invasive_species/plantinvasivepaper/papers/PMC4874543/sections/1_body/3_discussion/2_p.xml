<p>Based on the results of a short-term greenhouse study, Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] proposed that the relationship between the biomass of the invader and the biomass of resident plant species might shed light on the type of interspecific interaction in operation. They found a significant negative linear relationship between the biomass produced by 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of its old neighbours at home that share a co-evolutionary history with the invader, suggesting that they compete for the same limiting resources. In contrast, the biomass of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> explained very little of the variation in biomass of the naïve neighbours in the introduced range, indicating that the impact is driven by other forms of negative interactions (cf. below). Similarly, we also found significant negative relationships between biomass of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of EU neighbouring community for all three geo-cytotypes. In contrast, the lack of a significant relationship between biomass of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of North American neighbouring community suggests that the negative interactions of all three geo-cytotypes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> with its naïve neighbours was driven by other mechanisms than resource competition, such as by exploitation of resources that are not utilized by neighbours [

 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This indicates that the different impact types of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> in its home vs. introduced range are more likely driven by the native community origin (hypothesis 4) rather than the geo-cytotypes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> (hypothesis 5).
