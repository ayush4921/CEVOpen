<p>While evidence is increasing that some species traits indeed correlate with increased rates of spread of invasive alien species (e.g. Schlaepfer et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), it remains to be shown whether these or any other species traits may contribute to the dominance of an alien species when competing with a complex of resident plant species in the introduced range [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Strong impacts have been shown to occur when invaders greatly differ in their traits from those of the natives in the invaded community [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This, for instance, may enable invasive plant to exploit nutrients [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or soil water [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that residents are not able to tap in the introduced range [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Differences in resource acquisition between invasive alien plant species and resident species may then explain the increased impact of a plant invader in the introduced compared to its native range [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Strauss et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that invasive alien grass species causing high impacts are more distantly related to native grasses than are alien but noninvasive grass species in California. Invasive alien plants may also interfere with residents due to ‘novel biochemical weapons’ released by invaders in the introduced ecosystem, ranging from changes in nutrients to changes in trophic structure, while these allelochemicals are relatively ineffective against their old neighbours with which the invader shares a co-evolutionary history [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, altered biotic interactions between invasive alien plants and native mutualisms can reduce the performance of residents [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], improve nutrient availability for invaders [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and are also reported to lead to increased reproduction of plant invaders in the introduced range [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The concept that recipient communities are likely to be disrupted by novel invaders may be more general. These novel interactions can result from a pre-adaptation, an inherent character of invasive alien plant species, e.g. weedy demographic traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which enables invaders to build up high local population densities and thereby to impose high ecosystem impact. Alternatively, increased impact has also been explained by the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, which posits that invasive species might divert available energy and resources to compete with naïve neighbours when they arrive in the introduced range without their enemies [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Blumenthal et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that plants had fewer enemies in the novel environment as compared with the native environment, however, they did not find evidence of higher impact.
