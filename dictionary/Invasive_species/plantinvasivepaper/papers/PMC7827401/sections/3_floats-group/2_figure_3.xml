  <p>Global transcriptome/proteome similarity between 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
   <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Correlation between the 4 tissue types for proteomics and transcriptomics data in 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (left) and 
   <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (right). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Correlation between co-orthologs which were significantly differentially expressed/abundant in at least one of the species (for all co-orthologs, see 
   <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), showing correlation between samples across the two species. Blue represents higher correlation and red represents lower. Size of the circle is directly proportional to higher correlation. Pairwise mean Pearson correlation coefficients are given as numbers in the circles.
