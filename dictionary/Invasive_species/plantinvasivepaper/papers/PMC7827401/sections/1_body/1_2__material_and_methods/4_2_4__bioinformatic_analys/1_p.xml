<p>Paired-end Illumina (HiSeq, NextSeq, Seqomics Kft., Mórahalom, Hungary) reads were quality trimmed using the CLC Genomics Workbench tool version 11.0 (CLC Bio/Qiagen) removing ambiguous nucleotides as well as low quality read ends. The quality cutoff (error probability) was set to 0.05, corresponding to a Phred score of 13. Trimmed reads of &gt;40 bases were mapped using the RNA-Seq Analysis 2.16 package in CLC requiring &gt;80% sequence identity over &gt;80% of the read length; strand specificity was omitted. Reads with less than 30 equally scoring mapping positions were mapped to all possible locations while reads with &gt;30 potential mapping positions were considered as uninformative repeat reads and were excluded. “Total counts” RNA-Seq count data was imported from CLC into R version 3.0.2. We kept only genes detected by at least five mapped reads in at least 25% of the samples. Subsequently, “calcNormFactors” from “edgeR” version 3.4.2 [
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was used to perform data scaling based on the“trimmed mean of M-values” (TMM) method [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Log transformation was carried out by the “voom” function of the “limma” package version 3.18.13 [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Linear modeling, empirical Bayes moderation as well as the calculation of differentially expressed genes were carried out using “limma”. Genes showing an at least two-fold gene expression change with an FDR value &lt;0.05 were considered as significant. Multidimensional scaling (“plotMDS” function in edgeR) was applied to visually summarize gene expression profiles. In addition, unsupervised cluster analysis with Euclidean distance calculation and complete-linkage clustering was carried out on the normalized data using “heatmap.2” function from R package “gplots”.
