<p>Wood decay resembling soft rot has been reported also for several early-diverging Agaricomycetes (e.g., in non-mycorrhizal Cantharellales), which predate the origin of lignin-degrading class II peroxidases [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We hypothesized that these early diverging lineages of Basidiomycota class Agaricomycetes, together with a few later diverged species that have lost their lignin-attacking genes and ability (e.g., 
 <italic>Jaapia</italic> and 
 <italic>Schizophyllum</italic>), reverted to a plesiomorphic soft-rot like decay mechanism, which is primarily dominated by cellulolytic and pectinolytic functions [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It appears that this decay profile is widespread among Agaricomycetes, and we suggest that such species represent secondarily soft-rot fungi that have partially lost their ability to enzymatically attack and degrade lignin due to depletion and/or disability to produce catalytically efficient class-II peroxidase encoding. We think that the combination of (i) a widely conserved plesiomorphic soft rot-like wood decay strategy and (ii) the ability to degrade lignin in white rot, enables Agaricomycetes to toggle between soft- and white rot either by gene loss or by gene expression regulation. Thus, it is possible that temporal or substrate-dependent regulation of the activation of LDE encoding genes can separate soft- and white- rot behaviors of some species, adding further complexity to the range of decay modes of Basidiomycota.
