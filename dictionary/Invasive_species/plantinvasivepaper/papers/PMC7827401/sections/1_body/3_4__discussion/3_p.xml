<p>Several aspects of the gene expression patterns in our assays are unusual for white-rot fungi. These include the lack of an early burst of LDE encoding gene expression as is typical for white-rot fungi and the high expression of some genes (e.g., iron uptake systems, oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenases) that have been reported from brown rot fungi [

 <xref rid="B78-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Previous studies questioned the typical white-rot nature of

 <xref rid="B96-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. 
 <italic>Armillaria mellea</italic> was reported to attack celluloses but not lignin in the early stages of decay [

 <xref rid="B96-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. We previously showed that, based on LDEs, 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> spp. are intermediate between brown-rot and white-rot fungi, along with other species that have been recalcitrant to the WR/BR classification [
 <xref rid="B97-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], as well as ectomycorrhizal fungi with reduced LDE encoding gene repertoires. Of these, 
 <italic>Cylindrobasidium torrendii</italic> is a close relative of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> in the Physalacriaceae. Floudas et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that the reduced LDE encoding gene repertoire of 
 <italic>C. torrendii</italic> is a result of gene loss compared to its white-rot ancestors and that the decay of dead wood caused by this species resembles soft rot. While soft rot is characteristic to Ascomycota, especially in the class Sordariomycetes, several Basidiomycetes have been associated with Type II (e.g., 
 <italic>C. torrendii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) or Type I (e.g., 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) soft rot. These species are characterized by a complete set of PCWDEs for degrading cellulose and hemicellulose, but a depletion of genes encoding LDEs. More generally, a selective deployment of lignin-degrading activity has been reported in a number of wood-decaying fungal species of Basidiomycota. 
 <italic>Mucidula mucida</italic> (of the order Agaricales, as 
 <italic>Oudemansiella mucida)</italic> and 
 <italic>Meripilus giganteus</italic> (of the order Polyporales) caused either soft or white rot, depending on decay stage and substrate (host species, and type of wood and plant cell composition) [

 <xref rid="B99-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Recently, 
 <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus,</italic> a species typically reported to cause white rot, was reported to produce soft-rot like symptoms [
