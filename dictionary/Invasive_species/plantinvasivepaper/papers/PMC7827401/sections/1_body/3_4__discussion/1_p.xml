<p>In this study, we compared wood-decay patterns by two species of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> using transcriptomic and proteomic data on autoclaved spruce roots. Spruce roots were primarily colonized by fungal hyphae, which had a higher number of differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant proteins than did the rhizomorphs of both species. This suggests that although rhizomorphs can efficiently forage for nutrients, individual hyphae pierce and colonize woody tissues. Of the two species, the saprotroph, 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> showed a much stronger transcription- and protein-level response to wood than did the pathogenic 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>. This pattern was evident both in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes/proteins and in gene expression dynamics (e.g., fold change) displayed by the two species. We observed a higher number of upregulated PCWDEs in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> than in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> with the latter species showing more down- than upregulation in PCWDEs. We speculate that these observations might reflect a general difference in wood-decay strategies of saprotrophic vs. pathogenic species. Because saprotrophs colonize dead wood, they likely face more intense competition with other microbes than do necrotrophic pathogens, which, after killing the host, are the very first colonizers, and thus might face less competition. This might select for more rapid colonizing and substrate-degrading wood-decay strategy in saprotrophs, which, in an assay like ours, may manifest as a stronger induction of specific CAZymes and other proteins. In comparison, pathogens, which can also feed while the host is alive, may not be under a strong pressure to express a large suite of wood-decay enzymes. Similar observations were made in a study comparing gene expression during saprotrophic and parasitic phases in 
 <italic>Heterobasidion irregulare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It should be noted that these observations might also be influenced by the substrate (though spruce is a natural substrate for both species), the individual properties of the strains, and other factors, so more evidence, and experimental testing are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Another thing to be noted is that this study was aimed at comparing the changes during wood decay in a pathogenic and saprotrophic 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> species, further time-series wood decay analysis could prove to be helpful in understanding the wood-decay dynamics in 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> in detail.
