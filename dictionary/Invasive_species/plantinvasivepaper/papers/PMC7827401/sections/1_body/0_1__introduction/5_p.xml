<p>We here employed a comparative multi -omics approach for understanding wood-decay by 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic>, a group of wood-colonizing and pathogenic fungi that, in previous comparative genomic studies, showed great potential for improving our understanding of the functional diversity of wood-decay. We allowed a pathogenic (
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>) and a saprotrophic (
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>) species to colonize Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>) roots, and performed RNA-Seq and proteomics on invasive mycelium and rhizomorphs and their non-invasive counterparts. We opted for a comparative, instead of a time-series analysis, to enable evolutionary comparisons between two species and emphasize species diversity in 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic>. We found that the saprotroph 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> showed a stronger response to wood than 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, suggesting adaptations to faster wood colonization in saprotrophs than in pathogens. The two species of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> displayed a wood-decay profile that, unlike in white-rot fungi, mostly bypasses the activation of LDE encoding genes and is characterized by the upregulation of pectinolytic, cellulolytic, iron acquisition-related and expansin genes. These expression patterns resemble soft-rot, which, however, is selective and based on the transcriptional regulation of genes, given that 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> genomes encode LDE genes. Altogether, the decay profile of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> highlights a widespread wood-decay strategy in the Agaricomycetes and contributes to unveiling the functional diversity of forest fungi.
