<p>Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots show a strong clustering of the biological replicates in both transcriptomic and proteomic data in both species. The MDS plots portray a clear separation of the invasive and non-invasive mycelium samples, whereas invasive rhizomorphs and non-invasive rhizomorphs showed higher similarity to each other (
