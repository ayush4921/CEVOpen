<p>We found a high number of galactose-binding-like domain superfamily protein (GBDPs) genes upregulated the two species, especially in invasive mycelia. This protein superfamily includes, among others, the rhamnose-binding module family CBM67. Out of 84 and 89 genes containing GBDPs in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> we found 13 and 29 upregulated in invasive vs. non-invasive mycelia, respectively. Four of these genes were also among the 20 most highly induced co-orthologous genes in invasive mycelia (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In the proteomics data, 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> had 7 GBDPs (2 CBM67s) and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> had 12 GBDPs (2 CBM67s) with increased abundance in the mycelium vs. non-invasive mycelium. A significant portion (35â€“50%) of upregulated genes were annotated as CBM67s in the CAZy database [
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CBM67 are 
 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnose binding modules, which are reported to be involved in pectin degradation [

 <xref rid="B74-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Apart from CBM67, there were a number of other pectinolytic enzymes (e.g., GH78, PL4) associated with these GBDPs, which were upregulated in the two species (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). The abundance of 
 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnose binding modules on their own, or in combination with pectinolytic enzyme encoding genes, as well as the dominance of pectinolytic PCWDEs among upregulated CAZymes could suggest a decay strategy focused on pectin removal for accessing the cellulose and hemicellulose units of the plant cell wall.
