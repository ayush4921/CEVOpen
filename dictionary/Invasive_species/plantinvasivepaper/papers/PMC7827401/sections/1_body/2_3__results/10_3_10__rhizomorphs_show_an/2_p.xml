<p>To investigate transporter expression in our wood-decay system, we classified putative transporters in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> based on conserved domains. We identified 612 and 602 transporters in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, which belonged to 100 InterPro annotations with major facilitator superfamily domain, ABC-transporter like, sugar transporters, amino acid/polyamine transporters, and P-type ATPases being most abundant. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S7</xref> lists the identified transporters and their expression and abundances in the transcriptomic and proteomic data. Transcriptomics provided dynamics for a much larger number of transporters than proteomics, possibly due to the difficulty of extracting membrane proteins for LC/MS analyses. In the RNA-Seq data, we found 45 and 84 upregulated along with 96 and 105 downregulated transporters in mycelium vs non-invasive mycelium in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The majority of transporters upregulated in the mycelium vs. non-invasive mycelium belonged to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and sugar transporter family. Considerably lower numbers of upregulated transporters were found in rhizomorphs: 2 and 20 upregulated in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively, from the same families.
