<p>In the proteomics data, we found 89 co-orthologs with increased and 45 with decreased abundance in both species (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S5</xref>), of which, the ones with the highest abundance in both species included GH31, GH3, GH88, and GH92 CAZyme families as well as aspartic peptidases, fungal lipases, and Kre9/Knh1 fungal cell wall-related proteins. Some of these proteins were only detectable in the invasive mycelium and not in non-invasive mycelia, including several CAZymes such as pectin lyases, GH28, carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), PL8, GH3, GH35, galactosidases, carboxylesterases, and several other gene families like GMC oxidoreductases, various transporters, and cytochrome P450s.
