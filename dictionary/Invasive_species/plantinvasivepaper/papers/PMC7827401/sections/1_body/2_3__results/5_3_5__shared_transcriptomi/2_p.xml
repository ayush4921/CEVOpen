<p>Among the most upregulated co-orthologs in the transcriptomic analyses, we found oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenases, proteins of the galactose-binding-like domain superfamily (including CBM67, see below), ricin-B lectins, hydrophobins, intradiol-ring cleavage dioxygenases, GMC oxidoreductases, cytochrome p450-s, as well as 10 conserved transcription factors and several unannotated genes (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). The most highly induced genes in both species were oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenases. These were reported to be responsible for the oxidation of organic substrates, mycotoxin production, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis [

 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We found 46 oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenase genes in both species, of which five and nine were upregulated in the invasive mycelium of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively (but not in invasive rhizomorphs). In proteomics, we found one and four genes in the invasive mycelium and one and two genes in the invasive rhizomorphs with increased abundance in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively. The 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase superfamily is widespread across microorganisms, fungi, plants, and mammals as well [

 <xref rid="B60-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; however, their versatile nature makes them difficult to interpret in terms of exact biological relevance in wood decay mechanisms.
