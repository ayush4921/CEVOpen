<p>A striking difference in the expression of transporters was found between rhizomorphs vs mycelium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f006">Figure 6</xref>), with 120 and 100 upregulated and much fewer downregulated transporters in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively. Compared to the total number of these transporters, the most upregulated transporters in rhizomorphs vs. mycelium were the ones possibly involved in sugar transport, such as major facilitator sugar transport-like (IPR005828), sugar/inositol transporter (IPR003663) and sugar transporters (IPR005829). Several aquaporin-like proteins that were reported to be involved in mushroom development [
 <xref rid="B93-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and ectomycorrhizal functioning [
 <xref rid="B94-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], were also upregulated in rhizomorph vs. mycelium.
