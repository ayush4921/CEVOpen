<p>To understand what comprises the observed similarity in wood decay, we focused on co-orthologous gene/protein pairs up- or downregulated in invasive mycelia of both species. We found 779 co-orthologs having similar differential expression in the invasive mycelium. Of these 372 and 407 were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively (

 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> than in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (

 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> to wood.
