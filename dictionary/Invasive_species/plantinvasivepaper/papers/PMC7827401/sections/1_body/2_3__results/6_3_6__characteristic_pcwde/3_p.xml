<p>In contrast, we detected few lignin-degrading AAs to be DEG/DAP in the two species, the majority of which were downregulated, suggesting that lignin was not appreciably attacked by 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> in our experiments. The chemical composition of spruce roots was reported to have higher lignin content (25â€“28%) followed by cellulose, hemicellulose, and extractives [
 <xref rid="B69-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], yet our study revealed a general downregulation of LDEs. Of the 39 genes that encode LDEs (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) in each of the species, we found no upregulated and about 15% downregulated LDEs in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>. In 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, we found 15% upregulated and 30% downregulated LDEs. In the 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> the proteomic data revealed somewhat more substantial lignin degradation: we found 4 (out of 11 detected) AA1_1 laccases, 3 AA2 peroxidases (out of 4), and 7 (aryl) alcohol dehydrogenases (AA3_2, of 17) increased in invasive relative to non-invasive mycelium. The modest induction and general downregulation (in the transcriptomic data) of LDE encoding genes are remarkable for white-rot fungi, especially in the light of previous studies reporting an early activation of LDEs by white-rot fungi [

 <xref rid="B70-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and the enrichment of class II peroxidases and other AAs (e.g., laccases) near the hyphal front. The lack of a lignin-modifying burst is, on the other hand, consistent with the underrepresentation of LDE related gene families in 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> compared to other white-rot Agaricales [
