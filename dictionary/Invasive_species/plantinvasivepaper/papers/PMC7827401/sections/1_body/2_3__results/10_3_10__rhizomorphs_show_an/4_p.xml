<p>We also compared the upregulated transporters in rhizomorphs vs. mycelium to fruiting body development regulated genes of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> from Sipos et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], to identify transporters that are specifically upregulated in rhizomorphs but not in fruiting bodies. We reasoned that such genes might be involved in rhizomorph-specific functions rather than shared multicellularity-related functions between rhizomorphs and fruiting bodies. We found 47 such genes (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S7</xref>), 39% of rhizomorph-upregulated transporters, including several MFS domains and sugar transporters. Collectively, our transporter data suggests rhizomorphs not being involved in active wood-decay rather they might be involved in the transfer of the decomposition intermediates between different parts of the colony.
