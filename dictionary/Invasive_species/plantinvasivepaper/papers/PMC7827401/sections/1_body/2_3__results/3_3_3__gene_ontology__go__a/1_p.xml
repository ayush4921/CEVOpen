<p>In 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, we found 25 and 11 GO terms significantly enriched among the genes upregulated in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM and R
 <italic>vs</italic>NIR, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). For 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> we found 57 and 29 terms enriched in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM and R
 <italic>vs</italic>NIR, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). In both species, genes upregulated in invasive mycelia were enriched (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fisherâ€™s exact test) for terms related to oxidation-reduction, lipid metabolism, transmembrane transport, iron ion, and heme-binding processes along with the terms "fungal type cell wall" and "structural constituent of cell wall". We find that the enrichment of iron-binding related terms was driven by the upregulation of members of the high-affinity iron permease complex (2 out of 3 genes and, 1 out of 2 genes upregulated in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively). Consistent with the lower number of DEGs in invasive vs non-invasive rhizomorphs, we observed fewer enriched GO terms (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).
