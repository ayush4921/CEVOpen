<p>We observed a number of iron acquisition genes to be upregulated in mycelia vs. non-invasive mycelia of both species. Uptake of extracellular ferrous iron (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) occurs in fungi via a two-part transporter, which consists of an iron permease (Ftr1/FtrA) and an associated multicopper oxidase (Fet3) [

 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> there were 3 Ftr1/Fip1/EfeU iron permease encoding genes (IPR004923) of which two were upregulated in the mycelium. Of these three iron permeases, two were accompanied by a multicopper oxidase gene (one had an upstream and the other had a downstream MCO to the Ftr1/FtrA iron permease respectively). In 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, there were two iron permease encoding genes, of which one was upregulated in mycelium vs non-invasive mycelium. The genes downstream to these two iron permeases were multicopper oxidases, and both were upregulated in mycelium vs. non-invasive mycelium. Neither iron permeases nor the Fet3-multicopper oxidases were differentially expressed in rhizomorphs vs non-invasive rhizomorphs. In proteomics, we found 1 Ftr1/FtrA iron permease gene with increased abundance in mycelia of both 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. There was one downstream multicopper oxidase gene with increased abundance in the mycelium only of 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> and not in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>. The iron permease system along with iron reductases and MCOs is specifically seen upregulated in brown-rot wood decay [
