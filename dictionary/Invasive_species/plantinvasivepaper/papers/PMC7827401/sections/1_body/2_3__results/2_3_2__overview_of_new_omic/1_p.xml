<p>We analyzed four tissue types from both species in three biological replicates using transcriptomics and proteomics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The mycelium and rhizomorphs collected from colonized roots are hereafter referred to as invasive mycelium (M) and invasive rhizomorphs (R), while those grown in the absence of roots are referred to as non-invasive mycelium (NIM) and non-invasive rhizomorphs (NIR), respectively. This yielded 12 samples for both 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (with an additional sample type in the latter, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). We prepared ribosomal RNA-depleted libraries and sequenced them to a depth of 46.7â€“93.4 million paired-end reads on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. On average, 69% and 38% of the reads mapped to the transcripts in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Regarding the low mapping percentages in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> we find that they were either caused by genomic DNA contamination or a poor annotation of the reference species (~50% of unmapped reads mapped to intergenic regions, and not transcripts). Although such factors can dampen the signal of differential expression, we find that in our case this did not compromise our analysis of differential gene expression (see the clear separation of samples in the MDS, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,E).
