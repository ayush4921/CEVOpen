<p>Within species, we observed limited differences among transcriptomes, with the highest global transcriptome similarity values observed between invasive tissue types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). For example, in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, the two most similar sample types were invasive mycelium and invasive rhizomorphs (mean Pearson: 0.92), slightly higher than other combinations of samples (0.83â€“0.88). A similar, but a stronger pattern is observable in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). This pattern suggests that contact with wood elicits similar expression changes irrespective of the tissue type. In support of this, we could identify 4 and 127 genes upregulated in the invasive mycelium and invasive rhizomorphs of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, respectively. Many of these genes were annotated as hydrophobins, cytochrome P450s, galactose-binding domain-like proteins, and a number of CAZymes (
