  <title>Evaluation of the diagnosis system using as template DNA obtained from a plant tissue artificially infected tissue with 
   <italic>F</italic>. 
   <italic>kuroshium</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>This test included the FuSp02 genus-specific marker and FuKu01 and FuKu02 species-specific markers. Lanes 1, 2 and 3 which showed a total absence of any amplicons correspond to negative controls, that is, DNA used as template was isolated from non-infected plant tissue. For the rest of the lines, DNA used as template comes from plant tissue artificially infected tissue with 
   <italic>F</italic>. 
   <italic>kuroshium</italic>. Lane 4 represents FuSp02, while lanes 5 and 6 show the expected products for markers FuKu01 and FuKu02. As additional controls, markers designed for 
   <italic>F</italic>. 
   <italic>graminearum</italic> were also tested. Two of them designed in the present study (FuGr01 and FuGr02; lanes 7 and 8), and the other one (PC02; lane 9), previously reported [
   <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In the same way, the FuOx01 and FuOx02 markers designed on this study for 
   <italic>F</italic>. 
   <italic>oxysporum</italic>, were also tested (lanes 10 and 11). Additional results regarding markers designed on this study to 
   <italic>F</italic>. 
   <italic>graminearum</italic> and 
   <italic>F</italic>. 
   <italic>oxysporum</italic> are shown in sections downstream described.
