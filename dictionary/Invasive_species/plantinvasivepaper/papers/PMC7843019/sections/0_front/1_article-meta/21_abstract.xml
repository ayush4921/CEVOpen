 <p>A key factor to take actions against phytosanitary problems is the accurate and rapid detection of the causal agent. Here, we develop a molecular diagnostics system based on comparative genomics to easily identify fusariosis and specific pathogenic species as the 
  <italic>Fusarium kuroshium</italic>, the symbiont of the ambrosia beetle 
  <italic>Euwallaceae kuroshio</italic> Gomez and Hulcr which is responsible for 
  <italic>Fusarium</italic> dieback disease in San Diego CA, USA. We performed a pan-genome analysis using sixty-three ascomycetes fungi species including phytopathogens and fungi associated with the ambrosia beetles. Pan-genome analysis revealed that 2,631 orthologue genes are only shared by 
  <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., and on average 3,941 (SD Â± 1,418.6) are species-specific genes. These genes were used for PCR primer design and tested on DNA isolated from 
  <italic>i)</italic> different strains of ascomycete species, 
  <italic>ii)</italic> artificially infected avocado stems and 
  <italic>iii)</italic> plant tissue of field-collected samples presumably infected. Our results let us propose a useful set of primers to either identify any species from 
  <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus or, in a specific manner, species such as 
  <italic>F</italic>. 
  <italic>kuroshium</italic>, 
  <italic>F</italic>. 
  <italic>oxysporum</italic>, and 
  <italic>F</italic>. 
  <italic>graminearum</italic>. The results suggest that the molecular strategy employed in this study can be expanded to design primers against different types of pathogens responsible for provoking critical plant diseases.
