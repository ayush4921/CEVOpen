<p>Distinct strategies based on comparative genomics are used to identify and design specific targets. Comparative genomics studies revealed a wide diversity of genetic content throughout different biological groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This diversity includes genes shared by all the members of a specific biological group (i.e., species, genus, family), frequently called ‘core’, as well as, genes that are not shared by all the members of the group, which are named ‘accessories’, and are unique genes, present in specific lineages or clades [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These concepts have been applied to find taxa-specific targets in order to develop tools for the control of the pathogens as the vaccines [

Despite comparative genomics identifies specific targets, these markers can amplify genome non-coding areas that accumulate variation because they are subjected to less selective pressure. Therefore, this is a potential problem regarding marker specificity.
