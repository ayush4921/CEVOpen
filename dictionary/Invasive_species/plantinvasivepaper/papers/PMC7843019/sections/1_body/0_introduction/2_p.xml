<p>The ambrosia beetles establish mutualistic relationships with various species of fungi mainly for nutritional purposes. To maintain these symbioses, beetles dig galleries and tunnels into the vascular system (especially the xylem) of host plants, where they farm the fungi to guarantee an available food source throughout their life cycle [

 <italic>euwallaceae</italic> and
