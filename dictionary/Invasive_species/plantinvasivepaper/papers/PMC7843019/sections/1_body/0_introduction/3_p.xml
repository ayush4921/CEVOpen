<p>Currently, micro- and macro-conidia features, the presence or absence of chlamydospores, colony appearance, and growth rates in different culture media are used to identify 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In consequence, the diagnosis is time-consuming and requires experts in the field. On the other hand, molecular diagnosis is a rapid, sensitive, specific and efficient alternative [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing techniques. In both cases, a small quantity of DNA is required during the assay. There are several PCR based methods to identify 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], including methods based on real-time PCR (qPCR) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] moreover there are some recent approaches based on this technique for the detection of ambrosia fungi species. For example, Carrillo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] developed a multiplex qPCR assay using hydrolysis probes for the detection of the b-tubulin gene.
