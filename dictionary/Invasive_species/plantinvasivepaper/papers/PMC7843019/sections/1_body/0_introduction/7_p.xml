<p>In this study, we performed a pan-genome analysis of ascomycetes associated with ambrosia beetles and other phytopathogens to find gene markers in order to design primers for the accurate diagnosis of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. by PCR. Unlike previous research, we focus on the use of coding regions. We probed the specificity of the primers using three different DNA sources, 
 <italic>i)</italic> a pure culture of different phytopathogenic ascomycetes, 
 <italic>ii)</italic> stems of 
 <italic>Persea americana</italic> cv. Hass artificially infected by 
 <italic>Fusarium kuroshium</italic> and iii) field samples from KSHB infested trees. We demonstrate the specificity of the markers, and therefore, our results bring to light the possibility of using this analysis method to develop an accurate diagnostic system for other types of plant pathogens.
