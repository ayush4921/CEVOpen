<p>A critical step of PCR based methods is the selection of a target gene and the development of specific primers and probes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Most of the targets used for plant pathogenic fungi identification derive from housekeeping genes; which do not reflect sufficient sequence variation for the discrimination between species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], or derive from genes related to the pathogenesis of the fungi; in that case the specificity of these types of markers depends on the evolutionary history of the gene, which could be common to other pathogens, either by horizontal gene transfer [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], common ancestry, or convergent evolution [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and therefore non-specific.
