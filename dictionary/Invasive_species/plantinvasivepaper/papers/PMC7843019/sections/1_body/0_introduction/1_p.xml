<p>Phytosanitary problems are considered a primary cause behind economic crop losses around the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, accurate identification of the causal agent is a critical factor for implementing actions against a specific disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The introduction of new species or the eradication of native species within an ecosystem contributes also to phytosanitary problems [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One clear example is the accidental introduction to the United States of two species of ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) native to Asia: the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB) and the Kuroshio shot hole borer (KSHB) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Both plagues have negatively impacted avocado (
 <italic>Persea americana</italic> Mill) production [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and many other arboreal plant species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Specifically, the KSHB complex has devastated large areas of riparian forest in the valley of Tijuana [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and currently, in this country is considered a quarantine pest.
