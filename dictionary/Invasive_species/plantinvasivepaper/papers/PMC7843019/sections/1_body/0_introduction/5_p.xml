<p>Also, techniques based on genotyping have also been employed (i.e., restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)). These techniques differentiate strains, races, or varieties within a given species, and have been used to generate markers that allow, for example, the identification of groups within the species
