<p>In this study, we identify highly divergent coding regions, and we prove that they can be used to design specific primers that allow the identification of genus- or specie- in specific manner (in this study we mainly focused our searches on species from 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus). Based on presented results we propose that this method could be employed to design primers or probes for other pathogenic species or strains. We confirmed by validating species-specific and genera specific genes of at least three different species of the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., that the proposed method is capable to identify reliable marker. We also prove the technique is stable enough to prevent erroneous diagnoses even when dealing with closely related species (e.g., 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>solani</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic>).
