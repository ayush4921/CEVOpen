<p>A really low percent of the designed primers under proposed methodology can generate inconsistent results, we consider that this problem can be associated with automatic gene prediction algorithms often make errors and can jeopardize subsequent analyses. This issue obviously could be more frequent in low quality draft genomes with complex gene structures and assembled with low coverages. These low-quality genomes could be no included, however, it should be considered that increasing the number of genomes in pangenome analysis, it undoubtedly increases the reliability with which specific genus or species markers are identified. Based on the above, we suggest that gene model prediction processes need to be accompanied by the implementation of some dedicated computational methods to correct mistakes from the predictions and accompanied by some manual curation.</p>
