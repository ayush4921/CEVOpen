 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus comprises a wide range of phytopathogen species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]; and, in this study, our main goal was to design specific primers that can be used to identify the 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic> specie and to generate an efficient diagnosis system for 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> dieback disease. We obtained three sets of primers that we named as FuKu01, FuKu02, and FuKu03, and which can generate 600, 599, and 466 bp amplicons, respectively. These primers were tested using genomic DNA of six different 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species (including the species of interest, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic>) and other three species of phytopathogenic ascomycete, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>alternata</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>cinerea</italic>, and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>parvum</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, we obtained amplicons of the expected sizes only when 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic> genomic DNA was used as a template (lanes 1, 2, and 3). Markers FuKu01 and FuKu02 generate amplicons of the expected size and are species-specific. In the case of FuKu01, this genetic marker generated a noticeably lower amount of product with respect to FuKu02. As expected, these two markers fail to generate any product when using genomic DNA from other 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species even when they are closely related to the species of interest. For example, 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. associated with 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>morigerus</italic> (lanes 16â€“18), a strain which on this study was also isolated from an ambrosia beetle species. Regarding FuKu03, this genetic marker also amplified only in the case of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic> besides the species of interest (
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic>). We consider that even when the amplicon obtained for 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic> is slightly longest with respect to the amplicon obtained for 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kusoshium</italic>, this marker (FuKu03) is not useful for the diagnosis because this difference could be related either to presence/absence of one or several introns, or maybe related to differences in the size of some of them. In principle, we do not attribute this difference to the obtaining of a non-specific product. It is important to emphasize the total absence of these three amplicons (gene markers) when template DNA belongs from other phytopathogenic ascomycetes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).
