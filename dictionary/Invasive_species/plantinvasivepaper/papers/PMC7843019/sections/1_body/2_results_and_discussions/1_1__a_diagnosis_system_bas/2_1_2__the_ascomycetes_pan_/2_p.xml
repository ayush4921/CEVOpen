<p>Moreover, we identified a total of 65 proteins (or genes) belonging to ascomycetes core genome (considering all species used in this study). Core genes fulfill two essential conditions; all the species share them, and they are single-copy ortholog genes. We observe that the topology of the resolved phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g003">Fig 3</xref>) resembles in some clades (but not all of them) to the clustering based on the gene content of the orthogroups inferred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We explain this discrepancy by the differences in the analysis; on the one hand, the phylogeny of core genes shows the evolutionary relationships of species, while clustering analysis of pan-genome genes shows the similarities regarding the presence and absence of shared ortholog genes, which are inferred based on specific parameters.
