<p>We also test the effectiveness of the primers designed for fusariosis diagnostic on field samples. In our search of symptomatic trees, only three trees of the 
 <italic>Erythrina corallodendron</italic> species were identified in a unique and small location (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246079.s002">S2 Fig</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246079.s005">S3 Table</xref>, see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> for more details). First, to confirm the presence of genetic material from fungi on the DNA isolated from infected plant tissue, we amplify the ITS region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g007">Fig 7</xref>, lanes 1–3). Then, using a genus-specific marker (FuSp02) we confirm that this fungus (or fungi) belongs to the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g007">Fig 7</xref>, lanes 4–6). Finally, FuKu01 and FuKu02 successfully identified the pathogen 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g007">Fig 7</xref>, lanes 7–12). Equal that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, primers designed to amplify specifically other species belonging to 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus (
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearun</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic>), were also used as negative controls and as expected, with none of them we obtained PCR products (data not shown).
