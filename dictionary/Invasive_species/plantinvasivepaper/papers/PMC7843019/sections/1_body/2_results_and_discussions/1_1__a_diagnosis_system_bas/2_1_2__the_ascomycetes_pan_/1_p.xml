<p>For the sixty-three proteomes analyzed (
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we obtained a total of 685,096 proteins classified into 382,502 orthogroups or OrthoMCL-defined protein families. Clustering analysis of pan-genome showed that under the set parameters (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> section for more information), 2,631 orthogroups, contain unique proteins only from species of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Regarding species-specific proteins, on average 3,941 orthogroups resulted like specific for each of the species included within the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g002">Fig 2</xref>). As expected, the number of orthogroups with shared proteins between some of the compared species is smaller, to the extent that the number of species included in the analysis is increased.
