<p>In order to provide additional evidence of the suitability of the application of pan-genome analysis for select markers and design primers to be used in a PCR-based diagnosis system, we evaluate the primers designed for the detection of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic>. The primers designed for these species showed specificity, because only amplified DNA of the species for which they were designed. As a result of our analyses, we proposed two markers as diagnostic tools for 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic> (FuGr01 and FuGr02, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); these allowed for the generation of 549 and 509 bp amplicons, respectively. We used as a positive control the primers previously reported to detect the presence of strains of the 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic> species ([
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], see 
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, PC02). After the analysis of band patterns obtained by electrophoresis, it was evident that primers designed on this study as well as positive control were specific for 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic>; these primers produced no unspecific products, neither with other species of the genera or with other ascomycetes (
