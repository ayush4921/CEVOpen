<p>We performed primers design for both, specific species, and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus. In the case of the species-specific dataset, we identified on average 136 (SD Â± 108) target genes per species for which we performed the design of the primers. However, for each species on average, only 120 pairs of primers met the set criteria, i.e., lacked mismatches and the amplification temperatures required by both forward and reverse primers were in the same or equivalent range. Subsequently, based on a manual evaluation considering the alignment temperatures, percentages of guanine and cytosine, and a total lack of secondary structures formation such as hairpins, dimers, cross dimers or palindromes, we selected the primer sets for the experimental tests presented in
