<p>Next, using DNA isolated from 
 <italic>Persea americana</italic> cv. Hass stalks artificially infected with 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246079.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> for more details), we tested the reliability of the primers designed to diagnose both, fusariosis (genus-specific primers) and the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> dieback disease (primers designed specifically for 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic>). Consistent with the results presented above, FuSp02 genetic marker was successfully used to amplify the expected fragment, confirming the presence of genetic material in the DNA sample which belongs to one (or several) 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species. To define the species, FuKu01 and Fuku02 genetic markers were successfully used (
