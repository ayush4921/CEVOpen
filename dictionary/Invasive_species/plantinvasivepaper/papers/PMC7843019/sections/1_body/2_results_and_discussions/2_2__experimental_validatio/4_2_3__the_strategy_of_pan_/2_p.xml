<p>For the diagnosis of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic> we identified two possible markers candidates, FuOx01 and FuOx02. Primers designed to amplify these markers produced amplicons with 554 and 556 bp sizes, respectively. The experimental validation using genomic DNA from the strain reveals high specificity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g009">Fig 9</xref>). We use a previously reported set of primers as a positive control ([
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], 
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, PC03); however, in contrast with the high degree of specificity of the markers proposed in this study, the positive control of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic> (PC03) amplified PCR products of 280 pb when DNA used as template was isolated from 
 <italic>Fusarium kuroshium</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>solani</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>verticillioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>parvum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g010">Fig 10</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9, respectively). Which indicates that the primers previously reported are not useful to identify a species-specific marker that can be used to diagnose fusariosis caused by strains of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic> species.
