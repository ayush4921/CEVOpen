<p>Based on the criteria described before (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> for details) and after their 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> validation, we selected three primer pairs as the main candidates to identify species of the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus. These markers were tagged as FuSp01, FuSp02, and FuSp03 (
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We tested the specificity of those primers with DNA obtained from strains of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>verticillioides</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>tricinctum</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Neofusicoccum parvum</italic>. Prior to validating the use of the primers designed for the fusariosis diagnostic, we amplified the ITS region with universal primers in order to guarantee the quality of the DNA samples used as a template (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). As expected, the primers designed for the marker FuSp02, amplified a single band of around 590 bp on all tested 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species but not so in the other ascomycete fungi species included in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As a positive control, we included a previously reported marker that successfully identifies 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, labelled in the present study as PC01 (from Positive Control 01, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Based on the obtained results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g004">Fig 4</xref>), we conclude that FuSp02 marker shows a high level of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> specificity comparable to PC01. With only one exception (the 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic> species), the primers designed for FuSp01 marker shown only the unique expected product for the species of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus which were tested. Meanwhile, the results obtained with FuSp03 marker were inconsistent, obtaining the desired product in only few cases. We concluded that FuSp02 seems to be a suitable marker for diagnosis of fusariosis because amplified efficiently using DNA from only 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species but not from DNA of other ascomycete fungi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246079.g004">Fig 4</xref>).
