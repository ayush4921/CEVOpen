<p>Finally, we performed an 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> experiment to test specificity. Briefly, the designed primers were tested using ThermonucleotideBLAST [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which performs a DNA fragment search in a database; however, as opposed to the BLAST [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] algorithm, ThermonucleotideBLAST uses additional alignment parameters based on biochemical variables present in PCR reactions, especially free energy and alignment temperature. A database containing all ascomycete genomes available in GenBank was used as a source of target sequences to perform 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> amplification. We selected primers lacking mismatches regarding the species or genera we were expecting for as well as those whose estimated alignment temperatures were similar for both forward and reverse primers.
