<p>Likewise, to validate the marker’s design, PCR reactions were performed with 10x-Mg PCR buffer, 10 μM of each designed primer per marker, 50 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM of deoxyribonucleotide mix (Sigma), 100 ng of DNA, 2 U of Platinum
 <sup>™</sup> Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and sterile deionized water for a final total volume of 50 μl. A thermal cycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler Nexus gradient) was used to carry out PCR reactions using the following thermal profile: an initial denaturation of 94°C for 2 min., followed by 35 cycles of continual changes beginning with a denaturation step of 35 seconds at 94°C followed by an alignment step of 35 seconds at 55°C, and an extension step of 1 minute at 72°C and an additional extension step of 5 min at 72°C after the 35 cycles. Finally, the amplicon was analyzed in agarose gel of 1.5% and it was visualized in a Gel Doc
 <sup>™</sup> EZ imaging tool (BIO-RAD) and images were processed using Image Lab
 <sup>™</sup> (BIO-RAD).
