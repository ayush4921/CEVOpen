<p>To obtain DNA from infected avocado stalks, the biological material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and then pulverized using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 10 mg of pulverized tissue was employed for DNA extraction using a Plant/Fungi DNA Isolation Kit (Norgene Biotek Corporation) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Obtained DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of deionized sterile water, and its quality was quantified and evaluated using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) spectrometer. Finally, DNA was stored at -20°C.</p>
