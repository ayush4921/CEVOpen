<p>DNA quality was confirmed amplifying the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, using the primers ITS1 (
 <monospace>5’-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3’</monospace>) and ITS4 (
 <monospace>5’-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’</monospace>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The amplification was performed with 10x-Mg PCR buffer, 10 μM of each primer, 50 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM of deoxyribonucleotides mix (Sigma), 50 ng of DNA, 2 U of Platinum
 <sup>™</sup> Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and sterile deionized water for a final total volume of 25 μl. PCR reactions were carried out in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 9700) as follows: an initial denaturing step of 95°C for 3 min., followed by 35 cycles of continual changes beginning with denaturing for 35 seconds at 94°C followed by an alignment step of 45 seconds at 58°C and finally, elongated for 1 minute at 72°C, and an additional elongation step of 5 min. at 72°C after the 35 cycles. The amplicon was analyzed in an agarose gel at 1.5% and the PCR product was sequenced at the CNRF Molecular Biology laboratory.
