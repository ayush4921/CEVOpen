<p>In the case of field samples, tree branch segments were cut and lengthwise scraped to extract the inner part of the galleries drilled by the beetles and colonized by the fungi. DNA extraction was performed following a standard protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, 200 mg of plant material was mixed with 1 mL of lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 100 mM pH 8.0, 3 M NaCl, 3% CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), 20 mM EDTA and 50–80 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)). Following, a total of 500 μL of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added and mixed by inversion followed by centrifuging 10 min at 3,500 rpm. The supernatant was mixed with one volume of isopropanol, incubated for 10 min at -20°C. Subsequently, the isolated genetic material was visualized in a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight estimation was carried out using a 1 kb molecular weight marker (Thermo Scientific).
