<p>In addition, tissue from some branches collected from visibly symptomatic trees in the field was used. In Mexico and USA, the highest incidence of affected trees by KSHB corresponds to species such as coral trees and dwarf coral trees (
 <italic>Erythrina corallodendron</italic> and 
 <italic>Erythrina humeana</italic>), California sycamore (
 <italic>Platanus racemosa</italic>), coast live oak tree (
 <italic>Quercus agrifolia</italic>), and some different species of willow trees (
 <italic>Salix</italic> spp.). All these species are recognized as suitable reproductive host trees of KSHB and susceptible to 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> dieback (

Therefore, with the help of Mexican phytosanitary authorities, was performed a visual examination in urban landscapes and natural, agricultural, and riparian areas in order to identify some trees of the species mentioned above with symptoms of the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> dieback disease and/or visible damage caused by KSBH complex. Interestingly, after our search, only symptomatic/damaged trees from 
 <italic>Erythrina corallodendron</italic> were found in one of the evaluated areas (
