<p>With the purpose of validating the primers designed as a diagnostic tool of Fusarium Diseases (FD), first, the primers were probed using DNA isolated from artificially infected avocado stalks (
 <italic>Persea americana</italic> cv Hass) with 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic> HFEW-16-IV-019 strain. Briefly, stalks of approximately 30–40 cm length and 1 cm diameter were collected from one-year-old healthy avocado trees which were grown in pots and then acclimated for 4 to 6 months in a greenhouse. In order to mimic the ambrosia beetle, the stalks were cut into fragments of 3.5–4 cm length and were drilled into the center with a 1/16” Dremel
 <sup>®</sup>. Then, the stalk-segments were placed into humid chambers and were inoculated into the drilled injury with 40 μL of conidial suspension (1x10
 <sup>8</sup> conidia/mL). After 14 days (at 27°C and 16 h light/8 h dark), DNA isolation was carried out.
