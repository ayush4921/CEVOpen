<p>Fungal spores were preserved at -80°C in 10% glycerol. These were inoculated in PDA medium (potato, dextrose, agar) to promote germination and mycelial growth. After 15 days, a 0.7 cm
 <sup>2</sup> plug from the outer zone of the colony was punched with a sterile well cutter and transferred to new PDA culture plates and incubated for one week in total darkness at 28°C using a CB 210 CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator (BINDER
 <sup>™</sup>). Mycelium was peeled off from the agar surface with a scalpel and DNA was extracted using a previously reported method [
