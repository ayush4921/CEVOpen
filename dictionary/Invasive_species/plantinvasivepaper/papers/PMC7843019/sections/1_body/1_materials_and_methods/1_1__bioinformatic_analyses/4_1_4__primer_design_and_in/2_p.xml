<p>For the design of the genera-specific primers, the strategy consisted of analyzing the orthologous groups including only proteins of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species. First, the candidate proteins were compared against the ascomycete fungi protein database available on GeneBank and homologs identified as hypothetical or predicted proteins were discarded from further analyses. After this, using Kalign [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], we aligned the proteins contained into the remaining orthogroups and only in those cases that contained proteins, represented the proteins from all available species of the genus of interest. The protein sequences were translated into nucleotide sequences using the backtranseq application included in the EMBOSS [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] software package, to finally be realigned using ClustalW [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] based on specific codon usage. Gblocks [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] was utilized to extract highly conserved regions based on this alignment, and a consensus sequence was generated using the em_cons application included in EMBOSS [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Genera-specific primers were designed in these consensus regions using Primer3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; optimal primer length was 20 nucleotides, and the expected product-length range was set between 200 and 1,000 nucleotides.
