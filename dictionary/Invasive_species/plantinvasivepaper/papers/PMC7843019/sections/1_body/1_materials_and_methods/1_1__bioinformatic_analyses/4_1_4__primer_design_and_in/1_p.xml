<p>We designed primers for diagnosis based on both, species and genera-specific genes. Regarding the primer design for species-specific genes, the proteins tagged as an orphan after the identification of orthologous groups were compared against a database including a total of 1,953,116 ascomycete fungi proteins available from GeneBank using the BLASTp algorithm. All proteins which showed homology with proteins of unknown function (hypothetical or predicted) were discarded from further analyses to avoid bias/errors associated with the computational tools used. Proteins showing an identity equal to or greater than 75% with proteins of other species were also discarded basically because we consider that homologs sequences with an identity greater than this defined threshold, could present regions (motifs) that at nucleotide level have high similarity and as consequence, with a greater probability of not being truly specie-specifics. The remaining proteins were considered as a list of possible targets for primer design. For that purpose, the nucleotide sequences corresponding to predicted gene models were extracted from the genome [complete gene structure, including both coding regions (exons) and non-coding regions (introns)]. Primers were designed using Primer3 software [

Optimal size required for primer design was 20 nucleotides (at an alignment temperature close to 60Â°C); the expected range of the amplicon or expected product was set between 400 and 600 nucleotides. The complete structure of putative target genes was used considering that diagnosis employs mainly DNA as template and an estimate of the PCR amplicon length is required.
