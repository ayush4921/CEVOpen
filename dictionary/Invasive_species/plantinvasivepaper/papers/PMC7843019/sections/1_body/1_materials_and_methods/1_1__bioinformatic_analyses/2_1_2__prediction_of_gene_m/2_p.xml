<p>The SRA (Sequence Read Archive) database of the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) was consulted, and transcriptomic data available for 12 of the 15 species of interest were downloaded (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246079.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Prior to the assembly, the available transcriptomic sequences of the species of interest were processed by a Python script (

For the study purposes, we use the parameters -q 30 (the minimum quality value allowed from in Phred format), -p 90 (minimum percentage of bases in the sequence of -q quality), and -a 30 (Phred format estimated average quality limit throughout the sequence). When overlapping regions were detected (at least 25 overlapped bases in initial-terminal portions of paired-end reads), we used SeqPrep software (

We eliminate orphan reads (those in which one of the paired sequences failed to meet the established parameters), in order to only keep paired sequences. Finally, the sequences were assembled with Trinity software [
