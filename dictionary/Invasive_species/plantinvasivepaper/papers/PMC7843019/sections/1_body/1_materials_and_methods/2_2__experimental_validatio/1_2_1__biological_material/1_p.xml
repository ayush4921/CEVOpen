<p>Different phytopathogenic 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> strains were used for the experimental validation of the designed primers. The 
 <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> (MY3) strain was provided by Dr Javier Plasencia, School of Chemistry, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (CB-36) strain was provided by Dr Gloria Carrión, Biocontrol Laboratory, Institute of Ecology A.C. (INECOL). 
 <italic>Fusarium kuroshium</italic> (strain HFEW-16IV-019) was provided by the Mycology Department of the National Reference Center (CNRF). The 
 <italic>Fusarium sp</italic>. associated with 
 <italic>Xylosandrus morigerus</italic> INECOL-BM-04 strain and other phytopathogenic fungi such as 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Neofusicoccum parvum</italic> (isolated from 
 <italic>Liquidambar styraciflua</italic>), 
 <italic>Fusarium tricinctum</italic> and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (isolated from 
 <italic>Persea schiedeana</italic> and 
 <italic>Nectandra salicifolia</italic>, respectively) were provide by Dr. Diana Sánchez-Rangel, Phytopathology Laboratory of the Molecular Studies Network (REMAv) at INECOL. All designed primers were tested using DNA isolated from the different fungal species mentioned above as a template; these fungi were grown under controlled conditions, using papa dextrose agar (PDA) medium.
