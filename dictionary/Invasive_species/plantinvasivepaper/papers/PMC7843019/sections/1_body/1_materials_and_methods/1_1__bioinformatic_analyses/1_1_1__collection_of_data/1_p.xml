<p>Sixty-three proteomes of phytopathogenic and non-pathogenic ascomycete fungi from public databases were used including the species of interest (
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic>). Some of them also associated with ambrosia beetles (
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Forty-eight proteomes from the JGI database (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246079.s003">S1 Table</xref>) [

 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; contained gene models without isoforms. For the rest of the species, including the recently reported genome of 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>kuroshium</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0246079.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we carried out gene models prediction. Additional information related to strain name isolation environment and their host was also included in
