<p>The concomitance of biotic and abiotic stress factors causes the species–which is widely recommended for difficult urban conditions, especially in places along streets–to lose its resistance. This is partly caused by climate changes, which affect the expansiveness of pathogens and pests, extend the period of plant colonization by pests and increase their numbers of generations. These adverse effects may exert even greater influence on new trees planted in cities and on species that are considered more sensitive than putatively resistant black locust.</p>
