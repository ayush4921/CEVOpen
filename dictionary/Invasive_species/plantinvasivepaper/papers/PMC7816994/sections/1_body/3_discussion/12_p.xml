<p>The leaves of the trees growing along the streets had increased content of calcium. This effect may be caused by–as often documented in literature–higher concentrations of Ca in the street soil samples than in the park soil samples [

 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In Poland fly ash, which is formed when coal is burnt in furnaces, is one of the causes of the high content of calcium in urban soils. It flies in the air in the form of alkaline particulate matter. This problem is intensified in the winter during the heating season. Depending on the quality of coal, fresh ashes contain 2.95–33.25% of CaO [
