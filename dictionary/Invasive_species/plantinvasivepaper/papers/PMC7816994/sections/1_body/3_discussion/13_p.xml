<p>In all three cities the content of Na in the leaves of the black locust trees growing along the streets was only slightly higher (20–30 mg·kg
 <sup>-1</sup>) than in the leaves of the park trees. The amounts of sodium measured in the dry matter of plants were divergent and ranged from 30 [

 <sup>-1</sup> d.w. [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In this context, the Na content in the leaves analysed in our study was very low. Because sodium chloride is used in winter, the higher content of Na in the leaves of trees growing along streets was often documented in scientific publications [

 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. However, recently NaCl has been used very sparingly due to snowless winters for many years and improved ecological standards of road maintenance implemented by municipal governments. As a result, the sodium content in plants is constantly decreasing.
