 <italic>polygoni</italic> fungus, which causes powdery mildew, was usually dominant at all the research sites. Powdery mildew is initially manifested by small, white patches on leaves. Later fungal colonies expand and cover the leaf surface. Because there were two rather dry growing seasons during the research, the dominance of

 <italic>polygoni</italic> seems understandable. Most species of fungi thrive better at higher humidity because their spores need drop of water to germinate. However, the fungi causing powdery mildew on various plant species are an exception, as they develop very expansively when the growth of other fungi is inhibited by the shortage of water [

 <italic>polygoni</italic> fungus, apart from their own symptoms, they may also be a source of inoculum, which can infect other species of plants in the urban environment. There have been few scientific reports on the health of black locust trees because this species is considered invasive and undesirable in many habitats [
