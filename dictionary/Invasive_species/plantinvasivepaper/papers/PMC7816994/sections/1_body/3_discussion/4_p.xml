<p>The results of our research show that neither salinity nor higher concentration of metals (Fe, Mn, Cu and Pb) were correlated with development of aphids. There were similar findings of studies on the occurrence of aphids in many other urban environments [

 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. These results do not correspond to the findings of research on

 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Those authors investigated the effect of salt stress on lime aphids and observed larger numbers of these insects on trees growing in parks. This suggests that lime aphids preferred the leaves of plants with low content of Cl and Na, but with higher concentration of N.
