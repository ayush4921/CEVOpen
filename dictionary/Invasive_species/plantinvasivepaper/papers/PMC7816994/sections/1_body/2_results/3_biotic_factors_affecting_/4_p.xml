<p>There were symptoms of fungal diseases observed on 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudoacaccia</italic> leaves in all of the sites. They significantly reduced the decorative value of the trees and deteriorated their health (

 <xref rid="pone.0245398.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The leaves of the trees growing both in the parks and along the streets were infected by pathogenic fungi of the following species: 
 <italic>Pleospora robiniae</italic> Lib., 
 <italic>Phyllosticta robiniae</italic> Sacc. and 
 <italic>Erysiphe polygoni</italic> D.C. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245398.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The 
 <italic>Pl</italic>. 
 <italic>robiniae</italic> fungus caused the necrosis and deformation of black locust leaves from early spring onward. The trees infected by 
 <italic>Ph</italic>. 
 <italic>robiniae</italic> had black spots on their leaves. However, this pathogen had weaker correlation with the Q parameter than 
 <italic>Pl</italic>. 
 <italic>robiniae</italic>. 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>polygoni</italic> was the dominant pathogenic fungus in all locations (
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). It caused powdery mildew, which was manifested by the occurrence of white mycelium on the surface of leaf blades. The pathogen limited access to light and thus, it negatively affected the dynamics of photosynthesis and the condition of the trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245398.g001">Fig 1</xref>). 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>polygoni</italic> infections were more commonly found on the leaves of the trees growing at the park sites. Only in Pozna≈Ñ the fungus was more frequent at the street site.
