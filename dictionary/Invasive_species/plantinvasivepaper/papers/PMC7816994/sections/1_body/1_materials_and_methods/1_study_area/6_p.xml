<p>The research was conducted on 10 specimens of black locust (
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L.) in each site (60 specimens in total). The age of the trees was estimated at 70â€“130 years, by assessing the diameter of the trunk [

The median of their circumferences was 206.6 cm. The trees selected for the study were several decades old so that the assessment of their health would not be impeded by the problems of young trees adapting to a new site and so as to focus the analysis on the most valuable specimens in the urban environment.
