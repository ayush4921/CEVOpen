<p>The CVA resulted in 3 canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245398.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Stepwise regression analysis was used to find which variables had the greatest influence on the health of the trees at the research sites. All variables were assessed. The ones that contributed most to the discrimination of the groups based on the p and F values for the variable under analysis were included in the model. The process was repeated until the p value fell below 0.05 for the variable under analysis.
