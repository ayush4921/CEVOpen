<p>Today, comparative identification strategies based on gene sequencing can be considered the new gold standard for the identification of fungal species. Gene sequencing is characterized by PCR amplification of the ITS region, and sequencing of the resulting amplicon (s). The ITS region can be amplified reliably for most fungi [

 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp, and can be performed on different types of materials, including paraffin blocks, which is why it is considered an emerging and promising methodology to be used in the routine identification of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. In our case, no other fungal species were identified in the studied specimen or in any other specimen from the patient. The 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> complex includes 13 species; biogeographic data suggest that the majority of the species within the complex have evolutionary origins in the Southern hemisphere and Asia. According to the surveys to date, 
 <italic>F. austroamericanum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. meridionale</italic>, 
 <italic>F. cortaderiae</italic>, and 
 <italic>F. brasilicum</italic> appear to be endemic to South America; 
 <italic>F. acaciae-mearnsii</italic> to Australia or less likely Africa; 
 <italic>F. asiaticum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. vorosii</italic> and 
 <italic>F. ussurianum</italic> to Asia; 
 <italic>F. aethiopicum</italic> to Africa; 
 <italic>F. boothii</italic> and 
 <italic>F. mesoamericanum</italic> to Central America; 
 <italic>F. gerlachii</italic> to the US and 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> sensu stricto (F. graminearum s.s.) it is the most cosmopolitan species and has been found in Asia, Africa, America, Europe, and Oceania [
