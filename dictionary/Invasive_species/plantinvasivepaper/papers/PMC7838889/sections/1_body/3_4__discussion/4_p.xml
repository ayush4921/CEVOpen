<p>In our patient, the diagnosis of hyalohyphomycosis was first made by pathologic specimen. The biopsy revealed the presence of septate hyaline hyphae 3–6 μm diameter, indistinguishable from other hyalohyphomycosis such as 
 <italic>Aspergillus, Acremonium</italic> [
 <italic>Cephalosporium</italic>]

 <xref rid="B18-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], foodborne IFI are infections acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated with the fungi causing the infection. Reports describe molds and yeasts as etiologic agents. 
 <italic>Rhizopus</italic> sp is the most frequently described mold, but one case of IFI due to 
 <italic>Fusarium moniliforme</italic> is reported in a man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who ingested cereals. The diagnosis of foodborne IFI is difficult, clinical presentation is usually atypical, and mainly gastrointestinal. Fungi can spoil food that is ingested, and it is suggested that this category of fungal infections could be related to food insecurity. The source of the fungi should be identified to be able to classify the IFI as foodborne, which is often difficult to the ubiquitous nature of these fungi. As previously mentioned, although we suspect that our patient acquired the infection orally and this could correspond to foodborne IFI, we cannot corroborate the above because we could not have samples of the food that the patient ingested prior to his hospitalization and we did not perform stool cultures.
