<p>Finally, the treatment in localized disease can benefit from surgical debridement especially in disseminated disease together with the use of systemic antifungals. 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species are relatively resistant in vitro to most antifungal agents, showing different susceptibility patterns between species. In general, most 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> isolates have lower inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Amphotericin B higher than 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species. 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> and 
 <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> are usually resistant to azoles and they have higher MIC for azoles than other 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species. In contrast, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. moniliforme</italic> may be susceptible to voriconazole and posaconazole [
 <xref rid="B9-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Echinocandins show the highest MIC values [
 <xref rid="B21-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As far as we know there are no previous reports in the medical literature of identification of 
 <italic>F.graminearum</italic> as a pathogen in humans; therefore antifungal therapy was initiated based on is the antifungals reported in the literature for the Fusarium species and on the clinical response.
