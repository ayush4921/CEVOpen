 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> plays a major role as the etiological agent of one important disease of small grain cereals and corn. First identified in 1884 in England, it is considered a major threat to wheat and barley [
 <xref rid="B12-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The fungi, transmitted by seed, can survive up to 10 years as spores or resting structures in and on the seed. In Mexico, 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> has been found in Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico, Michoacán and Tlaxcala [

 <xref rid="B16-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This fungus can produce several mycotoxins, which have shown abortive estrogenic, gastric (nausea and vomiting) and neurotoxic toxicity in swine, cattle, dogs, cats, and ducks [

 <xref rid="B17-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Grain that has been infected with the fungus can be incorporated into basic diets and could be a source of infection in humans. So far, no infections due to 
 <italic>F. graminareum</italic> have been reported. Considering the patient’s occupation (kitchen helper) and the high corn content in the Mexican diet, we supposed that the patient was colonized with 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> through the daily ingestion and handling of corn. He possibly got the mould through oral ingestion, and symptoms were gastrointestinal due to portal dissemination, which explains why we did not document any fungemia or cutaneous infection, despite an invasive disease. Usually, in disseminated fusariosis, blood cultures are positive in more than 75% of cases [
