<p>Hialohifomycetes are opportunistic filamentous fungi that usually cause infection after environmental exposure [
 <xref rid="B6-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infection occurs through inhalation or skin breakdown (wounds, burns) [
 <xref rid="B8-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. is the second cause of infections by filamentous fungi after 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. More than 50 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species have been identified, but only about 12 are associated with infection in humans. 
 <italic>F. incarnatum, F. moniliforme, F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> usually cause allergic reactions and superficial infections such as keratitis and onychomycosis in immunocompetent hosts. In immunocompromised patients, it can cause from locally invasive diseases such as sinusitis and pneumonia, to fungemia and disseminated disease [
 <xref rid="B9-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In neutropenic patients, it usually manifests as fever not responding to empirical antibiotics. Profound and prolonged neutropenia is the most important risk factor for dissemination and death due to fusariosis [
 <xref rid="B8-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The most frequently isolated species in this setting are 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> (50%) and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (20%) [
