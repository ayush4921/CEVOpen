<p>In the last decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI), related to new immunosuppressive treatments and improved diagnosis with new molecular techniques and higher diagnostic yields [
 <xref rid="B1-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-idr-13-00002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We present the case of a male patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and prolonged profound neutropenia, who developed an invasive infection by 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, acquired via non-cutaneous entry, presenting an atypical clinical course, gastrointestinal symptoms, sigmoid perforation and liver abscesses due to portal dissemination. The etiologic agent was identified using the 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S rRNA sequence gene from a liver biopsy. This is the first reported case of portal dissemination by 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus and the first report of 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> infection in humans.
