<p>A paraffin block of the first liver biopsy was requested, and DNA extraction was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue sample using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Ventura, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before preliminary removal of paraffin by extraction with xylene protocol. The molecular identification was performed by 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-25S rRNA gene amplification using a set of primers previously reported to identify fungi species (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′). A PCR product of 500 bp was amplified, purified and sequenced in both directions; nucleotide sequence was determined with Taq FS Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Fluorescence-Based Sequencing and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA sequencing system (Foster City, CA, USA). The sequence was edited with Vector NTI program and homology search was performed in the GenBank database (nucleotide blast), finding a 100% identity with
