<p>Prolonged profound neutropenia and alteration of the intestinal flora, secondary to myelotoxic chemotherapies and environmental exposure in patients with hematological neoplasms, are important risk factors for the development of invasive infections by filamentous fungi. This is the first reported case of invasive fungal infection by 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and the first case of portal dissemination of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. The anamnesis and exposure to environmental factors are important during clinical evaluation. 
 <italic>F.graminearum</italic> was not identifiable by traditional methods such as culture and pathology. Access to molecular biology is extremely valuable to increase the performance of diagnostic tests in the identification of new species such as the 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> reported in our paper.
