<p>A type II functional response, demonstrated through logistic regression results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s005">S1 Table</xref>), was observed in every combination of copepod species and temperature (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s008">S4 Table</xref>). Within each temperature setting, there was no significant difference in either type of parameter estimate due to copepod species (

 <italic>albidus</italic> at 25°C was extremely wide, representing high uncertainty (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This imprecise estimate was likely due to the highly significant effect of mortality rate (p-value = 0.0040) on the change in prey density over time (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s006">S2 Table</xref>). In addition, the mortality rate’s standard error was higher for 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>albidus</italic> at 25°C than it was for any other data subset that included background larval mortality (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s006">S2 Table</xref>), and the model deviance (-2 log L = 111.25) was higher than that of any other model used to generate parameter estimates (
