<p>A linear model testing copepod body mass and temperature category as predictors of predation efficiency explained 14.0% of the variance in predation efficiency (
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For each 0.1 mg increase in copepod body mass, the predation efficiency increased by approximately 3.4 percentage points (p-value = 0.0042), when controlling for differences in temperature (
