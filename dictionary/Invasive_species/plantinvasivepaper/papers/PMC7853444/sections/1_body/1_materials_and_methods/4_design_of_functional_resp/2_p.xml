 <italic>albopictus</italic> larvae (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s012">S2 File</xref>) were each pipetted into a small plastic tub containing 150 mL of spring water to strongly dilute any residual food from the hatching media. Each tub of 87 larvae was then split into seven Petri dishes each containing 20 mL of spring water and the following larval densities: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32. All larvae were counted into dishes at room temperature and then divided into the three different controlled environments, allowing a 12 h temperature acclimation period before predator introduction (

 <italic>albopictus</italic> larvae, with a total of 2,610 larvae used across all predator treatments and controls (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This sample size allowed for four replicates of each larval density and one predator-absent control at each density, for each combination of copepod species and temperature (
