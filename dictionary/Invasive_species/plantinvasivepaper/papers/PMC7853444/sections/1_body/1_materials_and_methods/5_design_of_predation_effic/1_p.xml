<p>In addition to functional response, predation efficiency has previously been measured to assess copepod predators of mosquito larvae [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We measured predation efficiency using a constant density of 24 larvae in 20 mL of spring water. This density was chosen from the higher end of the range of densities used in the functional response experiments, where the curves generally start to plateau (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The density where the functional response curves start to plateau represents the density at which the predators are satiated; increases in prey density after this point would not result in a higher number of prey killed by the predator [
