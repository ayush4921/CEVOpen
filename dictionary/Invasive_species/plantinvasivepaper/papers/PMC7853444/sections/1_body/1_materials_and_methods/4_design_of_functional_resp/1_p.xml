<p>Adult non-gravid female copepods, identified by larger relative size, were removed from their culture and each was placed in a Petri dish (diameter: 50 mm, height: 20.3 mm) holding 20 mL of spring water. The copepods were placed in three different controlled environments set to 15 ± 1, 20 ± 1, and 25 ± 1°C, all at a 12:12 light/dark cycle, to begin a 24 h starvation and temperature-acclimation period for the predators (
