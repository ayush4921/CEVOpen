<p>Within each experimental design (functional response and predation efficiency), the distribution of body masses was assessed for each copepod species using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Based on these results, either a Wilcoxon rank sum test or a Welch two sample t-test was used to determine if the body masses differed due to copepod species.</p>
