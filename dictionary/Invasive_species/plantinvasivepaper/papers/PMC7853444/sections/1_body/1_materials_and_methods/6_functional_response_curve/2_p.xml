 <italic>albidus</italic>, across all control larvae (n = 87) at 15°C, three deaths were observed (3% mortality); four deaths were observed at 20°C (5% mortality); and eleven deaths were observed at 25°C (13% mortality). For 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic>, two deaths were observed among control larvae at 15°C (2% mortality), and three deaths were observed at 20°C (3% mortality). Mortality rates of aedine larvae in predator-absent controls have previously been observed to be as high as 20% [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To account for both background mortality and prey depletion caused by predation, the functional response parameters (attack coefficient and handling time) were estimated by fitting the following differential equation:
