<p>The next day, the copepod predators held at three different temperatures were introduced to larval Petri dishes of matching controlled temperatures (

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Each copepod was preserved in 80% ethanol so that its body size could later be measured and matched to the larval count data. Immediately following the removal of the copepods, the number of surviving larvae in each Petri dish was counted and recorded. In addition, the body lengths of the 10 gravid females selected from each species of copepod, as well as the body lengths of all copepods included as predators in the functional response experiments, were measured from the front of the cephalosome to the end of the last urosomite [
