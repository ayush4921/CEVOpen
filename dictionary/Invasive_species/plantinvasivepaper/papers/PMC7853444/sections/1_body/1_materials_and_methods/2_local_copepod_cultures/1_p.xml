<p>Adult gravid female copepods were collected in August of 2018 from the edge of Longside Lake in Egham, Surrey, UK (N 51° 24.298’, W 0° 32.599’) using a 53 μm sieve (Reefphyto Ltd, UK). Neither the collection of UK aquatic invertebrates, nor the use of these organisms in laboratory experiments, currently requires permission from an ethics committee; and access to Longside Lake was not restricted at the time of sampling. Separate cultures were started from each gravid female. The copepods were kept in 3 L containers of spring water (Highland Spring, UK) at a 12:12 light/dark cycle, and 20 ± 1°C, a temperature previously found to increase the portion of their life cycle spent in the reproductive phase [

 <italic>Chilomonas paramecium</italic> and 
 <italic>Paramecium caudatum</italic> (Sciento, UK) were provided 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> as food for the copepods [

 <italic>Macrocyclops albidus</italic> (Jurine, 1820) and 
 <italic>Megacyclops viridis</italic> (Jurine, 1820) by Dr. Maria Hołyńska from the Museum and Institute of Zoology in Warsaw, Poland. The copepod cultures were maintained continuously for approximately three months before the start of the experiments.
