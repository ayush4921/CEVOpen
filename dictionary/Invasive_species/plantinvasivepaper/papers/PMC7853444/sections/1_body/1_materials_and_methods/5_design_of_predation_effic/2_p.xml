 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s012">S2 File</xref>) and any residual food was diluted in spring water following the same procedure used for the functional response experiments. Adult non-gravid female copepods were each placed in a Petri dish for a 24 h period of starvation and acclimation to three different temperature settings: 15 ± 1, 20 ± 1, and 25 ± 1°C, all at a 12:12 light/dark cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The largest non-gravid copepods of each species were selected to minimize the risk of selecting males or immature stages. The Petri dishes containing larvae were split into the three different temperature settings 12 h prior to the introduction of copepod predators, and there was a 6 h period of predation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g001">Fig 1</xref>). At the end of the 6 h period, the copepods were removed, and each was stored individually in 80% ethanol so that predator body lengths could later be measured. The number of surviving larvae in each Petri dish was recorded immediately after removing the copepods.
