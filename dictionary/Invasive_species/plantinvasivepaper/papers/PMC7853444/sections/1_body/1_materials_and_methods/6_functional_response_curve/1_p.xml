<p>The general shapes of the functional response curves were determined for each combination of copepod species and temperature using predator-present data. When polynomial logistic functions are fitted to describe the relationship between the proportion of larvae killed and the initial larval density, a negative first-order term indicates a type II response, and a positive first-order term indicates a type III response [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The “frair_test” function (“frair” package, R version 3.4.2) was used to determine the shapes of the functional response curves according to the sign and significance of first-order and second-order terms in logistic regressions [

 <italic>viridis</italic> exclusions were due to insufficient body length of the copepod indicating that these predators could have been either males or immatures, rather than adult non-gravid females.
