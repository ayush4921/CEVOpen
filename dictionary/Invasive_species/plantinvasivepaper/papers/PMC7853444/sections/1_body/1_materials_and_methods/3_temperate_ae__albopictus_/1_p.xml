<p>A colony of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes (original collection Montpellier, France 2016 obtained through Infravec2) was maintained at 27 ± 1°C, 70% relative humidity, and a 12:12 light/dark cycle. The colony maintenance temperature of 27°C was chosen because it falls at the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval that was fitted around mean daily Montpellier temperatures from 1996–2005 in the summer months, and these temperatures are expected to increase in the coming decades [
