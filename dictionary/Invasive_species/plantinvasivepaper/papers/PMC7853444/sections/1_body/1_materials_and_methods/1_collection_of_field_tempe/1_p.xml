 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s011">S1 File</xref>). These temperature data provided rough guidelines for our choice of the three temperatures to be tested in our functional response and predation efficiency experiments. The minimum water temperature was 9°C, the 25
 <sup>th</sup> percentile was 16.1°C, the median was 18.1°C, the 75
 <sup>th</sup> percentile was 20°C, and the maximum was 25°C (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, our choice of 15, 20, and 25°C as the three main temperatures of interest is representative of more than 75% of the tire water temperatures recorded in the field from May through September of 2018.
