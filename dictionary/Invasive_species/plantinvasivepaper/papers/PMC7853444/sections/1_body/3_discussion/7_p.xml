<p>Although we did not detect any difference in functional response parameter estimates or predation efficiency due to temperature, the temperature at which copepods are cultured impacts their size [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and our results show that copepod size is a determinant of their predation efficiency. A previous study, in which UK 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>albidus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> were cultured at six different temperatures between 5 and 20Â°C, showed a consistent negative relationship between adult body mass of both species and culturing temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Evidence of this relationship between size and rearing temperature had already been recorded for freshwater copepods collected in Paris [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we recommend that the importance of individual body mass be taken into consideration when determining the optimal temperature for mass copepod culturing.
