<p>Fecundity data from older studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] have recently been incorporated into metrics used to compare the efficacy of different copepod species as biocontrol agents [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Caution is recommended when interpreting these metrics if the fecundity variable is either based on an inadequate number of observations or derived from multiple populations of copepods. For example, a previous calculation used to determine the “reproductive effort” of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> incorporated a clutch weight value based on the dimensions of a single egg sac from a female collected at an unrecorded temperature in South Germany, female body weight data from a population in South Germany, and embryonic development time data from English Lake District copepods held at 20°C [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This reproductive effort value was then applied to calculate a metric for 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> from Northern Ireland that were cultured at 25°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While it is time-consuming to collect robust and relevant fecundity data experimentally, biocontrol metrics can only be meaningful if they are based on appropriate original data.
