<p>As the invasion of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> into the UK progresses, it may become more relevant to conduct predation experiments on mosquito larvae that are hatched from colonies acclimated to lower temperatures. In our experiments, the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larvae were from a colony that was reared under conditions experienced on warm summer days in Montpellier, France. This approach is currently valid because 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> has not yet established in the UK and eggs that could be introduced via used tire shipments would be na√Øve to UK weather conditions. However, in future decades, it may be more appropriate to use 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larvae from a colony reared under conditions reflective of the diurnal temperature range experienced in the southern UK.
