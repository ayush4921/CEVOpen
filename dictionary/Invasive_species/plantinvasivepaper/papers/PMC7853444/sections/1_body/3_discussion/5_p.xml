<p>The larger size of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Our analysis shows that copepod body mass was a better predictor of predation efficiency than species identity (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The linear regression model with the highest adjusted R-squared value, 16%, was the model with copepod body mass as the sole predictor of predation efficiency (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s010">S6 Table</xref>). The positive relationship we observed between copepod body mass and predation efficiency (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s010">S6 Table</xref>) is consistent with the findings of a previous meta-analysis on crustacean predation of immature fish, which showed that the predation rate was negatively related to the prey/predator size ratio [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, a study specific to mosquito prey found that consumption rate increased with predator body mass when comparing three different predators of mosquitoes: copepods, dragonfly naiads, and mosquitofish [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Our data are also in agreement with the positive linear relationship between body mass and ingestion rate that has been demonstrated in other taxa, including herbivorous and carnivorous endotherms, as well as carnivorous poikilothermic tetrapods [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although a recent study using 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>japonicus</italic> larvae as prey found that 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> predation rates began to decrease when predators exceeded 1.8 mm in length [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], our data represent copepods of up to 2.5 mm in length, and there is no evidence of lower predation efficiency among the largest predators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246178.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). According to the theory that, at equilibrium, “the rate of food intake is equal to the rate at which food is leaving the gut” [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], our results suggest that 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> may have a higher gut clearance rate than 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>albidus</italic>, possibly due to its larger size.
