 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0246178.s008">S4 Table</xref>); this was perhaps because the predation efficiency experiment had a larger sample size of observations for each combination of predictors, and therefore more power to detect differences. In addition, while the size difference between

 <italic>albidus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> was significant in both experimental designs, there was a greater difference in size due to species among the copepods used in the predation efficiency experiment than among the copepods used in the functional response experiment (
