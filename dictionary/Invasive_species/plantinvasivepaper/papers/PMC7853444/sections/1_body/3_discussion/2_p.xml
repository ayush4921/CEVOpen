<p>Our functional response analyses did not detect any differences in response type, attack coefficient, or handling time due to copepod species or temperature, tested at 15, 20, and 25°C (

In addition, a previous study of predator-prey interactions involving sit-and-wait copepod predators found no significant difference in the attack parameter of the functional response across three different temperatures: 18, 22, and 26°C [
