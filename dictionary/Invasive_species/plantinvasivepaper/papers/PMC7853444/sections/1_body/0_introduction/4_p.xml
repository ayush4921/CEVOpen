<p>Functional response curves were originally developed to relate the number of prey attacked by an invertebrate predator to the prey density [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Previous work has suggested that the best predators to use in an “inundative release” biocontrol program are those that have type II functional responses to prey density, so that the predators’ attack rates are high even at low prey densities [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Predators that display a type III functional response against an invasive prey species—such as signal crayfish (

 <italic>Potamopyrgus antipodarum</italic>)—may be able to limit the spread of the invader, but cannot prevent it from establishing [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, recent literature shows that the temperature dependence of attack rate is unimodal, or “hump-shaped,” especially when the temperature range exceeds thermal optima, and suggests that the impact of climate change on predation will depend on the thermal optima of consumers [
