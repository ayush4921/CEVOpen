<p>In this study, we determined the type of functional response of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>albidus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>viridis</italic> copepods from Surrey, UK against 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larvae from Montpellier, France at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25Â°C) likely to be experienced by container-dwelling mosquito larvae in London and South East England. We also calculated predation efficiency, the percentage of larvae consumed, of both copepod species at a constant mosquito prey density under the same three temperatures.
