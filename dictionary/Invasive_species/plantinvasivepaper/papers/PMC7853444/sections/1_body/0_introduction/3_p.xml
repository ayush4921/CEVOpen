 <italic>viridis</italic> are 1.3–2.5 mm [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], respectively. These are small enough to enable the distribution of copepod cultures to mosquito larval habitats using “a simple backpack sprayer with a 5 mm hole in the nozzle,” as has been previously recommended [

 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although adults have been observed consuming immatures of the nauplius stage, these instances of cannibalism are not common when other prey options are available [
 <xref rid="pone.0246178.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Cyclopoid copepods are considered sit-and-wait ambush predators because of their attack behaviors, which have been described in six steps: encounter, aiming, stalking, attack, capture, and ingestion [
