<p>An invasion of the Asian tiger mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, into the UK is a major public health concern. This species is not only an aggressive nuisance biter, but also a known vector of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes to lay desiccation-resistant eggs has enabled their introduction into cities across the globe, often via used tire shipments [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations have already established throughout the vast majority of Italy and southern France [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> establishment; projections of climate and human population conditions into future decades suggest that if introduced, the vector species could establish throughout most of England and southern Wales during the 2060s [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> presence by either 2050 or 2080, depending on the patterns of future greenhouse gas emissions [
