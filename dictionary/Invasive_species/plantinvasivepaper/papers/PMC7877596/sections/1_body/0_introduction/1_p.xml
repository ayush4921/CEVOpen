<p>The introduction of alien species represents one of the major threats to biodiversity at a global level [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Exotic species can transform a habitat, affecting biodiversity on different spatial scales, contributing to species extinction [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and creating severe challenges in terms of their management and control [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Their effect on biodiversity, health and the economy is so great that the control and management of invasive species has become the principal objective of numerous restoration studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Once successfully introduced outside their natural range, potentially invasive exotic plant species can propagate in the new environment if their ecological needs are met, establishing self-sustaining populations [
