<p>Assessing the functional composition of communities enables us to compare assembly processes between studies in different regions and on different scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In general, the species that colonize roadsides are short-lived, monocarpic annual or perennial species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In northwest Patagonia, the response of different functional groups to disturbances such as fire, volcanic eruption, and drought have been much studied [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; however, in this region no research has been carried out on colonization of the roadside habitat by the different functional groups. Analyzing functional groups enables to draw more general conclusions on assembly process compared to species-specific analysis.
