<p>In December of 2016 (spring), at each sampling point 15 quadrats of 1m
 <sup>2</sup> were placed at random in each plot (roadside and reference area) to determine species composition, cover, and richness (3 sampling points x 2 plots x 15 quadrats) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246657.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Species cover was estimated in each quadrat using the Braun-Blanquet scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, all species present within a distance of 1 m from each side of the quadrat were recorded.
