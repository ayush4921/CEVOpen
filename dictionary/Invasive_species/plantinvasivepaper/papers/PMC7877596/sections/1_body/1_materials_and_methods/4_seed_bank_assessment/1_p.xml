<p>The seed bank was assessed at both plots in April 2017 (in autumn, after seed dispersal but before germination). At each sampling point, 10 soil samples were taken at random per plot (roadside and reference area), giving a total of 60 soil samples. Each sample measured 8.5 cm in diameter and 3 cm in depth. The samples were stratified in a refrigerator (at 5°C) for 3 months. After this time, they were sieved to eliminate stones and plants remaining before being placed in containers on a substrate of sterile sand (for 2 days at 100°C) to promote water drainage [
