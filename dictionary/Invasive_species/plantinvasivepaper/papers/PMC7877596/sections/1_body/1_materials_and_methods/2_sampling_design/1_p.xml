<p>Three sampling points were selected along the highway, separated from one another by about 2 km. At each point we selected two different plots 5 m wide and 50 m long parallel to the road. The first one (Roadside plot) was adjacent to the road and had similar environmental conditions (north orientation, slope less than 45Â°), and the second one (Reference area plot) was located 20 m from the road within the grassland (
