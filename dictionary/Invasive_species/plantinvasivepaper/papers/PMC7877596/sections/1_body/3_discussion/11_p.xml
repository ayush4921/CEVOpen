<p>In general, dispersal studies have reported that anemochorous species are common at roadsides [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, in this study the exotic and native species at the roadsides presented similar percentages of anemochorous and non-anemochorous (autochorous and zoochorous) species. This may be because various species that present autochorous dispersal (e.g., 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>acetosella</italic>, 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>thapsus</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>paronychioides</italic>) have small, light seeds that can also be wind dispersed and contribute mostly to the seed bank. Many exotic roadside species with long-distance dispersion mechanisms are annual herbs and grasses [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Finally, highways may constitute corridors that channel air currents, favoring the distribution of anemochorous species along their length [
