<p>The high cover of exotic species in the reference areas was due to the marked dominance of the perennial herb 
 <italic>Rumex acetosella</italic>, which was responsible for the high cover of the exotic perennial herbs and grasses functional group in the roadsides and reference areas. 
 <italic>Rumex acetosella</italic> first came into northern Patagonia with domestic cattle over 100 years ago, and its dominance and permanence could be due to its double strategy of bud and seed bank regeneration and its high competitivity [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This ruderal species dominates the steppe gaps, occupying safe microsites for the regeneration of many species, including the dominant matrix and competes for the resources, having a negative effect on the growth of other species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is likely that the dominance of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>acetosella</italic> in the gaps may limits the colonization and establishment of other exotic species, producing invasional interference [
