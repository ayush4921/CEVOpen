<p>Despite the dominance of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>acetosella</italic> at the roadsides, the annual grass 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> and annual herb 
 <italic>Epilobium brachycarpum</italic>, both exotic, contributed greatly to the vegetation cover of the roadsides, perhaps due to the greater availability of space because of the low plant cover. Both annual herb and grass appear to depend on intense disturbance (i.e., removal of soil, fire, grazing) to spread into less degraded sites. It is documented that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>tectorum</italic> spread from the roadsides to the interior of the natural ecosystem [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>brachycarpum</italic> is frequently found in degraded environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], while in little-disturbed natural habitats it presents low cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The high germination potential, abundant seed production and high dispersal capacity by wind or animals of both species could favor their establishment in disturbed zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Both species have been registered as invasive in other regions of the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], having an important impact on native communities. For example, 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>tectorum</italic> alters the nutrient cycle, water availability and fire frequency, and may exclude native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, their population dynamics and effects on native ecosystems need to be monitored and studied for the planning of appropriate management.
