<p>In conclusion, this work has demonstrated that the roadsides of the northwest Patagonian steppe constitute a reservoir of exotic species. Since the spread of exotic species is a major problem throughout the world, the importance of studying roadside vegetation and seed banks must be highlighted, in order to carry out the early identification and control of alien species, and generate ecosystem management programs.</p>
