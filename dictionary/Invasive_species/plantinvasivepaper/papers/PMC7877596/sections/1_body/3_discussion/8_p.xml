<p>In the roadside seed bank, a higher density of seeds of exotic annual/biannual herbs and grasses was found than in the reference area. This functional group was dominated by 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic>. The high seed density of annual herbs may be related to species traits such as fast reproduction and high production levels of long-lived, small seeds with dormancy, which tend to become buried in the soil and form persistent banks [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> is categorized as invasive in other parts of the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It was present in the vegetation and the seed bank of the roadsides, however in the reference areas its seeds were abundant only in the seed bank being absent in the vegetation, as this species depends on intense disturbance to spread into less degraded sites. 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> is an opportunist species that does not compete well within the natural ecosystem [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]; nevertheless, this species presents high production of small seeds that form a persistent, long-lasting bank [
