<p>In this work it was found that the total vegetation cover was lower at the roadsides than in the reference areas, in agreement with another study in the Patagonian region [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Low cover at roadsides is frequently seen, due to the elimination of surface soil layers and the reduction in organic material brought about by road construction [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The new substrates at the roadsides are susceptible to erosion, with changes in water availability that hamper colonization [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. As expected, in this study the vegetation cover of exotic species was higher than native species at the roadsides. This may be a result of the environmental conditions at the roadsides (e.g., greater availability of light, bare soil, soil texture) [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], which generate habitats suitable for the establishment, growth and reproduction of exotic plants to the detriment of native species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Other studies reported that the disturbance of the roadside and the movement of vehicles favor the entry of propagules of exotic species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These factors may also affect species richness, since that roadside vegetation presented lower native species richness than the reference area, coinciding with other studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
