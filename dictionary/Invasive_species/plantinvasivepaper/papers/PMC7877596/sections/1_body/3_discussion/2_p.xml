<p>In this study, the majority of exotic species at the roadsides belonged to the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Poaceae</italic> families, results that coincide with other studies carried out on the roadsides in southern Chile [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and in the center of Argentina [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These families contribute a large number of exotic invasive species to the worldâ€™s flora [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Many of these invader species have spreading strategies related to efficient long-distance wind or animals dispersal [
