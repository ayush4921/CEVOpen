<p>According to our results, most of the geographical and environmental factors do not influence the appearance of common milkweed independently, but in relation to one another (

 <xref rid="plants-08-00593-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>). Changes in soil properties and land cover are also connected with each other, leading to an explosive increase in the amount of areas infected by common milkweed since the 1990s (
