<p>We split the data into a training set and a test set, where the training set was used to explore and model the relationship between the dummy variable and the environmental covariates, whereas the test set was used to validate the resulting model. The data partition was carried out randomly, with the addition that it had to take into consideration the unbalanced nature of the dataâ€”i.e., both the training and test sets had to honor the initial proportion of the absence and presence of common milkweed. From there, 75% of the data (i.e., 730 observations) went to the training set, while the remaining 25% (i.e., 243 observations) went to the test set, which was independent of the whole modeling process.</p>
