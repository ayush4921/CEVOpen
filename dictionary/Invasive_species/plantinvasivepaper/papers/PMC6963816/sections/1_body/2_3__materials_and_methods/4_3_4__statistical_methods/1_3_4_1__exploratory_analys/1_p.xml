<p>The classified database containing 973 LUCAS survey points on common milkweed was converted into a dummy variable. The created dummy variable makes it possible to explore the potential geographical driving forces and factors of common milkweed spreading. After binary coding, we observed that the dummy variable had unbalanced data, i.e., the dummy value 0 (no milkweed) was overrepresented at the expense of the dummy value 1 (milkweed present). The proportions were 88% and 12% for the dummy values 0 and 1, respectively (
