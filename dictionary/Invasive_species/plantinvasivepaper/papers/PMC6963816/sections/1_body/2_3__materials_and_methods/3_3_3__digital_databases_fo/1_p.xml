<p>We used various environmental covariates for identifying the geographical driving forces that may determine the occurrence of common milkweed (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00593-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). They were classified into five classes, depending on their roles in landscape ecology. The first class was soil, which quantifies the productivity of a habitat. The second class was topography, in which covariates were selected that provided information on the vertical and horizontal distance to the channel network. These were derived from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 100-meter-resolution digital elevation model [

The third one was land cover, which was represented by the CORINE Land Cover survey products from 2012 and by the land cover change between 1990–2000, 2000–2006, and 2006–2012. The fourth class was climate, which was characterized by the most common climatic parameters. The last was geology, where the parent material was considered as a potential environmental covariate.
