 <italic>Bactrocera zonata</italic> is native to South and South-East Asia but it has invaded and become established in a number of countries in the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and some of the Indian Ocean Islands (i.e. Mauritius and Réunion) [

 <italic>zonata</italic> is better adapted to tropical and subtropical regions, it is also established in Northern Egypt where temperatures reach freezing point during winter, demonstrating its ability to survive under the Mediterranean climatic conditions [

 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> development is 25°C-30°C whilst egg, larval and pupal survival is highest at 25°C. The upper temperature limit recorded is close to 35°C and none of its stage survives at 12.6°C or less [
