<p>Given that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> continues to invade new areas, there is a need for improved forecasting of potential areas for its invasion and establishment as a mitigating measure. There is a huge deficit in information regarding mapping the potential ecological niche of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> under current and future climatic conditions accounting for host availability and its likely dispersal patterns. Dispersal is an important factor in insect invasions and plays an important role in determining the potential distribution of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To our knowledge, two models of potential geographical distribution of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> using the CLIMEX model have been published in literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although they provide important insights into the potential invasive range of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>, they do not report the impact of host availability and how the fruit fly will potentially disperse in space over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These past attempts to estimating the potential geographical distribution of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> also did not take into consideration the current invasive location of the pest in Sudan.
