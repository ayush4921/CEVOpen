 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tephritid fruit flies of the genus

The mated female fruit flies lay eggs in ripening fruit, followed by larvae and other opportunist secondary microorganisms feeding on the fruit pulp leading to decomposition. The destruction caused by larvae range from unattractive appearance due to egg laying punctures resulting in reduced marketability and fruit drops leading to diminished yields [
