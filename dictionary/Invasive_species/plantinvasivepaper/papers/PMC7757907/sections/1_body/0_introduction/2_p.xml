<p>Among the 
 <italic>Bactrocera</italic> species that are currently of high interest is the invasive peach fruit fly 
 <italic>Bactrocera zonata</italic> (Saunders) (Diptera: Tephritidae). 
 <italic>Bactrocera zonata</italic>â€™s invasive nature is linked to it being a strong flier capable of dispersing 25 miles or greater in search of hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], short generation time, high polyphagy, and ability to adapt to different habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>Bactrocera zonata</italic> feeds on more than 50 commercial and wild host plants; including peach, guava, mango, apricot, citrus, prickly pear and fig [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Its host range recently expanded to include some commercially important crops such as eggplant, tomato, apple, loquat, and potato [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives, the availability of its host plants throughout the year favours its proliferation leading to high economic losses in most horticultural regions. The annual financial losses associated with the fruit fly are estimated at USD 200 million in Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], EUR 320 million in the Near East and EUR 190 million in Egypt [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The amount of fruit damage in Pakistan as a result of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> infestation is reported to range from 5 to 100% [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, it is listed as A1 quarantine pest in the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) countries, affecting availability of lucrative export markets.
