<p>The Centre For Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI) Invasive Species Compendium datasheet number 17694 [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was used to extract information on the names of crops considered as important host plants for 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>. These host crop names were used in the subsequent analysis to obtain the spatial extent of the important host plants for 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>, from the Spatial Production Allocation Model (MapSPAM 2005 v3.2) database. MapSPAM 2005 datasets are global gridded maps of crop distribution estimations at 10km x 10km spatial resolution. The maps were calculated according to four variables: actual area where crops are being grown (physical area), harvested area, production and yield for 42 different crops under both rainfed and irrigated production systems. In this study, important host plants for 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> were categorized under four broad classes: tropical fruits, temperate fruits, vegetables, and banana based on the MapSPAM model (
