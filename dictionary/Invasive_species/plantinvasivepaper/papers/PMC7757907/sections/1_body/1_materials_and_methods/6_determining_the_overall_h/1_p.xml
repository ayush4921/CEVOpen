<p>In order to map areas that are potentially more vulnerable to 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> invasion, climatic suitability derived from the MaxEnt models was merged with host availability extracted from the MapSPAM database using 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0243047.e001">Eq 1</xref>. This complemented the results of MaxEnt to get potential climatically suitable areas where 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> could potentially thrive due to hosts being available. The necessity to define areas of potential establishment of invasive species defined by favourable climate and host availability before applying spread models was emphasized before [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The datasets were normalized to a common scale of 0 to 1 for easy comparison.
