 <italic>Bactrocera zonata</italic> has the capability of dispersing locally reaching distances of up to 25 miles (40.2 km) [

 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our model uses the known occurrence records of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> as basis to develop several Gaussian functions centred on each location. Each Gaussian function has a height of 1, a mean of 0 and value (density of fruit fly) decreasing with distance in relation to the width or standard deviation.
