<p>We developed a simple model to hypothetically model the short distance dispersal of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> by natural means using the Gaussian probability density function to estimate infestation probability. The following assumptions were considered in building the model: (1) that the host plants of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> were available throughout the year; (2) the current occurrence records of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> were the potential source of infestations to its surrounding areas; (3) there were no major barriers limiting the spread of the pest, and that its probability of spread occurred equally in all directions from the source locations; (4) the pest spreads naturally by flying from one location to another in search of suitable host plants; and (5) the pest spreads from its source location with infestation probability decreasing as a function of distance following a normal curve. The following equation for the Gaussian probability density function (3) was used.
