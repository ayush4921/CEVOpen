 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> (n = 57) were obtained from the Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC) of Sudan within a framework of a Department for International Development (DFID) funded project. The presence of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> in Sudan was monitored during the period 14 January 2014 to 28 April 2016 using methyl eugenol-baited traps to attract and kill fruit fly species in mango, guava, banana, date palm and citrus orchards. The confirmed presences of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> occurrence with geographical coordinates collected during this period in Sudan were incorporated in the present study.
