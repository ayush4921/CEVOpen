<p>Our decision to use MapSPAM products was motivated by an earlier study to determine cropping distributions of the spotted stemborer 
 <italic>Chilo partellus</italic> (Swinhoe) popular host plants in order to assess its potential to invade the areas where they are grown [

 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> host crops are currently grown were aggregated at global level and were used as a proxy for host availability. This involved accessing the harvested area layer (in hectares) of the MapSPAM database to download maps of areas where 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> host crops are being grown. A total of four maps for the different classes of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> host crops (tropical fruits, temperate fruits, vegetables, and banana) were downloaded. A raster overlay analysis was implemented using ArcGIS version 10.3.1 to combine the maps into an aggregate map which represented areas where hosts are available. The MapSPAM datasets were resampled to 1km x 1km grid cell size using a bilinear interpolation technique in ArcGIS 10.3.1 to match the resolution of the bioclimatic variables for subsequent analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The bilinear interpolation method is highly suitable for continuous data like the MapSPAM harvested area dataset.
