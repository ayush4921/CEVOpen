 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] was used to assess the performance of the MaxEnt models. The use of AUC as a statistic to assess the discriminatory capacity of ENMs has been widely accepted [

 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. By default, MaxEnt calculates the AUC which determines how the models distinguished between presence and absence observations, but with presence only data as in our case, the AUC compared presence observation with the pseudoabsence background points. The AUC values range from 0 to 1 where values of 0.5–0.7 indicate low accuracy, values of 0.7–0.9 are usually interpreted as useful for applications and those greater than 0.9 imply high accuracy [
