<p>In preparation for the MaxEnt modeling, duplicate occurrence records were removed, and in instances where georeferenced occurrence points were not provided, but place names given we geo-coded the points based on the place names using Google Earth Pro software version 7.3.2. Although these coordinate points were not the exact locations of the

 <italic>zonataâ€™s</italic> records, they provided representative conditions of the sampling sites. The occurrence records were plotted on a map and visually inspected for obvious errors. To minimize spatial autocorrelation, the location records were spatially filtered specifying a minimum distance of 10 km. A similar method was employed in a study to determine the global potential distribution of
