<p>The Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 2-Earth System (HADGEM2-ES) models [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] for four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 were implemented to investigate the impact of climate change on the pest’s distribution in the year 2050. The bioclimatic variables for the different RCPs at a spatial resolution of 1km x 1km were downloaded from the Worldclim platform (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldclim.org</ext-link>). The list of the downloaded bioclimatic variables matched the 8 uncorrelated bioclimatic variables determined in the previous section (

 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The RCPs are labelled according to their associated radiative forcing in the year 2100 (i.e. 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 Watts per square meter (W/m2) and have carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels reaching 421, 538, 670 and 936 ppm, respectively. The projected global mean surface temperature warming for the mid-21
 <sup>st</sup> century (2046–2065) compared to the late-20
 <sup>th</sup> century (1986–2005) for RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5 are 1.0°C, 1.4°C, 1.3°C and 2.0°C respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. RCP 2.6 represents hard-line mitigation scenarios in literature that limit greenhouse gas concentrations and reduce global radiative forcing by the year 2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. On the other hand, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are intermediate emission scenarios which stabilize after 2100, by applying different strategies and technologies that minimize greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Finally, RCP8.5 is considered a high emission scenario with increasing greenhouse gas emissions overtime and the associated increases in global temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. To review a wide range of possibilities of predicted changes in the potential climatic suitability of the fruit fly we used all four RCPs.
