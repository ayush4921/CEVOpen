<p>For consistency, we used the same modeling approach for both current and future climatic scenarios. The outputs of MaxEnt modeling were imported in a geographical information system (GIS) for further analysis. We reclassified our probability of occurrence maps of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> into 4 classes based on a suggestion by Abdelaal et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The classes were: (i) not suitable (≤ 0.15), (ii) low suitability (0.16–0.30), (iii) medium suitability (0.31–0.60) and (iv) high suitability (≥ 0.61).
