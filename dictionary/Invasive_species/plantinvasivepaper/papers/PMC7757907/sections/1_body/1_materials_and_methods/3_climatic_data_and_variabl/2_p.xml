<p>To assess the expected multicollinearity between the 19 bioclimatic predictor variables we performed a Pearson’ correlation test between all the potential predictor variables in (

A correlation threshold of |r| &gt; 0.7 was set for variables that could potentially affect our model, and variables that met this criterion were removed from the analysis. The uncorrelated bioclimatic variables were used in MaxEnt to determine the areas climatically suitable for
