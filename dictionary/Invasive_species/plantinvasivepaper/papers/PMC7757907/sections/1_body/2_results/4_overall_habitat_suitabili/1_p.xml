 </bold>. We noted some variability in the overall habitat suitability of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> globally. The merged distribution indicated highly vulnerable areas in Asia (India, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, and Laos under future climatic conditions (RCP2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). In Madagascar, Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia suitable habitats were detected under RCP4.5. In Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Western Sahara we predicted areas less vulnerable to the potential establishment of
