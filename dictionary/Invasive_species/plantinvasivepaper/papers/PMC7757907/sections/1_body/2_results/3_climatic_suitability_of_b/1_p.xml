<p>The 5 MaxEnt models using 8 bioclimatic variables exhibited varied results for predicting the areas climatically suitable to

 <italic>zonata</italic> establishment under current and future climate scenarios. The results revealed that countries in the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman), North Africa (Western Sahara, Libya and Egypt), West Africa (Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Mauritania), Central Africa (Northern Cameroon and Chad), the Horn of Africa (Sudan, Eritrea and to a lesser extent part of Somalia and Ethiopia), Iran, Asia (India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Bhutan) and South America (Chile and Ecuador) were highly suitable for the potential establishment of
