 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], where it is more competitive than several other tephritid species. Libya, Egypt, and Sudan have the highest risk of further invasion and recurrent spread into new areas due to the heterogeneous agricultural landscape of the Mediterranean region, characterized by mixed-fruit and vegetable orchards and therefore deserves special attention. Therefore, the suggestion that cold and dry stress were among the factors that limits 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>â€™s distributional range in these areas might no longer be applicable. Although to date there are no records of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> being captured from nationwide monitoring programs in neighbouring countries to Sudan, the potential invasion risk of these countries in the region remains high.
