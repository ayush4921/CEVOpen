 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> is expected to potentially establish throughout much of the tropics and subtropics, including some parts of the USA, southern China, south eastern Australia and northern New Zealand under current climatic conditions. Possibilities for expansion of

 <italic>zonata</italic> potential ecological niche poleward or northward into colder areas was observed for US, China, New Zealand, and Mediterranean regions under climate change scenarios for the year 2070s [

 <italic>B</italic>.
