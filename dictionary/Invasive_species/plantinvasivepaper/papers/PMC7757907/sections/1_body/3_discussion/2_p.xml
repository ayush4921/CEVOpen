<p>According to our knowledge, two studies have investigated the potential climatic suitability of

 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Delrio and Cocco [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] developed the first model of the potential distribution of the peach fruit fly in the Mediterranean basin using CLIMEX (Hearne Scientific, Australia). In their CLIMEX model a set of parameters to describe 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>â€™s response to moisture and temperature were used to deduce the potential geographical distribution of the fruit fly. Their results suggested the potential establishment of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> in coastal areas of the Mediterranean region (North Africa) and Near East. In the present study, the predicted potential climatic suitability for 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> was also limited to southern areas of Portugal, Spain, Greece and all the main Mediterranean islands (Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and Crete) similar to that reported by Delrio and Cocco [
