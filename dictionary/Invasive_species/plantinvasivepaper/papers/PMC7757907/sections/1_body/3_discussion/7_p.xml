<p>The simple natural dispersal model developed here complements baseline ENM algorithms which do not support explicit dispersal mechanisms. It supports the concept of short-distance dispersal as an important modeling framework to understand the spread of invasive fruit flies locally. While existing studies acknowledge the limitations of the Gaussian dispersal kernel in realistically modeling human- mediated dispersal through long distance dispersal [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], it adequately represents dispersal by diffusion. While we acknowledge the limitation in our study to model long-distance and stratified dispersal, our model can be used as a reference against which leptokurtic dispersal of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> can be compared in future. It adequately models short- distance dispersal like the classical spread models and can be applied in local contexts [

 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The invasion of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> will likely involve short and long distance dispersal or a combination of the two which is known as stratified dispersal [

 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] resulting in higher rates of spread. This is a complex stochastic spatiotemporal process which involves individual fruit flies dispersing and interacting in a nonlinear matter, and this is better modeled by other approaches like individual based models [
