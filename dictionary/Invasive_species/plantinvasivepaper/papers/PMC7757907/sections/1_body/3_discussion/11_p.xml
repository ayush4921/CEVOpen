<p>Our findings provide important information to significantly help reformulation of policy decisions, assist government extension officers and farmers to make adaptive agricultural management strategies. This allows for enhanced monitoring and surveillance, and designing of local, regional and national-level phytosanitary and integrated pest management options to limit the spread and reduce impact of

 <italic>zonata</italic> in the invaded range. The integration of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> distribution maps generated under the various climate change scenarios into agricultural landscape management decisions would help to increase crop productivity, secure food production and livelihoods of farmers in affected areas where 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> is likely to expand its ecological niche under climate change. Our modeling results under different future climate change scenarios further enhances awareness on the potential threats of spatial expansion of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> by the year 2050 and serve as a decision-support tool for early warning signals to guide preparedness for possible invasions.
