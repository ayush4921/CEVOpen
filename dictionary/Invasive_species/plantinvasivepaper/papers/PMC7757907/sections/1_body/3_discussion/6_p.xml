<p>Furthermore, our models demonstrated that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> will potentially disperse naturally with decreasing geographical reachability following the normal curve from the present occurrence point locations. Similar use of the Gaussian probability density functions to model the dispersal pattern of an invasive fish species [
 <italic>Lagocephalus sceleratus</italic> (Gmelin)] to uninvaded areas in the Mediterranean sea from its known locations has been reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Given the invasive traits of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>sceleratus</italic> its natural spread pattern is likely to be closely related to that of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>. Gilbert et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] also developed a diffusion model to forecast the potential spread of the horse-chestnut leaf miner 
 <italic>Cameraria ohridella</italic> which was used as a reference against which he compared other leptokurtic models for the pest. Similarly, our simple natural spread model could be used as reference for other leptokurtic models of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>. Our findings add to the pool of knowledge of previous studies on the potential distribution of invasive species and how they interact with their overall habitat suitability with special emphasis on
