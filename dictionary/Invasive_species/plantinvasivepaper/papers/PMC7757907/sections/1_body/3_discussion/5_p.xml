<p>Our MaxEnt models were generally more restrictive in predicting the climatic suitability of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> compared to the results of the previous CLIMEX models, except for north Africa where areas predicted to be optimally suitable were larger than that reported by Ni et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, the model by Ni et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] revealed much larger areas of high climatic suitability, especially across central, eastern, and southern Africa and to a lesser extent the coastal belt of west Africa than in our study. Also, southern and eastern parts of Australia, southern Asia, parts of the Mediterranean areas, China, New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Madagascar, Central America, South America, and the south-eastern United States were shown to be optimally suitable for possible establishment of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>, which is contrary to the present study. This could be partially attributed to the differences in the climatic datasets and modeling algorithms used in the studies. There was a strong fit between climatic suitability and known occurrences of the pest. We demonstrated that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> can potentially establish and become widespread under tropical and subtropical conditions, which agrees with the report by Ni et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0243047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For all the MaxEnt models we fitted, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of driest month and temperature seasonality were the most important bioclimatic variables significantly influencing the potential establishment of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>. Under current and future climate scenarios, optimal suitable areas in Africa were predicted in north (Libya and Egypt), West (Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Guinea Bissau), East (Sudan), Central Africa (Cameroon, Tchad and Central Africa republic), Arabian Peninsula (Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia), Iran, Southern Asia (India, Burma, Bangladesh and Bhutan) and to a lesser extent in South America (Chile). Our model further suggested that under future climatic scenarios, RCP 4.5 and 8.5, there was a significant range expansion of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> in Western Sahara, and in Southern Africa but with medium climatic suitability. On the contrary, RCP 2.6 showed considerable decrease in 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> range expansion in Central, East and West Africa. All the models under current and future climate change scenarios revealed medium climatic suitability for 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> in Madagascar. However, when the area under production of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> host plants were taken into consideration the resultant overall habitat suitability map demonstrated less invasion risk for areas that do not currently grow 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>â€™s host plants. In general, all agricultural areas where 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> host crops are currently grown, and the climatic suitability score is high are considered at higher risk of invasion by the pest.
