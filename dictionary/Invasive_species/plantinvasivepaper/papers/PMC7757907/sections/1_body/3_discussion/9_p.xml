 <italic>zonataâ€™</italic>s spread our simple dispersal model did not take into account spatial heterogeneity, dispersal barriers (such as deserts, oceans, mountains) that limit the distances the fruit fly covers in certain directions, natural enemies and human activities such as movement of commodities. While we assume a homogeneous environment, habitat variability plays a key role in the spatial spread of insect pests. In real-world ecosystems the environment is mostly heterogeneous and can greatly affect the rate and pattern of invasive spread. Spreading invasive insects are affected by several natural and human-made obstacles. In addition habitat fragmentation and other spatial arrangements of the favourable habitats have been noted to alter spread patterns of invasive species [
