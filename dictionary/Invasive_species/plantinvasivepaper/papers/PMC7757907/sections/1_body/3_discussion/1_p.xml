<p>In this study we used MaxEnt to estimate the ecological niche of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> under current and four future greenhouse gas concentration scenarios in 2050 to review predictive changes in the potential climatic pest suitability. Climatic suitability derived from MaxEnt was integrated with host availability data to map areas that are potentially vulnerable to invasion by 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic>. Further we developed a simple model for 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> dispersal assuming a Gaussian dispersal kernel. The simple dispersal model provides an easy way to map the potential local dispersal of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> by natural means over time. The resulting potential spread map presents complimentary aspects with respect to short- distance natural spread of the pest. In general, our findings provide information to guide biosecurity agencies at a local level in decision-making and serve as an early warning tool to safeguard against the invasion of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>zonata</italic> into unaffected areas.
