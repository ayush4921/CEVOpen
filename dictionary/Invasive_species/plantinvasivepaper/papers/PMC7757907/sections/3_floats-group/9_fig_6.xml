 <caption>
  <p>The overall habitat suitability of 
   <italic>Bactrocera zonata</italic> under current (A) and four future climate change scenarios [i.e. four representative concentration pathways (RCPs)]–RCPs 2.6 (B), RCPs 4.5 (C), RCPs 6.0 (D) and RCPs 8.0 (E). These were obtained by merging the normalised climatic suitability with normalised host availability. The overall habitat suitability classes were: (i) not suitable (≤ 0.15), (ii) low suitability (0.16–0.30), (iii) medium suitability (0.31–0.60) and (iv) high suitability (≥ 0.61). “The figure was generated using the QGIS 3.10.2 software (
