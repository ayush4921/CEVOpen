<p>A: No. This was indicated with the notion that leachate effects are very short lived and do not translate into soil effects. We found leachate effects in a germination experiment and see the same patterns in the common-garden experiment: less seedlings emerge in ragwort litter. The chemicals in the leachates that cause this effect might be decomposed very fast in the soil or connect with other chemicals in the soil so that the lack of soil conditioning does not mean a lack of autotoxic effects of the leachate.</p>
