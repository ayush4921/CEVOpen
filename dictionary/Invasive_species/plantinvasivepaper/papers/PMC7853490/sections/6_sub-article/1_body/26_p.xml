<p>A: We tried to find as much literature that dealt specifically with ragwort as possible. However, some aspects are only studied on other plants or assumed to be of general importance for all forbs. Thus, we feel that combining both general and ragwort-specific literature will give a more consistent picture than focusing only on “general” or “ragwort” studies. Where it is important that we directly refer to ragwort this is mentioned in the text. In other parts we did not clarify that as it made no difference in the point, we wanted to make but would rather complicate the text for the reader. </p>
