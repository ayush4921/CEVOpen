<p>A: We explain in detail what we defined as “unconditioned”. Rephrasing “unconditioned” in grass-conditioned would miss the point as there are also other forbs that may conditioned the soil. Another wording such as ragwort and non-ragwort conditioned would be more confusing for the reader as “ragwort-conditioned” is the focus. In our study it does not matter how the other soil is conditioned. Thus, we decided to keep the dichotomy as we established it.</p>
