<p>First, I appreciate the expanded presentation of the Control results, but I could not sort out what the controls represented. Were they controls for litter addition, in which seeds were added without litter? The Methods state that “no ragwort seedlings emerged (Line 178)”, and yet the authors report emergence, biomass, etc. results for the Controls. Remind the reader in the Results what they are controls for – presumably for the effect of litter?</p>
