<p>A: As former studies (pure leachate studies) showed that ragwort is autotoxic, we assume that conspecific effects differ from heterospecific effects. It is certainly true that other especially congeneric species may also hamper seedling emergence in ragwort as they contain similar chemical compounds. And it is an interesting question what effect native congeneric species would have. However, the scope of our study was to test whether ragwort litter can be used as a management tool and not to test if other congeneric forbs may also hamper its growth. </p>
