<p>R2: This study doesnâ€™t strictly test the effects of leachates since the presence of leachates are confounded with the presence of other chemical and physical impacts of litter. This point is now emphasized throughout the discussion, and I think the authors do a good job explaining the importance of these other mechanism for their results. However, their argument and their data (see specific comments) suggest a subsidiary role of autotoxic litter leachates in ragwort performance, which is in contrast to the narrative established in the introduction. Therefore, a more consistent narrative could be created by emphasizing physical impacts of litter in the introduction.</p>
