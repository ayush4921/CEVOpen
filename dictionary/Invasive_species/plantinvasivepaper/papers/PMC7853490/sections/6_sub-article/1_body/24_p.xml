<p>A: We feel uneasy to resume the proposed feedback loop. From a successional point of view, ragwort is an early successional that profits from open soils (as mentioned in the methods section). It never establishes in grassland with intact sward and high litter but needs disturbed ground for germination. If open soil patches are available and a light litter cover protects the seeds and seedlings ragwort will establish. But it will never form monocultures without grasses and other forbs. When the soil is not disturbed grasses will outcompete ragwort sooner or later at least in our study system where ragwort is native. The system we studied is much more complex in the field than the feedback loop you proposed, especially in managed grasslands. In our simple experiment we did not find univocal effects of ragwort litter on its germination and establishment. Germination was higher under ragwort, but resulting seedlings were stronger. If even our simple experiment does not show a clear negative effect of ragwort litter on both germination and growth, it is rather unlikely to find distinct effects in the field. Thus, we refrain from proposing your synthesis as we do not see this mirrored in the natural system.</p>
