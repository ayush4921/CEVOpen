<p>A: It is true that we did not test effects of pure leachate as these effects are confounded with physical litter aspects. However, we did a pure leachate test earlier and found autotoxic effects. As far as we understand you question effects of leachate in general. However, we see that seedlings emerge less often under ragwort litter and we know from earlier experiments from us and others (Van de Voorde et al) that there is an autotoxic effect. Hence leaving out autotoxicity as an explanation would not give a full picture. Therefore, we restrain from changing the narrative in the introduction, as we feel that both parts: allelopathy and physical effects should be given a fair share in the narrative of the introduction and discussion.</p>
