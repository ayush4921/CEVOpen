<p>A: We used the hetero- and conspecific dichotomy since the effects of ragwort on itself (conspecific) were in the focus of our study and using this word gives the reader the concrete origin of the litter as rather con- or heterospecific. Your right, that other forbs may have similar effects as ragwort. Therefore, we added “grass” to heterospecific. We hope that this is a compromise were the reader can see at one view that conspecific effects of ragwort are in the focus of our study compared to effects of other litter, which consisted mainly of grass.</p>
