<p>R2: I kept expecting a type of synthesis of the results from an invasion ecology or successional perspective that never quite landed. The results suggest a positive feedback loop to invasion (similar to findings of Schuster Dukes 2014 Oikos). Initially, sites have high biotic resistance against ragwort invasion since grass litter suppresses growth. However, since germination under grass litter is enhanced, they eventually establish. As ragwort start to accumulate on site, the non-additive interactions observed in growth take effect â€“ facilitating enhanced growth of ragwort in the early and mid stages of invasion. This enhanced growth allows them expedite the competitive exclusion of grasses and dominate the site. Once ragwort becomes dominant and there is less grass litter on site, litter interactions start to wane but increasingly pure ragwort litter means bigger and bigger ragwort. Eventually grasses are excluded and ragwort is a self-sustaining monoculture. In short: differing impacts of grass and ragwort litter mean that ragwort benefits from whatever litter is there (grass promotes establishment early in invasion, ragwort-grass mixtures promote competitive ability mid-invasion, and ragwort promotes exclusion of other species late in invasion). The points are there throughout the discussion, but I think the authors could make it a concise point in the conclusion or near the end of the discussion. This feedback loop suggests that managers should limit ragwort litter on site.</p>
