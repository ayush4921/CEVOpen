<p>R2: 328. Yes, but there are many other possible explanations too. Litter impacts on microclimate, the rate of litter decomposition and N release, and the relative difference between different litter amounts compared to differences between litter types could all be drivers of this result. There is no way to exclude these other factors given the current design, so there is little reason to expect that autotoxicity alone is the primary factor.</p>
