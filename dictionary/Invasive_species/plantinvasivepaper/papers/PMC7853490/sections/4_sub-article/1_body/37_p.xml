<p>A: We do not quite understand this claim. Maybe we might have not described the design clear enough, thus we rephrased and added information on this in the manuscript now. We exposed seedlings of ragwort to ragwort litter and left the litter for decay under outdoor conditions. Thus, seeds were exposed to litter leachates that would also occur under natural conditions. It is certainly true that we did not only assess the chemical effects induced by leachate but also physical and mechanical litter effects. Therefore, we also discuss these in detail in the discussion section.</p>
