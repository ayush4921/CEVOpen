<p>A: We disagree; the comment of Reviewer 1 supports this by explicitly praising our clear hypothesis. The current format allows us to directly formulate our research hypothesis, which is derived from all the introduction written before the hypothesis are phrased. Thus, we have a clear section that sums up our assumptions based on all the information gathered in the introduction. Therefore, no further citations are included in this section. The current format allows us to build a frame for the study and is a clear guide to the reader, which questions he or she can expect to be answered.</p>
