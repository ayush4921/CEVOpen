<p>A: We added analysis on whether effects were purely additive or not. Indeed, concerning the two variables height and biomass per pot effects deviated positively, e.g. litter mix facilitated higher growth and led to higher biomass per pot. However, there was an only additive effect in biomass per plant and mean number of leaves. Furthermore, even though seedling vigor was positively influenced, seedling emergence was not. Thus, deriving a net effect favoring more ragwort cannot be concluded. Because of these ambivalent results we conclude that leaving or removing litter on the grassland will not substantially influence ragwort density. We clarified this in our conclusions.</p>
