<p>R2: The analyses are structured around response ratios. Most of the results and discussion focus on differences in observed values and not on deviation from control values. So, there is an inherent disconnect between how data were analyzed and presented, and how they are discussed. This is confusing, and not particularly robust for most comparisons because it ignores variance of control units.</p>
