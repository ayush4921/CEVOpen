<p>A: We included all information necessary in the introduction already. This section allows us to explicitly portrait the studied species. “Information on ecological effects” of ragwort is rather vague. We could describe ragworts role as important habitat for insects or its positive soil feedback for other plants, but this would not be an important information for the current study. Thus, we refrained from it.</p>
