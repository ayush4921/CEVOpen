<p>R2: 103. In general, this section should not be necessary. It should be enough to state the hypotheses or questions without going back and explaining each. At the point that the hypotheses are presented, the reader should already be familiar enough with the mechanisms to understand the hypotheses without explanation. The current format of presenting a question and then detailing the predicted response is confusing and seems to be used instead of adequate background information beforehand. Furthermore, there are no citations presented within these explanations, so it is unclear what is hypothesis and what is already known.</p>
