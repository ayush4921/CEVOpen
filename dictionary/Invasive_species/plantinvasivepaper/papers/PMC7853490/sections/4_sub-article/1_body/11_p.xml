<p>A: We added information on per pot biomass throughout the manuscript. However, as the results of per plant and per pot biomass do not differ in their general pattern (see figure below or figure added in supporting information), we cannot support reviewer 1â€™s guess, that biomass was lower in ragwort litter pots and thus do not further discuss self-limitation. However, we did discuss self-thinning in the manuscript (line 324, 363, 415ff).</p>
