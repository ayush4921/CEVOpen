<p>A: Interactions can either be quantitative (seize of the effect differs) or qualitative (sign/direction of the effect changes). We want to stress that the direction (sign of the effect: low litter amounts leading to higher seedling mass) is the same we for all litter types. Thus, we want to keep this point. </p>
