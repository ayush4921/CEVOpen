<p>A: Log response ratios are a nice and valid approach to handle hanging control groups (in the current study the control pots (no litter) acted at the same time as the control for grass litter, grass-senecio-mix and pure senecio litter), but they come at the expense of some drawbacks; one (i.e. ignoring variance of control units) was highlighted by you and since we follow your argument we decided to rearrange the analyses. We changed the analyses and worked with the original to data make it easier to assess direct changes in factors like seedling number, biomass, height, and mean leaf number. In this approach, we did not include the controls in the complete ANOVA-model. We were interested in the differential effects of the three litter types; and not in the general differences of no litter cover vs. litter cover present (therefore, we did also not refer to a control litter treatment in our research question/expectations section). </p>
