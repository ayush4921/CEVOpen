<p>A: To dry litter at low temperatures allowed us to preserve all possible influential chemicals within the litter, which are part of the complex of litter effects. Still, we had the same concern you stated in earlier litter experiments; as a consequence we tried to assess how much more additional weight litter loses when dried at higher temperatures (110Â°C ) some years ago; obviously the additional loss varied with the litter type but in most cases this loss was well below 5% and in no case above this value (not published personal observation). </p>
