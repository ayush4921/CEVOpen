<p>R1: The authors missed an opportunity to synthesize these observations by considering the per pot biomass of ragwort. The larger per-plant biomass of under ragwort litter is not inconsistent with a negative effect of litter on germination and early-plant growth. I expect that the total biomass – the sum of individual plants’ biomass per pot – was lower in ragwort litter pots. That would offer evidence that ragwort self-limits itself and perhaps would offer a clearer management recommendation. “Self limitation” could be a broader concept that this study tests, if the authors choose. More importantly, the conclusion could change, as this finding would suggest a specific strategy for managers hoping to limit ragwort.</p>
