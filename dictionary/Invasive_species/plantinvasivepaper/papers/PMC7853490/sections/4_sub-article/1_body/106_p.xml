<p>A: In fact, using a litter mixture as comparison is a strength rather than weakness as it mirrors natural conditions we wanted to mimic. For our research question we wanted a comparison of litter without ragwort, litter of pure ragwort and a mix of the two. We were not interested in pure grass effects as this does not lead to an answer of the evaluation if ragwort litter can act as establishment barrier for ragwort. As we found clear effects of grass litter vs. ragwort litter despite using the rather uncontrolled grass treatment, actually supports the clearance and strength of the patterns we found.</p>
