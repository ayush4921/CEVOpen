<p>A: It is true that “unconditioned” soil as we phrase it, is truly conditioned by other plants than ragwort (including grasses and other forbs). However, as ragwort and effects of its litter are in the focus of our study and not “grasses and other forbs”, we find it more convenient to refer to ragwort conditioned soil as “conditioned” and not ragwort conditioned soil as “unconditioned”. We clarified this definition in our method-section.</p>
