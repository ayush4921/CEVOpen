<p>The analyses are structured around response ratios. Most of the results and discussion focus on differences in observed values and not on deviation from control values. So, there is an inherent disconnect between how data were analyzed and presented, and how they are discussed. This is confusing, and not particularly robust for most comparisons because it ignores variance of control units. When attempting to discern if litter mixtures behaved additively, the response ratio analyses make sense (although no such analysis is actually presented here â€“ a missed opportunity since mixed litter studies are also uncommon). In all other cases, using a simpler factorial design would be more accurate and more easily interpreted since it A) preserves variance of the controls, and B) directly reflects observed values. The structure of the analyses should be reconsidered.</p>
