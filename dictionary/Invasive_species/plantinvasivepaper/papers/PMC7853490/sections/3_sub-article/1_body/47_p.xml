<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript describes a container experiment in which germination and seedling growth (10 weeks) of ragwort was tested in a factorial experiment with litter type, litter quantity, and soil conditioning as treatments. The study’s rationale is the challenge that ragwort is a significant management problem in rangelands, so understanding strategies (including cutting, etc.) to reduce ragwort cover is important.</p>
