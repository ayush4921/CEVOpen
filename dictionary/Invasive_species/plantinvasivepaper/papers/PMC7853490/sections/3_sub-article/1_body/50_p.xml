<p>The Discussion should be reorganized to be clearer and shorter. The division into headings based on the main treatments – litter type, litter quantity, and soil conditioning – prevented a synthetic consideration of the comparisons.

Then, the relative importance of litter type, litter quantity, and soil conditioning can be compared to other studies – many of which have also combined one or more of your same treatments (though not all three).</p>
