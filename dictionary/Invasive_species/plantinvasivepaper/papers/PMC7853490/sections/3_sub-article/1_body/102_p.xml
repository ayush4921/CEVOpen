<p>155. This is a weakness of the experimental design that the authors must address. The study focuses on specific litter effects, and while ragwort is maintained as a specific treatment, the grass litter treatment is poorly controlled. The exact composition of the grass litter treatment is unclear. Ideally, this would have been a single grass species, but instead appears to be a presumably variable mixture of different species. This severely limits the authorsâ€™ ability to detect litter mixing effects since the baseline additive condition would vary with the composition of the grass litter. This is true for all litter experiments to some extent since litter quality is variable even within a single plant, but by including multiple grass species as a single treatment, this error is enhanced.</p>
