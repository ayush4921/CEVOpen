<p>The results are vague. It is not sufficient to only state that levels differed. Instead, the direction and magnitude of the change should also be presented in text (e.g. seedlings grew X% taller under ragwort litter than under grass litter).

As is, the table is presented in passing and it is unclear exactly which tests correspond to any given statement of significance.</p>
