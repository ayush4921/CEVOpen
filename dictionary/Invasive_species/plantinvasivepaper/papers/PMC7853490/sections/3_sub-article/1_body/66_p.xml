<p>Perhaps my largest concern with the manuscript is that it is over-eager to draw conclusions outside the scope of the design. There is a fair amount of attention given to litter leachates as a possible inhibitory factor, but this wasn’t tested and although likely, is not necessarily the sole explanation for the observed results. More importantly, the manuscript concludes that leaving ragwort litter in the field has no net effect on ragwort establishment, but this is not adequately assessed by the presented analyses. To better understand this, the authors should evaluate whether grass-ragwort mixtures had an effect that deviated from the expected value based on those two litters in monoculture. Based on Fig 3, it appears that ragwort litter (which is different than green biomass – something that must be kept in mind) disproportionately stimulates germinant growth. If so, it would mean that incorporation of ragwort litter into mixtures with grass litter would result in more favorable conditions for germinants and that ragwort litter could facilitate a positive feedback loop favoring more ragwort. Managers should then seek to limit ragwort litter as much as possible (contrary to the current conclusion).</p>
