<p>In this manuscript MÃ¶hler et al. present findings from a mesocosm experiment examining the impacts of soil conditioning, litter species, and litter amount on the germination and initial establishment of invasive Jacobaea vulgaris (ragwort). They find that ragwort litter suppressed germination, but that resulting germinants grew larger than germinants arising from controls or from soil covered with grass litter. The authors ask valuable questions; particularly since experiments combining soil conditioning and litter impacts are relatively scarce. Overall, the manuscript has merit and is worth publishing, but will require significant revision beforehand. In particular, I recommend that the analyses be revised and expanded (see below). These are major revisions, but may also warrant a reject decision.</p>
