<p>389. This makes sense: when there is not a monoculture of ragwort, litter facilitates invasion. When there is a monoculture, litter slightly inhibits invasion. So, remove litter when there are grasses still present, but leave litter alone when ragwort is the only thing left. The question then though is if this even matters – once there is a ragwort monoculture, it doesn’t matter if germination is reduced so long as the population can maintain itself. The reduction in germination rates would have to be large enough to make the population collapse or for the establishment of later-successional species. I think this effect is outweighed by the benefits of larger ragwort under ragwort litter - this allows them to exclude other species from the site (so even with lower germination they still win).</p>
