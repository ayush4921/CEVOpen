<p>I question the accuracy of framing this study using the hetero- con-specific dichotomy. This is not a highly-controlled test of conspecific litter impacts relative to heterospecific litter since the non-ragwort litter was derived from very different species (grasses). This means that differences in the “conspecific” result and the “heterospecific” result could be due to any number of traits that differ between the species, not just species identity. For example, the design does not allow the authors to identify how much of the “conspecific” effect is due to seeds and litter being from the exact same species versus that litter belonging to any forb in general. It may be that other forbs are relatively rare and so “heterospecific” and “grass” may be functionally interchangeable in this study system, but that is not true everywhere. Especially given the broad scope of the journal, this should be addressed in the manuscript and/or mentions of “heterospecific” should be changed to “grass” (including the title).</p>
