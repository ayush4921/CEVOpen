<p>370. Does the lack of a conditioning effect suggest a lack of a chemical/autotoxic effect of litter as well? Presumably leachates would accumulate in soils in such a way that you would detect a legacy effect of leachates in your conditioning analyses. In contrast, there would not be the same legacy effect of a physical mechanism, therefore fitting with the lack of a conditioning effect.</p>
