<p>A more direct test of the effects of leachates would be to isolate leachates and artificially impose them on soils/seeds in the absence of litter itself. Since this is not done and the authors make a strong argument for physical mechanisms, I remain confused by the assumptions made in the intro and the discussion that leachates are a primary cause of the observed results. The authors should review the manuscript to ensure it reflects their confidence in the various proposed mechanisms.</p>
