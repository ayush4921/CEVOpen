<p>The manuscript is much improved and I appreciate the authorsâ€™ thoughtful responses to my earlier comments. In particular, the re-imagining of the statistical analyses makes the paper much more intuitive and also provides some new, exciting results. Although I still have some substantial concerns, I think they are fairly easily-addressed.</p>
