  <italic>Jacobaea vulgaris</italic> Gaertn. or common ragwort is a widespread noxious grassland weed that is subject to different regulation measures worldwide. Seedling emergence and growth are the most crucial stages for most plants during their life cycle. Therefore, heterospecific grass or conspecific ragwort litter as well as soil-mediated effects may be of relevance for ragwort control. Our study examines the effects of conspecific and heterospecific litter as well as ragwort conditioned soil on seedling emergence and growth. We conducted pot experiments to estimate the influence of soil conditioning (with, without ragwort), litter type (grass, ragwort, grass-ragwort-mix) and amount (200 g/m², 400 g/m²) on 
  <italic>J</italic>. 
  <italic>vulgaris</italic> recruitment. As response parameters, we assessed seedling number, biomass, height and number of seedling leaves. We found that 200 g/m² grass litter led to higher seedling numbers, while litter composed of 
  <italic>J</italic>. 
  <italic>vulgaris</italic> reduced seedling emergence. Litter amounts of 400 g/m² had negative effects on the number of seedlings regardless of the litter type. Results for biomass, plant height and leaf number showed opposing patterns to seedling numbers. Seedlings in pots treated with high litter amounts and seedlings in ragwort litter became heavier, grew higher and had more leaves. Significant effects of the soil conditioned by ragwort on seedling emergence and growth were negligible. The study confirms that the amount and composition of litter strongly affect seedling emergence and growth of 
  <italic>J</italic>. 
  <italic>vulgaris</italic>. Moreover, while conspecific litter and high litter amounts negatively affected early seedling development in ragwort, those seedlings that survived accumulated more biomass and got taller than seedlings grown in heterospecific or less dense litter. Therefore, ragwort litter has negative effects in ragwort germination, but positive effects in ragwort growth. Thus, leaving ragwort litter on pastures will not reduce ragwort establishment and growth and cannot be used as management tool.
