 <italic>Jacobaea vulgaris</italic> Gaertn. or common ragwort is a widespread noxious grassland weed that is native to Eurasia, and invasive in North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Since the pyrrolizidine alkaloids of the plant pose a health risk to cattle that consume this plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], its occurrence in high densities is a challenge for grassland management. Consequently, control of common ragwort is prescribed in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and Friesland, province of the Netherlands [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, several studies have aimed to find effective and efficient ways to manage this grassland weed [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some of these studies came to the conclusion that specific cutting regimes are a promising approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Biomass containing toxic ragwort cannot be used as hay or silage and the high number of long-living seeds rules out composting biomass [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, the biomass is often disposed of as special waste [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, cut ragwort litter is often left on the grassland, because removing the litter is laborious and costly. Yet, the occurrence of conspecific allelopathic effects from litter leachates [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] suggests that simply leaving ragwort litter on mown grassland could be an additional component in managing ragwort abundance. As a first step to evaluate the validity of this approach, we experimentally tested this management option.
