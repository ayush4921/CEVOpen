<p>Litter type present is another important factor that can influence whether seed germination and seedling establishment is facilitated or hampered [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Litter type changes conditions for germination and growth as chemical as well as physical structure depend on the characteristics of species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Grass litter, for example, might be less hampering than large-leafed forb litter due to a lower amount of phytotoxins and an easier to penetrate structure [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. On the other side, forb litter often decomposes faster thereby reducing physical constrains for seedling emergence. Under natural conditions, however, litter is not usually monospecific, e.g. in grasslands it consists of a mixture of forb and grass litter. The effects of litter from plant communities are driven by species-specific litter properties [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and may either be purely additive as hypothesized in the mass-ratio-hypothesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or non-additive, as litter types may interact. In this context, Gartner and Cardon [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found that more than half of the litter mixtures they reviewed behaved in a non-additive way concerning factors such as mass loss, nutrient transfer or decomposer composition.
