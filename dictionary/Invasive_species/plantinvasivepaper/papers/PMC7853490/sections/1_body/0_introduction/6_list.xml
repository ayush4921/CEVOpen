  <p>Does litter type influence the emergence and growth of ragwort seedlings?</p>
  <p>We expect lower numbers of ragwort seedlings to emerge from beneath conspecific litter compared to pure grass litter or a mixture of grass and ragwort litter. As lower competition results in stronger growth we expect converse patterns to occur in seedling growth after emergence.</p>

  <p>Does litter amount influence seedling emergence and growth of ragwort and does this depend on litter type?</p>
  <p>We expect negative litter effects to be stronger with increasing litter amount. We also expect the size of litter effects to increase with the portion of ragwort litter in the litter cover. Seedling performance is hypothesized to be higher under medium ragwort amounts and highest under low amounts of pure grass litter.</p>

  <p>Does ragwort-conditioned soil influence conspecific seedling emergence and growth? If so, do these effects interact with the litter effects?</p>
  <p>We hypothesized an inhibitory effect of ragwort-conditioned soil on its own emergence and growth. We expect these effects to be additive for ragwort litter.</p>
