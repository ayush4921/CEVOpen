<p>We found both negative and positive effects of ragwort litter on conspecific seedling emergence and growth. While negative effects can be linked to physical and autotoxic chemical ragwort litter effects in the stage of seedling emergence, those seedlings that emerged successfully may have profited from a lower intraspecific competition and may had more resources to invest than seedlings that emerged beneath grass or mixed litter. Due to the ambivalent nature of our results, these findings cannot easily be translated into management recommendations for ragwort-infested sites. However, the effects of mixed litter on ragwort recruitment were either neutral or even promoted ragwort growth. Therefore, when we assume that biomass on mowed ragwort pastures consists roughly of similar amounts of grass and ragwort, we expect that leaving litter containing ragwort biomass on the grassland will have no negative effect on ragwort population density or growth. As already our results for a simple controlled experiment do not lead to a clear hint of the effectiveness of ragwort litter in reducing ragwort population density, we do not expect pronounced effects in an experiment under more natural conditions.</p>
