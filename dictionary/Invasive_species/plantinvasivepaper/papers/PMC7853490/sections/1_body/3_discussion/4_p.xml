<p>In general, the amelioration of the physical environment by litter (e. g. on soil moisture), rather than its chemical composition, seems to be the main factor boosting seedling growth in short time scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the size of chemical autotoxic effects and therefore their relative importance in relation to physical and mechanical or other biotic effects are species-specific [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Several studies show the occurrence of autotoxicity of ragwort [

 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which suggests that chemical effects are an additional mechanism for lower seedling emergence from beneath ragwort litter. Van de Voorde [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported decreasing germination with increasing concentrations of ragwort extract. As ragwort produces many seeds with high germination potential and low dispersal ability [

 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] autotoxic effects may avoid intraspecific competition in ragwort and thus may lead to lower seedling numbers but increased seedling vitality.
