<p>Another explanation for superior performance of emerged seedlings in high litter amounts and ragwort litter might be an improved availability of nutrients [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as more biomass contains more nutrients and ragwort litter decomposed quite fast. This is supported by our observation that even though the number of seedlings in the control pot and in the ragwort litter pot with 200 g/m² was about the same and thus competition among seedlings was comparable, biomass of seedlings growing in ragwort litter pots was still higher. However, it is questionable if nutrients from decaying litter are converted to plant available nutrients within 70 days. Effects of different litter amounts on nutrient availability are generally relatively low [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Another reason for lighter and smaller seedlings in lower amounts of litter could be due to the missing investment of seedlings in higher growth when they have already reached light [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Siebenkäs et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] compared seedling growth in the same developmental stage as seedlings in our experiment and found that plants tend to grow higher when there is more shade. Thus, seedlings may grow higher in higher litter amounts to avoid its shade and in order to reach light. Renne et al. (2006) found that small differences in height of seedlings early on can produce large differences in their final biomass [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] indicating that early shading can translate in higher heights, even if shade is gone.
