<p>Our experimental results suggest that litter type as well as litter amount do influence seedling emergence and growth, whereas conditioned soil did not when combined with litter treatments. Our main finding is, that although ragwort litter reduced the number of conspecific emerging seeds, seedlings actually performed better in ragwort litter showing increased biomass, height and leaf numbers. Therefore, ragwort litter cannot be used to control reduce ragwort abundance.</p>
