<p>In contrast of Van de Voordes notion of a negative soil-feedback in ragwort [

 <xref rid="pone.0246459.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In fact, the only significant effect of conditioned soil occurred on seedling height in controls, i.e. seedlings in conditioned soil grew bigger than in unconditioned soil. This finding is in contrast to findings of van de Voorde [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], who reported autotoxic effects of ragwort on its seedling development. However, on average the observed difference in plant height between ragwort seedlings growing in conditioned versus those growing in unconditioned soil including control and litter addition treatments was only 2 mm (less than 4% of the average height of about 54.5 mm). Therefore, we expect that this difference is too small to be of ecological relevance. In other studies, looking at several seedling cohorts, those cohorts usually differed several centimeters in height [
