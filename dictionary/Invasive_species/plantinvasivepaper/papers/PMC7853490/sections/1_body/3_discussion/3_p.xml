<p>Seedling emergence was highest in grass litter, lowest in ragwort litter and intermediate in the litter mixture. Germination was highest in medium compared to no (control) or high litter amounts. In contrast, all parameters measuring seedling growth (biomass, height, mean leaf number) were highest in high amounts of litter and/or ragwort litter. The positive effect of grass litter and medium litter amounts on seedling emergence might be due to physical litter effects like preserving a relatively constant temperature and soil moisture [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our experiment, the same amount of grass litter covered a larger proportion of the soil surface than ragwort or mixed litter (high amount: grass 90 ± 3%, mixed 85 ± 4% and ragwort 67 ± 8%, low amount: grass: 85 ± 3%, mixed 70 ± 9%, ragwort 37 ± 5%). In accordance with a study by Eckstein and Donath [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which revealed a rise in soil moisture when litter cover increased, we assume that seedlings experienced more favourable water availability in grass litter and medium litter amounts. In high litter amounts however, negative effects of litter prevailed over positive effects. Laboratory experiments of van der Meijden et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that seed germination of ragwort increased with higher soil humidity. We also observed that ragwort litter decayed faster than grass litter (personal observation). This is in line with general findings that litter of forb species such as ragwort tends to decay faster than grass litter [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Schuster et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] found that the mass of ragwort litter remaining after 30 days was only half of the amount of grass (
 <italic>Alopecurus pratensis</italic>) litter. Since the protective properties of a litter cover against desiccation and temperature extremes increases with litter amount present, seedlings emerging from beneath faster decaying ragwort litter might have experienced less protection than those seedlings emerging beneath grass litter [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, the negative effect of ragwort litter on ragwort seedlings emergence may be a result of fewer physical benefits seedlings experienced from ragwort litter compared to grass litter. In addition, effects of leachate may depend on the specific decomposition rate of different litter types. As leachates released from the litter are declining very rapidly after senescence [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], intensity of seedlings’ exposure to leachate depends on the decomposition rate of the litter present. Thus, ragwort seeds and seedlings emerging from ragwort litter, which decays fast [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], were only exposed to the ragwort leachate for a short time. Consequently, we assume that leachate effects on seedling emergence were more pronounced than on seedling growth.
