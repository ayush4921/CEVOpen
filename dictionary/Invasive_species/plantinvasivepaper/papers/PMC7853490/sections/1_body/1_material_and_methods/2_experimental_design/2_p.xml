 <sup>st</sup> April 2016. An initial viability test with a 1% tetrazolium chloride solution [

 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> litter and conditioned and unconditioned soil was collected from rosettes on a ragwort-infested extensive cattle pasture near Preetz, Germany (54.227175, 10.242809) in April 2016. We assumed soil to be affected by ragwort, i.e. conditioned, if at least four ragwort-plants were growing within 0.5 m². We refer to unconditioned soil when soil was taken from the center of an area (diameter 10 m) where no ragwort was growing. Conspecific litter was collected, cleaned and dried for two days at room temperature and for 24 hours at 40°C to constant weight. This way we ensured that chemicals potentially affecting germination were not changed. For heterospecific grass litter, we used dried plant material from a grassland mainly consisting of sweet grass (Poaceae) species.
