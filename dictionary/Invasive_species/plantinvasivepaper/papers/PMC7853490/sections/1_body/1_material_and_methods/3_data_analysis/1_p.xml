<p>We tested for differences in number of emerged seedlings and measurements of seedling growth represented by: total biomass per pot and per plant, plant height, leaf number and specific leaf area. We used a three-factorial ANOVA to analyze the effect of litter type, litter amount and soil type, and their interactions. Residuals were examined visually to assess validity of assumptions for analysis of variance, i.e. normal distribution and variance homogeneity. Data for biomass per pot and biomass per plant had to be ln transformed to meet assumptions of analysis of variance. Subsequent to significant ANOVA results, post-hoc Tukey-HSD test was employed to test for individual differences. In addition, we used contrasts to specifically test whether the effect of mixed litter on response variables was mid-way between that of grass and ragwort alone (additive effect of pure type litters in the mixture). Since specific effects of the different litter types on seedling emergence and growth of ragwort, rather than general litter effects, were the focus in our study, we did not include the controls in our model but included them for visual comparison in the figures. In addition, we analyzed the controls for soil effects as well as for differences to the litter types across litter amount using contrasts. As a measure for the relative contribution of each factor and their interactions to the total variability of the response parameters of interest, we used the ratio of the sum of squares of the factor or interaction of interest to the total sum of squares (i.e. for all factors, their interactions and error). All analyses were done using R version 3.6.1 [
