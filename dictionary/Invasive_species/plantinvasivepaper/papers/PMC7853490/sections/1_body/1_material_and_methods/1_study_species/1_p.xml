 <italic>Senecio jacobaea</italic> Gaertn. or common ragwort is an herbaceous monocarpic plant from the Asteraceae family [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is a hemicryptophyte, forming a rosette in the first year and flowering in the second year [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It prefers open patches and disturbed sites. Thus, it occurs on ruderal sites, along roadsides, pastures and grassland ecosystems in most temperate regions of the world. It is often regarded as a noxious weed due to its content of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ragwort shows ecological characteristics of a pioneer species, in particular its numerous light seeds and fast growth enable ragwort to spread rapidly in open areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Each plant produces several thousand seeds per year [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Seeds are mainly dispersed by wind over a distance of usually less than 15 m [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Seed survival (up to 20 years) and germination rates (about 80%) are high [
