<p>Germination started in mid May 2016. Seedlings that emerged above the litter cover were counted weekly until the tenth week after the experiment started. After the tenth week, we counted the total number of leaves per plant and measured the height of the tallest plant in the pot. We determined specific leaf area for five pots per combination by cutting the youngest fully developed leaves of three plants. These were scanned and leaf area in mm² measured by the programme IMAGEJ [
