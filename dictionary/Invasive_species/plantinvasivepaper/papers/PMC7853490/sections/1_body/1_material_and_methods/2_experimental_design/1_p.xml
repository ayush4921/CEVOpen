<p>We studied the effects of 
 <italic>litter amount</italic> (200 (low) vs. 400 (high) g/m
 <sup>2</sup>), 
 <italic>litter type</italic> (ragwort litter, grass litter, 1:1 mix of ragwort and grass litter) and 
 <italic>conditioned soil</italic> (soil conditioned with ragwort vs. unconditioned soil that is soil not conditioned by ragwort) on seedling emergence and growth. The litter amounts applied corresponded to the range of average productivity of extensively managed grasslands in Northern Germany [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Loydi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found positive litter effects to occur at these litter amounts. Thus, the litter amounts applied represent litter quantities that ragwort seeds are exposed to naturally and that seem to affect germination.
