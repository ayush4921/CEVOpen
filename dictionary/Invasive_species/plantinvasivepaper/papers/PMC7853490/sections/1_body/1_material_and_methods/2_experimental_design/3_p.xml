<p>We set up a completely randomized experimental design. We prepared pots of 1 dm
 <sup>3</sup> volume (c. 10 × 10 × 10 cm) for each litter amount × litter type × soil conditioned (12 combinations) replicated eight times. To assess for seedlings emerging from the soil taken from ragwort stands we additionally included 20 extra-control pots, ten with ragwort conditioned soil and ten filled with unconditioned soil. In none of these extra control-pots ragwort seedlings emerged. Half of all the pots were filled with a 6:1 mixture of commercial potting soil (Fruhstorfer Erde®, Type P, Industrie-Erdenwerke Archut GmbH, Germany) and ragwort-conditioned soil or unconditioned soil, respectively. We followed the protocol of van de Voorde et al. [
