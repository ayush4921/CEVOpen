<p>In late April 2016, we sowed 50 seeds in each experimental pot and added litter on top of it. Pots were placed randomly in a common garden in Kiel, Germany (54.346883, 10.106829), surrounded by another row of pots (to reduce desiccation) and protected by a light metal grid (mesh size 7 cm x 7cm) to avoid litter being blown away. Pots were kept constantly moist by regular watering.</p>
