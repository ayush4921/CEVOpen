<p>The mean leaf number of plants growing in ragwort litter was highest compared to in plants growing in grass litter and the combination of both litter types (ragwort 3.59 ± 0.12, grass 3.15 ± 0.05, mixture 3.31 ± 0.08). Analyses of variance revealed that mean leaf number was significantly affected by litter type and amount but not their interaction (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The variance explained by litter amount was twice as high as that explained by litter type (
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, mean leaf number is the only measured variable that seems to be stronger influenced from litter amount than litter type. Effects of litter type were additive, i.e. the leaf number in the litter mixture did not differ significantly from the expected mean effect of pure grass and ragwort litter (p = 0.49, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Plants growing in high litter amounts (400 g/m²) had significantly more leaves per plant than plants growing in the low litter amounts (200 g/m²). Contrast analyses revealed no significant difference in leaf number between the plants growing in the control and in any of the three litter types (p &gt; 0.05).
