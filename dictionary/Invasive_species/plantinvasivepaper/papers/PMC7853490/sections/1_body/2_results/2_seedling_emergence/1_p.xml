<p>We found that less seedlings emerged in ragwort litter compared to grass litter. Number of emerged seedlings differed significantly between all three litter types (

In addition, contrast analyses of the control against litter types revealed that the litter mixture had no significant effect on seedling number compared to the control (p = 0.30), while in the control seedling number differed significantly from grass and ragwort litter (p = 0.016 and p ≤ 0.0001, respectively). From beneath grass litter, about 50% more seedlings emerged compared to ragwort litter (18.1 ± 1.0 vs. 27.6 ± 0.8), while emergence from beneath mixed litter was intermediate (22.8 ± 0.8), roughly 25% greater than in pure ragwort (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Litter effects were additive, i.e. the effect size of mixed grass-ragwort litter did not deviate significantly from the expected mean effect of pure grass and ragwort litter (p = 0.99).
