<p>Across litter amounts seedlings in ragwort litter had twice the biomass per pot as those grown in grass litter (1.1 ± 0.1 g vs. 0.4 ± 0.1 g) (

Interestingly, seedling biomass per pot in the litter mixture (0.9 ± 0.1 g) lay between that of seedlings growing in pure grass or ragwort litter but in contrast to seedling emergence, the litter type effects were not additive, i.e. seedling biomass per pot in the mixed litter treatment lay significantly above the mean of seedling biomass in grass and ragwort litter (p = 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Across litter types, biomass per plant and per pot increased with increasing litter amount applied (0.56 ± 0.03 g in low litter vs. 1.00 ± 0.08 g in high litter). Contrast analyses of the control against the three litter types revealed no significant difference of biomass per pot between the control and grass litter (p = 0.40) but significant differences in biomass between control and litter mixture as well as ragwort litter (both p ≤ 0.0001). Seedling biomass per plant showed almost the same response patterns but the litter effect was additive (p = 0.88;
