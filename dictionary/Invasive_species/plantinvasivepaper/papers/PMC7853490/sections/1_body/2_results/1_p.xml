<p>In general, our results showed significant main effects of litter type and litter amount on all response variables: seedling number, biomass per plant and pot, plant height and mean leaf number. In contrast, the soil factor (conditioned vs. unconditioned) was not significant for any response variables under the litter treatments. Only the case of the separate analysis of controls (seeds added but no litter) soil revealed a significant effect on plant height. Our analyses revealed two significant interactions between main factors. In the case of biomass per plant and pot and seedling height we found a significant two-way 
 <italic>litter type Ã— litter amount</italic> interaction. Effects of the treatments on specific leaf area were not significant (results not shown).
