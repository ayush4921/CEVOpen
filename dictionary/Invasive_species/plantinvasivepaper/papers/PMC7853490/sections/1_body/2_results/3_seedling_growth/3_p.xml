<p>Seedlings grew tallest in high amounts of ragwort litter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Across amounts seedlings in ragwort litter grew almost three times as tall as in grass litter (8.1 ± 2.8 cm vs. 2.8 ± 0.9 cm) and about one third taller compared to the litter mixture (6.5 ± 0.3 cm). Litter type influenced plant height significantly, as did litter amount and the interaction of these factors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g003">Fig 3</xref>). More than half of the variance was explained by litter type (
 <xref rid="pone.0246459.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Again, litter type effects were not additive, i.e. seedling height per pot in the mixed litter treatment lay significantly above the mean of seedling height in grass and ragwort litter (p = 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246459.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Contrast analyses of the control against the three litter types revealed no significant difference of height between the control and grass litter (p = 0.39) but significant differences between control and litter mixture as well as ragwort litter (both p ≤ 0.0001).
