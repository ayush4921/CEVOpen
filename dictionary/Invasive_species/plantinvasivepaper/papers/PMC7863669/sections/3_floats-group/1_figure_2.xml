 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of planted and naturally grown 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in the habitats alder forest and meadow. With generalized‐linear models, it was tested whether total dry biomass, cover, individual plant dry biomass, and stem length of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> depended on treatment and habitat. Study site was used as random factor (lmer or glmer) unless its variance was estimated zero, thus no random factor was used (glm). For total biomass and individual plant biomass, a gamma error distribution was applied. Resulting 
   <italic>p</italic>‐values are given and total sample sizes indicated at the bottom line in the graphs. Individual plant biomass and stem length 
   <italic>N</italic> = 8 plants per plot
