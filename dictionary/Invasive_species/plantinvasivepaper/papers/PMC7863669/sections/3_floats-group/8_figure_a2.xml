 <caption>
  <p>Total biomass per 1 m
   <sup>2</sup> of the most frequent resident species in the control treatments (a) and impact intensity of 
   <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> planting and removal (b). With a Mann‐Whitney‐
   <italic>U</italic> test, it was tested whether the shown parameters differed between control plots invaded and uninvaded by 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (
   <italic>p</italic>‐values given). Impact intensity of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulation on each parameter is expressed by relative interaction index (RII) among manipulation and appropriate control per pair of plots. RII of −1 shows most negative impact, 0 no impact, and + 1 most positive impact. For planting and removal separately, it was tested with a one‐sample Wilcoxon test whether RII differs from zero (result indicated by asterics). Sample sizes are given at the bottom of the graphs. Only pairs of plots are considered in which the respective species occurred in both plots
