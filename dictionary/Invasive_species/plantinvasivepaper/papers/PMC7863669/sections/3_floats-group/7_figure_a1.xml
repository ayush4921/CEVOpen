  <p>Correlation between total dry biomass and cover of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. Habitat and whether 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was planted or grew naturally is indicated by point color and shape. To avoid overplotting of points, 2.5% random noise was added to 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> cover. Pooling both habitats and treatments, Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.726, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Biomass was harvested from the central 1 m
   <sup>2</sup> per plot and given as dry weight, while cover was estimated according Braun‐Blanquet scale within the total 2.25 m
   <sup>2</sup> plot
