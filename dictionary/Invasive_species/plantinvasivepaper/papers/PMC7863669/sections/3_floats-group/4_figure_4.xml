  <p>Ordination analysis of the resident species composition and abundance showing differences between invaded and uninvaded controls, respectively, and effect of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting and removal. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed based on Bray‐Curtis dissimilarity index of plant dry biomass, dimensions 3, stress 0.136, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 58 plots. Sites are indicated by points with arrows connecting a control treatment with its corresponding plot where 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was manipulated. Species are given as crosses, the most frequent ones were labeled with priority. Results of a PERMANOVA testing the differences are given in Table 
   <xref rid="ece37135-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For abbreviations of the species names see Table
