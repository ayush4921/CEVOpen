  <p>
   <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> in the control treatments (a) and impact intensity of 
   <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> planting and removal (b). With linear models, it was tested whether the shown parameters differed between control plots invaded and uninvaded by 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (
   <italic>p</italic>‐values given). Study site was used as random factor (lmer) unless its variance was estimated zero, thus no random factor was used (lm). Impact intensity of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulation on each parameter is expressed by relative interaction index (RII) among manipulation and appropriate control per pair of plots. RII of −1 shows most negative impact, 0 no impact, and + 1 most positive impact. For planting and removal separately, it was tested with a one‐sample Wilcoxon test whether RII differs from zero (result indicated by asterisks). Sample sizes are given at the bottom of the graphs. Only pairs of plots are considered in which 
   <italic>U. dioica</italic> occurred in both plots. Stem length, vegetative, and infructescence biomass of 
   <italic>U. dioica</italic> represent mean values of 6–8 plants per plot
