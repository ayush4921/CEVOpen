  <p>Study design. (a) Concept of selection of suitable plot positions along a grid laid over each study site. From the suitable positions, it was randomly chosen which positions were used to either conduct the planting or the removal trial there. (b) In total, there were four treatments: planting of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> within uninvaded plots and a paired uninvaded control, removal of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> from invaded plots and a paired invaded control. (c) Data collection within each plot: cover and vegetation height were gathered within the total 2.25 m
   <sup>2</sup> plot; total biomass was harvested within the central 1 m
   <sup>2</sup>; individual plants of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and 
   <italic>U. dioica</italic> were harvested within the total plot except a 10‐cm buffer margin, whereby those eight plants being nearest to the eight fixed points in the plot were sampled
