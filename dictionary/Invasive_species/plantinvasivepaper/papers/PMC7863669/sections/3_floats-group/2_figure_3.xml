 <caption>
  <p>Resident vegetation characteristics in the control treatments (a) and impact intensity of 
   <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> planting and removal (b) depending on the habitat. With linear mixed‐effect models using site as random factor, it was tested whether the shown parameters differed between control plots invaded and uninvaded by 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and between habitats (
   <italic>p</italic>‐values given). Impact intensity of 
   <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulation on each parameter is expressed by relative interaction index (RII) among manipulation and appropriate control per pair of plots. RII of −1 shows most negative impact, 0 no impact, and + 1 most positive impact. For planting and removal in both habitats separately, it was tested with a one‐sample Wilcoxon test whether RII differs from zero (result indicated by asterisks). Sample sizes are given at the bottom of the graphs
