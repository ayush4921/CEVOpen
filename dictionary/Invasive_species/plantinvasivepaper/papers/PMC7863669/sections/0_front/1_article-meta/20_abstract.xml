 <p>In invasion biology, causality of impact is often not obvious. By experimental removal and planting the plant invader 
  <italic>Impatiens glandulifera,</italic> we showed that it had a low but causal negative impact on native European vegetation in riparian meadows and alder forests. Thus, 
  <italic>I. glandulifara</italic> has some characteristics of a driver of ecosystem changes.
