<p>We found that the impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on native vegetation was causal but low. The response of the native vegetation to the 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulations was quite fast within one vegetation period, even if only some parameters were affected within the study duration. Also other field studies on 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> using a removal approach found effects on native vegetation within one season (Cockel et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>),⁠ whereas only in Hulme and Bremner (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), the effect was quite high. This means that invasion can have a negative impact after a short period of time, but also removal as management measure could have a fast effect. However, the impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> could also increase over time after invasion (Rusterholz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and longer lasting removal can also enhance a management effect (Cockel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Rusterholz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
