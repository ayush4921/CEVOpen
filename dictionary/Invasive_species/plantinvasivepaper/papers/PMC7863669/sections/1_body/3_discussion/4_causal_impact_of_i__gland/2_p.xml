<p>We found a consistent effect of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulations on native vegetation in alder forests and meadows: In both habitats, 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> caused a reduction of total resident biomass but had no causal impact on species composition, α‐diversity, and vegetation height. According to a linear model, RII on total biomass did not differ between the two habitats, alder forests and meadows. However, there was a small difference between habitats, as the RII on total biomass was significantly different from zero in alder forests but not in meadows in the 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting trial. This indicates a higher impact in elder forests, where both, the biomass of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and the resident vegetation was lower than in meadows. In contrast, in our previous study within the same study sites, we found negative correlations between cover of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and cover of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic>, 
 <italic>F. ulmaria</italic> and total cover, which were stronger under bright conditions with higher 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> cover than under dark site conditions (Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Comparing invaded and uninvaded sites, also Diekmann et al., (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) suggested a higher impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in open than in more shady habitats. Thus, the correlative impact seems to be stronger habitat‐dependent than the short‐time causal impact and more pronounced in bright habitats.
