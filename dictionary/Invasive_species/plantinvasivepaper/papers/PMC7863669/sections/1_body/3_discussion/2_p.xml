<p>In this field study, we experimentally removed 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> from invaded plots, and planted 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in formerly uninvaded plots in order to test whether 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> has a negative impact on the native vegetation in riparian meadows and alder forests, and whether the impact is causal or not. We found that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> had a causal impact indicated by a negative effect of planting and a positive effect of removal of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on total resident biomass and individual plant growth of 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> but not on α‐diversity, species composition, vegetation height, and total biomass of the most frequent co‐occurring species. Impact of the manipulations depended only slightly on the habitat.
