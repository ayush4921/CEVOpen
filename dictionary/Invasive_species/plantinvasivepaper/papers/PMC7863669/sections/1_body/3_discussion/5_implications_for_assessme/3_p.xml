<p>We suggest that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is not a clear driver of changes, but it has some characteristics of a back‐seat driver benefiting from previous changes such as disturbances or changed land use. This is relevant for nature conservation because drivers and back‐seat drivers require a different management strategy. In the case of a driver, removal of the invader, which induced the changes, is ideally sufficient (Bauer, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In contrast, in the case of a back‐seat driver, habitat restoration is necessary in addition to removal of the invader (Bauer, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Thus, management of a back‐seat driver is more complicated because the previous changes that facilitated invasion have to be known and countered. Such previous changes can be all kinds of alterations of ecosystem properties such as land use change, pollution, nutrient input, or altered disturbance regimes (Bauer, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Didham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Unfortunately, there is often no reliable information on the original community and ecosystem processes available (Parker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Special cases are natural disturbances and intentional anthropogenic ecosystem changes. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are common in riparian habitats and can generally favor invasions (Richardson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Intentional ecosystem changes such as tree cutting or habitat restoration are sometimes associated with 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> invasion (for forests: Čuda et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), river restoration: Lapin et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>)). In this case, it can be recommended to prevent the potential invasion of a back‐seat driver while planning and conducting the disturbance (D’Antonio &amp; Meyerson, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Lapin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>)⁠. It is also possible that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> invasions are favored by anthropogenic nutrient input as 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> has an affinity to nutrient‐rich patches (Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Čuda et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>)⁠. Thus, reducing the nutrient input into water bodies as a general aim of nature conservation may also reduce invasion of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. In the case of already established populations of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera,</italic> it can be discussed if a management is reasonable, considering the rather low impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in combination with its high abundance and frequency in Central Europe. Since a population control can be very expensive (Leblanc &amp; Lavoie, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), it should be reserved for sites which are particularly valuable in terms of nature conservation.
