<p>If 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is not a strict driver of changes, it could be a back‐seat driver, whose invasion is favored by previous ecosystem changes until it becomes a driver of further changes itself (Bauer, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Affinity of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> to habitats with natural and anthropogenic disturbances and changed land use (Ammer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Beerling &amp; Perrins,

 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>) also indicates characteristics of a back‐seat driver. However, to clearly distinguish a back‐seat driver from a driver is not possible with the present study. To this end, it would be necessary to test whether removal of the invader would result in recovery of the initial state of an ecosystem only in combination with habitat restoration (Bauer, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
