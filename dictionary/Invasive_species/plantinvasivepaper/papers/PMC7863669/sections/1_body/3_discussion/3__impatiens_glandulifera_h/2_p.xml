<p>Removal of 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> had a positive and planting a negative effect on total resident plant biomass and growth of 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> individual plants. This indicates that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is a driver of ecosystem changes having a causal negative impact on the resident vegetation. A causal impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on native vegetation is also indicated by Hejda and Pyšek (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), Hulme and Bremner (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), and Cockel et al., (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) who all found positive, but often only slight effects of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> removal on riparian plant species diversity and composition, which were, however, not affected in the present study. A causal impact on 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> plants as found in the present study is underpinned by experimental studies on competitive and allelopathic interactions of both species (Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Gruntman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Tickner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>)⁠. However, the impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> competing in a pot experiment was much stronger (relative interaction index RII about −0.7, in Gruntman et al., (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>)⁠ and Bieberich et al., (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>)) than under the field conditions in the present study (median RII planting −0.09). Taken together the impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> can be rated as low. Total resident biomass and individual plant growth of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> were affected by planting and removal indeed, but only to a small extend, and α‐diversity, species composition, vegetation height, and total biomass of the most frequent co‐occurring species were not affected by the manipulations at all.
