 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> originating from the Himalaya mountains is a very common invasive species in Central Europe. Rapid spread and population growth of this annual species are enabled by a large number of seeds and their effective dispersal. Seeds are catapulted over several meters due to an explosion mechanism of the capsule and subsequently often transported by water flows (Beerling &amp; Perrins, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> invaded various wet habitats such as mesotrophic grass‐ and woodlands but increasingly also forests and ruderal sites outside of the riparian zone (Beerling &amp; Perrins, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Čuda et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Čuda et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Pyšek &amp; Prach, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is capable of suppressing native plants because of a high competitive effect along with a vigorous growth and the release of allelopathic substances such as 2‐methoxy‐1,4‐naphthoquinone as shown in experimental studies (Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Gruntman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Loydi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Power &amp; Sánchez Vilas, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Ruckli et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Vrchotová et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Another factor benefiting 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is, for example, release from natural enemies such as insect herbivores and parasitic rust fungi (Tanner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Under field conditions, it can form dominant stands with a height of up to three meters (Beerling &amp; Perrins, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Nonetheless, the impact of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on native plant communities is rated ambiguously, and it is not clear whether the impact is causal, thus 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> being a driver of ecosystem changes. Comparing invaded and uninvaded sites Hejda and Pyšek (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), Hejda et al., (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), and Diekmann et al., (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) found only weak, but Kiełtyk and Delimat (
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) found strong differences of plant diversity and composition. From a previous study, we know that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and native vegetation cover correlated negatively, and the correlation depended on environmental conditions at a particular site (Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>)⁠. However, with these observational approaches, causality of impact is difficult to address (Hejda &amp; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Kumschick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Stricker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Some studies—also with ambiguous results—experimentally removed the invader 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (Cockel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Čuda et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Hejda &amp; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Hulme &amp; Bremner, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>)⁠. Such removal experiments can help to identify whether an effect is causal (Kumschick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; MacDougall &amp; Turkington, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>)⁠. If the invader is a driver of changes, removal should rescue the state prior to invasion. However, also removal experiments have some drawbacks (Hulme &amp; Bremner, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Kumschick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Stricker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>)⁠. Response of the native community could also be caused by the disturbance of the treatment itself. Removal of any other, even native, species could have the same effect, for example, because this may lead to higher resource availability. The process of native community recovery could also take longer time than the study, and thus effects may not become visible yet, especially if there are legacy effects of the invasion. An effective method to study causal effects is to add the invader to the native community (Stricker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>)⁠. However, this is rarely implemented under field conditions because then, a careful handling of the invader is required.
