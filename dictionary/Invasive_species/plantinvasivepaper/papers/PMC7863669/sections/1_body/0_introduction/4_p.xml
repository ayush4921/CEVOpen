<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> has a causal negative impact on the native vegetation and whether this impact depends on the habitat. Due to its uneven distribution within one field site, 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> can be transplanted from an invaded patch into an uninvaded patch, without introducing the species to a new site. To disentangle cause and effect of invasion, we combined the classical approaches to compare invaded and uninvaded patches, and to remove 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> from invaded patches, with transplanting 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> into uninvaded patches. Thus, the transplanting represents a control for removal and vice versa. To test for habitat‐dependence, we replicated this experimental approach in two different riverside habitat types, alder forests and meadows. We expect that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> has a negative impact on the native vegetation, specifically on α‐diversity, biomass and species composition of the resident vegetation, and on individual plant growth of resident species. For the latter, 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> was chosen as target species because it is one of the most frequent native co‐occurring species of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in both habitats. Because of the high competitive and allelopathic effect of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on neighboring plants, especially native plant growth should be affected even within a short time leading to changed species abundances and plant performance at the spatial scale of the experimental plots. If 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is a driver of changes having a causal impact, (a) removal of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is expected to have a positive (recovery) effect on the native vegetation, and (b) planting 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> into formerly uninvaded plots should have a negative impact on the native vegetation. Additionally, (c) establishment of planted 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and impact of planting and removal are expected to depend on the habitat because plant growth and species interactions are shaped by environmental conditions. If 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> has no causal impact on the resident vegetation, its removal should have no recovery effect, and its planting should have no negative impact on the resident vegetation. The native vegetation could still differ between invaded and uninvaded patches if 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> has no causal impact but is only a passenger of changes.
