 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> grew significantly better in uninvaded than in invaded control plots regarding total biomass, cover, individual stem length, and individual vegetative biomass (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> total biomass was not changed by 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulations while cover was slightly, but not significantly, decreased by 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting and increased by removal (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Individual plants of 
 <italic>U. dioica,</italic> however, were affected by the manipulations regarding all considered parameters (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Impact intensity on stem length was low but significant for planting. Impact on individual plant biomass of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> was slightly higher. Median RII through planting was −0.11 with a maximum decrease from 6.2 to 2.6 g (RII −0.41), median RII through removal was 0.23 with a maximum increase from 1.2 to 4.8 g (RII 0.59). Impact intensity on infructescence biomass was very high but only significant in the removal trial (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).
