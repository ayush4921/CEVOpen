<p>Besides 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic>, the most frequent resident species were 
 <italic>Galium aparine</italic>, 
 <italic>Filipendula ulmaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Stellaria nemorum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phalaris arundinacea</italic>. Total biomass of 
 <italic>P. arundinacea</italic> was higher in invaded plots, but total biomass of the other species was independent of invaded or uninvaded situations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">A2a</xref>). RII of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting and removal on each of those frequent species was highly variable and never significantly different from zero (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">A2b</xref>). However, median total biomass of 
 <italic>G. aparine</italic> decreased by planting and median total biomass of 
 <italic>F. ulmaria</italic>, 
 <italic>G. aparine</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. nemorum</italic> increased by removal.
