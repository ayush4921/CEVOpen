<p>In total 71 resident species were recorded (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37135-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">A1</xref>). Besides 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Lamium argentatum</italic> occurring in two pairs of plots was the only alien plant species. In the control treatments, resident species number ranged from 2 to 16 per 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> and did not differ between invaded and uninvaded plots and between habitats, and likewise the Shannon index did not differ (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Total biomass and height of the resident vegetation in contrast were significantly higher in uninvaded plots than in invaded ones, biomass by about 124 g and vegetation height by almost 50 cm. Both were lower in alder forests than in meadows. However, for vegetation height, this difference was not significant because of a high variation between study sites (mixed‐effect model). Species composition and abundance differed between invaded and uninvaded plots and also between habitats (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37135-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>Galeopsis tetrahit</italic> and 
 <italic>Cardamine amara</italic> tend to have more biomass in invaded control plots, while for 
 <italic>Carex acutiformis</italic>, 
 <italic>Aegopodium podagraria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chaerophyllum hirsutum</italic> this is the case in uninvaded ones. 
 <italic>Cirsium oleraceum</italic>, 
 <italic>Ajuga reptans</italic> and 
 <italic>Carex brizoides</italic> only occurred in uninvaded control plots. Comparing habitats regarding their species composition 
 <italic>Geranium palustre</italic>, 
 <italic>Carex acutiformis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia,</italic> for example, were specific to meadows, while 
 <italic>Circaea lutetiana</italic>, 
 <italic>Dryopteris carthusiana</italic>, 
 <italic>Chrysosplenium oppositifolium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ch. alternifolium</italic> to forests. The common species 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic>, 
 <italic>Galium aparine</italic>, 
 <italic>Filipendula ulmaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Phalaris arundinacea</italic>, 
 <italic>Stellaria nemorum</italic>, 
 <italic>Agrostis caninus</italic>, 
 <italic>Galeopsis tetrahit</italic>, 
 <italic>Aegopodium podagraria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chaerophyllum hirsutum</italic> occurred consistently across both habitats although biomass could vary.
