<p>A causal negative impact tested by planting or removal of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> on resident vegetation characteristics was only indicated for total biomass of the resident vegetation and the impact intensity did not depend on habitat (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece37135-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). On average, 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting decreased total resident biomass by 20 g (RII −0.08), and removal increased it by 17 g (RII + 0.08). At maximum, planting resulted in a decrease of total resident biomass from 189 to 118 g (RII −0.23) and removal of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in an increase from 95 to 203 g (RII 0.36). Pooling both habitats, RII of planting and removal on total resident biomass was different from zero (planting 
 <italic>p</italic> = .016 and removal 
 <italic>p</italic> = .033, one‐sample Wilcoxon test). Differing between habitats, median RII of planting on total resident biomass was negative and removal positive in both habitats, but only planting within alder forests showed a RII significantly different from zero (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Species composition was neither changed by 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting nor by removal, and this did not depend on habitat (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37135-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
