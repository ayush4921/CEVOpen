<p>In the uninvaded control as in the removal treatment 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> remained mostly absent or occurred at very low abundances only (
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> dry biomass median 0.00 g, max. 0.87 g, cover less than 5%). On average 47 of the 63 planted 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants, corresponding to 74%, established. However, survival was lower in alder forests than in meadows (51% versus 85%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .012, Wilcoxon‐test). The planted 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> added up to a biomass of 7–186 g per plot (median 75 g, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In natural occurrences in contrast, a higher 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> biomass was recorded (39–433 g, median 137 g, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Cover of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> ranged from 10% to 90% (Braun‐Blanquet classes 2a to 5) and correlated strongly with biomass (combining planted and natural occurrences, Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.797, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">A1</xref>). Planted 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants reached similar, but slightly smaller sizes as those naturally grown (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): with 0.1–61 g biomass (median 4.8 g) plants did not differ significantly in biomass but planted ones had shorter stems than the naturally grown ones (median 126 versus 153 cm). Abundance and plant growth of both, planted and naturally grown 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was lower in alder forests than in meadows (Figure
