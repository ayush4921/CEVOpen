<p>Effect of the 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulations on the resident vegetation was evaluated in autumn 2016. To study the effect on traits of individual plant growth, 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> was chosen as native target species because it was the only species that was sufficiently abundant in all sites and treatments. When 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> or 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> occurred in a plot, their cover was estimated within the total plot on 2016–08‐19/25 according to extended Braun‐Blanquet scale which was afterward converted into the numerical values 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 8.8, 20.5, 37.5, 62.5, 87.5 percent cover (Braun‐Blanquet,

 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">1973</xref>)⁠. Data on vegetation height and biomass were collected on 2016–08‐30/10‐04. Maximum vegetation height of the resident vegetation was recorded with a folding ruler as mean height of the five highest plants in the plot, regardless of plant species. In one pair of plots, the plants were not totally upright due to rainfall or wind, and thus we could not measure vegetation height. When occurring, eight individual plants each of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> were harvested per plot. The respective plants nearest to one of eight fixed points in the plot were chosen whereby the outermost 10 cm margin of the plot was ignored (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In some cases, there were only six or seven plants of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> in a plot, and accordingly sample size decreased. Of each sampled plant, stem length was measured with a folding ruler and dry weight of the vegetative plant parts and the infructescence were measured separately. Within the central 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> of each plot, all vascular plants were harvested and the biomass sorted by species. Species were determined using standard literature (Eggenberg &amp; Möhl,

To measure dry weight, all plant material was dried at 90°C for 2 days and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g (weighing scale Mettler PM 4,600). Thus, all biomass data, hereafter, are given as dry mass.
