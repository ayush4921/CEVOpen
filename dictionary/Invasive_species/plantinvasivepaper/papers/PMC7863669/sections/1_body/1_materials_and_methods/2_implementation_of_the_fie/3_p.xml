<p>To choose positions for the plots, a grid of 20 m × 20 m was laid over each study site (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), ten meters shifted to the grid of our previous study (Bieberich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>)⁠. In March to April 2016, all grid intersection points were checked for suitability to conduct either removal or planting of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> there (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Suitability was predefined as an area of 2 m × 4 m homogeneous herbaceous vegetation, in spring either invaded by 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> with 5%–40% cover for the removal trial or uninvaded with a maximum of five 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants for the planting trial. Additionally, suitable positions in alder forests had to have a more or less closed canopy and positions in meadows had to be not covered by trees as far as possible. Out of all suitable positions, four positions per study site and trial (planting, removal) were randomly chosen for usage. On each chosen position, a pair of 1.5 m × 1.5 m plots was established with a gap of 0.5 m between the single plots. One randomly chosen plot of the pair was left unchanged either as an invaded control or an uninvaded control, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37135-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Within the second plot of the pair, occurrence of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was manipulated in May (2016–05‐09/27). For the removal treatment, all 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants were removed. Plots were checked and, if necessary, removal repeated every other week for the first 2 months and then at larger intervals since only few 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants emerged. Initially removed 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> had a stem length of 21 ± 12 cm mean ± 
 <italic>SD</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 65 with five plants randomly chosen and measured per plot) and in total 6–87 g dry biomass of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was removed per plot (mean 26 g, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 plots). For the planting treatment, 63 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants, corresponding to about 5%–10% cover in spring, were transplanted into each plot with always 20 cm distance between individual plants (mean stem length 19 ± 5 cm, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 65 with five plants randomly chosen and measured per plot). Transplanted individuals were always collected and transplanted within the same study site. After about 10 days, we checked whether the transplanted individuals had grown and replaced failed individuals once. We wanted to achieve that the uninvaded plots and plots where 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was removed were free of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> over summer, while naturally growing and planted 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> developed 15%–75% cover. This moderate cover of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was aimed for because a very high cover of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in the removal trial could make the measurement of a recovery effect difficult. For a recovery effect in particular, a certain amount of native vegetation is required. During summer, in total three pairs of plots belonging to the removal trial were destroyed by fallen trees and wild boars in three different study sites. This resulted in 
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 for the removal trial and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 16 pairs of plots for the planting trial.
