<p>All statistical analyses were done with the software package R 4.2.0 (2020–06–22), R Studio 1.3.959. In addition to the core packages, lme4 (Bates et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), vegan (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), car (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), and broom (Robinson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>)⁠ were used for statistical analyses, plyr (Wickham, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), dplyr (Wickham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>),⁠ and reshape2 (Wickham, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>)⁠ for data handling, ggplot2 (Wickham, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), cowplot (Wilke, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>),⁠ and RColorBrewer (Neuwirth, 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>)⁠ for visualization. Linear models were used to test whether total biomass, cover, individual plant biomass, and stem length of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> depended on whether 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was planted or grew naturally and whether in the habitat meadow or alder forest. In the case of individual plant biomass and stem length (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 per plot) plot was applied as random factor. Species number, Shannon index, total biomass, and vegetation height of the resident vegetation (all species except 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>) were compared between invaded and uninvaded control treatments and between habitats using linear models. Likewise, total biomass, cover, stem length, vegetative biomass, and infructescence biomass of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> were compared between invaded and uninvaded control situations with linear models, and additionally total biomass of the most frequent native species with Mann‐Whitney‐
 <italic>U</italic> tests. However, habitat‐dependency could not be tested with these parameters because sample size per habitat was too low. In the case of individual plant growth of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> mean values per plot were used making the use of plot as random factor unnecessary. For all linear models, either pair of plots or study site was applied as random factor whenever possible. In some cases, it was not possible to use the random factor because its variance was estimated zero. Use of error distribution family was decided per parameter based on visual inspection of the model residuals, resulting in generalized linear models where necessary.
