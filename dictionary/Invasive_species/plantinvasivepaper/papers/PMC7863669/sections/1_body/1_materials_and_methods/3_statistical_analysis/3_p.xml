<p>To quantify impact intensity of manipulation of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> within each pair of plots, the relative interaction index RII was calculated (Armas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Gruntman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) comparing manipulation and control, according to the equation (manipulation ‐ control)/(manipulation + control). RII is bound to the range from −1, to + 1, is symmetrical around zero (no effect), and the algebraic sign shows whether the effect of the manipulation is negative or positive. Because of these properties, RII enables further analysis with classical statistical methods (Armas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37135-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>)⁠. Planting of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is expected to have a negative impact on the resident vegetation, indicated by a negative RII, while removal of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is expected to have a positive effect, indicated by a positive RII. RII was applied for the above‐mentioned parameters of the resident vegetation and of 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> and the biomass of the most frequent species. For 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> individual plant biomass and stem length, RII was calculated with the mean values of 6–8 plants per plot. For each parameter, it was tested whether impact intensity RII of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> planting and removal in the two habitats differs from zero using a one‐sample Wilcoxon test. Additionally, we used linear models to test whether the RII of species number, Shannon index, total biomass and vegetation height depended on the trials (planting and removal of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>), the habitats (meadow and alder forest), and their interaction term.
