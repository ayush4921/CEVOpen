<p>To analyze whether plant species composition and abundance differ between the natural control situations (uninvaded or invaded) and whether 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> manipulations (removal or planting) have an effect on them, multivariate analyses were performed with biomass data of all species. For visualization, a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed based on Bray‐Curtis dissimilarity index (max. 80 numbers of random starts, 3 dimensions, package vegan). Differences between treatments, habitats, and their interaction were tested with PERMANOVA analyses also based on Bray‐Curtis dissimilarities (command adonis of package vegan). Study sites were given as groups within which permutations were constrained.
