  <title>Data on individual small mammals.</title>
  <p>Data include their field ID, the season, site, habitat type, species, geographic coordinates, sex (F = female, M = Male), the positive or negative status for Leptospira based on RT-PCR, whether the species was native (N) or introduced (I), and site-level data on the species richness, rarified species richness, and Shannon diversity index. For geographic coordinates at the village site, the animals were captured within individual homes, and the coordinates are low resolution and generalized for the village to protect the identity of participants, according to human ethics protocols.</p>
