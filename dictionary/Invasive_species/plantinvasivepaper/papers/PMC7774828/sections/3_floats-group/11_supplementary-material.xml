  <title>Results of prevalence analysis using the phylogenetically-informed analysis.</title>
  <p>Analyses were implemented in MCMCglmm. The lambda value, or ‘phylogenetic signal,’ had a posterior mode of 0.47 (95% highest posterior density = 0.28–0.71). Posterior mean effect refers to the mean coefficient estimate from the posterior distribution of samples from the MCMC algorithm, with 5X10^6 generations, omitting the first 1000 as burn-in and sampling every 500 generations. The low and high 95% CI values are confidence intervals from the posterior distribution. ESS = effective sample size, values &gt;200 demonstrate ample sampling of the posterior distribution. p is the probability of the variable having no effect on the dependent variable based on the posterior sample from the MCMC.</p>
