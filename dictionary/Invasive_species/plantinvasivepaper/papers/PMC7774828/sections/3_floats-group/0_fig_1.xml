  <title>Map of study sites in northeast Madagascar.</title>
  <p>The locations of the eight trapping sites are overlaid on a map of the percent forest cover as of 2010, as well as deforestation between 2001 and 2018 (30m resolution, Source: Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA [
   <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). The border of the Marojejy National Park is shown. The habitats at trap sites are as follows: 1–2 = forest, 3–4 = fragments, 5–6 = flooded rice fields, 7 = swidden agriculture, 8 = Mandena village. The inset map indicates with a circle the general position of the study site in northeastern Madagascar.
