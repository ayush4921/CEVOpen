<p>To investigate the factors that predicted the probability of infection with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> at the individual-level, we conducted logistic regressions to predict infection status based on the habitat type, whether the individual was an introduced or native species, diet and locomotor guilds, abundance, the proportion of individuals captured in the plot that were introduced species, and the sex. We included latitude as a means to capture the gradient from the forest in the north of the study site through the agricultural lands to the village in the south (
