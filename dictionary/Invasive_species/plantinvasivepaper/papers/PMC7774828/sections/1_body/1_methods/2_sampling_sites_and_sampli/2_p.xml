<p>We sampled small mammals from eight plots of land representing five habitat types: swidden hillside agriculture for rice and cassava (n = 1 plot), lowland flooded rice fields (n = 2, with varying amounts of mixed crops), secondary forest fragments (n = 2), the forest interior within the park (n = 2), and in homes in the village (n = 1 village, 41 households, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008946.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Given that 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> is typically water-borne, variation in water sources at these sites likely played a role in transmission. The lowland flooded rice fields had the most standing water and the closest streams and canals, but the fields were not always flooded during sampling, and were more often sampled soon after being drained and rice was harvested. The forest sites had small streams within 100m of the trapping grids, while forest fragments were situated on hills and slopes above streams or a river within 100m. The swidden plot was a dry sloping hillside after rice had been harvested and there were also mixed plantations of cassava, with lowland rice fields below. Within the village, the closest water source is the Manantenina river, which is ~50-400m from the households.
