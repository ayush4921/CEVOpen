<p>All tissue samples were immediately placed in 75% ethanol in the field, shipped to the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement lab facilities on La Réunion (France), and stored at -20°C. Kidney samples were rehydrated overnight and 20 mg of tissue was used for total nucleic acid (RNA/DNA) extraction using a Qiagen HT robot and Cador pathogen kits (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> detection was carried out through a probe-based real-time PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The leptospire load was quantified based on the cycle threshold (Ct) value from the real-time PCR, with Ct values ≤ 40.00 considered a positive sample [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Sequencing of 
 <italic>secY</italic> was attempted on all positive samples using standard primers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and with a set of primers optimized to amplify 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevailing in southwestern Indian ocean islands [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The 
 <italic>secY</italic> locus is among the most polymorphic marker within the published multilocus sequence typing schemes and hence suitable for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species identification and epidemiological studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Amplicons were sequenced on both strands (Genoscreen, Lille, France) and allele identification was carried out through the 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> PubMLST database (
