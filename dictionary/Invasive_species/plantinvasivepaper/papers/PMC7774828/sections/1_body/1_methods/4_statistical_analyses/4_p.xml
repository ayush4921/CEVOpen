<p>We compared the effects of different predictor variables on 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence and infection using model-comparison and model averaging. Specifically, we used the “dredge” function in the R package MuMIn [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] to compare the full model with all possible combinations of variables and assessed their support based on the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) for the likelihood-based approaches. The model coefficients were then averaged based on the Akaike weights to estimate the effects of each predictor.
