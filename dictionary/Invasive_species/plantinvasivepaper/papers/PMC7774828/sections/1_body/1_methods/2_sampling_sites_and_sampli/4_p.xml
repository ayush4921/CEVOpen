<p>Captured small mammals included introduced Muridae rodents and Soricidae shrews, as well as endemic rodents (subfamily Nesomyinae) and tenrecs (family Tenrecidae). Species could be broadly classified as primarily granivores or insectivores, and primarily terrestrial or both terrestrial and scansorial, based on published literature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Preliminary species identifications of all captured animals were made in hand, including a series of measurements. Between five and 10 captured individuals of each endemic species were euthanized and collected for voucher and tissue specimens. A subset of individuals of endemic species were released at the site of capture to avoid overharvesting rare species (e.g., 
 <italic>Eliurus</italic>, 
 <italic>Microgale</italic>). All introduced species (murids and soricids) were euthanized. Euthanasia was performed using cervical dislocation for most animals, but for the larger tenrecs (
 <italic>Setifer</italic> and 
 <italic>Tenrec</italic>), a lethal dose of xylazine was administered via intermuscular injection. For euthanized mammals, we collected kidneys, urine, and blood, with all material stored in 75% ethanol. All specimens were deposited in the Département de Biologie, Université d’Antananarivo (UADBA) collection after verification of species identification by VS and SMG.
