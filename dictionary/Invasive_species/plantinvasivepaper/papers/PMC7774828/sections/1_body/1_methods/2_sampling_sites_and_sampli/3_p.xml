<p>These plots were sampled during three field sessions, twice in the transitional period between wet and dry seasons (June-August 2017 and 2018), and once in the transitional period between dry and wet seasons (November-December 2017). It was not possible to sample all plots during each season due to logistical constraints. We sampled each site for 5–15 consecutive days using two methods of nonlethal traps simultaneously (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008946.s003">S2</xref> Tables). Sampling effort varied among sites in relation to the abundance of species at those sites. Species in forest sites had low abundance, which required more sampling to acquire sufficient sample sizes and reliably estimate species diversity. First, we established a 90 m X 90 m grid of 100 live traps, including 75 Sherman (H. B. Sherman Traps, Inc., Tallahassee, Florida, model LFA and XLK), 10 Tomahawk (Tomahawk Live Trap, Hazelhurst, Wisconsin, model 201), and 15 Havahart (Havahart, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, model 1079-B) at 10 m intervals set on the ground and baited with peanut butter and banana. Second, we set two pitfall lines within 15–20 m ground distance of the grid, each line being 100 m long, with 15 liter buckets every 10 m (11 pitfall traps per line), dug in the ground to rim level, and a 0.80 m high plastic sheet stapled to wooden stakes to create a vertical barrier fence that bisected each bucket. The total cumulative capture effort during the different field sessions was 11,035 trap-days for traps and 2,235 trap-days for pitfalls.
