<p>Despite the important role introduced species play in altering local community composition and disease transmission dynamics, parameters that are key to understanding the mechanisms of these dynamics are still poorly understood [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, introduced species have different effects on overall community diversity across systems, sometimes causing reduced diversity due to competitive exclusion, but often increasing diversity as well [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In light of the dilution and amplification effects, these changes in community diversity due to introduced species will have cascading effects on disease dynamics. If the introduced and native species are competent hosts, then the addition of introduced species and increase in diversity leads to a larger pool of potential hosts and is predicted to result in an amplification effect. In contrast, if native species are noncompetent hosts, then higher diversity should lead to a dilution effect. Although some studies have experimentally manipulated animal populations and measured the effect of such manipulations on pathogen prevalence [
