<p>We investigated the effects of anthropogenic land use in the native and introduced small mammal communities around a protected area in northeast Madagascar, where human subsistence activities and population growth are encroaching on the remaining moist evergreen forest in the area. Specifically, we collected data on 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> in wild mammals to determine the relationship between human land use, wildlife species diversity, and infection. Given the potential for small mammals to vary in their importance as reservoirs of infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we hypothesized that human activities influence 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence via changes in small mammal diversity and abundanceâ€“and especially variation in the presence of introduced rodents (family Muridae) and shrews (family Soricidae). We tested the hypothesis that 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence was related to small mammal diversity; a positive association between prevalence and higher species diversity would be consistent with an amplification effect, while a negative association would be consistent with a dilution effect [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We also investigated whether prevalence was positively related to mammalian abundance, the proportion of individuals captured that were introduced species, and whether prevalence varied across habitat types, predicting highest prevalence in flooded rice fields (due to water-borne transmission) and lowest prevalence in forest habitats. Further, we tested whether introduced mammal species had a higher probability of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection than native species, if infection varied among sexes, and if individuals captured in flooded rice fields had higher probability of infection than those caught in other habitat types. To determine if there were ecological predictors of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection, we also tested whether the probability of infection varied among ecological guilds in terms of general diet and locomotor classifications. This is the first investigation that specifically tests the effects of introduced species, land use, and ecological niche as predictors of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in Madagascar.
