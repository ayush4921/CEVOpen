<p>Madagascar is renowned for its biodiversity, and all native terrestrial mammals are endemic, including rodents and tenrecs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Native non-primate mammal communities are often diverse, with up to 20 sympatric species in a community and over 69 species known from the island [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For mammals, rodents are often a diverse component of communities, and are important reservoirs of zoonotic parasites globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There are now several known cases of pathogen spillover from introduced mammals to primates in Madagascar, such as canine heart worm (
 <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic>) in mouse lemurs (
 <italic>Microcebus lehilahytsara</italic>, family Cheirogaleidae), and enteric viruses and protozoa in several lemur species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Endemic species can be negatively impacted by introduced small mammals via parasite spillover [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which has been proposed to cause extinctions via introductions of new parasites in other areas of the world [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to affecting native mammalian species, mammal-borne diseases, including leptospirosis, represent potential health risks for humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although human leptospirosis is a major zoonotic disease with highest incidence in tropical countries, pathogenic 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> were not known from Madagascar until recently [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given the environmental mode of transmission through soil and water, people and animals in rural Madagascar are likely to be highly exposed to 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> because a predominant form of agriculture is flooded-field paddy rice [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Little is known, however, about how 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection varies in relation to human land use. Native and introduced mammals in Madagascar have been reported to shed 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> in their urine, and domesticated animals and humans are exposed to infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Importantly, introduced small mammals are mostly infected by the globally-distributed 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans</italic> and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>borgpetersenii</italic>, while endemic tenrecs (family Tenrecidae) host an endemic species, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>mayottensis</italic>, though infection with the widespread species 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>kirschneri</italic> has also been documented [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Endemic Malagasy rodents had a prevalence of up to 25%, and were co-infected with 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>mayottensis</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>borgpetersenii</italic>, as well as previously undescribed lineages suggesting deep co-evolution between small mammals and leptospires [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, sampling of livestock in Madagascar also revealed mixed infections and high prevalence of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>, including 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>kirschneri</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans</italic>, and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>borgpetersenii</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> haplotypes found in domestic animals were clearly related to those described in small mammals from Madagascar, as well as in livestock from Tanzania, Réunion, and Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
