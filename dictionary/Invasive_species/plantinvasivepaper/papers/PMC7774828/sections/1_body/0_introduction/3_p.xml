<p>Linking changes in biodiversity to infectious disease is fundamental to understanding the impact of global changes on the functioning of ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alterations in wildlife communities due to habitat degradation include reduced abundance of native species and the introduction of exotic species. Introduced species, which often become invasive, can alter the disease dynamics of biological systems and the risks for wild and domestic animals, as well as humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In disease-mediated invasion, introduced species bring pathogens to which they are immune, but to which native species are highly susceptible [
