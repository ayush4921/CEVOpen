<p>The global biodiversity crisis has far-reaching effects on human well-being, including changes in disease prevalence in wildlife and people [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Loss of biodiversity can increase parasite prevalence due to a phenomenon termed the “dilution effect” [

 <italic>Borrelia</italic>, in wildlife [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this case, habitat fragmentation favored an increased abundance of the reservoir host, the white-footed mouse, 
 <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic> (family Cricetidae), which in turn increased abundance and transmission of the tick vector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This example and others [
