<p>The infection prevalence and 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> host-specificity pattern described here paves the way for investigations of humans and domesticated animals, with one goal to determine the reservoir of highest epidemiological importance. Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and has been reported in Madagascar [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and neighboring Indian Ocean islands [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Malagasy agriculturalists spend long hours working in flooded rice fields, and they commonly use water from fields and neighboring streams and rivers for bathing, cooking and drinking. 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> can easily be acquired by people when ingesting contaminated water, or via open wounds that are exposed to the water [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, people are likely highly exposed to this pathogenic bacterium. One factor that requires future investigation is whether 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> is detectable in water sources used by people, as well as soils, to determine environmental risk factors for infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].
