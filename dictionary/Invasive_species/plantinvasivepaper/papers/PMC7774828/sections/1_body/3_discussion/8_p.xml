<p>A serological study for the people in this rural village should also be conducted using a Microscopic Agglutination Test based on a panel of isolates including shrew-, mice- and rat-borne 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> from the field site. Such a public-health study would identify the transmission cycles and address the medical importance of this zoonosis. Determining the intensity of exposure is critical, as a high seroprevalence in humans would increase the awareness of the community to the disease and stimulate early antibiotic (doxycycline) treatment that may significantly reduce disease burden. Results presented here suggest that isolating 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> from rats and mice is indicative of which leptospires the local human population is exposed. In association with the serological screening of the local population, these data would determine whether the available monovalent or multivalent vaccines are likely to limit infection in local people and domesticated animals [
