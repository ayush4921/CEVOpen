<p>We propose that the 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> community composition at the Marojejy study site is driven by introduced mammals and their cosmopolitan leptospires (
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans</italic> and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>kirschneri</italic>), which in turn displaced endemic 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> lineages/species. These transmission dynamics can have important impacts on the native fauna, with unpredictable consequences because the incidence of disease and mortality in wildlife is unknown. However, because we could not obtain 
 <italic>secY</italic> sequences from most endemic mammals, we cannot exclude the existence of endemic lineages/species such as 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>mayottensis</italic>, especially in the forest. Future research within the forest, particularly in more montane areas with higher species richness, will help to address whether cosmopolitan 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> persist far from human disturbed habitats or if there is a transition to endemic 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> species, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We also acknowledge that our models only captured a relatively small proportion of variance in prevalence and infection probability. Future research should investigate other variables that likely play a role including seasonality, more specific quantification of water sources and their flows, and soil moisture [
