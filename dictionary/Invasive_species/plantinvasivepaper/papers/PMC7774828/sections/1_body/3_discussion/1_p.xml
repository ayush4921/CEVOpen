<p>The prevalence of infection with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> was significantly higher for introduced than native species. Introduced species were more likely to be infected than native species, though this result was not significant when controlling for phylogenetic relatedness. The probability of infection with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> was lower in forest fragments and swidden fields compared to continuous forest, flooded rice fields, and in the village. Our results illustrate how introduced species and habitat degradation can affect the disease dynamics in this system.
