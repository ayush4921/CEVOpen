<p>One way that habitat degradation affects biodiversity–and thus disease ecology–is by changing the composition of the host community. In certain cases, parasite transmission increases with habitat degradation when the abundance of competent hosts increases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the classic example of Lyme disease, habitat fragmentation decreased the diversity of mammals and increased the abundance of the highly competent rodent host 
 <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>, which favored the transmission of the associated bacterium [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This system and many others led to the hypothesis of the dilution effect, in which habitat degradation reduced diversity and favored competent hosts which increased disease transmission, while diverse habitats ‘diluted’ the competent host populations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our study, species diversity was 
 <italic>higher</italic> in some of the disturbed habitats than in natural forest due to the combination of native and introduced species. The negative effects of introduced species on community composition and conservation are diverse [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and the effects on disease ecology can be especially significant [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Introduced species can greatly affect the pool of susceptible hosts when parasites are generalists that can infect multiple host species. It should be noted that native small mammal diversity is notably high in montane habitats on the Marojejy massif [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and comparatively reduced in lowland forests where our sampling was done. Further, because of the rarity of native species, sample sizes for those species were low and future research with larger samples of native species will be needed to determine the robustness of our results. The combination of environmental conditions and host community composition affects the potential for parasite transmission.
