<p>Contrary to previous research, where 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in small mammals captured inside homes was rare [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we found high prevalence in small mammals in homes. The high incidence of peridomestic species in homes, especially 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, likely enhances the accumulation of leptospires. Because many homes have dirt floors, this permits the leptospires to persist in the soil and high contact rates among abundant small mammals likely increases transmission.
