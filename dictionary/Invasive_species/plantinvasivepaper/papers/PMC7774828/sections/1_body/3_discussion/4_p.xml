<p>The effects of biodiversity and habitat degradation on disease ecology vary among systems. In our study, the probability of infection with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> was lowest in the forest fragments and swidden field, but was not significantly different across other habitat types. The animals in the fragments and swidden field may have had lower infection probability because of the lack of water sources within the fragments and field themselves, although streams and seasonally flooded rice fields were within 100 m of the plots. Prevalence and infection probabilities were not higher in flooded rice fields, despite predictions based on the existing knowledge about 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> transmission. This may be due to variation in the leptospire species found across habitats, since in previous research 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans</italic> appears to be more restricted to humid environments while other species were common across habitats [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In Madagascar, lowland valleys are usually cultivated for flooded paddy rice, and introduced rats are abundant in these habitats [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The survival and spread of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> is facilitated by permanent and seasonally abundant water [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and environmental contamination is likely enhanced by the mammal hosts that use these habitats. We may not have detected the association between flooded habitats and 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection because of the variation in flooding schedules during this study. In future research, a larger number of plots for each habitat type sampled in both wet and dry seasons will allow us to determine the validity of these results and the drivers of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection.
