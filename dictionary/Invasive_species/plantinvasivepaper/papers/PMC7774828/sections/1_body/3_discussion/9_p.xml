<p>In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the importance of ecological community composition in driving parasite dynamics. Given the high prevalence of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> in the system, it is potentially a threat to native biodiversity and to public health. More research is needed to understand the risks for local people of this and other zoonotic transmission pathways. Then, steps can be taken to plan actions that reduce exposure and disease in people.
