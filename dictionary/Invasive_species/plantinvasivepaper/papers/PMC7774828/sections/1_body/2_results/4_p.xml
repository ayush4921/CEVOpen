<p>In analyses that examined individual predictors of infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008946.s007">S6 Table</xref>), the model-averaged results show that native species and those individuals captured in forest fragments and the swidden field were less likely to be infected with 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> than introduced species and individuals in other habitat types (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The full model explained 18.7% of the variance in 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Among habitat types, the animals captured in forest fragments and in the swidden field had significantly lower probability of infection than other habitat types, controlling for all other variables (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The analyses that incorporated phylogeny found that there was no difference in the probability of infection between native and introduced species and that infection probability was lower in all anthropogenic habitats, controlling for all other variables (lambda value posterior mode = 0.48, 95% highest posterior density = 0.32â€“0.72,
