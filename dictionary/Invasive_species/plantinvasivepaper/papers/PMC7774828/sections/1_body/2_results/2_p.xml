<p>Altogether, of 530 animals, 192 tested positive for 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> based on qPCR results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008946.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Of the individuals that tested positive, 168 were introduced species (87.5%), while 24 were native (12.5%). Thirty-nine 
 <italic>secY</italic> sequences could be obtained from the positive samples using standard and degenerated primers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (GenBank accession numbers MT81160â€”MT81194) Only two distinct 
 <italic>secY</italic> haplotypes were found in these sequences, corresponding to 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans</italic> and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>kirschneri</italic>. None of the positive samples were identified as 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>mayottensis</italic>, which was previously isolated and/or identified in Malagasy small mammals [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008946.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Most sequences were obtained from introduced rodents and shrews, with the exception of one endemic spiny tenrec (
 <italic>Setifer setosus</italic>, see below). The 
 <italic>secY</italic> sequences obtained from infected rats all corresponded to a single 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>interrogans secY</italic> haplotype (23 sequences) that did not correspond to any reference allele on the PubMLST database. However, this allele was identical to 
 <italic>L</italic>.

 <italic>Suncus etruscus</italic> and one 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>murinus</italic> specimens were infected by 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>kirschneri</italic> represented by the single secY

 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>musculus</italic> (N = 1) and 
 <italic>Setifer setosus</italic> (N = 1) specimens corresponded to the same
