 <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic> may be phenotypically difficult to differentiate from other 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species due to the high variability observed in the conidiophore and conidia characteristics of each species (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, colony age and maturity are also the confounding factors for microscopic identification. The asexual morphs of members of 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> are monophialidic and heavily sporulating. 
 <italic>Pleurostoma richardsiae</italic> is likely the easiest to differentiate, as its conidia are most commonly spherical and aggregate as slimy masses at the apices of distinct flared collarettes (Figure S3(a)). The wide saucer shaped collarette observed in 
 <italic>Pleurostoma richardsiae</italic> is not observed in other 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species, which usually display either cupped or slightly rounded collarettes. 
 <italic>Pleurostoma repens</italic> can be differentiated through its relatively long, branched and elongated conidiophores. In addition, spherical conidia have never been observed in 
 <italic>Pleurostoma repens</italic>. 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ootheca</italic> were observed to have the shortest phialides. In addition, spherical conidia were found to be tightly bunched at the apices of these short phialides (Figure S3(b)). 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ochraceum</italic> and 
 <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic> share remarkably similar phialide and hyphal structures, but a large noticeable difference is the degree of melanization of conidia. 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ochraceum</italic> has distinctly melanized and thick-walled spherical conidia (Figure S3(c)). The asexual morph of 
 <italic>P. candollei</italic> is not known [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
