<p>Hyphae 1.3–6.5 µm (x̄ = 2.5 ± 0.9 µm, n = 58) wide, septate and hyaline, with verruculose walls. Phialides 1.5–11.0 µm × 0.7–3.0 µm (x̄ = 4.7 ± 2.7 µm × 1.7 ± 0.5 µm, n = 42), monophialidic, usually laterally located and closely associated to a cluster of conidia. Three types of phialide structures were observed, including swollen elongate-ampulliform phialides with constricted bases, relatively long type I-like adelophialides which lacked basal septa as well as shorter and indistinct projection-like conidiophores associated with spherical to ellipsoidal conidia. Collarettes inconspicuous, though slightly cupped or tubular collarettes were observable for the longer and larger conidiophores. Conidia 0.3–11.0 µm × 1.5–3.7 µm (x̄ = 2.6 ± 0.4 µm × 2.7 ± 0.6 µm, n = 49), most commonly reniform, occasionally spherical, oblong-elliptical or allantoid. Subspherical and oblong shaped conidia usually associated with shorter conidiophores and reniform and allantoid conidia usually congregated to the other two types of conidiophores.</p>
