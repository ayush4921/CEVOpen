 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species are emerging human pathogens causing phaeohyphomycosis. This historic genus was originally established in 1863 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Following its merging with the asexual genus 
 <italic>Pleurostomophora</italic> subsequent to the abolishment of dual nomenclature of the different morphs of the same fungus since 2013, it currently accommodates a total of five species, namely 
 <italic>Pleurostoma candollei</italic> (type species), 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ootheca, Pleurostoma ochraceum, Pleurostoma repens and Pleurostoma richardsiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In nature, this group of fungi inhabits woods [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; and they have also been isolated from soil and sewage [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and found as contaminants which cause blueing of ground wood pulp [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infection may result from close contact with 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic>-contaminated plants or direct inoculation of contaminated materials into the body [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–11</xref>]. Very often 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> infections are localized and manifest as cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions and/or nodules [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11–30</xref>], although infections of the bones/joints [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31–35</xref>], eyes [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref>] and urinary tracts [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] are also observed. In more rare occasions especially in severely immunocompromised individuals, disseminated invasive infections affecting the bloodstreams, hearts and livers could also occur [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The aetiological agent for most of the cases were 
 <italic>Pleurostoma richardsiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28–33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35–40</xref>], while 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ochraceum</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ootheca</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 
 <italic>Pleurostoma repens</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] were also reported to cause infections in a few cases.
