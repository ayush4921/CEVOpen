<p>In 2017, we isolated a dematiaceous fungus from the subhepatic abscess pus and drain fluids of a patient. Microscopic examination of the fungal culture and preliminary internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing showed that it is a 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species, although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS) failed to identify this fungus due to the absence of interpretable protein mass spectra. Further morphological and molecular characterizations showed that this fungus is closely related to, but distinct from, all the known 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species. Therefore, we propose a new species, 
 <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic> sp. nov., to describe this fungus. Antifungal susceptibilities of this novel species and the known 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species were also performed to help guide patient management.
