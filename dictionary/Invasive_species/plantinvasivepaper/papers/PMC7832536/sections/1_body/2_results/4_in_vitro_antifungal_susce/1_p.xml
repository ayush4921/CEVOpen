<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibilities of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> and other 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> strains to 11 different antifungal agents are listed in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> possessed high MICs/MECs (&gt;8 µg/mL) to all antifungal agents tested except amphotericin B (0.5 µg/mL). As for other 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> strains, all of them had high MICs to flucytosine and fluconazole (≥4 µg/mL) and most had high MECs (≥2 µg/mL) to the echinocandins, except 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ochraceum</italic> CBS 131321
 <sup>T</sup> and 
 <italic>Pleurostoma richardsiae</italic> NCPF 2765 which had low MECs (0.5 and 1 µg/mL, respectively) to caspofungin. In addition to fluconazole, in general these 
 <italic>Pleutostoma</italic> strains possessed high MICs to other triazole agents as well. Only ten of them possessed low MICs (≤1 µg/mL) to posaconazole, seven to itraconazole, four to voriconazole and three to each of isavuconazole and ravuconazole. On the contrary, the majority of other 
 <italic>Pleutostoma</italic> strains tested possessed low MICs (≤1 µg/mL) to amphotericin B, including 
 <italic>Pleurostoma repens</italic> CBS 294.39, 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ochraceum</italic> CBS 131321
 <sup>T</sup>, 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ootheca</italic> CBS 115329 and 14 strains of 
 <italic>Pleurostoma richardsiae</italic>.
