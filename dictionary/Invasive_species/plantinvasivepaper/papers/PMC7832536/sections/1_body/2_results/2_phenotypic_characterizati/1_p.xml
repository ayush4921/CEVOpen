<p>The colony macroscopy of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> varied greatly when cultured on different media. On MEA, colonies were grey with creamy mycelial tufts on the surface. The reverse was beige (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(a,d)). On SDA, HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> initially grew white but developed a beige complexion on day 5. The colony surface was powdery but the outer colony border was floccose (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(b,e)). The reverse surface maintained the same coloration. Meanwhile on PDA, the colony surface was flat and creamy white. As the colony matured, a yellow pigment or hue appeared to diffuse from the initial point of inoculation, but remained confined to the mycelial mat (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(c,f)). Furthermore, short white creamy mycelial tufts began to emerge from the outer ring of the growing colony and later grew inwards as the colony matured. No diffusible pigment was observed for the fungus when cultured on all the three media tested. The growth rate of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> on the three media tested also differed. After 7 days of incubation at 25°C, HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> grew significantly the fastest on PDA, attaining a colony diameter of approximately 50 mm; whereas on SDA and MEA the fungus grew slower, attaining colony diameters of around 35 mm and 31 mm, respectively (Figure S1(a)). In addition, growth of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> was influenced by temperature. On SDA after 7 days of incubation, growth of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> at 25°C and 30°C was comparable, with colony diameters of around 30–40 mm. When the temperature increased to 35–37C°, the fungus grew significantly faster, attaining colony diameters of around 60 mm (Figure S1(b)).
