<p>A 65-year-old Chinese man was admitted in March 2017 for management of post-liver transplant biliary stricture. The patient had hepatitis B virus-related liver failure and living donor liver transplantation was performed in November 2015. Biliary stricture developed and right hepatico-jejunostomy bypass was performed in August 2016. The patient developed stricture of the hepatico-jejunostomy bypass and was admitted in March 2017 for a second hepatico-jejunostomy bypass. Post-operatively, the patient developed increasing abdominal pain. Computed tomography examination of the abdomen revealed a 4.3 cm × 0.8 cm collection with gas pocket and rim enhancement was observed around the tubal drains in the upper abdomen (

 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae</italic> and a dematiaceous fungus (strain HKU44
 <sup>T</sup>). Despite antimicrobial treatment including the use of anidulafungin, the same dematiaceous fungus was repeatedly recovered from the drain fluid eight more times. The patient developed progressive liver failure and cadaveric liver transplantation was performed again in July 2017. Post-operatively, amphotericin B and voriconazole were given for 16 days, followed by voriconazole maintenance therapy for three months. The function of the graft was normal and the dematiaceous fungus was not isolated from the patient again up to the time of writing, three years after the second liver transplantation.
