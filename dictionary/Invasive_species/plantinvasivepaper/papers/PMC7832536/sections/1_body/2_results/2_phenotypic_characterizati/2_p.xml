<p>Microscopically, hyphae were septate and hyaline and hyphal walls were verruculose (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Phialides appeared to be monophialidic, but were usually closely associated to a cluster of conidia and were usually laterally located rather than terminally on hyphae (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Several distinguishable phialide structures were observed including swollen elongate-ampulliform phialides with constricted bases (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(a,d,g)), relatively long type I-like adelophialides which lacked basal septa (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(b,e,h)) as well as shorter and indistinct projection-like conidiophores associated with spherical to ellipsoidal conidia (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(c,f,i)). Collarettes were usually inconspicuous, though slightly cupped or tubular collarettes could be observed for the longer and larger conidiophores (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(e,g,h)). Conidia sported a wide variety of shapes and sizes including spherical, oblong-elliptical, allantoid and most commonly reniform. Notably, subspherical and oblong shaped conidia tended to associate more frequently with shorter conidiophores (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(c,f,i)), while reniform and allantoid conidia were found congregated to the other two types of conidiophores (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(aâ€“h)).
