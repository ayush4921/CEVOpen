<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibilities against 11 antifungal drugs, including amphotericin B (Cayman Chemical, USA), anidulafungin (SelleckChem, USA), caspofungin (TargetMol, USA), micafungin (TargetMol), fluconazole (TargetMol), isavuconazole (TargetMol), itraconazole (TargetMol), posaconazole (Sigma-Aldrich), ravuconazole (Sigma-Aldrich), voriconazole (TargetMol) and flucytosine (Sigma-Aldrich), were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to the guidelines by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (test range: 0.0156–8 µg/mL for itraconazole and posaconazole; 0.0312–16 µg/mL for other drugs) [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and our previous publication [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For echinocandins, minimum effective concentration (MEC) endpoints were recorded as the lowest drug concentrations in which abnormal, short and branched hyphal clusters were observed; whereas for the other antifungal agents, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) endpoints yielding no visible fungal growth by eyes were recorded. Strains 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> ATCC 204304 and CNM-CM-1813, 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> ATCC 204305, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> CNM-CL F8555, 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019
 <sup>T</sup> as well as 
 <italic>Pichia kudriavzevii</italic> CNM-CL-3403 and NRRL Y-413 were used as quality controls.
