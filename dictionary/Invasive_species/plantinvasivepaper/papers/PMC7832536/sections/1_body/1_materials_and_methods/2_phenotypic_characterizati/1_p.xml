<p>The fungal isolate HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> and other 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> ex-type/reference strains were cultured on malt extract agar (MEA; Oxoid, UK), potato dextrose agar (PDA; BD Diagnostic Systems) and SDA (all supplemented with chloramphenicol [50 µg/mL]) for examination of growth rates and colony characteristics. Images of the fungal colonies were captured using the digital camera α5100 (Sony, Japan). For light microscopy, a slide culture was prepared by first placing an SDA block measuring 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm onto a glass slide. Each surface of the agar block was inoculated with the conidia of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> (3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> colony forming units) and a cover slip was then placed on top of the agar block. The slide culture was incubated at 25°C for 7 days after which the cover slip with the attaching fungal materials, mounted and stained with lactophenol cotton blue (BD Diagnostics System), was transferred on a fresh glass slide. Microscopic characteristics were observed using the microscope BX43 (Olympus, Japan) under an original magnification of 1000× and digital images were obtained by the attached camera DP80 (Olympus) and the software cellSens Dimension (Olympus). Measurement was made for 40–60 structures for each microscopic character. HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> was also microscopically examined by scanning electron microscopy, performed following a simplified protocol [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, polycarbonate filter membranes with a pore size of 0.8 µm were placed on tap water agar (1.5% agarose [w/v; BD Diagnostic Systems]). Strain HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> was then inoculated on the membranes and was incubated at 25°C for 14 days. Upon colony maturation, the culture was fixed using formalin vapour by adding 1 mL of 37% formaldehyde (in water, v/v; Sigma Aldrich, USA) onto the lid of the inverted Petri dish which was then securely sealed and incubated overnight. Membranes with fixed fungal materials were then collected and washed with absolute ethanol (Merck, Germany) twice and then sent to the Electron Microscope Unit of The University of Hong Kong for sample processing, where the fixed samples were dried by the critical point dryer CPD 030 (Bal-Tec, Liechtenstein) using liquid carbon dioxide as the transitional fluid, mounted on aluminium stubs and then coated with a thin layer (10–20 nm) of palladium for electrical conduction by the cool sputter coater SCD 005 (Bal-Tec). Coated specimens were then examined using the field emission scanning electron microscope S-4800 (Hitachi High-Technologies, Japan).
