<p>Treatment of 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> infections is often achieved by a combination of surgical excision/debridement of the infected tissue and antifungal therapy. Of the 37 cases of 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> infections, 25 (67.6%) required surgery to remove the infected tissue and 22 (59.4%) involved the administration of antifungals (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For the present patient as well as the previous liver transplant recipient, they were both treated successfully with a second liver transplant and antifungal agents. As for the choice of antifungal agents, almost all the 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> strains tested in the present study had high MICs/MECs to fluconazole, 5-flucytosine and the echinocandins (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For amphotericin B, 18 (64.3%) of the 28 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> strains tested, including our case isolate 
 <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic> HKU44
 <sup>T</sup>, had MICs of ≤1 µg/mL, which is the general breakpoint for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As for the susceptibilities to the other triazoles, the results showed a high strain-to-strain variability (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In general, a strong Spearman correlation among the susceptibilities to different triazoles can be observed (Table S2). In view of the highly variable antifungal susceptibility profiles for 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species and strains, MICs/MECs should be determined for deciding the optimal treatment regimen for individual patients. Remarkably, for the 36 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> infection cases previously reported, seven of the isolates recovered were included in this study for susceptibility testing (ATCC 58041 [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], CBS 506.90 [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CBS 131321
 <sup>T</sup> [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], UAMH 5052 [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], UAMH 5056 [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], UAMH 5058 [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and UAMH 10082 [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Amongst these seven cases, antifungal therapies were only administered for three of the patients (Case 7, ATCC 58041 [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; Case 16, CBS 506.90 [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Case 23, UAMH 10082 [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For Case 7, the patient was treated with the debridement of infected bone and amphotericin B prescription for one week followed by flucytosine prescription for two and a half weeks [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], although susceptibility testing in this study showed that the isolate ATCC 58041 possessed MICs of 1 µg/mL and &gt;16 µg/mL for these two antifungals, respectively. Similarly, for Case 23, the patient was first treated with surgical excision and prescription of liposomal amphotericin B for one week. However, due to recurrence a repeat debridement was performed and liposomal amphotericin B for two weeks followed by itraconazole for six weeks was prescribed [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Again, susceptibility testing in this study showed that isolate UAMH 10082 possessed high MICs of 2 µg/mL and &gt;8 µg/mL for these two antifungals, respectively. For Case 16, the patient was treated with clotrimazole for 15 days [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Susceptibility to this drug was not tested in the present study and therefore, the activity of this drug to the fungal isolate (CBS 506.90) remains unknown. As for the present reported case due to 
 <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic>, the patient was treated with antimicrobials including anidulafungin before the second liver transplant. However, this was not successful in curing the infection which may be partly due to a high MEC for anidulafungin (&gt;16 µg/mL) for HKU44
 <sup>T</sup>. After the second liver transplant, the patient was treated with amphotericin B and voriconazole while HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> possessed MICs of 0.5 and 16 µg/mL for these two drugs, respectively. As a result, antifungal susceptibility testing should be performed for 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species to guide patient management and to avoid the unnecessary use of less or ineffective drugs.
