<p>We report the isolation of HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> from the subhepatic abscess as well as repeatedly from the drain fluid eight more times in a liver transplant recipient, who received prednisolone and tacrolimus that had suppressed his immune system, rendering him susceptible to invasive fungal infections. The clinical significance of the fungus was evident by the invasion of the fungus to the patient’s tissue as demonstrated by the presence of abundant fungal hyphae as well as necrotic tissue and acute inflammatory cells in histological sections of the biopsied specimen. Culture of the abscess pus and drain fluid specimens also showed colonies at the primary inoculum on all agar plates inoculated with the specimens, supporting that the isolate was from the clinical specimens, instead of due to environmental contamination. Sequencing of four different DNA regions commonly used for phylogenetic studies, including the ITS, partial 28S nrDNA, partial 18S nrDNA and partial β-tubulin gene [
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and phylogenetic analyses showed that HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> stood out as a unique branch distinct from the other 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species in the concatenated trees (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) as well as all the individual DNA marker trees (Figure S2), despite being the most closely related to 
 <italic>Pleurostoma ootheca</italic> and 
 <italic>Pleurostoma repens</italic>. HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> also possessed morphological features different to those of other known 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Figure S3). All these results supported that HKU44
 <sup>T</sup> should belong to a novel 
 <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species distinct from any other member of this genus, and we propose a novel species, 
 <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic>, to accommodate HKU44
 <sup>T</sup>.
