  <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species are wood-inhabiting fungi and emerging opportunistic pathogens causing phaeohyphomycosis. In this study, we isolated a dematiaceous fungus, HKU44
  <sup>T</sup>, from the subhepatic abscess pus and drain fluids of a liver transplant recipient with post-transplant biliary and hepatico-jejunostomy bypass strictures. Histology of the abscess wall biopsy showed abundant fungal hyphae. The patient survived after a second liver transplant and antifungal therapy. On SDA, HKU44
  <sup>T</sup> grew initially as white powdery colonies which turned beige upon maturation. Hyphae were septate and hyaline. Phialides were monophialidic and laterally located, generally closely associated to a cluster of conidia which were usually reniform. Phylogenetic analyses showed that HKU44
  <sup>T</sup> is most closely related to, but distinct from, 
  <italic>Pleurostoma ootheca</italic> and 
  <italic>Pleurostoma repens</italic>. These suggested that HKU44
  <sup>T</sup> is a novel 
  <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species, for which the name 
  <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic> sp. nov. is proposed. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that 
  <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> species possessed high MICs/MECs for fluconazole, 5-flucytosine and the echinocandins; whereas they exhibited a high strain-to-strain variability to the susceptibilities to the other triazoles. As for amphotericin B, ∼65% of the 
  <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> strains had low MICs (≤1 µg/mL). DNA sequencing should be performed to accurately identify fungi with 
  <italic>Pleurostoma/Phialophora</italic>-like morphologies, so is antifungal susceptibility testing for patients with 
  <italic>Pleurostoma</italic> infections.
