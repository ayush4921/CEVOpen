  <p>Phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of 
   <italic>Pleurostoma hongkongense</italic> HKU44
   <sup>T</sup> to its closely related species within the genus 
   <italic>Pleurostoma</italic>. The tree was inferred from the concatenated sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, partial β-tubulin gene, partial 18S nrDNA and partial 28S nrDNA by the maximum likelihood method with the substitution model T92 (Tamura 3-parameter model) + G (gamma-distributed rate variation) + I (estimated proportion of invariable sites). The scale bar indicates the estimated number of substitutions per base. Only nodes that were well supported by the maximum-likelihood method (≥70% bootstrap support) have their bootstrap support, calculated from 1,000 replicates, shown; and all these nodes were also well supported by the Bayesian inference method (posterior probabilities ≥0.99). The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank nucleotide accession numbers for 
   <italic>Jattaea algeriensis</italic> STE-U 6201
   <sup>T</sup> are EU367446 (ITS), EU367466 (β-tubulin), EU367462 (18S nrDNA) and EU367456 (28S nrDNA).
