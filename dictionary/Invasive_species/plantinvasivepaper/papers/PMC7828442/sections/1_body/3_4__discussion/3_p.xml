<p>In consideration of biological control to 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, several native Chinese insects are reported to be parasitic and predatory to the new invasive pest 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. However, their potential applications as biological control agents remain unclear and deserve further investigation. In terms of developing effective IPM strategies for controlling 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in China, biological control, protection, and utilization of natural enemies should be given priority for reducing the use of pesticides. Therefore, there needs to be further investigation and exploitation of natural enemies in China to aid the development of subsequent IPM strategies.
