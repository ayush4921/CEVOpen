 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> is active in a wide range of geographical regions and usually feeds on decaying organic materials [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been reported in forensic cases [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and there are some reports on the parasitism of 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic>. It has been reported that adult 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> can break into the hive and lay eggs in the hive; the larvae of 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> then hijack the food of bee larvae, therefore hindering the growth and development of bee larvae [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Koch and Costa found that laboratory-raised 
 <italic>Parastagmatoptera tessellata</italic> and 
 <italic>Triatoma brasiliensis</italic> could be parasitized by 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; the larvae of 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> can feed and grow in the host’s body. In our study, a similar phenomenon of 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> parasitizing 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in various regions of China was observed. The emergence of eggs on the epidermis of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae and pupae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>B–D), and maggots in the thoracic cavities of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> pupae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>E) and the solid fungi culture medium inoculated with the intestinal tract portion of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>F) demonstrates that maggots can destroy the integrity of the epidermis and penetrate into the host body cavity to infest 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. The emergence of flies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) in the closed but ventilated containers proves that the maggots are able to develop to the adult stage in the body cavity of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. All these results indicate that the indigenous species 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> can parasitize the new invasive pest 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in the wild in China. To our knowledge, this is the first record of 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> infesting wild 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in China. There have been a few previous reports of this fly infesting other insects in the wild [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our finding indicates that 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> may play various roles in the ecosystem in addition to being saprophages, such as being parasitic to insects.
