<p>The CTAB method was employed to extract genomic and mitochondrial DNA of parasitic flies [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Two pairs of DNA barcode primers were used to amplify the 28S rRNA gene (F: 5′-GACTACCCCCTGAATTTAAGCAT-3′ and R: 5′-GACTCCTTGGTCCGTGTTTCAAG-3′) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (
 <italic>CO</italic>I) (F: 5′-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3′ and R: 5′-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3′) gene of flies [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The PCR program was as follows: 96 °C for 8 min; 35 cycles at 96 °C for 40 s; 56 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 1 min; and then 72 °C for 10 min. The specific PCR products were then assessed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. All sequences of the targeted genes in this study were submitted to NCBI under the accession number MT254753-MT254757 (28S rRNA), MT251290-MT251294 (
 <italic>CO</italic>I).
