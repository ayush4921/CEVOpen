<p>In this study, we serendipitously found that 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> was parasitized by some flies from four regions in China, and identified these flies as being of the species 
 <italic>Megaselia scalaris</italic> by DNA barcoding [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is the first report showing that 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> could parasitize 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in China. Our discovery expands the repertoire of indigenous natural enemies against 
 <italic>S. frugiperda,</italic> and can ultimately contribute to the development of IPM strategies for pest control in China.
