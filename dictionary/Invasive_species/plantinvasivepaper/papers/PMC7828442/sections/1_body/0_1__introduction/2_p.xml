<p>Many kinds of potentially natural candidates for biological control, including entomophagous insects and entomopathogens, have been identified and reported throughout the world [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Investigations conducted in the Americas on the inventory of parasitoids and parasites of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> have shown that approximately 150 species from 14 families are able to attack 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> [

 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, virus-based insecticides such as 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (
 <italic>Sf</italic>MNPV) and granulovirus (
 <italic>Sf</italic>GV) have been developed for 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> [

 <xref rid="B9-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> has exhibited resistance to many commonly used entomopathogenic bacteria and fungi such as 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> [

 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> has been limited in China because this species of pest only recently migrated to China (2019). Within the past year, several surveys on the natural enemies attacking 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> have been conducted in many regions of China, showing that a number of parasitic wasps and flies are able to attack 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. These include 
 <italic>Telenomus remus</italic>, 
 <italic>Diadegma semiclausum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Exorista japonica</italic> [
