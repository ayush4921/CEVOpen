<p>As a major migratory agricultural pest, 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> originated in the Americas and migrated to the African continent in 2016. It was first discovered and reported in China in January 2019 [

 <xref rid="B2-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With favorable temperatures and abundant crops, 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> rapidly spread to 29 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) across the country, posing a serious threat to food production security in China [
 <xref rid="B3-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To control this new invasive and rapidly spreading pest, the “2019 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> prevention and control technology plan (trial)” developed by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China recommended employing the chemical pesticides chlorantraniliprole, cyfluthrin, and deltamethrin for emergency control. In the following years, the pest may continue to cause seasonal outbreaks in China. The climate in southern China can support the presence 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> through the winter and this region could potentially be the annual breeding area for the pest [
 <xref rid="B3-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to emergency control by chemical pesticides, there is an urgent need for a long-term integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> control. Biological control and natural enemy protection and utilization should be given priority, in addition to efforts towards reducing the number of applications and risks of pesticides [
