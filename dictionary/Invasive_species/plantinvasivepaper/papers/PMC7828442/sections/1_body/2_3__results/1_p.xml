<p>In our surveillance studies, some flies (2.46 ± 0.50 by 0.75 ± 0.17 mm) were observed and caught in the closed but ventilated containers for 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> collected from the maize fields of four different regions in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), and white long oval eggs (0.60 ± 0.04 by 0.2 ± 0.01 mm) were found on the epidermis of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C) and pupae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Moreover, we observed that the maggots emerged from thoracic cavities of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> pupae, which were alive upon being collected from the maize fields, and left solid exoskeletons of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> pupae as remnants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). Additionally, the maggots that emerged on the solid fungi culture medium (Potato Dextrose Agar Medium, PDA) were inoculated with the intestinal tract portion of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f002">Figure 2</xref>F). To better characterize these flies morphologically, we next conducted a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f003">Figure 3</xref>), and concluded that these flies were of the species 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> based on the presence of male terminalia from the SEM results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f003">Figure 3</xref>J) [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To further confirm the identification of these flies by molecular approach, two pairs of universal DNA barcode primers were used to amplify the target genes from nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA of flies. The sequence alignments showed that all the parasite flies caught in different regions shared high homology in two DNA barcoding genes. The phylogenetic trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f004">Figure 4</xref>) constructed based on the 28S rRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) and 
 <italic>CO</italic>I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) gene sequence show that the five fly specimens from this study have a high homologous evolutionary relationship with the Phoridae family, and clustered with 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic>.
