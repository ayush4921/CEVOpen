<p>In this study, we reported that some dipterans were able to infest invasive pest 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in the wild in China. Both conventional and molecular methods identified the dipterans as 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic>. This is the first report on the native species 
 <italic>M. species</italic> infesting 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> in China. Further investigations on the infestation of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> by 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic> are warranted and such studies can potentially provide new directions for the integrated pest management strategies in China.
