<p>NIR, which is absorbed in minimal amounts by water and biomolecules, can penetrate tissue deeply (Chen, Ning, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). First NIR window light (650–950 nm) is often utilized in photothermal therapy (PTT). Exposed to NIR radiation, PTA can generate heat through plasmon resonance or jump energy to rapidly increase the local temperature to ablate cancer cells. Cancer cells are more sensitive to heat than surrounding normal cells and more likely to be damaged with the cells membrane, intracellular protein, or RNA/DNA repair being broken (Abadeer &amp; Murphy, 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Regional hyperthermy can kill cells and increase the cells’ sensitivity to anticancer drugs (Sun, Ge, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0115" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Frequently-used PTA include inorganic materials (noble metal materials, transition-metal chalcogenide materials, carbon-based nanomaterials etc.) and organic materials (polypyrrole and polydopamine, cyanine dyes, porphyrin, etc.). Gold NPs, Pt NPs, Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> NPs, and carbon-based nanomaterials have been explored as PTA because of their effective photothermal conversion (Liu, Bhattarai, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0149" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Polydopamine (PDA) is formed by mussel-inspired polymerization dopamine. PDA possesses not only versatile adhesion property (through covalent binding or non-covalent binding of catecholamine groups coordination or chelation) which can be utilized to modify the surface of various materials and bind drugs, high chemical activity, excellent biocompatibility, but also strong photothermal property. The biodegradable monodispersed bioactive glass (BGN) was modified by PDA and linked DOX to these NPs for enhancing colon cancer photothermo-chemotherapy and bone repair. NIR-excited PTT of BGN@PDA could ablate tumors. And the relative tumor volume was reduced to 0.85 in BGN@PDA-DOX group, 0.50 in BGN@PDA + NIR group, and 0.01 in BGN@PDA-DOX + NIR group after 12 d of treatment. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> experiment and quantitative analysis revealed that BGN@PDA and BGN could enhance new bone formation, and NIR did not reduce the bone regeneration efficacy of BGN@PDA (Xue et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0140" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In another study, the researcher fabricated a kind of ALN-conjugated PDA NPs (PDA-ALN), which exhibited excellent photothermal effect and high affinity to HA. PDA-ALN loaded anticancer drug 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) via π–π stacking and the release of SN38 could be triggered by NIR.
