<p>Besides, some interesting photothermal materials with smart decoration were synthesized and applied in targeted delivery systems. Na

 <sub>3</sub> NPs (about 150 nm oxygen vacancy-rich tungsten bronze NPs) were synthesized for PTT. Na
 <sub>x</sub>WO
 <sub>3</sub> NPs had desirable PTT effects that the temperature increased from 25.8 °C to 41.8 °C in 5 min under the irradiation of 980 nm laser. The cytotoxicity of the particles against breast cancer cells appeared in dose-dependence

 <sub>3</sub> + PTT group had the most effective inhibition of tumor and bone destruction (Jie et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Except for organic photothermal materials, noble metal and inorganic materials both have nonnegligible cytotoxicity, low biodegradability and low biocompatibility. Effective PTT needs the desired accumulation of PTA in the irradiated area. Thus, it is necessary to apply targeted or local drug delivery systems to carry these PTA to narrow their distribution and modify them to improve biocompatibility.
