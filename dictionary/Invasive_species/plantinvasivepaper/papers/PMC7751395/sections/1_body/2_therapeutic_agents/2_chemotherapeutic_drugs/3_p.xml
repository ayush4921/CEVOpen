<p>BP is a stable analog of pyrophosphate by replacing the P–O–P bonds with P–C–P bonds (Rudnick-Glick et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0099" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This makes BP enzymatically stable. BP has a high affinity to the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (HA) and has been exploited as a targeting ligand. Osteoclasts can take up and be suppressed by BP chelating to bone (Zeng et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0145" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In addition, BP has been revealed to be able to inhibit cancer cells (Robert &amp; Reinhold, 
 <xref rid="CIT0097" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Santini et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0102" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHA) was always applied in bone repairing because of its good biocompatibility to the bone and fine adsorption to BP. Recently, nHA has been found to be able to inhibit several kinds of cancer cells through mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and have special functions of lessening osteolysis caused by cancer metastasis (Zhang, Zhou, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0148" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The transcription factor Gli2 is a key regulator of PTHrP (Vanderburgh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0124" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). And GANT58 is a Gli2 antagonist that inhibits Gli2 nuclear translocation and PTHrP expression in tumor cells to play a role in hindering the ‘vicious circle’ (Vanderburgh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0124" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Gallium (Ga) is a semi-metallic element with a chemical affinity for biological HA, anti-resorption activity and anticancer ability. Ga significantly decreased osteoclasts differentiation and activity without negative interaction with osteoblasts (Strazic-Geljic et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0112" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Odanacatib and balicatib, inhibitors of cathepsin K, can suppress bone resorption (Saracino et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0103" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Mature osteoclasts express cathepsin K which is a kind of lysosomal cysteine protease essential for collagen and elastin degradation during bone resorption. 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> collected some reported effective drugs for suppressing osteoclasts and some other potential drugs (Vinay &amp; KusumDevi,
