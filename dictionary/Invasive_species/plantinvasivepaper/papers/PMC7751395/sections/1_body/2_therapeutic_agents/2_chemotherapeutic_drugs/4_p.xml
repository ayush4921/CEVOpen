<p>Some traditional Chinese herb extractions were studied for their ability to inhibit the activation of osteoclast induced by cancer cells and obtained optimistic results, as showed in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Curcumin, extraction from 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> plant, was able to anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer cells through NOTCH-1 signaling and suppress NF-κB relative gene expression. Artemisinin and its derivants, famous for curing malaria, were also researched about their inhibiting osteolysis and cancer ability. Dihydroartemisinin suppressed osteoclasts differentiation, F-actin ring formation, and bone resorption through AKT/SRC pathways. It also inhibited breast tumor-induced osteolysis by inhibiting the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells via modulating AKT signaling pathway. Wedelolactone, a natural product from 
 <italic>Ecliptae herba</italic>, was reported to be capable of suppressing breast cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis and enhancing osteoblastogenesis. And some extractions were revealed effective in suppressing osteoclasts formation and maturity without a clear mechanism yet. In spite of the satisfying experimental outcome, drugs’ low bioavailability, poor solubility, and short half-life limit their application (Wang, Sun, et al.,
