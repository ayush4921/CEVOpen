<p>In local delivery systems based on implanted materials, drug loading can be obtained by the following methods: (a). mixing drugs with materials directly before fabrication; (b). entrapping drugs into basic drug carriers (e.g. NPs) and adding this system to implantable materials; (c). immersing scaffold/hydrogel/composite into drugs solution; (d). anchoring drug on the materials (physical adsorption, chemical conjunction); (e). coating the scaffold in a polymer or composite solution (Sarigol-Calamak &amp; Hascicek, 
 <xref rid="CIT0105" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Drugs can be released from implantable materials in several ways, such as drug diffusion, drug adsorption–desorption, and materials erosion (Chen, Boda, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The early-stage release always appears a burst release through diffusion followed by a constant release through materials erosion or further diffusion (Zeng et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0145" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Biodegradable materials are degraded by hydrolysis and enzymolysis (Song et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0108" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). When NPs serve as drug carriers and then are incorporated in implantable materials or modify the materials, special properties of NPs can endow the implantable materials with new merits, such as stimulus-release ability, photothermal property, and more sustained release ability. GG-NPs-ALN system, with ALN-loaded PLGA NPs carried in the matrix of gellan gum, was injectable and delivered ALN intra-bone in a constant manner. The ALN release graphs of NPs-ALN and GG-NPs-ALN are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>. It was obvious that this local release system released drugs more slowly and constantly. GG-NPs-ALN was cytocompatible with osteoblast-like cells but inhibited RANKL mediated osteoclastic differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells significantly

 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0136" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Wei Wu et al. designed a local release system (GEM-Lip@Gel) based on hydrogel, in which liposomes blended with methacryloyl (GelMA). Gemcitabine (GEM) was loaded into liposomes for local release to kill osteosarcoma cells. GEM-Lip@Gel (with liposome) had a more constant level than GEM-GelMA (without liposome) in drug release assay and showed the strongest ability to inhibit cancer cells than the control

 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> outlined some local delivery systems of lessening bone destruction and their drug-release characteristics. A sustained release can be realized easily by biodegradable materials like hydrogels. Biodegradable materials release drugs sustainedly through erosion and it is controllable through regulating the matrix ingredient ratio, crosslinking method, or utilizing NPs which encapsulate drugs.
