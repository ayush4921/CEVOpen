<p>The most common way to optimize the grafts for treating osteolysis is decorating them with anti-osteolysis drugs. For example, ZOL-loaded bone cement or tricalcium phosphate (TCP) inhibited malignant bone tumors or metastatic bone tumors with the help of sustained ZOL release and acted as a bone substitute at the same time (Koto et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Rahmanian et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0095" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Aliphatic polyesters like PCL, PLA, PLLA were used widely for their good biodegradability, biocompatibility, and permeability (Oledzka et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Ewa Oledzka et al. prepared a new multifunctional composite as a promising bone substitute material in which HA porous granules doped with selenite ions (SeO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>2−</sup>) and conjugated biodegradable branched copolymer-BP. This composite delivered pamidronate locally to inhibit bone resorption and osteoclast activity. The different molar ratios of copolymers (PLLA/PCL) resulted in different drug release kinetics and degradation speed (Oledzka et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In another work, PCL matrix and multilayer polyelectrolyte were combined to fabricate a scaffold in which CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> microparticles were covered with multilayer polyelectrolyte and then loaded with dexamethasone (DXM) for sustained local release. As a drug delivery system, this PCL scaffold also promoted osteoblast-like cells (Palamà et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0089" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). 3D-print technology is popular in medicine and bionics. It has been used extensively in fabricating individualistic, multifunctional scaffolds and given the inspiration to design local drug release systems. In the work of Pouyan Ahangar et al., 3D-printed scaffolds which loaded and locally delivered DOX to inhibit cancer cells could also potentially serve as a substitute for destructed bone tissue (Ahangar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Commonly applied for the repair and replacement of bone in the clinic, titanium is often utilized to fabricate 3D bone scaffolds in researches (Wang et al., 2019). Kun Zhang et al. fabricated a 3D-printed multifunctional titanium scaffold with an anti-tumor function via modification of locally-released nHA. After 5 weeks of implantation, 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> tumor volume of the rabbit implanted with nHA/titanium scaffold was 73.8% smaller than other groups. Micro-CT showed nHA/titanium scaffold inhibited osteolytic destruction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(a)</xref>). New bone formed at the pore walls of the nHA/titanium scaffold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(b))</xref> (Zhang, Zhou, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0148" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Another optimized implantable titanium scaffold was fabricated with titania nanotube arrays to form nano-engineered 3D titanium wire. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was loaded onto titania nanotube arrays (Ti-TNT) to form TRAIL-TNTs for localized cancer treatment (Song et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0108" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The mechanical property and microstructure of TRAIL-TNTs made it proper to support bone and act as a substitute graft with local treatment after cancer resection. Type I collagen and calcium salt are the main ingredients of bone. Thus, composites containing some similar nature polymers and calcium salt possess good biocompatibility and outstanding ability to induce osteogenesis. Mehdi Rahmanian et al. developed a gelatin/beta-TCP (β-TCP) nanocomposite scaffold loaded with ZA for bone defect regeneration and local drug release after cancer resection. Porous structure (50–200 μm pore) of gelatin reinforced with β-TCP spherical NPs (around 90 nm diameter) facilitated bone cell proliferation. Local ZA release not only inhibited the residual cancer cells and osteoclasts but also promoted osteoblasts proliferation. Histopathological results showed that the new bone formation was established by more than 75% in the whole area of the defect after 3 and 4 months (Rahmanian et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0149" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Multifunctional scaffolds have certain mechanical properties and space structures and these make them only apply to the severe metastatic bone defect area which need surgery.
