<p>Most targeted NPs had only one kind of targeting ligands decorated to combine with one specific molecular structure in the osteolytic microenvironment. PLGA and cabazitaxel were used as the core with amino-BP surface conjugation to make NPs. Bone-targeted NPs showed an 8-fold affinity to the bone in 72 h compared with non-targeted NPs. After one-month treatment of bone metastatic models, only the targeted NPs treatment group had a significant reduction in limb weight and pain response. And targeted NPs provided all treated mice protection from bone lesions while 33% of the mice with nontargeted NPs treatment had bone lesions (Gdowski et al.,

Similarly, polymeric NPs or micelles encapsulating anticancer drugs, functionalized with ZA or ALN for homing bone, were designed in many other studies and demonstrated much higher efficiency and accumulation in bone than free drugs (Rudnick-Glick et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0099" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hatami et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Liu, Romanova, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A novel preparation of polymeric NPs with high affinity to bone was completed by Yuya Hirano et al. (Hirano &amp; Iwasaki, 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Two-step synthesis of cholesteryl-functionalized poly(ethylene sodium phosphate) (Ch-PEPn·Na) was performed via ring-opening polymerization of cyclic phosphoesters and the demethylation. Synthesized PEPn·Na NPs adsorbed onto HA with the help of poly(ethylene sodium phosphate) which is an analog of polyphosphoesters and has a polyphosphodiester backbone. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated PEPn·Na NPs had a higher affinity to the bone than PEG NPs. In addition to polymeric NPs, calcium phosphate NPs and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were also utilized as BP-modified drug delivery systems to target bone (Chu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Dlamini et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It was reported that carboxyl groups on the dendrimer surface endowed dendrimer with the intrinsic bone-binding affinity (Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0141" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The dendrimer loaded with Pt NPs (DEPt-COOH) showed a high affinity to HA and bone fragments

 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0141" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Polyphosphate (polyP) was also used in a bone-targeted system. Ca-polyP nano/microparticles complexed with ZA maintained the morphogenesis and mineralization-inducing activity of polyP and anti-osteolysis effect of BP (Müller et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Optimized PTT systems usually depended on targeted NPs or locally implanted materials to increase PTT efficiency and reduce the toxicity to other organs because PTA are hard to degrade. For example, Gold nanorods were enclosed inside targeted mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs NPs) for PTT and obtained obvious treatment effects (Sun, Ge, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0115" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
