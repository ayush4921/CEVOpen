<p>Injectable drug delivery systems for treating osteolysis mainly include particle and hydrogel. Hydrogel materials incorporated with drugs and NPs have been explored as local delivery systems. The designed injectable hydrogel can solidify with certain environmental conditions. They were supposed to solidify at about 37 °C through molecular self-assembly. It is conceivable that injectable hydrogel materials have much weaker mechanical properties than implanted scaffolds and this makes hydrogel inferior to scaffolds as bone substitutes. These materials achieved local delivery through simple local injection, not implant surgery. They were also employed for cancer treatment by many researchers (Norouzi et al.,

For treating osteolysis, pamidronate (Pami)-derivative and Alen-derivative hydrogelators Pami-D and Alen-D were used to form supramolecular hydrogels under acidic conditions. Pami-D and Alen-D inhibited the proliferation and osteoclastogenesis of bone marrow-derived macrophages in a dose-dependent manner
