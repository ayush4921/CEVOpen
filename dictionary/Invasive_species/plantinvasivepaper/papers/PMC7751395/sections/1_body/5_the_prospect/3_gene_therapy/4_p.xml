<p>In osteolysis, some miRNAs play a very important role in regulating bone destruction. MiR-31, miR-33a, miR-34a, miR-133a, miR-141, miR-155, miR-190, miR-192, miR-219, and miR-223 were reported to be capable of influencing osteoclast differentiation in bone metastasis (Ell et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A hydrogel-embedded, gold-NPs-based delivery vehicle provided efficient local, selective, and sustained release of miR-96/miR-182, markedly suppressed metastasis in a breast cancer mouse model (Gilam et al.,
