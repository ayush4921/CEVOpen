<p>When metastatic tumor forms, tumor cells interact with normal cells in the vicinity, influence their cellular function, and destroy the primary microenvironment (Futakuchi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Shupp et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0107" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Bone offers metastatic cells unique microenvironments termed ‘niches’ (Croucher et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ahangar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The slow blood flow in bone, mechanical property, various chemokines, and growth factors are beneficial to tumor cells’ growth (Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0153" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Turpin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0121" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the osteolytic microenvironment, the ‘vicious circle’ between cancer cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts facilitates the activation of osteoclasts and suppresses the action of osteoblasts. At the same time, cancer cells’ proliferation is also promoted continually (Futakuchi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Saracino et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0103" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Turpin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0121" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In brief, metastatic cancer cells produce and excrete parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), IL-11, TNF-a, and other factors that act on the osteoblasts to promote the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL). RANKL combines with receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) on the membrane of preosteoclasts to accelerate osteoclast formation and maturity (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0138" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Cancer cells also express the Notch ligand Jagged1 and VCAM-1 to promote the activation of preosteoclasts (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sethi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0106" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The bone matrix contains a variety of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) (Kagiya, 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Vinay &amp; KusumDevi, 
 <xref rid="CIT0125" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These growth factors are released from the bone matrix during the bone resorption caused by mature osteoclasts. TGF-β acts on cancer cells to facilitate its proliferation and production of more PTHrP. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), also produced by osteoblasts, is a soluble RANKL decoy receptor that can prevent osteoclasts formation and osteoclastic bone resorption (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0138" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, the production of OPG is suppressed by matric meralloproteinases (MMPs) during this ‘vicious circle’ (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Additionally, cancer cells secrete a macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) to promote osteoclasts activation directly via the receptor on the osteoclasts, RON tyrosine kinase (Andrade et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The diagram description of the interaction between cells in the osteolytic microenvironment is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. Also, many microRNAs are involved in osteolysis, such as miR-21, miR-133a, miR-33a, miR-190, and miR-223 (Probert et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0093" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
