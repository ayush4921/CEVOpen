<p>Nowadays, radiotherapy, surgery as well as systemic drug therapies (chemotherapy, hormone therapy), and targeted therapy are effective clinical therapies for osteolysis. The efficacy of BP appeared to be time-dependent and they were effective after 6–12 months of therapy (Irelli et al.,

Many experiments showed that Denosumab was more effective than zoledronic acid (Zol or ZA) and caused fewer side effects (Stopeck et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Turpin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0121" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, Denosumab cannot accumulate in the bone like BP and its effect is reversible after treatment discontinuation (Macedo et al.,
