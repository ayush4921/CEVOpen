<p>The extent to which invasive and naturalized species differ in their phenotypic plasticity under different environmental conditions is important for determining which traits correlate with invasion success in particular ecological contexts (Davidson et al. 
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). For instance, invasive species have a capacity for greater plasticity in the expression of traits associated with light use and leaf nitrogen content relative to co-occurring natives (Funk 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Comparisons of this kind, particularly where limiting resources (e.g., nutrients, water) are manipulated to reconstruct different environmental conditions and naturalized and invasive species are explicitly paired, are a key area for future research into understanding the plasticity of growth traits in the naturalizationâ€“invasion transition.
