<p>Several other challenges to understanding the dynamics of the invasion continuum exist and to integrating these into WRA schemes, including identifying sources of data on propagule pressure and integrating these quantitative estimates into analyses. No reliable source of data on introduction effort for exotic species exists in Australia; therefore, we were unable to include this information in our analyses. Also, it will be crucial to identify how the ecological and environmental conditions under which naturalized plants have established influence the role of traits in determining a plant's ability to become invasive (i.e., the importance of environmental context) (Kueffer et al. 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For instance, although we show that large SLA is consistently associated with progression from naturalized to invasive independent of ecosystem conditions, the fast-growing strategy associated with large SLA may only be advantageous in early-successional, high resource, or highly disturbed environments.
