<p>The invasive species in this study had flowering seasons that were, on average, almost 1 month longer than flowering seasons of the naturalized species examined. Longer flowering periods may lead to higher propagule pressure through the production of more seed over longer periods. Propagule pressure is undoubtedly a more proximal cause of invasion success than flowering duration; however, data on introduction effort and propagule pressure are particularly difficult to acquire and no comprehensive source of this type of information exists for the introduced flora of Australia. However, a longer reproductive season may increase rates of seed set by allowing greater chance of visitation by pollinators and help buffer against stochastic events, such as heat waves or frosts, which may negatively affect reproductive success (O'Neil 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Chrobock et al. 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Increases in total seed output have also been linked to longer flowering seasons (Mason et al. 
 <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The probability of seed being dispersed to new environments is likely to increase as a function of the length of the reproductive period, which may help spread invaders throughout the landscape (Py≈°ek &amp; Richardson 
 <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Lengthy flowering seasons have been linked to greater invasion success in species introduced to Europe (Chrobock et al. 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and in exotic species colonizing high nutrient sites in low-fertility sandstone vegetation in eastern Australia (Lake &amp; Leishman 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). There is also evidence that long flowering periods that evolved under ecological conditions in the native range may preadapt species to becoming invasive when introduced beyond their natural biogeographic limits (Jenkins &amp; Keller 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
