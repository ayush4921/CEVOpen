<p>New approaches will be needed if quantitative trait information is to make a useful contribution in the WRA process. For instance, it may be necessary to devise threshold values for key traits, such as SLA or height, above which species, genera, or families of plants are deemed potentially too likely to exhibit invasive behavior in certain environmental contexts. This could be achieved using data held within large-scale trait databases (e.g., TRY) (Kattge et al. 
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; LEDA: Kleyer et al. 2008) or through targeted sampling of particularly problematic groups of plants (e.g., pines or acacias).
