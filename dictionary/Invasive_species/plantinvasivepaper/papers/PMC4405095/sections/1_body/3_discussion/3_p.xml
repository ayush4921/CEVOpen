<p>A shift to higher SLA values in invasive species relative to naturalized species reflects differences in the types of strategies used to capture and deploy essential plant resources (e.g., carbon, nitrogen) between these 2 groups. High SLA values are associated with faster growth rates in invaders, particularly in the seedling stage (Grotkopp et al. 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and are characteristic of species at the acquisitive end of the leaf economic spectrum, which tend to deploy leaves that are rapidly turned over and relatively cheap in terms of carbon to construct (Wright et al. 
 <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). A capacity for rapid growth and tissue turnover may predispose species to becoming invasive by allowing them to more efficiently outcompete extant vegetation, particularly in early successional or disturbed environments. A range of studies reports higher values of SLA for invasive species relative to co-occurring native species in the field across a range of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes (Baruch &amp; Goldstein 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Lake &amp; Leishman 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Leishman et al. 
 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, we found no experimental manipulations reported to date that specifically compare SLA between naturalized and invasive species, despite this being important for understanding the dynamics of the invasion continuum.
