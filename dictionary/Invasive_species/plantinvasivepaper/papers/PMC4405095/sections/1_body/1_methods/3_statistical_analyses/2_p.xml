<p>We also investigated the correlation structure between trait variables with Pearson correlation coefficients (
 <italic>r</italic>). This analysis was conducted to examine the independence of the trait variables with the expectation that each trait would explain an independent aspect of invasion success. Data for the 8 traits for all naturalized and invasive species were aggregated and correlation coefficients were calculated between each pairwise combination of traits. All analyses were made in SPSS (version 21; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) and were considered significant at Î± = 0.05.
