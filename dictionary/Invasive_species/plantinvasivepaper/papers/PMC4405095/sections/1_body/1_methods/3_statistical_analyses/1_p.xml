<p>We used a series of one-tailed, paired 
 <italic>t</italic> tests to quantify differences in trait values between naturalized and invasive congeneric pairs with similar residence times. One-tailed tests were chosen because our hypotheses were based on a priori assumptions about the direction of trait differences, such as invaders possessing higher SLA, or being taller on average, relative to their congeneric naturalized equivalent (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). All traits except flowering duration and biome occupancy were log
 <sub>10</sub> transformed before analysis to reduce skew in the raw data. Each naturalized and invasive species was used in only one congeneric pairing for any given trait; however, some pairings were used in more than one analysis across the 8 traits examined (Supporting Information).
