<p>We collated data on 5 functional traits (flowering duration, leaf size, maximum height, seed mass, SLA) and 3 native range characteristics (mean annual temperature range, mean annual precipitation range, biome occupancy) (hereafter referred to collectively as traits) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). These traits were chosen because they have been associated previously with invasion success in introduced plants (Reichard &amp; Hamilton
