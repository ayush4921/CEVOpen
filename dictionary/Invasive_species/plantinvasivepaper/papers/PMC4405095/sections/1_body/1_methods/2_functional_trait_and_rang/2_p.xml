<p>Data on flowering duration (112 species), maximum plant height (112 species), and leaf size (88 species) were compiled from online and published floras, taxonomic treatments, and published papers detailed in Supporting Information. Seed mass data were acquired from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew Seed Information Database (2008 [

 <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The SLA observations accessed from the TRY database were originally reported in 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">Poschold et al. (2003)</xref>, Sack and Frole (
 <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and Laughlin et al. (
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A mean value was calculated wherever multiple observations existed for a single species.
