<p>Why do some species become invasive when introduced to a novel environment, whereas others remain naturalized? This deceptively simple question lies at the heart of invasion science and is crucial in weed risk assessment (WRA), yet it lacks a comprehensive empirical answer. Since the 1990s progress toward understanding the invasion continuum (sensu Richardson et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) has largely been made by examining invasion correlates, such as propagule pressure (Lockwood et al. 
 <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), residence time (Wilson et al. 
 <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), phylogeny (Duncan &amp; Williams 
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Diez et al. 
 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Procheş et al. 
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and species’ traits and biogeography (Pyšek &amp; Richardson 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Leishman et al. 
 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Van Kluenen et al. 
 <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) in isolation, rather than together in a single analysis. As a result, robust conclusions about which species will make the shift from naturalized to invasive, and why, remain somewhat elusive (but see Milbau &amp; Stout 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Dawson et al. 
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In particular, studies that explicitly compare the traits of species which have become serious invaders with those that remain naturalized (i.e., self-sustaining populations which are yet to spread) are lacking, despite the insights that such comparisons may provide into this critical transition along the invasion continuum.
