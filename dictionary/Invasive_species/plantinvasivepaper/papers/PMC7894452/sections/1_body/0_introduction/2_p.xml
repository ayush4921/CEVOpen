<p>Rosmarinic acid (α-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid, RosA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) is a phenolic compound isolated from a variety of Labiatae herbs and has diverse immunoregulatory functions, such as antioxidant (Luft et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), anti-inflammatory (Rodriguez-Luna et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), antimicrobial (Benedec et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), antiviral (Swarup et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), antiallergic (Osakabe et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), antidiabetic (Berhow et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), antidepressant (Ito et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and antitumor activities (Anusuya and Manoharan 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Although such functions have been reported, very little is known regarding the multitargeted action of RosA in treating cardiovascular disease, especially in myocardial I/R injury. Therefore, in the current study, RosA was tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a myocardial I/R injury mouse model. Furthermore, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line subjected to simulated I/R were performed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of RosA.
