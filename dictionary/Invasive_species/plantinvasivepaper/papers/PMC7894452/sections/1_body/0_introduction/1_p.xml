<p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is myocardial necrosis caused by acute, persistent ischaemia and hypoxia within the coronary arteries (Lai et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Reperfusion treatment is the primary therapeutic intervention in the treatment of AMI. However, blood pressure drops, cardiac dysfunction and other phenomena that occur after blood flow recovery restore cardiac function but aggravate cardiac dysfunction and can induce structural impairment, such as myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (Frank et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that myocardial injury caused by reperfusion injury accounts for more than 50% of total myocardial injury following recovery of blood flow (Hausenloy and Yellon
