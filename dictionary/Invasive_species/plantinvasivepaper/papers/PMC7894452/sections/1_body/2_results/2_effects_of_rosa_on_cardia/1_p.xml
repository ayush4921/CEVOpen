<p>After I/R treatment, echocardiographic examinations were used as non-invasive methods to detect mouse cardiac function. Normal cardiac function can be evaluated by EF (EF ≥ 55%) (Sweitzer et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and FS (FS ≥ 25%) (Gardin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>, representative images of the M-mode echocardiography indicated that the Vehicle + I/R group showed impaired cardiac function compared to the sham group. RosA markedly increased the levels of EF (70.2 ± 10.0% vs. 46.8 ± 10.6%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref>) and FS (38.0 ± 11.0% vs. 19.6 ± 2.7%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(C)</xref>).
