<p>ACO is an important Fe-S protease found in cells. When its Fe-S active centre is damaged by myocardial I/R injury, it is attacked by ROS, which inactivate ACO (Sami et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Here, RosA was found to reduce oxidative inactivation of ACO in the myocardial I/R injury area in mice (7.6 ± 0.4 mU/mg protein vs. 4.2 ± 0.4 mU/mg protein,
