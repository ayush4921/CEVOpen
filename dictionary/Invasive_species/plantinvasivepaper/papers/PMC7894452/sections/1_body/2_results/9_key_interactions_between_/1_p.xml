<p>Utilizing the AutoDock Vina software, the free energy of the RosA compound bound to the active cavity of NF-κB p65 (RelA) protein was determined to be −7.2 kcal/mol. It is generally believed that, when the absolute value is greater than 7, the compound and protein are more likely to bind (Nagasundaram et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The combination mode is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10(A)</xref>. Accordingly, RosA was found to bind to the active site of the NF-κB p65 protein, forming six hydrogen bonds with the four amino acids ARG73, GLU162, ASN139, and HIS142 near the active site. These hydrogen bonding interactions served as the most important forces between the NF-κB p65 protein and RosA (
