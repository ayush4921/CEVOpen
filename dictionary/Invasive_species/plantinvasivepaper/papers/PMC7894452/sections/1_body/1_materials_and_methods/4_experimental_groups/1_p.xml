<p>According to preliminary experimental data, 100 mg/kg of RosA was used 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in accordance with previous studies in which 100 mg/kg of RosA was determined to confer a cardioprotective effect (Noguchi-Shinohara et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The mice were randomly subdivided into 4 groups: (1) Vehicle; (2) RosA; (3) Vehicle + I/R; and (4) RosA + I/R. Accordingly, 50 μM of RosA was used 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, in accordance with previous studies (Diao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Han et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The cells were then randomly subdivided into 4 groups: (1) Vehicle; (2) RosA; (3) Vehicle + OGD/R; and (4) RosA + OGD/R.
