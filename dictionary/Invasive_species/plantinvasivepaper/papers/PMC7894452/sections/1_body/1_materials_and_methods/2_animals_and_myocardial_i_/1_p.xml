<p>C57BL/6J male mice that were 6–8 weeks old and weighed 18–22 g were purchased from the Animal Experimental Centre of the Air Force Medical University. All of the experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of AFMU. The protocol was performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were anaesthetised with 2% isoflurane inhalation, a skin incision was made at the left chest, and a small hole was made at the fourth intercostal space. Subsequently, the pleural membrane and pericardium were opened with a clamp, and the heart was then gently ‘popped out’ through the hole. The left main descending coronary artery (LCA) was sutured and ligated using a 6–0 silk suture, and the heart was immediately replaced into the intrathoracic space following ligation. The mice were subjected to myocardial ischaemia for 30 min, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Mice in the sham group underwent the same surgery, but the LCA was not occluded.</p>
