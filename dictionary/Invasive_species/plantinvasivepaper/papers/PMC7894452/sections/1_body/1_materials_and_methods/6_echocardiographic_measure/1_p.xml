<p>Echocardiographic views were acquired with the Vevo2100 (Visual Sonics Int., Toronto, Canada) 24 h after surgery. The mice were anaesthetised with 2% isoflurane inhalation with an isoflurane delivery system (Viking Medical, Medford, NJ, USA) during echocardiographic examination. In M-mode, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameters (LVESD), posterior wall diastolic thickness (PWT, d), and posterior wall systolic thickness (PWT, s) were measured (Gardin et al.
