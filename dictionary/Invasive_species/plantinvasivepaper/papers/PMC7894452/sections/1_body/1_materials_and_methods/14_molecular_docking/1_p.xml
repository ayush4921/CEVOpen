<p>ChemBioDraw Ultra software, version 17.0, was used to draw the structure of RosA, which was then converted into a three-dimensional structure and optimized using the MMFF94 force field. The three-dimensional structure of RelA (transcription factor p65, also known as nuclear factor NF-κB p65 subunit, a protein encoded by the 
 <italic>RelA</italic> gene in humans) was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The three-dimensional structure of RelA (PDB ID: 6GGR) was used as the protein for docking in this project. Both NF-κB and RosA were converted into PDBQT format using AutodockTools software, version 1.5.6. Autodock Vina software, version 1.1.2, was used for molecular docking research. The coordinates of the NF-κB active site were as follows: centre_X= −10.733, centre_Y = 12.416, centre_Z = 68.829; size_X = 20, size_Y = 20, and size_Z = 20. To increase accuracy, the parameter exhaustiveness was set to 20. Unless otherwise specified, all of the other parameters were set to default values. Finally, conformation with the highest score was selected, and the results were analyzed using Free Maestro software, version 11.9.
