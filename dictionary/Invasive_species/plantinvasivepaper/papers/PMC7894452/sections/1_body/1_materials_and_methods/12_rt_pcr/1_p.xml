<p>Total RNA was extracted using a Total RNA Kit (Tsingke Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Reverse transcription (RT) of mRNA was conducted via a standard reaction using a FastKing RT Kit (Tsingke Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Real-time PCR was performed using Fast qPCR Mix (SYBR Green I) (Tsingke Biological Technology, Beijing, China). The RT-PCR reaction was performed in a 20 μL system containing cDNA template and 10 μM forward and reverse primers. Primers for 
 <italic>ogdh</italic> and 
 <italic>gapdh</italic> were designed (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). RT-qPCR was performed using an ABI StepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems) followed by a melting curve analysis with the following cycling program: initial activation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 48 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s. The results for each gene were normalized to Gapdh messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, which were measured in parallel in each sample.
