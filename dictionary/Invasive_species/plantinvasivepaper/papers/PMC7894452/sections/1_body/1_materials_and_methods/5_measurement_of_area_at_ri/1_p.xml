<p>To obtain samples for infarct size analysis, mouse hearts were briefly perfused with 3% Evans blue in normal saline and then removed. Subsequently, the LV tissue was frozen and cut into 6 slices along the horizontal axis. The heart sections were then incubated with 1% TTC in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 37 °C) for half an hour in the dark. After staining with TTC, red areas in the heart indicated ischaemic but viable tissue, while pale areas represented infarcted myocardium. Images pertaining to Evans blue and TTC dyeing results were obtained with a macrolens. Infarct area sizes were determined using Image-Pro software. The size of the infarction area was calculated as the infarct area divided by the area at risk (IF/AAR).</p>
