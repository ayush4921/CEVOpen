<p>Cells of the cardiac muscle cell line HL-1 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and penicillin (100 U/mL) at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. HL-1 cells were processed under conditions of oxygen glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R) to induce a simulated ischaemia/reperfusion injury model 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cells were exposed to hypoxia for 6 h in low-glucose DMEM, after which hypoxia was induced in a hypoxia incubator chamber saturated with a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and N
 <sub>2</sub> balance. Non-OGD control groups were maintained at normoxia in high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS. Subsequently, all of the sample groups were reoxygenated in a 21% O
 <sub>2</sub>/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>/N
 <sub>2</sub> balance and resupplied with nutrients in high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS.
