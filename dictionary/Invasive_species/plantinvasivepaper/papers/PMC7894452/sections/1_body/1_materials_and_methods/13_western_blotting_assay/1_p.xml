<p>The protein concentration of each sample was measured using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were separated via 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk at room temperature for 2 h and then with primary antibodies (targeting p-NF-κB, p-IκB-a, NF-κB, IκB-a, OGDH and β-actin) at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunolabeled proteins were detected using ECL-Plus reagent, and blots were analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
