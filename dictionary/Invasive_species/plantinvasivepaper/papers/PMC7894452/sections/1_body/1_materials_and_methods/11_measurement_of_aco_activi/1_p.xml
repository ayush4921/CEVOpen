<p>Enzyme activity was evaluated in 800 
 <italic>g</italic> of supernatant from heart extract (initial recommendation = 40 mg) or cell extract (initial recommendation = 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells). The reaction mix was added and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min, after which the developer was added and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. ACO activity was determined using a microplate reader at an optical density of 450 nm. The absorbance (A1) at 240 nm was then measured for 10 s, and the sample was quickly placed at 25 °C for 5 min, after which the cuvette was quickly removed and wiped dry. The absorbance (A2) was recorded at 5 min, and ΔA = A1-A2 was calculated. Additionally, the activity of ACO was computed according to the sample protein concentration (mU/mg prot) = 555.55 × ΔA ÷ Cpr × N. Cpr1: sample protein concentration, mg/mL; N: dilution factor; ΔA: difference in absorbance between two times.
