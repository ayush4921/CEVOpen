<p>The body’s oxidative function can be reflected by changes in ROS. ROS determination can be used to measure oxidative tissue and cell damage (Qiu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and previous studies have reported that RosA has a powerful antioxidation effect. Thus, DHE-ROS was adopted to detect the oxidation state of myocardial tissue and cells. Simply stated, the DHE-ROS detection kit detects active oxygen utilizing the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium. DHE is freely accessible to the cell through the living cell membrane and is oxidized by ROS in the cell to form ethidium oxide, which can mix with chromosomal DNA to produce red fluorescence. It is possible to estimate the amount of ROS and change in its content in cells according to the red fluorescence produced in living cells (Hardy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Accordingly, the obtained results demonstrated that RosA could reduce ROS generation in the myocardial I/R injury area and after cell OGD/R injury. Aconitase (ACO) is an important iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protease in cells that is attacked by ROS when its Fe-S active centre undergoes I/R injury, leading to ACO oxidative inactivation (Lou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). According to aconitase detection, RosA was found to alleviate oxidative inactivation of ACO in the myocardial I/R injury area in mice and after cell OGD/R injury. The above experiments verified that the myocardial protective effect of RosA is closely correlated with a reduction in ROS generation.
