<p>NF-κB p65 (RelA) is a primary member of the NF-κB family and is a nuclear transcription factor for the NF-κB signalling pathway (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In the unstimulated state, p65, under regulation of the inhibitory factor IκB, forms a complex dimer located in the cytoplasm, existing in a resting state. After the cell is exposed to an external stimulus that leads to enzymatic dissociation of the inhibitor IκB, NF-κB p65 is activated and released. After nuclear transfer, it can be combined with the promoter region of the ogdh gene to initiate and regulate gene transcription (Shen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Therefore, the expression levels of p-NF-κB and p-IκB were detected at the cellular level, and it was found that RosA could reduce the expression levels of the key proteins p-NF-κB and p-IκB in the NF-κB signalling pathway following OGD/R injury.
