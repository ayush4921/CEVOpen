<p>To further confirm the interaction between RosA and NF-κB protein, AutoDock Vina software was used for molecular docking. Here, it was found that the free energy of the active cavity of RosA and the key protein NF-κB p65 was −7.2 kcal/mol, suggesting that RosA was closely bound to the surface of the key protein NF-κB p65, with adequate spatial matching between the two. Moreover, RosA bound to the active site of NF-κB p65, forming six hydrogen bond interactions with the four amino acids ARG73, GLU162, ASN139 and HIS142 near the active site. These hydrogen bond interactions constitute the main acting force between NF-κB protein and RosA, thus forming a stable compound. The aforementioned molecular docking study could provide a reasonable explanation for the interaction between NF-κB protein and RosA.</p>
