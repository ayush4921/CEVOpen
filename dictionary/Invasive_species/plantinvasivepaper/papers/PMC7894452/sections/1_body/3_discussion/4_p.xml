<p>Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) is a key control point in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and serves as a main source of ROS generation in cells (Mailloux etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). qPCR and western blotting analysis showed that RosA reduced
