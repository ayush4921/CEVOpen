<p>In this study, we verified at the whole animal level that RosA has protective effects against ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Infarct size and cardiac function are clinically regarded as the main indices in evaluating the degree of myocardial I/R injury (Touboul et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). According to this study, RosA could reduce the myocardial infarction area, improve heart function, and relieve pathological injury in the myocardial infarction area. Additionally, myocardial cell arrangement in the RosA + I/R group was found to be relatively sparse, with clear stripes. No expansion of blood vessels or infiltration of inflammatory cells were found in the mesenchyme. Myocardial enzymes can serve as common indicators for the diagnosis of myocardial injury, and CK-MB is considered a diagnostic indicator of acute myocardial infarction (Yildiz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). cTnI is a regulatory protein in myocardial contraction and has greater sensitivity and specificity to myocardial injury than other myocardial enzymes (Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, LDH is a marker of myocardial injury (Jie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). RosA was found to significantly reduce these specific myocardial enzyme levels. Overall, RosA was shown to have significant protective effects in myocardial I/R injury.
