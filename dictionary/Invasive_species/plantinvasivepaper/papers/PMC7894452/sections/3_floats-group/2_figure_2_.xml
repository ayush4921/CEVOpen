  <p>Effects of RosA on myocardial infarct size. (A) Representative photomicrographs of heart sections stained with Evans blue and TTC for different treatment groups are shown. (B) AAR/LV was similar among groups. (C) Treatment with RosA markedly reduced the infarct size caused by myocardial I/R injury. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). Significance was determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 vs. Vehicle + I/R. AAR: area at risk; LV: left ventricle; IS: infarct size.
