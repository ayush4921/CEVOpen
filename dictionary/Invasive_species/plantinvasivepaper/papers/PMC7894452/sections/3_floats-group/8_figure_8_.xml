  <p>RosA reduced ogdh mRNA and protein levels. (A) RosA reduces ogdh mRNA levels in myocardial I/R area in mice. (B) RosA reduces OGDH protein levels in myocardial I/R area in mice. (C) Statistical results of RosA reducing OGDH protein levels in myocardial I/R area in mice. (D) RosA reduces ogdh mRNA levels after OGD/R injury in cells. (E) RosA reduces OGDH protein levels after OGD/R injury in cells. (F) Statistical results of RosA reducing OGDH protein levels after OGD/R injury in cells. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. (
