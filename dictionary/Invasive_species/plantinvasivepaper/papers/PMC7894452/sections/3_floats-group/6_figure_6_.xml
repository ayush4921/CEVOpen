  <p>Effects of RosA on ROS production. (A) Representative micrograph of RosA reducing ROS production in myocardial I/R area. Scale bar, 100 μm. (B) Representative micrographs of RosA reducing ROS production after OGD/R injury in cells. (C) Statistical results of RosA reducing ROS production in myocardial I/R area. (D) Statistical results of RosA reducing ROS production after OGD/R injury in cells. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Significance was determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. **
