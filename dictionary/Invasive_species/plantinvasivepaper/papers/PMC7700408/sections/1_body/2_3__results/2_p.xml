<p>Several males and females were dissected and mounted in Berlese medium for microscopic examination and photography, while others were preserved in alcohol. Specimens were identified by referring to Hauser [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Calabria et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both sexes: Body 2–3 mm long (female, some larger than male), pale brown with eyes red, with abdomen partly darkened dorsally. Male: One black spot at the apical part of each wing and two short black combs at the apex of 1st and 2nd fore tarsal segments (one comb on each segment). Female: Large ovipositor with many dark sclerotized teeth, ovipositor much longer (at least 6×) than spermatheca diameter (
