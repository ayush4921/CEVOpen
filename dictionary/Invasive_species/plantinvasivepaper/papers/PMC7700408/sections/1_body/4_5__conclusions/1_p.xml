    <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (Diptera, Drosophilidae), an invasive pest of fruit and wine production, has established in the Russian Caucasus.

   <p>Our finding suggests that the Black Sea Coast of the Caucasus is a hotspot of biological invasions for insect pests to European Russia. There needs to be more attention given to invasive species in this region.</p>

   <p>Spotted-wing drosophila shows that if an insect species has established outside its native range, it could spread over different continents and become a global invader very quickly (in just ten years).</p>

   <p>The spotted-wing drosophila stayed unnoticed for several years after its establishment in the Caucasus. Therefore, it is quite possible that it has already established and remained undetected in other regions, and the current range of this invasive pest is more extensive than documented. To reveal the real range of this pest and to mitigate potential economic losses, surveys for this species should be conducted where possible.</p>

   <p>The existing system of plant quarantine could not prevent the spread of 
    <italic>D. suzukii</italic> neither within Europe nor on a global scale, as is the case with many other invasive pests in the last 10â€“20 years. It seems that a new global system of insect pest monitoring should be developed.
