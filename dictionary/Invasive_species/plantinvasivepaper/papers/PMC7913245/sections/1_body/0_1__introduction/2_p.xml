 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> (common name buffalobur) is a native species of the Mexican highlands [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which has invaded several countries worldwide, including Canada, China, Russia and Australia [

 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> is a diploid, summer-annual, self-compatible weed species with prickles on both leaves and stems. It is a noxious weed, as it grows aggressively following habitat disturbance [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and livestock abstains from grazing on vegetation where it grows as thorns cover the entire plant. In minor crops, such as watermelon (
 <italic>Citrullus lanatus</italic> Thunb.), onion (
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> L.), chickpea (
 <italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> L.) and tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.), for which chemical control options are poor and hand weeding is common practice, 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> thorns may increase the difficulty of this task.
