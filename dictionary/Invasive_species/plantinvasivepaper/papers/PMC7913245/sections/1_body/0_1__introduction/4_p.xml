<p>Studies relating to 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> management approaches are scarce, warranting research into optimal weed control strategies, especially herbicide application. In two field experiments conducted at Nebraska and Wyoming, broadleaf weed control was tested as part of an overall strategy to reduce 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> infestation in two summer cereal crops, proso (
 <italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic> L.) and foxtail millet (
 <italic>Setaria italica</italic> P. Beauv.) [

Treatments with carfentrazone-ethyl [protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor (group E), combined with either 2,4-D amine (auxin inhibitor; group O) or prosulfuron (acetolactate synthase inhibitor; group B), were highly effective in controlling 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> plants. In Israel, PPO inhibitors such as oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon are registered for use in both onion and tomato, while carfentrazone-ethyl is registered for use in chickpea. Although the oxyfluorfen or oxadiazon herbicide labels do not require the addition of a surfactant, previous research suggested that the effectiveness of PPO inhibitors may be ameliorated by the addition of a nonionic surfactant to the tank mix [
