<p>Although 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> is highly abundant in China, it is usually found in open, disturbed habitats, such as roadsides, fallow fields and field margins [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the US, this weed was reported as an agricultural pest in Oklahoma [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Nebraska and Wyoming [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Field experiments conducted in cotton (
 <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L.) fields in Oklahoma showed that crop plant heights were decreased at greater densities of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the same study, yield reduction was also observed, with a damage of 480 kg ha
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> at a weed density of 64 plants/10 m row. In Israel, 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> was first documented at the Jezreel Valley in 1953 [

 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> may appear in several germination flashes, starting from spring and continuing throughout the summer; thus, both young and mature plants may coexist at the same field. Different sensitivity levels between young and mature 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> plants can reduce the effectiveness of chemical weed control.
