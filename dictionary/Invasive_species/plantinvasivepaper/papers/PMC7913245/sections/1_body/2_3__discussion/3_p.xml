<p>One of the most successful integrated weed management approaches is the use of different herbicides in combination with smart crop rotation. Crop rotation is a highly important component of good agricultural practice and can be used to increase productivity and optimize weed control. For instance, nonlegume crop yield can be improved by introducing a legume into the cropping sequence. In comparison to a continuous cotton or wheat-cotton sequence, growing cotton in rotation with vetch (
 <italic>Vicia sativa</italic> L.), led to a 20% increase in lint yield, even in the absence of N fertilizer [

 <italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> L.), yield was 5% higher after introduction of pea (
 <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L.), as compared to maize, as a sequence crop [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Crop rotation may also be used to reduce weed infestation. A sequence of corn–soybean vs. soybean–soybean crop was shown to decrease

 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, crop rotation with no proper weed management approaches may not be very efficient in reducing weed density [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the chemical management tools that were successful in this study should be combined with adequate crop rotation, in order to reduce 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> threat. For instance, using metribuzin in tomato, followed by clopyralid in onion and carfentrazone-ethyl in chickpea, may serve as a long-term crop-herbicide combination that can effectively control 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> in these fields. Besides the crops mentioned above, as a summer irrigated crop, corn (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) is also an important part of crop rotation in the Israeli agriculture [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> shows no marked effect on corn yield, it can be found in high densities at field margins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00284-f001">Figure 1</xref>d), where it may enrich the field seed bank for upcoming years. Moreover, this study included herbicides that are registered for use in corn, such as tembutrione. High effectiveness of this herbicide in controlling 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic>, mainly at the 4–5 cm growth stage, may serve as an advantageous tool to prevent further buildup of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> field populations.
