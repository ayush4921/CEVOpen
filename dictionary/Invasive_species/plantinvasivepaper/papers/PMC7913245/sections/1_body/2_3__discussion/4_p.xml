<p>In conclusion, the presented experiments identified several herbicides with varying levels of efficacy, dependent on the plant growth stage, tested on plants from two geographically distinct 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> population. In addition, the combination of PPO inhibitors with surfactant increased the susceptibility of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> to herbicides, even at a later growth stage, increasing the overall efficacy of oxadiazon and oxyfluorfen. These findings should be further evaluated under field conditions in order to validate their efficacy. Other approaches, such as nonchemical weed management tools, should also be explored to prevent future damage of agricultural habitats by 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic>.
