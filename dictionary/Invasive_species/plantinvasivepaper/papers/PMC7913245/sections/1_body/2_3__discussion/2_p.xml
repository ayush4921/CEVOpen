<p>Surfactants increase herbicide activity as they reduce the droplet surface tension, thus increasing herbicide permeability and mobility through the leaf cuticular layer [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Surfactant interactions with both the herbicide and leaf cuticle may differ as a function of their electrical charge (nonionic, ionic and anionic), thereby generating various levels of synergism. Several herbicides, such as the acetolactate inhibitors trifloxysulfuron-methyl [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], require the addition of surfactant to the spraying tank mix. In this study, the effect of surfactant addition on oxadiazon and oxyfluorfen efficacy in larger size (8â€“9 cm tall) 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> plants, was evaluated. Overall, addition of the surfactant induced a synergistic effect, manifesting by higher herbicide activity (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, different surfactant concentrations showed diverse synergism levels. For oxadiazon, the lower concentration provided better outcomes, while for oxyfluorfen, the higher surfactant concentration was more effective. Previous studies have demonstrated the synergistic effect of herbicide and surfactant combinations [
