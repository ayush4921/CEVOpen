<p>In this work, plants of two different populations were treated with several herbicides at two growth stages. As evident from the presented data, growth stage had a significant effect on herbicide control of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic>. The fact that growth stage has a significant effect on herbicide efficacy is known and was shown for both crop and weed plant species [

 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, as 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> may germinate in several germination flashes throughout the season, both young and mature plants can coexist in the same field, thereby reducing the overall efficacy of herbicide treatment. Thus, herbicides that effectively control a wider range of growth stages are more desirable for the farmer.
