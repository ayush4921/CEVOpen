<p>Experiments were carried out in the summer of 2020, in a greenhouse at the Newe-Yaar Research Center, under natural conditions. Plants from both GY and GO populations were sprayed when reaching heights of 4–5 cm and 8–9 cm. Experiments were spaced in time such that plants from the first group (4–5 cm) were sprayed two weeks prior to plants from the second group (8–9 cm). Plants were treated with eight different herbicides at the recommended field rate as specified in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, using a chain-driven sprayer delivering 300 L ha
 <sup>−1</sup>, with a flat-fan 8001E nozzle (TeeJet
 <sup>®</sup>, Spraying Systems Co., Wheaton, IL, USA). All experiments were arranged in a fully randomized-factorial design, with eight to ten replicates for each treatment. Shoot fresh weight of each plant was recorded 21 days after treatment (DAT).
