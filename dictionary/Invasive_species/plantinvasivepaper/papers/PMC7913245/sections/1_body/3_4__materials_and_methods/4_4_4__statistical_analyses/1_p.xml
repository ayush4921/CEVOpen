<p>Shoot fresh weight data were analyzed using ANOVA in JMP (ver. 15) statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data was visualized using SigmaPlot (ver. 13) software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality were met using Levene′s tests. For both experiments, i.e., the response of GO and GY populations to herbicide treatments at different growth stages and the synergistic effect of surfactant application, interactions between experimental parameters were observed. Thus, data from each experiment were analyzed separately as experiment-by-treatment. For all experiments, shoot fresh weight was analyzed as percent of untreated control. All parameters were subjected to one-way ANOVA and means were separated using the Tukey-HSD test (
