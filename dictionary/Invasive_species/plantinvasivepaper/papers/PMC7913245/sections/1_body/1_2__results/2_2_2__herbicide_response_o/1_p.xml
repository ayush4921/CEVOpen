<p>The same trend of herbicide response was recorded for plants of the GY population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00284-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b). As in the case of GO plants, clomazone, clopyralid and rimsulfuron, showed low efficacy on GY plants treated at the 4–5 cm growth stage. However, in contrast to the GO responses, clomazone was more effective than clopyralid, as exhibited by the mean shoot fresh weight values of 36.5% vs. 60.1%, respectively, as compared to untreated controls (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Plants treated at the 8–9 cm growth stage showed low response to herbicides, with mean shoot fresh weights not dropping below 40% for most treatments (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The only herbicides that induced shoot fresh weight reductions below 40% were the two PPO inhibitors, oxadiazon and carfentrazone ethyl (30.5% and 0.3%, respectively).
