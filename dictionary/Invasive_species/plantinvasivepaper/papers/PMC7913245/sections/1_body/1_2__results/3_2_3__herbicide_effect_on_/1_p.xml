<p>A negative correlation between plant growth stage and herbicide efficacy was recorded in both GY and GO populations for all herbicides, except for carfentrazone-ethyl (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with lower control rates observed when plants were sprayed at later growth stage (8–9 cm). However, the GY population response to rimsulfuron showed an opposite trend when plants were treated at the 8–9 cm growth stage; plants exhibited lower shoot fresh weight as compared to plants treated at the 4–5 cm growth stage.
