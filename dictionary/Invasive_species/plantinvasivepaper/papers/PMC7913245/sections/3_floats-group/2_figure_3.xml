  <p>Shoot fresh weight (% of control) of 
   <italic>Solanum rostratum</italic> plants from the Givat Yoav population treated with the recommended field rate of various herbicides at the 4–5 cm (
   <bold>a</bold>) and 8–9 cm (
   <bold>b</bold>) growth stages. Shoot fresh weight was recorded 21 days after herbicide application. Different uppercase letters indicate statistically significant differences among treatments, as determined by a Tukey–Kramer HSD test (α = 0.05).
