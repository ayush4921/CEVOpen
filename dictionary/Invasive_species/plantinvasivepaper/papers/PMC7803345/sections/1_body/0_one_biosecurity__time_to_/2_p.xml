<p>These sectorial divisions appear not to recognise the fundamental similarities in the processes underpinning biological invasions whether they relate to plant, animal, or human health and this may, in part, reflect the lack of cross-disciplinary thinking among the research community [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent assessments have pointed out similar dramatic increases in the rate at which plants, animals and microorganisms have been transported around the world over the last 100 years [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although SARS-CoV-2 has prompted a re-appraisal of human diseases as biological invasions [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], this underplays the fact that some of the earliest invasive alien species were undoubtedly the parasites and pathogens of humans [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The causative agent of leprosy (
 <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>) appears to have originated in Eastern Africa or the Near East over 2000 years ago and subsequently spread with successive human migrations to Europe and Asia, then with European colonists who introduced leprosy into West Africa and the Americas in the 18th century and the Pacific in the 19th century [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Viral diseases such as smallpox, measles, mumps, and polio have undergone a similar trajectory, moving across the globe within a few centuries in the wake of international trade [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the global distribution of many zoonotic livestock diseases that are infectious to humans, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, Q fever, and anthrax, have been facilitated by human trade in poultry, cattle, pigs, and horses [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the global redistribution of pathogens, parasites, plants, and animals should all be viewed as biological invasions [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and since they share many fundamental aspects of their spatial and temporal dynamics [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] a more integrated approach to biosecurity is warranted.
