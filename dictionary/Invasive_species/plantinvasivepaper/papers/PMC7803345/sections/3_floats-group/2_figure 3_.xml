  <title>Network diagram describing the links captured by the scientific literature addressing the topics of human health (H), animal health (A), plant health (P), and environmental health (E).</title>
  <p>The size of the circles is proportional to the number of papers published on that topic while the size of the arrows is proportional to the number of papers that address the two adjoining topics. Data are from a literature search using Web of Science over the period 1980–2019 undertaken on 21/08/20 using the individual search terms ‘human health’, ‘animal health’, ‘plant health,’ and ‘environmental health’ either on their own or in pairs.</p>
