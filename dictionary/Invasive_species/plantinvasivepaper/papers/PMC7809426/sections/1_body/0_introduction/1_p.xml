 </sup>. One of the major factors implicated in pollinator declines is the reduction of floral resources due to agricultural intensification and habitat loss

 </sup>. Across Europe, the dominant land use is agriculture, with over half of the European landscape being managed agriculturally

 </sup>. Agricultural land is therefore a focus of conservation efforts to prevent the loss of associated biodiversity

 </sup>. The input of inorganic nitrogen, re-seeding of grassland leys, high levels of grazing, and herbicide application can all cause species-rich, semi-natural grassland to become improved grassland, with a corresponding reduction in the diversity and availability of flowers used by pollinating insects for nectar and pollen

 </sup>. In England and Wales, the proportion of lowland semi-natural grassland has been estimated to be 3% of what was present prior to 1939
