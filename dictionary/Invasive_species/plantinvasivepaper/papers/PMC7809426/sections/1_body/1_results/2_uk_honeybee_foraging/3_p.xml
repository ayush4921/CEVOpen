 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">Supplementary Data</xref>). However, after Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing none of the 22 taxa remained significant. The relationship between the plant composition of the honey and the dominant surrounding habitat class was significant however habitat class explained only 3% of the total variation (Supplementary Fig.
