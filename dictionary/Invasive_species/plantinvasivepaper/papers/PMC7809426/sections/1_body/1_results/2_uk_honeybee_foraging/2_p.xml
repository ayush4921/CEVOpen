<p id="Par8">Brambles (
 <italic>Rubus</italic> spp.) were both the most frequently found and abundant species within the honey samples, followed by white clover (
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic>) and 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> species. The 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> species include the crop, oilseed rape (
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic>), along with other wild and cultivated 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> species. The high frequency of these taxa across the honey reflects their long flowering period, with these plant groups appearing at high levels from May to September (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The next most frequently found and abundant plants were spring-flowering shrubs and trees, including hawthorn (
 <italic>Cratageus monogyna</italic>), apple (
 <italic>Malus</italic> spp.), 
 <italic>Cotoneaster</italic> spp., sycamore and maples (
 <italic>Acer</italic> spp.), and cherries and plums (
 <italic>Prunus</italic> spp.). Towards the end of the season (peaking in September), heather 
 <italic>(Calluna vulgaris</italic>) and the non-native invasive species, Himalayan balsam (
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic>) were found abundantly within honey samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Pollen identified in honey collected in 2017 reflects the seasonal changes in the plants available to the honeybees, with calendar month (April–October), being a good predictor of plant taxa composition (Fig.
