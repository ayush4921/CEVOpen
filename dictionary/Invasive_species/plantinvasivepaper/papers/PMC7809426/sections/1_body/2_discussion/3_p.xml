 <italic>Vicia faba</italic>) are another insect attractive species that have increased in production. However, the overall frequency of 
 <italic>Vicia</italic> species within the honey was found to have decreased from 32 to 23%, reflecting the decline in wild vetches, which are a common component of species-rich grasslands

 </sup>. As a major component of the honey, 
 <italic>Vicia</italic> species have increased in frequency from 2 to 5%. with one possibility being that where there has been an increase in the availability of the field bean crop, honeybees will use them as a major honey source.
