<p id="Par29">Illumina MiSeq paired-end indexed amplicon libraries were created via a two-step PCR protocol. Two libraries were prepared for the DNA barcode regions, 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> and ITS2. Initial amplification used the template specific primers 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>af and 
 <italic>rbcLr</italic>506

 </sup>, and ITS2F and ITS3R, with universal tails designed to attach custom indices in the second-round PCR. To improve clustering on the Illumina MiSeq, a 6N sequence was also added between the forward template specific primer and the universal tail.
