<p>The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were tested by a chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system (CF imager, Technical Ltd., Colchester, UK). Before each test of the minimum fluorescence (F
 <sub>o</sub>) and maximum fluorescence (F
 <sub>m</sub>), the leaves were dark-adapted for 20 min. The maximum quantum yield (F
 <sub>v</sub>/F
 <sub>m</sub>) of PSII photochemistry was calculated using the following formula: (F
 <sub>m</sub>—F
 <sub>o</sub>)/F
 <sub>m</sub>. The steady-state fluorescence (F
 <sub>s</sub>) and the maximum fluorescence (F
 <sub>m</sub>’) in the light-adapted state were measured at 800 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup> PPFD. The actual photochemical efficiency (Φ
 <sub>PSII</sub>) was calculated as Φ
 <sub>PSII</sub> = (F
 <sub>m</sub>’—F
 <sub>s</sub>)/F
 <sub>m</sub>’.
