<p>Enzymatic antioxidants including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX were determined according to the methods of Tan et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Du et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and Nakano and Asada [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], respectively, with slight modifications. SOD activity was measured by examining its ability to inhibit the photoreduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). Each 3 mL assay mixture contained: phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH 7.8), 20 μM riboflavin, 130 mM methionine, 0.1 μM EDTA, 750 mM NBT, and 100 μL of enzyme extract. The absorbance of the samples was recorded at a wavelength of 560 nm. The reaction solution for POD activity comprised phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0), 30 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, guaiacol, and 100 μL of enzyme extract. The enzyme activity was estimated by recording the increase in absorbance at 470 nm every 15 s for 3 min. The CAT activity was measured by catalyzing the breakdown of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at 240 nm during 2 min. A final volume of 3 mL of assay mixture included 30 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 100 μL of enzyme extract. For the estimation of APX activity, reaction ingredients were composed of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM AsA, and 20 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the reaction was started after which 100 μL of enzyme extract was added, and the change in absorbance at 290 nm was recorded for 1 min.
