<p>Cell membrane leakage was measured by a DDS-11C conductometer (Shanghai Dapu Instruments) as described by Zheng et al., with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Three 0.8-cm-diameter leaf discs were incubated in 5 mL of distilled water for 3 h. Then, the samples were boiled for 30 min. The cell membrane leakage rate was calculated according to the formula: (R1/R2) Ã— 100%, where R1 and R2 are the initial conductivity and electrolyte conductivity, respectively.
