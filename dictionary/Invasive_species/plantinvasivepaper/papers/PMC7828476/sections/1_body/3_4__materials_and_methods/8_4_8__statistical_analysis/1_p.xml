<p>In this experiment, all of the measurements are shown as the means ± standard errors (SEs) of at least three biological replicates. Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by using IBM SPSS
 <sup>®</sup> Statistics (Version 19.0, IBM Corporation, New York, NY, USA). Two-tailed Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the response of two Sphagneticola species under HT treatments. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant if the 
 <italic>p</italic> value was less than 0.05 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). OriginPro (Version 8.0, OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) and Adobe Photoshop CC (Version 2014, Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) software were used for regression analyses and image processing, respectively.
