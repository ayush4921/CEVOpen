<p>Generally, ROS are produced in cell under a variety of environmental stress conditions, which can lead to oxidative stress in plants. The histochemical staining results showed that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> accumulated in the leaves of the 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> was more than that of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> under HT treatment, and was mainly distributed at the leaf base region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> content in two Sphagneticola species was further quantified using a colorimetric assay. We found that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> content was also significantly increased in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) while slightly increased in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the two Sphagneticola species increased upon exposure to high temperature, and the change ranges of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (15.9%) was much smaller than that of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (134.5%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). It was also found that the membrane leakage rate increased in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> by 29.8%, whereas there was no significant difference in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f003">Figure 3</xref>D).
