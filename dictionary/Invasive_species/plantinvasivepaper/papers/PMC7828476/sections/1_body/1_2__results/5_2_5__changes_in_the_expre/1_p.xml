<p>The expression of genes encoding photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes was measured by the method of qRT-PCR. The results showed that the expression levels of photosynthesis-related genes, including 
 <italic>PsbP</italic>, 
 <italic>PsbA</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rubisco L</italic>, were slightly increased in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> under HT treatment, but there were no significant differences in all of them. In contrast, the transcript levels of photosynthesis-related genes decreased by 1.6–7-fold in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> under HT treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f005">Figure 5</xref>A–C). The expression pattern of antioxidant enzyme-related genes was similar to that of photosynthesis-related genes. Therefore, SOD, POD, CAT, and APX gene expression levels were also not significantly different in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>, while these levels were all decreased in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and the expression of CAT was most obviously decreased by approximately 27.0-fold under HT treatment compared to the control treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f005">Figure 5</xref>D–G). The expression of these key enzyme genes at the transcription level was consistent with a previous report related to photosynthetic capacity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) and antioxidant enzyme activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f004">Figure 4</xref>).
