<p>Under HT treatment, we found that there was a significant decrease reduction of 42.2% in net photosynthetic rate (P
 <sub>n</sub>) values of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in the P
 <sub>n</sub> values of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The photosynthetic efficiency of plants is closely related to the electron transfer of chloroplasts. With respect to the control treatment, we found that 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> showed decreases in maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F
 <sub>v</sub>/F
 <sub>m</sub>) of 48.5% and 1.4% under HT treatment, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). We also observed that the operational photochemical efficiency (Î¦
 <sub>PSII</sub>) increased in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> but was significantly inhibited in 
 <italic>S. calendulaceas</italic> with a decrease range of 24.6% during the exposure to high temperature (
