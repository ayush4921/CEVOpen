<p>The 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> and 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> herbivores exhibit behaviors that indicate direct competition, increases in damage from one occurs concomitantly with decreases in damage from the other [
 <xref rid="B57-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We believe the combined damage of these two insects is non-additive, and the plant mortality has been magnified because of the concomitant herbivory of both insects. The joint damage of these two insects has been the major cause of the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> plantsâ€™ extensive mortality on Guam and Rota. If both of these invasive insects can be removed from Guam and Rota, we believe the extent of damage from the remaining threats would be minimal, and recovery of the threatened tree species would begin.
