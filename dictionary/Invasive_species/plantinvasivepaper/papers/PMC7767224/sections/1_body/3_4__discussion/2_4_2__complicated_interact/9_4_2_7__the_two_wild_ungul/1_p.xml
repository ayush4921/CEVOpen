<p>The Philippine Deer (
 <italic>Rusa marianna</italic> Desmarest) was introduced to Guam in the 1700s as a wild hunting game [

The presence of deer in Guam’s forests is more damaging to general ecosystem function than the presence of pigs, with pigs providing an endozoochory function [
 <xref rid="B68-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. For 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> species recovery, the opposite is true. The deer herbivory is restricted to leaves and megasporophylls and seasons with severe drought, which are rare in Guam. In contrast, the pig herbivory includes leaves, stems, and seeds and is chronic. The recent shift in pig behavior such that standing stems are eaten despite no signs of previous stem borer damage indicates that pig damage has emerged as a new acute threat to the tree species’ survival.
