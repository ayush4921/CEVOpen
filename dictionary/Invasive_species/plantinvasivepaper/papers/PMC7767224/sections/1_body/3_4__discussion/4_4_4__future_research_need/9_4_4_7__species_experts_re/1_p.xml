<p>The observation that 
 <italic>O. rhinoceros</italic> has exhibited a recent host shift from 
 <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> L. to 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> throughout Guam [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] illuminates the need to have knowledgeable experts involved in all fieldwork associated with the conservation of this unique plant species. This nascent form of damage from a new pest went unnoticed until it was observable throughout the island primarily because the currently funded practitioners lack cycad expertise. The potential for another phytophagous insect invasion or development of an unprecedented novel interaction among the existing threats is substantial. Moreover, the original invasions of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> and 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> likely included a single subspecies from a single geographic origin. Both of these specialist insects have a wide indigenous range comprised of distinct subspecies from different geographic regions. The potential for a second invasion of a second subspecies remains as a potential threat from both of these insect species. If this were to occur, these two specialistsâ€™ genetic diversity would increase, which would subsequently increase the level of damage to the host tree. These developments will go unnoticed if species experts continue to be excluded from the conservation actions.
