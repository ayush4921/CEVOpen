 <italic>Cycas micronesica</italic> has been listed on the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) for five years [
 <xref rid="B72-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The direction of public funds for immediate conservation projects has focused on tree rescue from construction sites rather than the known threats to species survival [
 <xref rid="B37-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The ultimate planning for 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> recovery should embrace the need to conserve all native species that rely on the tree while eradicating or mitigating the non-native biotic threats.
