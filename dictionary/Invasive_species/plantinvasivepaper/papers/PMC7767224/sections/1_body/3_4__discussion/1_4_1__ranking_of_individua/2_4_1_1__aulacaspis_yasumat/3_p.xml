<p>The scale predator 
 <italic>Rhyzobius lophanthae</italic> Blaisdell (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was released in Guam in 2005 [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We have identified three limitations to the predatory success of this animal. First, the 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> individuals are so small that they can infest locations on 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> organ surfaces that the relatively large predator cannot access [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Second, the predator tends to avoid the plants’ lowest stratum for unknown reasons such that 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> infestations are uncontrolled on leaf, stem, and root surfaces near the ground [
 <xref rid="B41-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Third, the olfactory signals from 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> are less attractive to the predator when the infested leaves are from seedlings rather than adults [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These and other phenomena have limited this predator’s success in protecting the tree host from 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> damage.
