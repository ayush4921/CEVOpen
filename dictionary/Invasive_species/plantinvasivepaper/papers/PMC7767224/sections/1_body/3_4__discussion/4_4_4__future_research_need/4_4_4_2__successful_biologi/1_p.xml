<p>Successful biological control of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> is achievable but will require an integrated multi-year plan for funding the cumulative process. We have collected parasitoids from 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> leaves infested with 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> in the Philippines and Thailand where the armored scale does not threaten its host 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> trees, only to learn that they have not been described. The binomial is required to obtain an import permit, so these efficacious parasitoids cannot be introduced to Guam or Rota because they are unknown to science. An integrated funded program is needed to collect these parasitoids by cycad biologists, have them described by taxonomists, secure import permits with the new binomial, collect live animals by entomologists, then introduce and release them in Guam and Rota. This was proposed in 2017 as an urgent action for conserving
