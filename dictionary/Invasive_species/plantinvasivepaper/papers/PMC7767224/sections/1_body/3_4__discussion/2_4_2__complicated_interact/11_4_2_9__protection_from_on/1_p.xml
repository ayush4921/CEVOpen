<p>One factor that has protected Guam’s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> population from historical anthropogenic destruction is the steep topography of the coastal areas of occupancy. The relatively recent conversion of habitat to agriculture, military, and urban uses has decimated all native tree species’ populations on most of the northern Guam terrain, which is characterized as a tectonically uplifted plateau. The steep topography of the coastal regions has effectively protected 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> from this historical and ongoing anthropogenic damage. This form of topographic protection of threatened gymnosperms has been identified as a benefit to biodiversity in other geographic regions [
 <xref rid="B70-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The recent phytophagous insect invasions have effectively removed this long-established form of protection from anthropogenic damage, as the trees growing on unusable vertical cliff faces are as threatened by the herbivory as trees growing on flat terrain.
