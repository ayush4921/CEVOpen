<p>The extent of 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> damage is entirely under the control of stressors that reduce tree health. This native stem borer persisted with a compatible relationship with the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> population in Guam prior to the non-native insects’ invasions. Any abiotic or biotic stress or any combination of stressors can generate an irruption of 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> by causing individual trees’ suboptimal health. The most productive conservation approach for minimizing 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> damage is to mitigate the other threats to enable plant health recovery. This alone would mitigate the current 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> threat.
