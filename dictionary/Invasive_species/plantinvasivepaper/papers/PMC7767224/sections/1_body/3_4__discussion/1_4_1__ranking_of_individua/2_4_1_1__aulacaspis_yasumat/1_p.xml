<p>Most of the historical 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> mortality on the islands of Guam and Rota has been a result of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui.</italic> This armored scale was absent from both islands until 2003 when it was identified on Guam in a single urban landscape, then on Rota in a single outbreak site in 2007. The scale rapidly spread throughout both islands because of the population of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> and the widespread use of 
 <italic>Cycas revoluta</italic> Thunb. trees in the urban environments on both islands. Direct observations of efficacious biological control within the native range of this scale and damage comparisons among many 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species within a common garden setting indicate the damage of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> to 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> in Guam and Rota is due to the lack of biological control within these insular invaded habitats [
