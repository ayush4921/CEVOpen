<p>Conservationists are unable to turn off the tropical cyclones that define life on Guam and Rota. The use of guy wire anchors for the trees within in situ conservation plots to protect the trees from catastrophic wind damage was a crucial component of the management plan developed by four international 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> experts [
 <xref rid="B60-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The value of the engineered anchors for conserving the trees has been confirmed [
 <xref rid="B59-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. More research into the biomechanical and allometric traits of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems and roots may improve management decisions and provide knowledge that can be used in other islands where threatened native tree species must contend with frequent tropical cyclones. This abiotic stress will persist in Guam and Rota, and conservation managers must integrate the stress into all decisions.
