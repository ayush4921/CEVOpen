 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> was introduced to Guam as a farm animal hundreds of years ago [
 <xref rid="B50-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The wild pigs are a feral population that developed from these original farm animals. The nature of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stemsâ€™ direct consumption has changed since the invasions of the non-native insects, dramatically increasing the threats of this ungulate to the tree population. Historically, pig herbivory had damaged no standing stems, but pigs sometimes ate broken stems dislodged from trees during tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclone damage to the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees increased following several years of non-native insect herbivory, and the first behavior change of the pig population was to completely consume every stem section that was detached during tropical cyclones. The second major behavior change of the pig population was to begin consuming cortex tissue on standing trees. Initially, the only trees that were eaten exhibited copious signs of 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> larvae activity, and we believe this omnivore was attracted to the larvae as food. This behavior has shifted again in 2020. For the first time, the pig herbivory of standing 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees can be observed on trees with no signs of 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> activity (
