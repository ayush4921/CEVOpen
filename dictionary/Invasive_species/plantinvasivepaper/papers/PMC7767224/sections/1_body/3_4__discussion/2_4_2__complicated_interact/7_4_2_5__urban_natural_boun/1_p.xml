<p>In situ conservation cannot be understood in isolation from urban horticulture because phytophagous insects do not respect urban-natural boundaries. This reality is magnified for Guam’s conservation efforts because resident biologists with the greatest level of species expertise are restricted from studying areas of occupancy within military installations even though the biotic threats to endangered species do not respect the boundaries between federal and non-federal lands. The role of horticulture in the study of island invasions is pertinent because the horticulture trade is responsible for many invasions [

Moreover, urban forests can serve as conduits through which non-native species expand their invasive range from one area of occupancy to a second area of occupancy. Ill-educated conservation practitioners may inadvertently serve as vectors of cryptic insects from natural systems to conservation nurseries and from urban forests to in situ locations if the practitioners do not understand the insects’ life history.
