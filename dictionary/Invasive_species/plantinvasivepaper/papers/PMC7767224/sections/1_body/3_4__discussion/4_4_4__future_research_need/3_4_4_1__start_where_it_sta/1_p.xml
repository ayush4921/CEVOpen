<p>The 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> plants on Guam and Rota were not threatened prior to 2003 when the invasions were initiated. This case study illuminates that the best approach for sustaining an unthreatened status of native tree species at risk of herbivory is to prevent the invasions before they occur. The 2020 level of threat and the number of non-native herbivores throughout the indigenous range of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> occur in the sequence Yap &lt; Palau &lt; Rota &lt; Guam. Why are the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> populations in Yap and Palau persisting with no threats, but the populations in Guam and Rota suffering from acute threats? Numerous differences among these four geopolitical states may account for the disparity in contemporary threats, including volume of human travel, funding for adequate customs inspections, style of oversight by the federal governments, and conservation ethos of the residents [

The proficiency of the federal governments in each of these geopolitical states to accept and integrate international expert knowledge into conservation decisions may differ, creating an interesting case study to understand how federal policy-makers influence the successes or failures of conservation actions for a single threatened species that has a wide indigenous range [
