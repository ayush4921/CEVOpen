<p>Conservation of the relationships among 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> roots and the 
 <italic>Nostoc</italic> and mycorrhizae mutualists should embrace a holistic approach. One of the greatest benefits of in situ conservation is that ecological interactions and mutualisms may be conserved even if they have not been studied and are not understood [
 <xref rid="B75-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The Guam and Rota 
 <italic>C. micronesica Nostoc</italic> and mycorrhizae mutualists have not been adequately studied. Efforts to remove all non-native plant and animal species from habitats may allow the native root symbionts to restore the native mutualisms passively. For example, the prevalent invasive trees that have altered the Mariana Islands’ landscapes have been shown to change chemistry and mineralization biology of soils compared with adjacent native trees [

 <xref rid="B77-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. For this reason, one of the most essential endeavors when constructing the in situ plots for conserving 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> in northern Guam was exclusion of ungulates with fencing and removal of all non-native plant species [
 <xref rid="B60-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], as 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> L., 
 <italic>Leucaena leucocephala</italic> (Lam.) de Wit, and 
 <italic>Passiflora suberosa</italic> L. were present in high densities. Continued management of these plots must remain vigilant to ensure all non-native organisms remain excluded, enabling the passive conservation of the native edaphic mutualisms disrupted by the non-native ungulates and plants. This process may be slow, and the non-native plants’ sustained exclusion will be required for an extended period [

 <xref rid="B80-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The transplantation of a native species to a restoration site within the native range of the species should ensure the recipient site’s natural conditions are suitable for accepting the transplants [
 <xref rid="B81-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Many species transplant projects have been unsuccessful due to a lack of consideration that the recipient site should provide appropriate transplanted species conditions [
 <xref rid="B82-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The primary recipient site being used for rescued 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees in northern Guam is a degraded 
 <italic>Vitex parviflora</italic> Juss. forest, a conservation approach that has been discouraged because of the altered soil biology in the degraded site that may damage the rescued trees’ health [
