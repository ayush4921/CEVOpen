<p>The extent of 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> damage on Guam’s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees is controlled by antecedent 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> or 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> damage. Irruptions of the armored scale or leaflet consumption by the butterfly preemptively damage the leaves before reaching the age that is suitable for the 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> oviposition. After the initial spread of the leaf miner throughout Guam habitats in 2003–2004, the damage declined when the initial 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> outbreak occurred, then increased as the 
 <italic>R. lophanthae</italic> predation of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> began partial control of the scale [
 <xref rid="B57-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The nascent observations that 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> damage can be observed in 100% of the leaves on some 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees in 2020 may mean the combined damage of 
 <italic>A. yasumatusi</italic> and 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> has been declining in severity among the remaining living trees. Suppose the living trees were afforded some time to recover from the herbivory of all other consumers. In that case, we do not believe that sustained 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> damage would be a major threat to the tree population.
