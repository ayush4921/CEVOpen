<p>Our sustained direct observations among Guamâ€™s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> areas of occupancy and the urban landscapes have enabled an arbitration of the severity of each of the biotic threats to this unique native tree species. The plant organs consumed, the temporal versus chronic nature of the threat, and the lethality of damage contrast sharply among the herbivores. Over the past 17 years, our collective observations indicate that mitigation of these biotic threats comprises the only acute conservation need for reversing the plant mortality.
