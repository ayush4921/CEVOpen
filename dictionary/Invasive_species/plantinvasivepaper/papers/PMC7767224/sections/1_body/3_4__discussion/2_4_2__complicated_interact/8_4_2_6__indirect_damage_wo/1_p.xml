<p>The pachycaulous cycad stem is uniquely designed with a large primary thickening meristem and very few branches [
 <xref rid="B64-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In fact, more than half of Guam’s female 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees are unbranched [
 <xref rid="B65-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Stem height growth is relatively slow, averaging about 3 cm per year for Guam’s population [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These traits reveal that stem breakage is highly damaging to a cycad plant’s continued health. The recent breakage of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems near the soil surface has been associated with termite damage. The recent breakage of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems at higher strata has been associated with 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> damage. The loss of height by the tree impairs its competitive advantage among the sympatric trees, as hundreds of years of height growth may be lost on the single day of stem breakage. This case study provides a unique example where the insects’ direct herbivory may be less damaging than the indirect damage of stem breakage that results from the herbivory.
