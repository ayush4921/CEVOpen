<p>Continued research and conservation actions overseen by species experts are needed to fully understand this case study’s relevance to global conservation issues. An updated threat assessment by the IUCN is needed, as the last assessment was ten years ago [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A species recovery plan developed with expert knowledge is needed, as the addition of the species to the ESA was five years ago [
 <xref rid="B72-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and during those five years, 36% mortality of the 2015 cycad population has occurred [
 <xref rid="B63-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This unique gymnosperm tree was the most abundant tree on Guam in 2002 [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For this reason, many of the historical ecosystem services provided by the taxon could be considered as those of a foundation species [
 <xref rid="B94-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Based on the other organisms known to rely on the tree, these interdependencies can be used to consider the taxon as a keystone species [
 <xref rid="B94-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The list of threats on each of the islands with areas of occupancy are dissimilar, illuminating 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> as an excellent model for research designed to exploit the islands as natural experiments to more fully understand the role of fragmentation on biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B94-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The funding of knowledgeable experts will be required for these opportunities to be fully exploited. How each of the major threats leads to plant mortality has been well-researched. Still, a full understanding of the threats’ interactions will require sustained direct observations by species experts.
