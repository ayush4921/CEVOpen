<p>Non-native species may have benign or positive influences within their invaded territory. Distinguishing which invader species cause minimal effects from those that cause major effects is needed to formulate management decisions [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, one invader species’ direct negative influence on a native species is often studied in isolation, ignoring the probability that one invader interacts with other invader species [
 <xref rid="B53-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These and other complicating issues demand that conservation decision-makers embrace a more holistic approach to determining invasive species’ influences on biodiversity by ensuring contextual evaluations are conducted by knowledgeable scientists [
 <xref rid="B54-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This input of expert knowledge is critically important in conservation planning because of how complex the threats may be, the widespread lack of data, and the urgency with which mitigating actions need to be implemented [
