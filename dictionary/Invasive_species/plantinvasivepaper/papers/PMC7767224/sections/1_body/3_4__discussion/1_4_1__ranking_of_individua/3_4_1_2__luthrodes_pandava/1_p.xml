<p>The 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> specialist 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> does not pose a lethal threat when it is the only herbivore, but general plant vigor is damaged. This butterfly was in the Northern Mariana Islands of Rota, Saipan, and Tinian for many years before being identified in one northern Guam locality in 2005. The population spread throughout Guam along with 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>, with both insects often entering new localities at the same time. The fact that the larvae require young, expanding tissue is both a limitation to the herbivoreâ€™s population success and why the herbivory is so damaging to plant vigor. The larvae require leaf tissue for greatest performance, but we have observed larvae feeding on young cataphyll, megasporophyll, and microstrobili tissue when no expanding leaves are available. All 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species grow with ephemeral flushes of leaves separated by quiescent periods that may last more than one year. The entire expansion phase of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> leaves is about 30 d [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. If a gravid female 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> adult finds a leaf in the first week of expansion, the larvae will consume the entire leaf. If a gravid female adult finds a leaf in the second week of expansion, leaflets may be partially or entirely consumed, but rachis and petiole tissue is not consumed. Ovipositions that occur after two weeks may lead to partial leaflet herbivory but not complete leaflet consumption.
