<p>The consequences of non-native insect herbivores on a native host tree are not restricted to mortality. We have reported that chronic herbivory of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> by these non-native insects has caused reductions in stem carbon dioxide efflux [
 <xref rid="B90-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], has selectively killed more unbranched trees than branched trees to indicate more female trees have died than male trees [
 <xref rid="B65-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], has compromised the success rate of adventitious root formation on stem cuttings [
 <xref rid="B91-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and has reduced the rate of tree height growth [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Additionally, we have reported substantial changes in leaf litter chemistry following herbivory in a manner that predicts increased decomposition rates [
 <xref rid="B92-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The influences of these plant behavior changes on ecosystem traits need to be researched to fully understand how these non-native insects have influenced the host treeâ€™s insular habitats.
