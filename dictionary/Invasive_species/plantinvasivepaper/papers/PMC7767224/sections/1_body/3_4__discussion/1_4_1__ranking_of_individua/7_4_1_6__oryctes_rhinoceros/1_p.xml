<p>The invasion of Guam by the scarab beetle 
 <italic>Oryctes rhinoceros</italic> was first observed in 2007 [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Burrowing on stems of several non-native cycad species in a Guam garden was observed beginning in 2018, and burrowing on stems of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> throughout Guam was confirmed in 2020 [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The long-term threat that this new herbivore damage may exert on 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees is not known. Burrowing occurs in the mature cataphyll complex immediately before a primary growth event. Subsequent male cones and leaves emerge distorted without the radial symmetry that characterizes 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> organs’ primary growth; however, the cones and leaves can function despite the asymmetry. Moreover, when this beetle kills a stem’s apical meristem, the damage is lethal for palm species. In contrast, 
 <italic>de novo</italic> development of adventitious buds occurs on 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems, and these new buds enable new stem growth whenever the apical meristem is killed or removed from a tree [
