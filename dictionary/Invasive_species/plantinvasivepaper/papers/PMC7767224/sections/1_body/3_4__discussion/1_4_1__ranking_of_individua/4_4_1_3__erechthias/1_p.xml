<p>The omnipresence of 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> throughout Guam causes this leaf miner to be the most damaging of the secondary threats. This leaf herbivore cannot kill the host tree when it is the only herbivore present, but general plant vigor is damaged. The initial outbreak was observed in one locality in southern Guam in 2003. To date, this leaf miner has not been observed on Rota. In relatively healthy trees, all of the youngest 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> leaves are undamaged by this leaf miner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00888-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). For the first time since 2003, numerous Guam trees exhibit 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> damage on some leaflets on 100% of the leaves in 2020 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00888-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). This unprecedented level of leaf damage does not occur because the animal has exhibited a behavioral change to oviposit in younger leaves; instead, it is happening because the plants are producing leaf flush events less often, such that the youngest leaf cohort reaches the minimum age suitable for the leaf miner larvae. 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic> damage is much less threatening to the host tree than 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> because herbivory is restricted to old leaves; however, the leaf miner damage is similar to 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> damage, as every tree suffers from the chronic presence of the leaf miner population.
