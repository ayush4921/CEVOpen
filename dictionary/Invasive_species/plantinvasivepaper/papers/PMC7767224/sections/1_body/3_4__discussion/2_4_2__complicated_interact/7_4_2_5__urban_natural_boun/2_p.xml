<p>We describe two conservation examples that exemplify this phenomenon. First, an ex situ germplasm collection of Guam’s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> genotypes was established on Tinian island in 2008. This island is free of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>, so the conservation site has historically been safe from the most severe threat. This successful conservation project was managed by a species expert from 2008 with 1024 plants until 2018 when the collection was expanded to 1186 plants. The best practices for keeping the isolated site secure were ensured by training a crew residing on Tinian to meet the substantial workforce demands to maintain the large germplasm collection. This minimized the risk of inadvertent vectoring of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> from Guam to Tinian. A change in decision-makers within the funding agency occurred in 2018, which caused a shift in funding to a contractor without species expertise. The workforce to maintain the site began to be conducted by hazardous monthly trips of a maintenance crew from Guam to Tinian. The crawler stage of this scale often moves by hitchhiking on people [

If the federal permitting and funding agencies employed biologists with an understanding of the threats to the tree, the contractor would not have been allowed to use public funds to threaten the conservation site with these risky methods. Considerable mortality of the expensive germplasm has likely occurred since 2018 because the maintenance crew lacks training from a species expert. Second, 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees have been rescued from Guam’s federal construction sites and transplanted to managed restoration sites. These anthropogenic actions increase stress among the transplanted trees in the managed recipient sites, generating a subsequent increase in vulnerability to 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> damage. The restoration site then serves as a brood site for increased 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> population to damage the in situ 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees nearby the recipient site. The use of isolated locations far away from other in situ conspecific plants for recipient sites of transplanted native plants was proposed in 2017 as an approach to protect the surrounding native plant population from negative consequences of the restoration sites [
