<p>The native stem borer 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> is more damaging to individual trees than 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic>, but less damaging at the population level because infestations are not omnipresent. Unlike the other major herbivore threats, this beetle does not attack healthy host trees. The guild of insect herbivores that comprise stem and bark borers provides a crucial ecological function within their native range by overwhelming unhealthy individuals to remove them from the host population [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The stressors that reduce host tree health in a manner that leads to increased stem borer damage may be abiotic, such as tropical cyclones [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], or biotic, such as herbivory by other herbivore guilds [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The extensive contributions of this native insect to 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> plant mortality since 2005 are not a result of a behavior change of the insect; perhaps they result from the fact that every 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> tree on Guam has been compromised in health due to the non-native insect herbivory.
