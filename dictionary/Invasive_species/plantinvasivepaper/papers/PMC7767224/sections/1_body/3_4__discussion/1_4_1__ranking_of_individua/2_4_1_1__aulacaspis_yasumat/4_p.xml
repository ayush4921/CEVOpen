<p>Numerous introductions and releases of 
 <italic>Coccobius fulvus</italic> Compere &amp; Annecke (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) and 
 <italic>Aphytis lingnanensis</italic> Compere (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) parasitoids have been conducted in Guam to control 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>, and to date we have been unable to verify that these animals have established; however, a fortuitous establishment of the scale parasitoid 
 <italic>Arrhenophagus chionaspidis</italic> Aurivillius (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was observed in 2013. This parasitoid avoids female armored scales, and preferentially parasitizes male armored scales; therefore, the parasitoidâ€™s effectiveness is limited by this behavior.
