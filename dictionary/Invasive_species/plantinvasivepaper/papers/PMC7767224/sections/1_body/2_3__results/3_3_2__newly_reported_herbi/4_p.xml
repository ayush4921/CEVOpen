<p>The termite 
 <italic>Coptotermes gestroi</italic> Wasmann (synonym = 
 <italic>Coptotermes vastator</italic> Light) is the third termite taxon that we have observed consuming 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stem tissue in habitat. The 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees’ damage does not appear direct, as the feeding we observed was restricted to dead vascular tissue. However, the lowest strata of the infested trees’ structural integrity are compromised by the termite activity, which increases the plant population’s threat by reducing the tree’s ability to withstand tropical cyclone force winds.
