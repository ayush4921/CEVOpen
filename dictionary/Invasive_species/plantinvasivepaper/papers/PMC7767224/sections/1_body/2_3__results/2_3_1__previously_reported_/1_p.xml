<p>Numerous phytophagous insects have been reported from 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees in Guam. Two beetles and one Hemiptera were reported in 1942 (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00888-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A stink bug and soft scale were added to the list in 1946; a fruit fly, a planthopper, and three beetles were added in 1948 [

 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A nitidulid beetle was added in 1962 [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], then five Diaspididae species were added in 1966 and 1975 [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Specifics of the collection methods were missing from most of these reports; therefore assumptions that they were feeding on the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> tissue are unwarranted. Regardless, none of these individual species pose a threat to the host tree today, nor do they emerge as secondary threats that magnify plant damage caused by one of the primary threats.
