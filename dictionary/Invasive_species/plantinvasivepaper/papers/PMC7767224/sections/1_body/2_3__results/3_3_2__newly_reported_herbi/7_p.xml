<p>The cortex parenchyma of fallen 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems was observed being consumed by the hermit crab 
 <italic>Coenobita</italic> sp. Latreille on numerous occasions. An open wound often results in exposed cortex parenchyma when pigs begin to feed on standing, living 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems. This crab is a secondary herbivore of the exposed parenchyma tissue after the initial pig damage.
