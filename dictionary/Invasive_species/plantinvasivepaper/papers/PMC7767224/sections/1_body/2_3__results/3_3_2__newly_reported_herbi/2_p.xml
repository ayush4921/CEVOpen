 <italic>Pseudaulacaspis cockerelli</italic> Cooley is a widespread horticultural pest with an extensive host range. This armored scale has been considered the greatest scale problem in the Florida horticulture industry [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Male and female individuals look similar to those of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>, but the behavior of the two scale species differs in the initial infestation sites for Guamâ€™s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> plants. First, 
 <italic>P. cockerelli</italic> females preferentially infest the adaxial leaflet surfaces, but 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> females preferentially infest the abaxial leaflet surfaces. Second, 
 <italic>P. cockerelli</italic> males exhibit no preference for which leaflet surface is infested and form initial aggregations, but 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> males preferentially infest the abaxial leaflet surfaces and do not aggregate. Third, in the absence of pesticide or biological control, 
 <italic>P. cockerelli</italic> crawlers disperse and refrain from forming high-density infestations. Still, high-density 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> infestations quickly develop at the initial infestation locations on a plant. Fourth, the extensive host range allows 
 <italic>P. cockerelli</italic> to persist locally in the absence of a 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> host plant, but 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> is the only native host for 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>. Fifth, the 
 <italic>P. cockerelli</italic> infestations we have observed have been restricted to 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> leaves, and 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> readily infests 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> leaves, stems, roots, megastrobili, microstrobili, and seeds.
