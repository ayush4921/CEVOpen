<p>An unidentified species of the large weevil genus 
 <italic>Myllocerus</italic> sp. Sch√∂nherr has caused recurring damage on leaflets of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> and several other 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species in cultivation. The only in situ locality that we have observed 
 <italic>Myllocerus</italic> damage to 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> leaves was an area of occupancy adjacent to a golf course. The horticultural trees in the golf course likely sustained the localized weevil populations.
