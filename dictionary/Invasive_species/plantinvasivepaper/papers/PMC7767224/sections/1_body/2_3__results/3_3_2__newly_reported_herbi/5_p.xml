 <italic>Hermetia illucens</italic> L. larvae were observed consuming 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> sarcotesta tissue from seeds heavily infested with 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>. This insectâ€™s primary larval food is detritus or feces, including in Guam [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; therefore, the herbivory of tissue on living seeds was unexpected. We have never seen this herbivory on healthy seeds, so this herbivory has been restricted to damaged seeds with a history of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> infestations on the seed integument.
