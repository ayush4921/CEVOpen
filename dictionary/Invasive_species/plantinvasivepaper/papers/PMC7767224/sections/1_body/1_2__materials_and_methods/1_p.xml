<p>The identification of the 
 <italic>Aulacaspis yasumatsui</italic> Takagi armored scale in Guam in 2003 [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] initiated our efforts to study the herbivore threats to Guam’s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> population. The 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees exhibited no signs of leaf herbivory prior to this invasion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00888-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Herein, first, we made one list of the various herbivore threats to this cycad species that have been previously reported in the literature. An exhaustive literature search on insect herbivory of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> was conducted in 2006 [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and several other consequential insect herbivore threats have been described thereafter, but without a subsequent literature search. We used the single search word “
 <italic>Cycas</italic>” in Google Scholar, and limited the years to 2005–2020. The number of articles on this genus was constrained enough that no other search delimitations were needed. Then, we summarized the previously unreported insect species observed to consume 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> tissue on Guam and Rota since 2006. Finally, in this article, we discuss the damage and interactions of the various herbivores observed from 2003–2020 to inform urgent conservation decisions that are needed for species recovery. These observations came from in situ locations of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic>, in situ locations of the two primary insect herbivore threats, and common garden settings where 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> is grown with numerous other 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species.
