<p>The soil pH in the two soil layers showed a trend of SC &gt; MC &gt; TC, and the pH of the SC community was significantly greater than that of the TC community. The soil water content of the two layers showed a trend of TC &gt; MC &gt; SC, but only in the 15â€“30 cm soil layer was there significant difference. The electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the two soil layers all showed the trend of MC &gt; TC &gt; SC, and the differences were significant at a
