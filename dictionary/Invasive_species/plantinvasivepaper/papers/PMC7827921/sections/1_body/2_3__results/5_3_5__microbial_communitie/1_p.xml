<p>The number of shared and unique OTUs among the SC, TC, and MC samples in bacterial and fungal communities differed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The bacterial community shared half of the OTUs (58% in soil layer 0–15 cm and 54.7% in soil layer 15–30 cm) among the SC, TC, and MC samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00138-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b). Less than 10% of the OTUs (9% in soil layer 0–15 cm and 7.2% in soil layer 15–30 cm) were shared among the SC, TC, and MC samples in fungal community (
