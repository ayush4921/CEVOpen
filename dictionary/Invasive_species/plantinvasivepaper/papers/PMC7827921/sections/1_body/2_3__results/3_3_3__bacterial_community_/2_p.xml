<p>The LEfSe analysis showed the abundance of some taxa differed among the SC, TC, and MC samples, respectively (LDA &gt; 3.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). When comparing the MC and TC communities, we found that the phylum Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria, the order Rhodobacterales, and the family Rhodobacteraceae and Porphyromonadaceaei were more abundant in the MC community and the phylum Proteobacteria, the class Epsilonproteobacteria, the order Campylobacterales, and the family Helicobacteraceae and Ruminococcaceae had higher abundance in the TC community in the 0–15 cm soil layer; whereas only the class Alphaproteobacteria in MC community were significantly higher than TC community in the 15–30 cm soil layer (

When comparing the TC and SC communities, we observed that the phylum Proteobacteria, the class Epsilonproteobacteria and Dehalococcoidia, the order Campylobacterales, the family Helicobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae, and the genus 
 <italic>Sulfurovum</italic> were more abundant in the TC community and the phylum Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes, the class Gemmatimonadetes and Gammaproteobacteria, the order BD7_8 marine group, Rhodospirillales, NB1_j, Gemmatimonadales and Xanthomonadales, the family Rhodospirillaceae, Eel_36e1D6, Gemmatimonadaceae, and JTB255 marine benthic group had higher abundance in the SC community in the 0–15 cm soil layer; whereas the class Epsilonproteobacteria, the order Campylobacterales, the family Helicobacteraceae, and the genus 
 <italic>Sulfurovum</italic> were more abundant in the TC community and the phylum Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae, the class Alphaproteobacteria and Nitrospira, the order Nitrospirales, and the family Nitrospiraceae had higher abundance in the SC community in the 15–30 cm soil layer (

 <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> were more abundant in the MC community and the phylum Nitrospirae, the class Gammaproteobacteria and Nitrospira, the order Xanthomonadales and Nitrospirales, and the family Nitrospiraceae had higher abundance in the SC community in the 0–15 cm soil layer; whereas the phylum Verrucomicrobia, the class BacteroidetesBD2_2, the genera 
 <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> were more abundant in the MC community, the phylum Nitrospirae, the class Nitrospira, the order Nitrospirales, the family Nitrospiraceae and Prevotellaceae, and the genus
