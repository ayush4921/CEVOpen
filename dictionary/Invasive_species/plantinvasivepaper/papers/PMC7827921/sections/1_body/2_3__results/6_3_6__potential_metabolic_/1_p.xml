<p>A total of 3979 bacterial OTUs were included in the Tax4Fun analysis for functional assessment. A total of 6325 KEGG orthologues were found in the soil samples. In level 1, the group Metabolism had the highest abundance (60.21%), followed by Environmental Information Processing (18.38%), Genetic Information Processing (12.82%), Cellular Processes (5.75%), Human Diseases (1.68%), and Organismal Systems (1.08%). The top abundant functional pathways (relative abundance &gt;1%) at level 2 was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00138">Table S4</xref>. In 0–15 cm soil layer, only three Metabolic pathways in level 2, which are Replication and repair, Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and Endocrine system, show significant differences. However, there is no significant difference in the 27 Metabolism pathways in the 15–30 cm soil layer. PCoA analysis based on the functional assessment data variances among bacterial community with the first and second axes explaining 39.82% and 30.96% of the variance, respectively (
