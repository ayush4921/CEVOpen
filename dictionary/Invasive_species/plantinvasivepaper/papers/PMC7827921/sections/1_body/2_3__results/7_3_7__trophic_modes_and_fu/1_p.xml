<p>A total of 833 fungal OTUs were included in the FUNGuild analysis for functional assessment, but only 451 OTUs have been predicted for its ecological function. The OTUs were assigned to 7 trophic modes and 54 guilds, of which the trophic mode Saprotroph (10.33%) had the highest abundance, followed by Pathotroph-Saprotroph-Symbiotroph (4.96%), Pathotroph-Saprotroph (4.43%), Pathotroph (2.78%), Symbiotroph (0.27%), Pathotroph-Symbiotroph (0.12%), and Saprotroph-Symbiotroph (0.02%). Relative abundance (&gt;1%) of fungal potential functional groups at the level of Guilds were shown in
