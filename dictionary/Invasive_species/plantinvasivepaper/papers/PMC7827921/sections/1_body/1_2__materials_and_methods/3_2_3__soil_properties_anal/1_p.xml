<p>The −70 ℃ ultra-low temperature refrigerator was used to store soil samples for microbiological analysis. We dried other soil samples to a constant weight in an oven below 60 ℃ to measure the soil moisture content. The roots were picked out from the soil, and the soil was filtered with a 2-mm sieve to remove plant residues and stones [

We used dilute HCl (5%) to acidify the air-dried sub-sample to achieve the purpose of removing carbonate. The procedure to extract fractionation of particulate organic carbon (POC) was referenced from Sun et al. [

Then, the POC and SOC content of the extracted soil and air-dried soil were measured by an element analyzer (Vario MACRO cube, Elementar, Langenselbold, Germany). The MOC content was obtained by subtracting the particulate organic carbon (POC) content from the total soil organic carbon content (i.e., SOC).
