Principal Co-ordinates Analysis (PCoA) was used to visualize the bacterial/fungal community structure and functional structure using relative abundances of OTUs or functional groups in statistical software Canoco v. 5.0 (Microcomputer Power, Ithaca NY, USA). In addition, the PerMANOVA test in the “Vagen” package in R software (v. 4.0.3) was used to test the significance of the difference between vegetative types in microbial community structure (
