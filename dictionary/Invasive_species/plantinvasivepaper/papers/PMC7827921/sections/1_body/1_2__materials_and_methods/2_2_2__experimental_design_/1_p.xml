<p>For the sampling, we selected three transect lines that spanned the mangrove—salt marsh ecotone within the intertidal zone. The Uninvaded mangrove community (MC), the 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic>–mangrove mixed community (TC), and the 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> community (SC) fully occupied by 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> were selected from sea to land in Zhangjiangkou National Mangrove Wetland Nature Reserve in July 2017. The specific direction and location information of transects has been described in detail in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For each of the three transect lines, the above three types of sample plots were selected, and three sample points were selected for each sample plot (distributed in a zigzag pattern, and the distance between each two sampling points was 5–10 m). Two layers of samples (0–15, 15–30 cm) were taken in layers with an earth drill, and a total of 18 samples were obtained. All the samples were put in the ice box and transported to the laboratory for subsequent analysis.
