<p>Soil microbes are one of the important factors of soil fertility, which can control the turnover and formation of soil organic matter (SOM) by decomposing various organic detritus. Therefore, soil microbes play a vital role in soil material transformation and energy flow [

 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Soil microbial communities are significantly affected by various environmental factors, such as plant communities, soil physicochemical properties, and soil nutrient substrate, etc. [

 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Plant communities can directly or indirectly influence soil microbial communities by altering the quantity and quality of litter [

 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Soil physicochemical properties (e.g., soil pH and soil water content) have been considered as one of the important driving factors of soil microbial communities [

 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, soil pH can regulate soil microbial communities by selecting species with compatible growth strategies, changing the growth and proliferation of soil microorganisms, and affecting the effectiveness of soil nutrients [

 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that the quality and quantity of soil nutrient substrates can alter soil microbial communities [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Previous studies have also found that soil microbial communities are closely related to soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), etc. [

 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been reported that one of the main reasons for the successful invasion of invasive plants is to promote the microbial community structure of the rhizosphere soil, improve the function of the microbial community, and thereby creating a better soil microenvironment, which in turn aggravates the invasion process [
