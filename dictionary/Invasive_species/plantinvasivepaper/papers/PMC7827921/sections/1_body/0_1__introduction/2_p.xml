<p>Chinese mangrove ecosystems are vulnerable to the invasive species 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> (a perennial herb), which is native to North America and was introduced to China in 1979 to accelerate the deposition and stabilization of tidal flats [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the past few decades, 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> has become one of the dominant species in the coastal wetlands in China due to its unique physiological and ecological characteristics (e.g., higher growth rate, higher net primary yield, and higher salt tolerance) compared to native plants [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. So far, 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> has spread throughout the coastline of mangrove wetlands [
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], thus greatly affecting the mangrove ecosystem in China. 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> invasion has been demonstrated to significantly change the accumulation and turnover of soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in mangrove wetlands [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as well as their soil physicochemical properties [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, studies have also shown that 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> invasion changes greenhouse gas fluxes in mangrove wetlands by controlling soil conductivity, microbial biomass, microbial respiration, etc. [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was reported that 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> invasion not only changed the dominant species and biodiversity of macrobenthos in mangrove wetlands [
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but also had a significant impact on soil bacterial abundance and community structure [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although extensive research has been conducted to investigate the effects of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> invasion on mangrove ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the elucidation of soil microbial communities responses to 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> invasion remains limited [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
