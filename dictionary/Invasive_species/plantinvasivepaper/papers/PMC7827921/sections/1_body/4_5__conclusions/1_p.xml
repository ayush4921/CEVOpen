<p>This study emphasized the changes of soil microbial communities in the mangrove ecosystem of the Zhangjiang Estuary wetland after the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic>. Our results suggest that although the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> does not cause significant changes in the diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, it can alter the community structure of soil bacteria. The results of the LEfSe analysis show that the relative abundance of some bacterial taxa is not significantly different between the MC and SC communities, but different changes have occurred during the invasion process (i.e., TC community). Different from the results of the bacterial community, the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> can only cause a significant increase in few fungal taxa during the invasion process, and these taxa are at some lower levels (such as family, genus and species) and classified into the phylum Ascomycota. Although the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> changes the taxa with certain ecological functions, it may not change the potential ecological functions of soil microorganisms (i.e., the potential metabolic pathways of bacteria, nutritional patterns, and fungal associations).
