<p>Assessment of potential functions using Tax4Fun and FunGuild based on high-throughput sequencing has been applied to analyze possible functions of different microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B60-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, the analysis based on the assessment of bacterial and fungal potential functions does not show significant differences in soil microbial possible functions before and after the invasion of Spartina alterniflora(
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00138">Tables S8 and S9</xref>). We infer that the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> did not change the ecological possible functions of soil microorganisms in general, but changed taxa with certain ecological functions. The potential functional assessment was based on the classification of OTUs and the SILVA123 database of bacteria and the FUNGuild database of fungi as a reference. In our data, the number of OTUs classified as genera in the bacterial community is very small (&lt;20.16%), and the fungal community has only 833 OTUs that can be classified to the genus level, which are limited by the current development of microbial taxonomy. However, we can still use Tax4Fun and FUNGuild to assess the potential functions of known taxonomic groups of microorganisms under the current development of microbiology, so as to provide reference for the impact of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> invasion on the potential ecological functions of soil microorganisms. In future research, it is necessary to combine more powerful tools (such as metagenomic sequencing and other technologies) or more complete databases to clarify the potential functions of microbial communities.
