<p>Finally, the results found in this study are in line with recent papers that also report an increase in phenotypic plasticity with latitude for different traits and taxonomic groups (see Introduction). Obviously, this does not mean that all the existing evidence supports the prediction of the CVH. For instance, studies analyzing acclimation abilities in ectothermic animals do not show a clear pattern of latitudinal variation 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Brattstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Overgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Although it is true that these studies had a more reduced taxonomic scope (e.g., one genus or one family) and geographic extension (e.g., one region or one continent) than most of the studies that support the CVH –suggesting that differences in results may be due in part to difference in the temporal and spatial scales considered– it could be expected that the prediction of the CVH does not hold for all phenotypic characters. As for phenotypic plasticity itself –although the lack of plasticity for one or more traits does not deny the adaptive value of plasticity in general– the lack of latitudinal patterns in plasticity for some traits does not deny the validity of the CVH in general terms. We believe that the evidence supporting the CVH is enough to warrant that it be seriously considered in models aimed at predicting the effect of global change (and particularly the effect of global warming) in future species distributions. A simple way to do this is to modify the current climate envelope models by increasing the potential niche of each population in parallel to latitude, but the specific details on how this could be done this exceed the aim of the present study.
