<p>The Earth is undergoing dramatic environmental changes (referred to as global change) which are mainly related to five different (but interacting) phenomena: climate change, land use change, resource overexploitation, pollution, and invasive species

 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Matesanz1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Two results obtained in the present study are relevant in this scenario of global change. First, in agreement with the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH), a clear association was found between latitude and plasticity for all the ecophysiological and fitness-related traits analyzed. Second, all the sampled populations of the highly invasive species considered here showed a great degree of plasticity for all the traits evaluated, regardless of their specific location along the latitudinal gradient. Thus, in what follows we discuss the implications of these results within the contexts of the CVH and species invasiveness ability.
