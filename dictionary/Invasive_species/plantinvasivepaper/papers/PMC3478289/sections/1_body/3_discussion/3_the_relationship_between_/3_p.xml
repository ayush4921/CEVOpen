<p>The high invasive capacity of Eurasian species is considered to be a result of an evolutionary history on a large continental mass that suffered major upheavals during the glacial period and longer association between humans and plants than in the New World 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-diCastri1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>; consequently, aliens of Eurasian origin, because of their higher competitiveness, vagility and plasticity are likely to invade areas even when interchange is fairly limited 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Finally, the fact that species that have been introduced into South America and can adapt to the wide range of environmental conditions found along fifty-five degrees of latitude could be surprising. Surely the high plasticity in the ecophysiological and fitness-related traits of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals from different populations suggests that some invaders could definitely adapt to changing environmental conditions found along broad gradients worldwide.
