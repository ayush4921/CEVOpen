<p>The triploid condition of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals from all localities studied suggests they are apomictics, which usually is associated with low genetic variability and high plasticity as a successful strategy to cope with changing environments 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-MolinaMontenegro2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, unexpectedly high levels of genetic variation have been found in other apomictic species generated by subsexual reproduction 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Darlington1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, including genetic segregation and hybridization between sexual and apomictic individuals

 <xref rid="pone.0047620-VanDijk1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Exceptions to the general pattern of high cytogenetic variability in widely distributed alien species do exist. They tend to occur in species with very high levels of phenotypic plasticity (e.g., 
 <italic>Taraxacum</italic>) which have a low level of cytogenetic variability
