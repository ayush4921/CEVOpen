<p>Seeds from all localities were germinated at 24±2°C on wet filter paper in Petri dishes and planted in 300-mL plastic pots filled with potting soil. First generation plants (F1) were generated from this initial seed pool and were grown in a greenhouse at the Universidad de Concepción (Concepción, Chile) under controlled conditions of light and temperature (1320 µmol m-2s-1±55 and 22±2°C, respectively). These plants were again put in 300-mL plastic pots filled with potting organic soil and irrigated every two days with 50 ml of water. After five months these plants produced the achenes that were used to obtain experimental plants (F
 <sub>2</sub>). One week after of appearance of the first true leaf, F
 <sub>2</sub> seedlings were transferred to growth chambers (Forma Scientific Inc.) with a photon flux density (PFD) of 170 µmol m-2 s-1 and 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod. The temperature treatment consisted of transferring 20 individuals from each locality described above to a growth chamber set at 5 or 20°C for 90 days. These temperatures were chosen because they are close to the mean temperatures in each extreme of gradient. Plants were irrigated daily and supplemented with Phostrogen® (Solaris, NPK, 14∶10∶27) using 0.2 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> once every 15 days. Plastic pot positions were randomized within the experimental plot every four days. Interplot distances were sufficient to prevent mutual shading. After 90 days we recorded three ecophysiological traits, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency (photosynthesis/foliar transpiration) and foliar angles, and three fitness-related traits (total dry biomass, flower production and seed output).
