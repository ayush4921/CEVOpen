 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> is a member of the Asteraceae originally from Europe that has spread worldwide. It is one of the top invasive species around the world 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Holm1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This plant can be found growing in sites with changing climatic characteristics, disturbance regimes, and along a wide range of altitudes and latitudes. Seeds of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> were collected in five localities: Manta (Ecuador), Trujillo (Perú), La Serena (Chile), Valdivia (Chile) and Punta Arenas (Chile). The hemispheric latitudinal gradient covers from 
 <italic>ca.</italic> 0° to 
 <italic>ca.</italic> 54° S, including a notorious and significant thermal gradient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047620-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All seeds were collected at sea level to reduce altitudinal effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047620-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Preliminarily, cytogenetic analysis showed that individuals from all localities sampled in this study have the same ploidy level (n = 24 chromosomes) and size of chromosomes, suggesting that all individuals sampled belong to the same species (data not shown).
