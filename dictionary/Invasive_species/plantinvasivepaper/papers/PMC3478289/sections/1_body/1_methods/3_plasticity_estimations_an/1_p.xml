<p>Phenotypic plasticity was considered as the environmentally-induced change in the expression of phenotypic traits at the end of the experimental period, whatever the mechanistic causes (e.g., ontogenetic, allometric) behind this differential expression 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Gianoli2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Phenotypic plasticity was estimated for each trait and locality as the percentage of change in mean trait value from one environment to the other; that is, P = [(X
 <sub>20</sub>– X
 <sub>5</sub>)/X
 <sub>20</sub>] * 100, where P is plasticity, X
 <sub>20</sub> is the mean trait value at 20°C and X
 <sub>5</sub> is the mean trait value at 5°C 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Valladares1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In addition, a measurement of overall plasticity was estimated for each population as the arithmetic average of the percentage of change observed for all the traits. A bootstrapping procedure, with 1000 iterations was used in order to obtain error estimations of plasticity for each trait and population (i.e., a percentage of change was calculated from two randomly selected individuals, one in each temperature treatment, in each iteration). The error estimation for overall plasticity was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the errors obtained for all the traits. The relationships between mean trait values at each temperature and trait plasticity with geographic latitude and climatic variables were evaluated separately using the Pearson product moment coefficient.
