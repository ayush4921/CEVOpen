<p>Populations exposed to environmental changes may respond in four not mutually exclusive ways: they can become extinct, migrate to new areas, adapt via genetic change, or persist via phenotypic plasticity 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although the last two alternatives avoid local extinction, current evidence suggests that for most populations coping with accelerated changing conditions, and thus local persistence, will be closely related to the amount of plasticity for fitness-related traits
