<p>In this context, the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) could be considered a timely and promising hypothesis, since it directly connects phenotypic plasticity with climatic and geographic variables at a global scale. Specifically, the CVH states that as the range of climatic fluctuation experienced by terrestrial animals increases with latitude, individuals at higher latitudes should have broader ranges of thermal tolerance and acclimation abilities that enable them to cope with the fluctuating environmental conditions [6; see also 7–8]. Given that tolerance ranges and acclimation responses are ultimately linked to mechanisms of morphological, physiological and/or behavioral flexibility, the central idea of the CVH has been recently extended to phenotypic plasticity in general

Up to the present, empirical evidence supporting the CVH may be clustered in three major groups: (1) studies that directly evaluated the relationship between latitude and thermal tolerance range in ectothermic animals [e.g., 12–18]; (2) studies that directly evaluated the relationship between latitude and phenotypic flexibility for non-thermal traits in ecto- and endothermic animals [e.g., 19–22]; and (3) studies that analyzed different ecological patterns at the population and community levels that are expected to emerge from the CVH [e.g., 7, 23–28].
