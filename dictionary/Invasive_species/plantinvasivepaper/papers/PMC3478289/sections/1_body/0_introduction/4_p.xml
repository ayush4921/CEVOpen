<p>An important gap that still remains in our knowledge is the direct applicability of the CVH to plant species. On theoretical grounds there are two contrasting ideas about how plant species should change with geographic latitude to cope with the environment. On one hand, the limited vagility of plants may result in a great degree of adaptation to local conditions, resulting in a great population differentiation, which could preclude the existence of a latitudinal pattern in trait plasticity

 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Mooney1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. On the other hand, the limited vagility of plants may imply a reduced ability to avoid environmental influences, and thus the pattern predicted by the CVH could be more clearly observed than in animal species
