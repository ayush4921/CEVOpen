<p>Except for water use efficiency and foliar angle at 5°C, for which no latitudinal changes were observed, mean trait values increased with latitude at both experimental temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047620-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, given that these increases in mean values were noticeably greater at 20°C than at 5°C, phenotypic plasticity also increased with latitude for all the six analyzed traits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047620-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Regarding the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and climatic variables, it was observed that plasticity in photosynthetic rate was positively related to temperature annual range, plasticity in water use efficiency was negatively correlated with maximum temperature of the warmest month, and plasticity in foliar angle, flower production, seed output and overall plasticity were positively related to thermal seasonality and negatively related to environmental temperatures (
