<p id="Par45">In conclusion, a bioprospecting approach focused on alien species represents a promising strategy for discovering new metabolites, as well as to contain, or at least plan prevention strategies against plant invasiveness. This kind of approach could also support a sort of circular economy in the framework of invasive species management procedures, meaning that the metabolites found in the extracted phytocomplexes could produce economic gains that can be used to support, at least partially, the costs required for eradication actions.</p>
