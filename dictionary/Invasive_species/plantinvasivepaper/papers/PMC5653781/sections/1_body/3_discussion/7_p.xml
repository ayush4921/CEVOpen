<p id="Par41">This is really relevant, because collecting fruit before they reach the ‘invasive developmental stage’ prevents seed dispersal. Moreover, we would like to stress that the Po plain is an important bird stopover area, and in a previous study, it was demonstrated that local and migratory birds are particularly attracted to dark fruits, such as
