<p id="Par42">From a technical point of view, the harvesting of unripe fruits could sound expensive and not sustainable. However, this activity could fit with a circular economy strategy for biodiversity management where ‘plant pickers’ are directly involved by forest and territory authorities to collect high-added value plant biomasses destined to processing by phytochemical companies. We underline that many bioactive metabolites and food ingredients are still today obtained from spontaneous or proto-domestic species and harvested by pickers

 </sup>. Mediterranean diet is recently facing a comeback to the collection and use of spontaneous herbs such as the wild asparagus (
 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius</italic> L.) that is rich in antioxidants, wild cabbages (
 <italic>Brassica</italic> spp.) that contains high levels of folates and the maidenstears (
 <italic>Silene vulgaris</italic> (Moench) Garcke) that shows important amount of Omega-3 fatty acid

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. Many companies involved in drugs and cosmetics production, regularly purchase great batches of wild plants to exploit their well-known bioactive components, including poisonous species as well. This is the case of 
 <italic>Atropa belladonna</italic> L. that is already used to extract analgesic and antispasmodic phytocomplexes. Also fruit belonging to 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>myrtillus</italic>, our experimental control species, are harvested at high altitudes on the Alps and Appennins

 </sup> (where they grow spontaneously), and other 
 <italic>Vaccinium</italic> sp. are still harvested in nature in Canada and in the USA. The cultivated species 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>corymbosum</italic> L. is polyploid, and although it has a higher production yield, is not as rich in antioxidants and anthocyanins as 
 <italic>V</italic>.

 </sup>. The occurrence of secondary metabolites is also related to the response of the plant to different environmental conditions. Some studies highlighted how invasive plants show an altered metabolic profile in terms of secondary compounds (e.g. polyphenols) when they colonize new non-native territories

 </sup>. An allelopathic response could explain this phenomenon: for example, caffeic acid extracted from 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic> fruits is a typical allelopathic compound

 </sup>. Moreover, it is known that also flowers and buds of this species are particularly rich in valuable compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and luteoloside that contribute to increase the economic value of 
 <italic>L</italic>.

 </sup>. Modifications in plant phytocomplexes during invasions also occur in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> drupes. These fruits are appreciated by humans in native territories (USA and Mexico) where they are eaten fresh or utilized to prepare jams
