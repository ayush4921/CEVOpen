 <italic>serotina</italic>, an intensive management action was started in 1997 in the Ticino valley Park to try to limit the species. After 11 years, and despite costing 830000 Euros to contain it, this species enhanced its diffusion, overcoming the boundaries of the park

 </sup>. Moreover, management activities produced indirect costs, such as those related to the waste disposal of the biomasses derived by pruning and extirpation actions. In this context, bioprospecting on plant biomass could help solve not only the problem of spreading invasive species, but also the management of waste. This agrees with current guidelines of agro-bioeconomy (see UE n.1141/2014), that stimulates the development of circular solutions that are able to transform waste into resources
