In many cases, management strategies (e.g., cutting, mowing and extirpation) are not completely effective, either for eradication or containment purposes, because invasive species rely on efficient dispersal systems ensuring their long-term persistence. Moreover, these strategies demand huge economic resources, not only to assist direct containment, but also for the management of the biomass resulting from extirpation and cutting activities
