 </sup>, the economic resources and human energy demanded for managing invasive plants are expected to increase. The engagement of the citizen and other stakeholders to improve actions aimed at controlling the invaders creates societal challenges that policy makers are asked to prioritize

 </sup>. At the same time, identifying innovative ways to transform invasive plants from ‘problems to resources’ also represent an important challenge for modern societies. In this context, we propose a bioprospecting strategy to find new compounds and antioxidant phytocomplexes to be used in different sectors of human interest (e.g. pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and nutrition). Usually, bioprospecting activities involve wild species from unexplored forests
