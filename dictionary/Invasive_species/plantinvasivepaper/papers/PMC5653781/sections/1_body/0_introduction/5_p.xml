<p id="Par6">All the three selected invasive species are very abundant in the Po plain region of Northern Italy. Like other European floodplains, this geographical area is increasingly colonized by invasive species due to the huge amount of water availability, fertile soils, and suitable climatic conditions

 </sup>. The Po plain is characterized by high human disturbance resulting in a consistent alteration of local floral communities and an increasing rate of habitat fragmentation; these conditions support the process of invasion

 </sup>. In addition, the Po plain is crossed by important migration routes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and contains many refueling stopover sites for migratory birds species crossing the Alpine barrier to reach breeding sites farther north in spring and wintering grounds farther south in autumn

For these reasons, the selection of efficient management activities to contrast the diffusion of invasive plant species represents a priority issue, not only to preserve local biodiversity but also to prevent the spread of these species in bird stopover areas along transcontinental migratory routes.
