<p id="Par2">Biological invasions constitute a global environmental, economic, and social change driver as they can irremediably alter ecosystem compositions and services, thus determining a loss in terms of biodiversity, agriculture productivity, and human health

 </sup>. In Europe, the number of invasive species has been rapidly increasing and reached an estimated value of over 12000 species including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms in 2016

 </sup>. Concerning plants, their intentional introduction for ornamental purposes is a major pathway for invasion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The effect of invasive plants on natural ecosystems can be disastrous, firstly for the competition with indigenous species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, and secondly, because they limit the stability and availability of natural resources to the whole native species community
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Detrimental effects on human health mediated by invasive plants have also been documented
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. These include the occurrence of immunostimulant substances or allergenic factors, such as those on the pollen of some species or toxic metabolites in fruits, leaves, or other plant portions
