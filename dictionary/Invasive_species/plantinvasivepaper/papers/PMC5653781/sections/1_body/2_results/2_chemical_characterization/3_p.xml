<p id="Par31">To better understand the biochemical profile of extracts obtained from the studied species, a total of 28 standard high-added value compounds were investigated by HPLC-DAD (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Noteworthy, the most interesting compounds found in unripe fruit from 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> were chlorogenic acid (CLORA, avg. 3.137 mg*g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and rutin (RUT, avg. 1.856 mg*g
 <sup>−1</sup> in hydro-alcoholic extract and 1.938 mg*g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the aqueous one). In the same samples, catechins (e.g., epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate EGCG) were also detected (avg. 0.180 mg*g
 <sup>−1</sup> in aqueous extract). A large amount of the unidentified chromatographic peaks showed an absorbance spectrum characteristic of catechins, thus confirming that these compounds are present in significant amounts. Finally, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> unripe fruit showed some glycosylated stilbenes, particularly 
 <italic>trans</italic>-piceid (tPIC avg. 0.596 mg * g
 <sup>−1</sup>).
