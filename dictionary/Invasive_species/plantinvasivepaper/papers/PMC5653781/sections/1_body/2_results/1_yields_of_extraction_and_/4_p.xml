<p id="Par27">To evaluate the possible elements influencing antioxidant activity, we adopted a regression analysis to assess the effect of biological (ripening) and chemical (polyphenols and solvent of extraction) variables (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The occurrence of polyphenols is one of the most significant factors inducing antioxidant activity (p &lt; 0.001) in all the investigated plants. In 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic>, unripeness plays a relevant role in the antioxidant activity (
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> p &lt; 0.001, and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic> p = 0.052). In the case of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic>, the antioxidant activity also depends on the interaction between the amount of polyphenols and the method of extraction (p &lt; 0.001). This condition can be explained by taking into account the different extraction capacity and specificity of hydro-alcoholic solvent and water. For example, it was previously reported that 95% (v/v) ethanol is able to extract a larger amount and spectrum of phenolic compounds from red and white grape pomace with respect to water, and alcoholic extract possesses higher antioxidant activity
