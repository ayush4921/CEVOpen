 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> provides a brief comparison of extraction yields for all the investigated species and tested protocols. 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic> showed the highest yield of extraction in all cases with the only exception of unripe fruits extracted with water. 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic> showed a statistically lower yield of extraction than the control 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>myrtillus</italic> in the hydro-alcoholic condition, and the opposite situation occurred with the aqueous extraction protocol. Finally, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> extraction yields starting from unripe fruits were lower than in the ripe ones, even though yields of aqueous extraction were comparable to that of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>myrtillus</italic>.
