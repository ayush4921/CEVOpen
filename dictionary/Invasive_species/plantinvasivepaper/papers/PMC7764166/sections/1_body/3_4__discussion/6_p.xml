<p>Secondly, the decline of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> should be studied more comprehensively. A national or continental assessment of the situation of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> would be desirable, since the ladybird does not decline equally everywhere. It would also be necessary to test and analyze, through field observations and laboratory experiments, the factors favoring or hampering the presence of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic>, as well as the mechanisms explaining why this species rather than another is declining. Laboratory studies have already shown that some species of ladybirds such as 
 <italic>C. quatuordecimguttata</italic>. and 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> had chemical or physical defenses against 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but other species, such as 
 <italic>A. decempunctata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. decemguttata</italic> and 
 <italic>O. conglobata</italic>, also appear vulnerable and, yet, are not affected. It has also been suggested that the decline of native species following the invasion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> could be due to exploitative or apparent competition through common natural enemies, such as predators, pathogens and parasitoids [
