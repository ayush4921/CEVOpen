<p>Thirdly, the effect of the invasion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> on aphid populations is still poorly documented in Europe. Unverified information points to a decreasing trend, or at least a status-quo, in aphid-related agricultural problems, which would confirm that the arrival of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> did not alter the natural aphid control function of ladybirds by affecting native ladybird populations. However, it is not excluded that 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> has a direct negative effect on native aphid populations, in particular aphids living on deciduous trees. Although it is difficult, long after the invasion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic>, to measure this effect accurately, it is possible that old and long-term data from aphid populations can be compared to new surveys carried out using the same protocols.
