<p>The decline of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> following the invasion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> was expected. The ecological niches of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> and 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> greatly overlap [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and several laboratory studies showed that 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> does not have the same defenses, as other ladybirds to thwart predation by 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> e.g., [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, eggs and larvae of 
 <italic>C. quatuordecimguttata</italic> are chemically protected against IGP by 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic>, whereas species such as 
 <italic>Anatis ocellata</italic> (L.) or 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> have mechanical defense mechanisms. However, three other species (
 <italic>A. decempunctata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. decemguttata</italic> and 
 <italic>O. conglobata</italic>) also lack defense mechanisms, and have been indicated as potentially at risk in a risk analysis [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Yet, they do not seem to decline in north-western Switzerland, at least for now. 
 <italic>Adalia decempunctata</italic> is now the most abundant native species on broadleaved trees and shrubs. The other two species are less common but still present. In particular, the rare 
 <italic>C. decemguttata</italic> is regularly monitored on lime trees in the Swiss Jura, and populations do not show any sign of decline [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Honek et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] even state that the species is increasing in the Czech Republic despite 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic>. The total number of ladybird adults collected in our surveys on broadleaved trees varied quite strongly from year to year, but 2017 was the most successful year in terms of adults collected, suggesting that the biological control function of ladybirds on aphids feeding on broadleaved trees has not been affected by the arrival of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic>. The same conclusion was drawn by Bahlai et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] based on a long-term ladybird survey in Michigan, USA.
