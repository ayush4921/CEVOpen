<p>Although it is known that ladybird populations can vary greatly from year to year [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (see also 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00883-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>,

 <xref rid="insects-11-00883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00883-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> for variations observed in some ladybirds, e.g., 
 <italic>C. septempunctata and T. sedecimpunctata</italic>), the fact that 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> has almost disappeared from our records since 2010 strongly suggests that this decline in populations is not due to natural fluctuations in populations but more probably to the presence of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic>. 
 <italic>Adalia bipunctata</italic> used to be the most abundant species in this habitat in Switzerland [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and other European countries, e.g., [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another 11-year study in England also showed that 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> was the only species to decline significantly after the arrival of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Signs of recent decline were also found in other countries such as Czech Republic [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Italy [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Belgium [
 <xref rid="B11-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the latter country, the decline of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> warrants red listing as a vulnerable species [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 
 <italic>Adalia bipunctata</italic>, a Holarctic species, is also one of the species that shows the strongest decline in Eastern North America, following the invasion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> and three other exotic ladybird species [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in none of these European and American studies was the decline as strong as in our surveys in north-western Switzerland. For example, in England, 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> abundance in 2016 was reduced to approximately 16% of the total from the first surveys in 2006 [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although it has almost disappeared from north-western Switzerland, opportunistic surveys showed that it is still more abundant in other regions, such as in the Valais, southern Switzerland, particularly on deciduous trees in urban settings, perhaps because of the abundance of resources over a long period of the year, which limits intra-guild competition [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
