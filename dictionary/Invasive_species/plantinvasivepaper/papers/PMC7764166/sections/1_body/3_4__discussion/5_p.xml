<p>Following this and other studies on the decline of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic>, the following recommendations are made. Firstly, this database of ladybird abundance at 40 sites for 11 years is a unique tool to assess the impact of an invasive insect in the long term. It would be important to sample again at the same sites in a few years to verify that 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> remains the dominant species, that the decline of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> is confirmed, and that other native lady beetles are not declining. Sampling for at least 3â€“4 years would be essential to consider the effects of natural fluctuations in ladybird populations.
