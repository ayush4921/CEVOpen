<p>Early reports from Belgium and England already showed that 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> can become rather abundant on herbaceous plants and conifers [

 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our surveys it never became the dominant species in these habitats, in particular, on spruce, where it was almost absent. A long-term study [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in England also observed that it was not dominant on pine and nettles, where it represented 11.4% (fourth most abundant species) and 5.3% (fifth) of all ladybirds, respectively. These results suggest that it does not represent a significant danger to native ladybirds that are found specifically on conifers and grasses. Nevertheless, the fact that 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> represents 20.2% of all ladybirds on pine in north-western Switzerland prompts us to suggest further studies in this habitat. Furthermore, various studies, mostly from the Americas, showed that it can also become very abundant on annual crops, such as alfalfa fields in Chile [

 <xref rid="B28-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or across agricultural landscapes [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00883" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in USA. Thus, their impact on both aphids and aphidophagous insects in such habitats should also be investigated in Europe.
