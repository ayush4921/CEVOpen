<p>A long-term field trial was set up in north-western Switzerland in the cantons Jura, Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt and Aargau, based on 40 permanent sites established within a 40 km distance from the town of Delémont (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-11-00883">Table S1 in Supplementary file</xref>). Thirty sites were selected in 2006: 15 “meadow sites” consisting of managed and unmanaged meadows, along roads, sampled by sweeping 60 times through the vegetation on a transect of 30 m with a 60 cm-diameter sweep net; 15 “broadleaved hedges” consisting of clearly delimited, ca. 50 m long planted hedgerows, semi-natural hedges or forest hedges of mixed broadleaved trees and shrubs, sampled by beating all branches up to a height of 2.5 m with a stick and collecting beetles falling down on a white, rectangular 90 × 125 cm beating tray. In 2007, 10 “conifer sites” were selected, all in the Jura, except one in Basel-Landschaft. They consisted of 4 to 10 preselected individual pine (
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>, 5 sites), and spruce (
 <italic>Picea Abies</italic>, 5 sites) trees, of which all branches up to 2.5 m were beaten above the same beating tray. All sites were chosen haphazardly. The same sites were sampled seven to ten times per year per site, from mid-April to late September from 2006 (2007 for the conifers) until 2013. No sampling was conducted in 2014 because of budget constraints. In the period 2015–2017, similar collections were made at the same sites, except that one site of broadleaved hedges had disappeared and was replaced by another in the same region. Five meadow sites were also replaced by other, very similar meadows.
