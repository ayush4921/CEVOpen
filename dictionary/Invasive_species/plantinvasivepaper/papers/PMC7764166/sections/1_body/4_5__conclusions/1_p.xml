<p>Our long-term monitoring of ladybird populations in north-western Switzerland clearly showed that 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> quickly became the dominant species on broadleaved trees and shrubs just a few years after its arrival, but not yet on conifers and grasses. Only one native species, 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic>, clearly declined following the invasion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic>, but this once dominant species almost disappeared from the region. The severe decline of 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic> deserves further investigations.
