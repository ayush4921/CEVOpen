<p>On conifers, since the start of the surveys, 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> has been more abundant on pine than on spruce. The proportion of 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> on pine varied from 0% in 2009 to 52% in 2010 (

 <xref rid="insects-11-00883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These strong variations are also explained by the low and fluctuating numbers of ladybirds collected on pine (four to 114 individuals per year). Fifteen native species were found on pine and the most abundant species was 
 <italic>Harmonia quadripunctata</italic> Pontoppidan (26.3%) followed by 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> (20.2%) and 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> (16.4%).
