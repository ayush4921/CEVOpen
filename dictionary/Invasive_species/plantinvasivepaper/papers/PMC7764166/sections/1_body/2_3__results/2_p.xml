<p>On broadleaved hedges, 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> was present in low numbers in 2006, at two of the 15 sites. In 2007, it already represented 27% of all ladybird beetles and from 2008 to 2017, its proportion varied between 60 and 80% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00883-f001">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 21 native species were collected on the hedges (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00883-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although the number of specimens collected per species varied between years, only one species, 
 <italic>A. bipunctata</italic>, clearly declined during this period (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00883-f005">Figure 5</xref>). It was the main native species from 2006 to 2009 and, since 2010, not more than one specimen per year was collected. Other abundant species included 
 <italic>A. decempunctata</italic> (13.5% of all ladybirds), 
 <italic>Propylea quatuordecimpunctata</italic> (L.) (8.9%) and 
 <italic>Calvia quatuordecimguttata</italic> (L.) (5.5%). Two species, 
 <italic>Chilocorus bipustulatus</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>Chilocorus renipustulatus</italic> (Scriba) were abundant only in 2007, but this was mainly at one site, and their abundance was related to a local outbreak of a scale insect. The total number of aphidophagous ladybirds was highly variable among years, but there was no sign of decline, with the highest number of specimens collected in 2017 (
