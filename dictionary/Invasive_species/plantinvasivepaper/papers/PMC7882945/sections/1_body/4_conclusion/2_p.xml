<p>The methods outlined here constitute a highly effective protocol for the molecular biosurveillance of wood‚Äêboring beetles. We have established that the use of a saturated salt solution as an effective alternative to other commonly used insect trap suspension solutions such as ethanol and propylene glycol. Our results were able to detect a wide range of taxa in the sampled region, including several introduced and pest taxa. The adoption of this highly effective protocol is recommended as a supplement for any small terrestrial arthropod trapping collections.</p>
