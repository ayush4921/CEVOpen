<p>Final eDNA extracted from the 12 salt trap collections were successfully amplified. Amplicons with greater than 10 reads were used to create the ASV accumulation curves. These results showed that for all traps, a consistently high amplicon yield of between 239,876 and 561,262 sequences, but that the number of ASV was not proportionally consistent across the sampled sites (FigureÂ
