<p>The remaining fungal and bacterial free dataset across all collections resulted in 1,656 BINs and 1,150 OTUs using a 2% clustering threshold. The OTUs were generated using amplicons not matched to BINs and represented approximately 12.6% of the total amplicons for all collections. Of these 1,150 OTU's there were 643 with greater than 10 reads, of which 400 did not possess any taxonomic information. The remaining 243 OTUs had varying levels of taxonomic identifications, with 75 identified to genus and 86 to species and only 118 OTUs of the target taxonomic group Arthropoda. In total, for the OTUs generated, there were 46 unique species and 69 unique genera with matches having a percent similarity ranging from 90% to 97%. There were no taxa identified to genera or species of concern from a Canadian regulatory perspective (List of pests regulated by Canada,Â 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). As reliable identifications necessary for regulatory decision making were not obtained for OTU data, further analyses of these records were not conducted.
