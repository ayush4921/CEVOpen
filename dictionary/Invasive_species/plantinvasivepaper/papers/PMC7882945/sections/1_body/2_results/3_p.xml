<p>The mBRAVE analyses provided matches to barcode records for metazoans with barcode sequence representation in the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system through BINs (Ratnasingham &amp; Hebert, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Sequences that did not match to a BIN were clustered using a 2% nucleotide divergence threshold and then matched to the closest sequence in BOLD (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37113-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although the mBRAVE analyses did identify fungal taxa, these results were not evaluated further as they were not target taxa for this study and only represented less than 0.1% of amplicons for all collected biological samples. Additionally, there were only 16 fungal taxa identified with greater than 10 reads and only two of these (
 <italic>Penicillium bialowiezense</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium olsonii</italic>) were identified to a species level, both of which are common taxa in the collection region. While some amplicons were matched to bacterial records (approximately 2% of all obtained amplicons), these represented common and nontarget taxa for this study and so these results were not evaluated further.
