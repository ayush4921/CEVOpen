<p>Molecular identifications through BINs for unique sequences, generated per collection site of greater than 109 reads, provided varying taxonomic levels. The main groups represented in the BIN analyses included chordates, noninsect arthropods, nonarthropod invertebrates, and insects. Insects accounted for 67%–86% of identifications across collected samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37113-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This higher proportion of insects is expected as the biological collection traps were targeting insect taxa.
