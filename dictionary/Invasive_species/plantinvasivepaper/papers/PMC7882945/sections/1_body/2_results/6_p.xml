<p>In total, 416,979 unique sequences with greater than 10 reads that were placed into BINs that represented 180 different binomial names (full list included in supplemental files). There were also 239,306 sequences that were matched to 161 unidentified BINs in 111 named genera. The sequences which had associated species names were representative of 19 different orders, 12 of which were insects (Blattodea, Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera, Psocodea, Thysanoptera, Trichoptera), with the target coleopteran taxa making up 38% (69/180) of identified species. There were 19 species identifications of note from our results, where all remaining species identifications obtained from our analyses were native in the collected region (TableÂ
