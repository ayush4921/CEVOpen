<p>Sequences present in the dataset also resulted in three matches to BINs with species names that have more than one associated BIN (
 <italic>Anatis labiculata</italic>, 
 <italic>Mordellaria serval</italic>, 
 <italic>Philoscia muscorum</italic>). There were also two species identified in our samples that were not expected to be present given the trapping methodology. In three traps (B2, W3, W5), there was sequence that matched to Raccoon (
 <italic>Procyon lotor</italic>), and in two traps (B2, W6) the common house mouse (
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) was identified.
