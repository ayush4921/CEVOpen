<p>Two other taxa on the CFIA list of regulated pests were also identified. 
 <italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> is an introduced pest to Canada with severe impacts on grapevines and commercial grape operations. Management options for this pest have centered around the production of resistant grapevine strains, and the monitoring of 
 <italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> distributions can assist in the effective planting strategies for the grape industry (Granett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). In addition, the sequences obtained using a trapping and metabarcoding protocol could provide insight into the population structure of 
 <italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> and contribute to the elucidation of the distribution patterns of this pest. The final taxon of regulatory concern identified in our work was the genus 
 <italic>Lymantria</italic>. There are numerous species of concern among 
 <italic>Lymantria</italic>, including the invasive 
 <italic>L. dispar</italic>. Although specific efforts to complete a DNA barcode library for all species in this genus have been underway, the lack of resolution in matching the amplicons for this study to a specific species indicates that further efforts are needed to populate this library and make it publicly available (deWaard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
