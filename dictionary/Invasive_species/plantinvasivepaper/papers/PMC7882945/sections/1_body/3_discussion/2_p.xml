<p>Biosurveillance protocols have been a persistent research and monitoring tool to better understand the presence and distribution of species. Historically, these surveillance efforts used morphological identifications and were generally divided into two groups, targeted surveillance, and biodiversity assessments. With the advancement of molecular identification tools and DNA metabarcoding methodologies, the possibility of establishing biosurveillance protocols to simultaneously address both targeted and biodiversity surveys is now available.</p>
