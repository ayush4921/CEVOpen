<p>Our resulting high numbers of unique high‐quality (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37113-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece37113-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) paired‐end reads for each of our traps provides evidence for the ability of the salt solution to maintain relatively high molecular weight DNA suitable for making species‐level identification where high‐quality reference sequence libraries exist. The high number of reads obtained from our mBRAVE analyses (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37113-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and the variation of matched results to sequences, gives us an indication that the preservation of the eDNA in the salt solution was not limited to one or few large specimens, but representative of many different taxa present in the solution. The large variety of taxa matched to reference sequences in the BOLD database include 341 taxonomic units as represented by species names and BINs in 252 genera, of which 26.9% were within the target group of Coleopterans. This further supports the efficacy of this protocol as an effective biosurveillance tool for Coleopteran species of regulatory concern.
