<p>Among the taxa identified using molecular evidence, there were six taxa categorized as either introduced, non‐native, invasive, or pest, within the survey region (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37113-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Four of these taxa were in the target group Coleoptera: 
 <italic>M. pyraster</italic>, 
 <italic>X. germanus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. maiche</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. japonica</italic>. 
 <italic>P. japonica</italic> is on the Canadian government plant health list of species of regulatory concern and has been a known pest to native flora and agriculture for over 25 years (Allsopp, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). Although the recorded presence of this species in a known invaded range is not unexpected, the effective identification of 
 <italic>P. japonica</italic> using this trapping and molecular protocol is useful in that the application of this biosurveillance protocol could aid in future species tracking and biocontrol review and management decisions.
