<p>With the successful amplification of both fungal and bacterial DNA in the protocols presented here, there is an opportunity to include different higher‐level taxa as targets using the salt trap medium and could be optimized with more taxon‐specific primers (Y. Milián‐García, R. G. Young, M. Madden, E. Bullas‐Appleton, &amp; R. H. Hanner, 2020, in preparation). For instance, in field applications of biological control protocols, traps placed in the control zone followed by a metabarcoding methodology of samples, can provide survey data for large scale applications which can be used to assess the impact of the biological control measures (Milián‐García, Young, Madden, Bullas‐Appleton, &amp; Hanner, 2020, in preparation). Our results contained amplicons identified within the same orders used by the biocontrol example studies referenced above, Rhabditida nematodes for Marianelli et al. (

 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). This further provides support that the salt trapping followed by metabarcoding analyses outlined here could be effectively applied to survey both target pest specimen as well as introduced biocontrol agents.
