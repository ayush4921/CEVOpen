<p>There were also several species identified which are of interest due to potential impacts on native and agricultural flora and fauna but are not on the Canadian plant health list of regulated species. The detection of one such species, 
 <italic>A. maiche</italic> is notable for two reasons. Firstly, it was the only taxa identified across all collections. Secondly, it is a recently introduced species to North America (Rabaglia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) but has yet to be reported as present in Canada in the peer‐reviewed literature, and is not currently on the CFIA plant pest species list. 
 <italic>A. maiche</italic> was first identified in North America in Pennsylvania in 2005 (Rabaglia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). 
 <italic>A. maiche</italic> is an Asian species of wood‐boring bark beetle which predominantly infests damaged or weakened trees (Ranger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Terekhova &amp; Skrylnik, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). It is destructive to a variety of trees and cultured ornamentals and once introduced into suitable habitat it quickly establishes and becomes abundant (Rabaglia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Ranger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The prevalence of 
 <italic>A. maiche</italic> in our samples is consistent with the notion that this species is quick to establish and become abundant in the invaded range.
