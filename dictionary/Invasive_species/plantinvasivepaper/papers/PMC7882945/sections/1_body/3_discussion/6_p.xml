<p>A strength of the approach taken with this metabarcoding protocol using a salt trap solution is in the resulting molecular extract which can be used not only in the target study but the unused portion can also be archived in a cryopreserve for use in future studies. For instance, if the original study was not targeting a more recently identified pest taxa, there is opportunity to access cryopreserved extracts for use in these potential future studies and could benefit from a dedicated repository for extracts. These additional DNA extracts can be used for a variety of purposes, including additional high‐throughput sequencing and metabarcoding analyses using differing methods or targeted detection using a quantitative PCR protocol. This could be especially important in helping to identify native predators or pathogens for use in biocontrol of invasives like
