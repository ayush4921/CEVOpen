<p>With the successful application of a salt suspension solution outlined here, it seems prudent to replace current protocols that utilize insect trap solutions that are expensive, hazardous to human and animal health, and are difficult to work with. For example, while the use of ethanol is effective in its ability to preserve specimens for downstream molecular and morphological analyses, it does present several challenges (deWaard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). One of these challenges is the high evaporation rate, and this is especially true in warm weather climates where frequent monitoring and top‐ups of suspension fluid are required. Although in warm climates the salt solution will still be subject to evaporation, it will be far less of a problem and require less regular maintenance of traps. When evaporation occurs, the salt will remain in the collection vessel, and the simple addition of distilled water is all that would be necessary to maintain the traps until collection. Further, when trap solutions are needing to be exchanged, the supplies, distilled water, and table salt, to accomplish this are easily accessible and inexpensive and can often be obtained through local vendors, whereas this is not usually the case for ethanol. This is especially true in remote locations where local regulations and laws limit the purchase and use of alcohol‐based substances (Gilchrist,
