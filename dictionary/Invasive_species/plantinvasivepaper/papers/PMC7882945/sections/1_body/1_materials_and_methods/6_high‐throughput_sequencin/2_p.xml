<p>Sequencing was performed at the Genomics Facility, Advanced Analysis Centre, University of Guelph. Sequencing libraries were quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), assessed for fragment size in a Bioanalyzer HS DNA Chip (Agilent), normalized using SequalPrep Normalization Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq System using a MiSeq reagent kit v3 (600 cycles). Each trap was processed on approximately 1% of the total capacity of the MiSeq run. Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and adapter trimmed with the MiSeq Reporter software, generating two paired‚Äêend raw FASTQ files.</p>
