<p>Sequencing libraries were completed by two PCRs to incorporate adaptors for downstream sequencing. Initially, to add Illumina adaptor sequence sets, PCR was conducted in 25 μl reaction volumes containing 15 ng of each purified COI‐5P amplicon, 0.2 μM each primer (Forward‐M13F: 5′‐TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG
 <underline underline-style="single">TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT</underline>‐3′ and Reverse‐M13R: 5′‐GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG
 <underline underline-style="single">CAGGA AACAGCTATGAC</underline>‐3′), and 12.5 μl of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roache Diagnostics). The cycling parameters consist of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 46°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. PCR products were verified on a 1% agarose gel alongside a no template control (NP) to assess the potential contamination in reaction reagents and purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) as per the manufacturer's protocol (Figure
