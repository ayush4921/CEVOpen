<p>To target wood‐boring beetles in the order Coleoptera, Lindgren funnel traps baited with Ethanol Ultra High Release (UHR) Lures (Synergy Semiochemical Corp), were used to survey two Southern Ontario locations, one in Windsor and another in Wheatley (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37113-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Lindgren funnels collection cups were filled with a salt (NaCl) water solution to preserve trapped insect specimens until collection. Saltwater suspension solution was made in the laboratory before field deployment by combining 2 kg of NaCl obtained from the local grocery store, in the form of table salt, with 5 L of distilled water. When adding a solution to the field collection cups, approximately 2.5 cm layer of salt was first placed in the cup. This additional salt was placed in the cup to account for potential environmental water getting into the traps and diluting the salt solution from the initial concentration. The placement and collection of these traps followed the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) Survey Protocol: Invasive Alien Species Forestry Trapping (2017). Traps were placed at six sites for each location, left in the field for 4 weeks and collected during a single collecting event in August of 2017. Upon collection, specimens were removed from the collection cups, and the salt solution was poured directly into a new whirl pack, labeled, frozen at −20°C, and shipped to the laboratory packed in ice where they were then stored at −20°C until filtration.
