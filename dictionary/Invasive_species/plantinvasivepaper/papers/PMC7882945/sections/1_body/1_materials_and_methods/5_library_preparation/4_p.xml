<p>Next, a Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina) was used to complete the first library preparation from the PCR products. A 50 μl reaction comprising 50 ng of purified COI‐5P/Illumina adaptor sequence amplicons, 5 μl each set of 10 μM concentration index primers, and 25 μl of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix. A thermocycling reaction of 95°C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. The amplicons were verified on an agarose gel alongside a no template control (NP) to assess the potential contamination in reaction reagents and cleaned using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) using the manufacturer's protocol (Figure
