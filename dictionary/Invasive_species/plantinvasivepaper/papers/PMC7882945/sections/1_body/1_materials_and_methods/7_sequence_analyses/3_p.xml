<p>A parallel analysis was conducted using the MiSeq data and the analytical platform Multiplex Barcode Research And Visualization Environment (mBRAVE; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbrave.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://mbrave.net/</ext-link>). Settings and libraries used to analyze the results from the high‐throughput sequencing can be found in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece37113-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>. Results obtained from the mBRAVE platform were in the form of matches to existing data on the Barcode of Life Data System (Ratnasingham &amp; Hebert, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), in the form of sequences and existing Barcode Index Numbers (Ratnasingham &amp; Hebert, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Where sequences did not match to BINs, a clustering analysis was conducted, and sequences were grouped into molecular operational taxonomic units (OTU) using a 2% sequence divergence threshold (Blaxter, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). All results from the mBRAVE analysis with more than 10 reads were used for discussions.
