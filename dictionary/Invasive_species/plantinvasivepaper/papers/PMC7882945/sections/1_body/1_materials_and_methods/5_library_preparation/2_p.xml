<p>To amplify a 407‐nucleotide region of the animal DNA barcode region (COI‐5P), PCR was performed following the standard protocol developed by Ivanova et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). PCR reactions were set up in a total volume of 50 μl comprising 50–100 ng of each eDNA extract, 1× PCR Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTP each, 0.2 μM primer each (mLepF1/RonMWASPdeg forward and C_LepFolR reverse primer; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37113-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and 2 U Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers were chosen to amplify a diverse set of taxa expected to be potentially present in the Lindgren funnel traps. The mLepF1 primer is a forward primer which has been shown to amplify a variety of insect taxa (Hajibabaei et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) and the RonMWASPdeg primer was used to amplify additional flighted insect species due to its degenerate nature (Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The reverse primers were a cocktail of two primers that resulted in an approximate amplified fragment of 407 nucleotides in length which were of suitable length for the Illumina MiSeq System (Hernández‐Triana et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). To facilitate sequencing library preparation, M13 (5′‐tgtaaaacgacggccagt‐3′) forward and M13 (5′‐caggaaacagctatgac‐3′) reverse nucleotide sequences were attached to the mLepF1 and RonMWASPdeg forward and C_LepFolR reverse primers, respectively. A thermocycling profile with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, 5 cycles of 94°C for 3 s, 45°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 51°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 1 min. After the sizes of the PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37113-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) alongside a ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O negative control (NW) and a no template control (NP) to assess the potential contamination in reaction reagents, the amplicons were purified with AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), following manufacturer's protocol, and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
