<p>eDNA was extracted using a CTAB method adapted from Dempster et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Each membrane filter was cut into quarters using sterile razor blades and placed into individual 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing ~100 μl of glass beads (0.75–1 mm diameter). A volume of 500 μl of CTAB buffer (2% [w/v] polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.4 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris‐HCL pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA) prewarmed to 65°C was added to each tube followed by homogenization by Mini BeadBeater for 1 min (BioSpec Products). The tubes were then incubated at 65°C for 1 hr in a heat block with occasional gentle mixing by inversion. After incubation, 500 μl of 24:1 (v/v) chloroform: isoamyl alcohol was added to each tube and gently mixed by inverting for 1 min. The tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min, and the supernatants were transferred into new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. An equal volume of isopropyl alcohol and a half volume of 5 M NaCl were added to each tube, which were then mixed, placed at −20°C overnight, and centrifuged at 13,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed in 500 μl of 70% (v/v) ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. After eDNA concentrations were determined by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37113-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) to verify the length fragments of the DNA alongside a ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O negative control (NW). All eDNA extracts were stored at 4°C for immediate use or −20°C for short‐term storage before use in polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
