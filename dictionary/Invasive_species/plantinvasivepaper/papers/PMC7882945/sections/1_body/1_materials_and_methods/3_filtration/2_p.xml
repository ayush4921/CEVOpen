<p>All equipment necessary for trap fluid filtration were sterilized with 50% bleach or ELIMINase (Decon Labs) prior to use. Trap saturated salt solution was filtered through Nitrocellulose Mixed Ester membrane filters (pore size 1 µm, diameter 47 mm; Sterlitech). The filtration apparatus included a three‐port manifold connected to an EZ‐Stream vacuum pump (EMD Millipore) with magnetic filtration cups (Pall). Upon filtration, the membranes were stored at −80°C until use in eDNA extraction.</p>
