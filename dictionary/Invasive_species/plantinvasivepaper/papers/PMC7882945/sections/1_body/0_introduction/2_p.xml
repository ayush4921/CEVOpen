<p>The volume of global shipping has created massive opportunities for hitchhiking insect pests present on packaging and products, resulting in their movement across large global regions (Perrings,

 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). With global warming trends opening new hospitable habitat for non‐native species, there is a need for more surveillance protocols and early detection methods to limit invasive species impacts (Dukes et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The early detection of non‐native insect species is essential to help reduce the impact of introduced species and mitigate the establishment and spread of these species through the invasive framework (Blackburn et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). A rapid and effective biosurveillance program needs to be adopted and implemented to identify species of concern and address introduced specimens and populations early (Roe et al.,
