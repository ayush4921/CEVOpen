<p>Traditional biosurveillance methods that include specimen collections using a variety of trapping methods followed by morphological identification are time‐consuming and costly (Poland &amp; Rassati, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Molecular identification techniques, such as DNA barcoding, have been adopted for use in monitoring to speed identifications and standardize and digitize results (Hebert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The benefits of a DNA barcoding approach as a plant pest surveillance tool to reduce impacts on native crops and native diversity through early detection have been well established (Roe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). However, a DNA barcoding methodology still relies on a one‐by‐one specimen approach, which is labor intensive and time‐consuming. In addition, the use of DNA barcoding often occurs at points of suspected introductions such as border inspection sites. Morphological survey results from these sites have established that only about 10% of invasive species were identified prior to establishment (Kenis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). This low percentage shows how targeted surveys and a one‐by‐one morphological identification or DNA barcoding approach are not effective at detecting introduced species on a broad scale, an important first step in limiting the impacts of non‐native species.
