<p>The development of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding protocols is especially important within the context of the regulation of species by governmental agencies. When detecting taxa, the retention of whole specimens is essential for regulatory purposes to verify suspected presence. Recently eDNA from ethanol in traps has been used in a high‐throughput metabarcoding approach to identify DNA of species while retaining voucher specimens (Hajibabaei et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The use of ethanol for the preservation of specimens is effective in maintaining DNA for molecular analyses (King &amp; Porter,

 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). However, ethanol also causes insect specimens to become brittle, can cause changes in soft tissues such as discoloration and variable amounts of morphological changes, and can degrade small‐bodied organisms if maintained in solution at temperatures above freezing for extended periods (King &amp; Porter, 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Moreau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37113-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In addition to the issues with the preservation of morphological characteristics, the high evaporation rate of ethanol in traps, which are often left in the field for extended periods, and the placement of traps with high concentration ethanol in publicly accessible locations, provides further complications for the use of ethanol in field applications. Here we present a biosurveillance protocol using a saturated salt solution and a next‐generation metabarcoding approach that detects taxa of regulatory interest while maintaining intact specimens and simultaneously addressing concerns with the use of ethanol.
