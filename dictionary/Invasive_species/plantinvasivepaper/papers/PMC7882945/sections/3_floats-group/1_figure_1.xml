  <p>DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. (a) eDNA extracted from saturated salt solution in Lindgren funnel traps were separated on 1% agarose gel. (b) The first PCR to amplify the target COI gene region using each of extracted eDNA as a template and primers, mLepF1/RonMWASPdeg and C_LepFolR. Two amplification attempts were conducted using the same protocols for the sample in lane B2. The attempt on the far right of section B yielded positive results and was the thermocycling product used for the remainder of this study. (c) The second PCR and (d) the third PCR to attach Illumina adapter overhang nucleotide sequences to each of the first PCR amplicons and Illumina index primer sets to each of the second PCR amplicons, respectively. NW is a ddH
   <sub>2</sub>O negative control. NP is the PCR reaction without the template as a negative control for PCR contamination. W: Wheatley Ontario regional collection identifiers, B: Windsor Ontario regional collection identifiers. All DNAs in the gels were visualized by SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen)
