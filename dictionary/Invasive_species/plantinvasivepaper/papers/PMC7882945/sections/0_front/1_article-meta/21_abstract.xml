 <p>A forest survey using Lindgren funnel traps and a metabarcoding approach to amplify environmental DNA from a saturated salt solution trap fluid, which retains trap specimens for downstream morphological identifications. This method amplified DNA which matched more than 1,600 taxa using the COI animal DNA barcode. Of these taxa, there were numerous identified species of concern to Canadian forests.
