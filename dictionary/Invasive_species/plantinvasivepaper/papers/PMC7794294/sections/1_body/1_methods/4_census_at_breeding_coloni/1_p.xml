<p id="Par14">In Italy, sacred ibises always nested within colonies of other waterbirds, mostly heronries located in inland or coastal wetlands, in patches usually covered by alder or willow woods, bushes of 
 <italic>Salix</italic> or 
 <italic>Tamarix</italic> sp., or reedbeds, and less frequently in acacia groves and poplar plantations. These heronries were plurispecific, with one or more species of herons, egrets, and cormorants. In one case only, sacred ibises in NE Italy placed their nests on the ground among low bushes of 
 <italic>Salicornia</italic> sp. within a colony of 
 <italic>Platalea leucorodia</italic> and 
 <italic>Larus michahellis</italic>.
