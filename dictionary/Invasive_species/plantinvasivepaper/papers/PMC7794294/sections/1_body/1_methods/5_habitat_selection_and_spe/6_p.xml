 </sup> in R. We selected only one record for each cell in a grid 0.02 × 0.02 degrees (about 2.2 × 2.2 km). The records utilized in the model dropped from 10,260 to 1252 observations. A preliminary model run with 8884 records (selected by the "remove duplicate presence records" option in Maxent, without any grid sample technique) showed very similar results, in accord with the indication that changing grain size does not severely affect prediction for SDM
