<p id="Par8">The sacred ibis, a medium size wader, is easily observed in nature for its unmistakable appearance, plumage predominantly white with contrasting black tips of remiges and tertials, naked black neck and head, large and curved bill. It is also clearly visible from a distance in its usually open habitats, so it is easily detected by nonprofessional birders. In this study we used a dataset composed of 10,260 records. We utilized the data collected by three projects of citizen science: 627 records from the AVES database of GPSO running in NW Italy from 1999

 </sup>. We also used information collected in annual reports of national, regional, and local ornithological associations (459 records, respectively extracted from: EBN annual report, 147; Associazione Faunisti Veneti annual report, 176; Emilia-Romagna annual report, 6; GPSO annual report, 75; Checklist of birds of Modena, 21; Cronaca Ornitologica Toscana, 12; Liguria Birding, 22). We also added to the data set some records of occasional personal observation from us and other observers (55). We finally used 669 incidental observations collected by us during distance sampling.
