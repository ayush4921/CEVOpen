 </sup>. Two observers in a car travelled at low speed along road transects. Each time an ibis was detected, the observers stopped and measured the distance of the individual by a laser telemeter (Leica Rangemaster LRF 800 or LRF 900). In total we travelled along 2034 km (N = 140 transects with a mean of 14.5 km each). Transect data were grouped in two periods:
