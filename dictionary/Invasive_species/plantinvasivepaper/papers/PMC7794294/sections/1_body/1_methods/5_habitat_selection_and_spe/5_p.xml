<p id="Par21">We utilized the software Maxent (version 3.3.3,

Maximum entropy models have been found to be particularly robust for SDM estimations in cases where presence-only data is available

 </sup>. In the Maxent model, we inserted the points with ascertained presence of sacred ibis, the land use classes as categorical variables, and the altitude and bioclim values as continuous variables. The program was run with these settings: remove duplicate presence records, random seed, regularization multiplier = 1,10,000 maximum number of background points, 500 maximum iterations, cross-validate replicated run type (80% of records were randomly extracted for training and 20% for testing the model). The predictive performance of the models was tested analyzing the receiver operated characteristics area under curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS)
