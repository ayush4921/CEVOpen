<p id="Par19">In NW-Italy, we utilized the detailed PTF cartography provided by Regione Piemonte administration

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> to define habitat distribution in the study area. The PTF maps come from aerial photographs collected in 2016 and are converted into maps at the 1:10,000 scale. Habitats were originally codified in 126 land use classes. We clumped these classes into 17 classes of interest for the sacred ibis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We also utilized the digital terrain model (DTM) provided by Italian Istituto Geografico Militare to calculate a topographical parameter, the altitude. DTM was downloaded at 5 × 5 m accuracy, then the GDAL connection plugin from QGIS software (GDAL/OGR contributors 2019) was utilized to calculate altitude at a 50 × 50 m grid size. In the detailed NW-Italy model we did not insert the bioclimatic variables.
