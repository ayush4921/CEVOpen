<p id="Par43">Currently, all breeding sites observed in Italy are multi-specific. During reproduction, the sacred ibis always mixes with herons or egrets in their heronries. This condition is different from that observed in western France during the sudden expansion of 2000â€“2005

 </sup>, where the breeding colonies of ibis were monospecific. This circumstance has strong consequences in terms of management of the species, because any intervention on the nest site, the eggs, or the chicks of the ibis will cause a disturb that can negatively impact the associated herons, egrets, and other waterbirds, most of them currently deserving conservation concern

 </sup>. Moreover, a number of heronries in Italy are now included in natural parks and in nature reserves, some of which have been designed specifically for the protection of waterbird colonies and are therefore submitted to strict regulation

 </sup>. The continuous increase in the number of sacred ibises in Italy requires guidelines for the management of this alien species. In 2016, the sacred ibis was included in the list of invasive alien species (IAS) of Union relevance (EU Implementing Regulation 2016/1141), in application of EU Regulation 2014/1143 containing provisions aimed at preventing and managing the introduction and spread of invasive alien species. However, until recently, its presence was commonly advertised by zoos and they were offered for sale by exotic bird breeders located in various Italian regions, including Sardinia and Sicily
