<p id="Par36">Our study shows that, after the first reports of nesting observed in northwestern Italy, the population remained at a low level until 2005, along a 17-year period. A sudden increase of breeding and roosting individuals occurred later, during the last 14Â years. In all cases, the population expansion was carried out by colonizing existing heronries. Outside Piedmont, cases of nesting have been reported in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, plus a temporary attempt in Tuscany. The increase of the breeding population was accompanied and preceded by a diffusion of the species in new areas. The observations collected by the citizen science projects in Italy show that the Italian population has recently expanded considerably. Reports of individuals or groups, in movement and/or wintering, were recorded in various areas of central Italy, and some individuals were observed in the southern peninsula (Apulia). From 2017, some individuals were observed in Sardinia, but it is unclear whether they reached the island from the continent or, more probably, they were due to a local escape of captive birds
