 </sup>. All other land use classes were less likely to be utilized. This sharp habitat selection lent to a map of predicted areas for possible expansion of the species that covers all the regions of northern Italy, where rice cultivation is widespread, as well as the vast wetland area of the Po delta and the Venice and Grado lagoons in northern Italy. In central and southern Italy there is no tradition of rice cultivation, but the presence of the species is predicted where wetland areas do exist, particularly along the coasts. Part of the Sardinia island also represents an area of predicted high probability of presence of the species. Here, wide wetland areas and rice fields are present in the Oristano and Cagliari provinces, the last being the zone where the first observations of the species occurred

 </sup>. The SDM including the bioclimatic variables indicated a lower probability of presence in southern Italy and Sicily, and a reduction of the area of presence in Sardinia. This model is strongly influenced by bioclim4 (temperature seasonality), with higher predicted presences in high temperature seasonality areas. Indeed, values of this climatic factor are high in the northern Po plain, an area that shows a continental climate, and lower in southern regions that show a Mediterranean climate.
