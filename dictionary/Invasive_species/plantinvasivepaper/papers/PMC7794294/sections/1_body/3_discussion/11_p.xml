<p id="Par44">Management of alien species is a difficult task. A strong debate exists about to what extent invasive species are dangerous for local species and cause their extinction

 </sup>, and there is no danger of large scale hybridization with taxonomically close species. In the case of eradication plans, public attitudes to the management of invasive non-native species should be carefully taken into account

This study represents a snapshot of the current distribution of the sacred ibis in Italy, of the increase in nesting colonies and roosting sites, and predictions of new areas were future expansion will likely occur through the use of species distribution models. These data will help scientists and conservation ecologists to build risk analysis and management strategies for the species.
