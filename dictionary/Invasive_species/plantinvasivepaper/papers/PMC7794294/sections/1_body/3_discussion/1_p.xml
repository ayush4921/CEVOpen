<p id="Par34">Sacred ibises have been able to expand their presence in several areas outside their historical range, albeit with differing success. In this study, we show the pattern of spreading of this invasive species in Italy. There were only a few pairs of breeding sacred ibises from 1989 to 1997, which slowly increased over time. Only 9 pairs were recorded in 1998 with 25 fledglings and 24–26 pairs in 2000

 </sup>. In the early 2000s, the only active breeding area was located in the northwestern Italy, in the Vercelli province, but trophic movements in the rice fields of the nearby Novara province were frequently reported. The first large group of ibises out of the Vercelli province was reported at Casalbeltrame, Novara, in 2006 (180 individuals on February 15). After 2006, the expansion of the sacred ibis was continuous and exponential. The number of breeding sites increased to 32 in northern Italy, with an estimated number of breeding pairs reaching 1249 in 2019. In winter, the birds aggregated at night in large roosts that recently reach a maximum of two thousand individuals. In 2019, the number of wintering ibises reached 11,000 in 19 roosts within NW Italy, and several other individuals were observed wintering in other areas of northern Italy. The recent increase in breeding sacred ibis in northern Italy mirrors the sudden increase observed in France during the 1994–2006 period. In France, 20 individuals were imported from Kenya and were sorted into different wildlife parks through four deliveries between 1975 and 1980. In a short time, a reproductive colony settled at the Branféré Zoological Garden in southern Brittany. In a natural habitat, the species was first noticed in 1993 near Golfe du Morbihan

 </sup>. In France, the first winter census was carried out in the winter 2003–2004, with 2,500 ibises counted, while in the winter 2004–2005 there were about 3,000 individuals. In 2006, the number of reproductive pairs reached 1700 with a winter estimate now exceeding 5,000 individuals. In France other escapes occurred in the Mediterranean, but none was as successful as that of the Atlantic coast
