<p id="Par6">The first aim of this work was to describe the spread and the abundance of the sacred ibis in Italy since its appearance in 1989 up to 2019. We utilized: (a) incidental observations collected by voluntaries for citizen science projects; (b) density estimates calculated from transect lines with the distance-sampling method; (c) censuses at the breeding colonies; (d) winter censuses at roosts.</p>
