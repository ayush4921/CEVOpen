Some cases of nesting occurred also in northeastern Italy (Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and in Tuscany. Wintering or moving individuals were recorded throughout all northern Italy and in Tuscany, Latium, and Sardinia. However, most of the Italian wild ibises are still confined to NW Italy. Sacred ibises in Europe are opportunistic feeders consuming a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate prey
