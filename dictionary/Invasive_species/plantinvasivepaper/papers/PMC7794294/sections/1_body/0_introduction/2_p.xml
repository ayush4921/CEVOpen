<p id="Par3">Nevertheless, the real danger posed by allochtonous invaders should not be presumed, instead it should be estimated for each case, different management options should be evaluated in relation to the arrival of a new species

 </sup>. Hence, conservation projects should distinguish allochthones that would cause negligible effects from those that cause significant damage to biodiversity. An invasive species can have a major impact in some areas and marginal effects in other sites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
