<p id="Par31">The species distribution model computed for the whole Italy (the model had: area under curve AUC training data = 0.955; AUC test data = 0.943; true skill statistic TSS = 0.826) indicates a higher probability of presence below 300 m altitudes, and a selection for two land use classes: rice fields and wetlands. The other land use classes showed a low predicted probability of presence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In Italy, all mountain or hilly areas of the Alps and Apennines were predicted to be unfavourable. All the northern Italy plains, from Piemonte in NW to Friuli and Veneto in NE, as well as several plains in central and southern Italy, a small part of Sicily, and a vast area of Sardinia were favourable for the presence of the species.
