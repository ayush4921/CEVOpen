 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In the first census year we counted 4068 individuals within 13 roosts. The increase of ibises was continuous in the following years, with 6765, 9419, and 10,830 roosting individuals in 2017, 2018, and 2019 respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The roost size varied significantly during the study period (Kruskal–Wallis rank test = 8.307, d.f. = 3, P = 0.04), increasing from a median of 245 and 348 in the first 2 years to 716 and 753 in the last two (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The maximum number of individuals in the largest roost was 790 in 2016, 2158 in 2017, 2050 in 2018, and 1692 in 2019.
