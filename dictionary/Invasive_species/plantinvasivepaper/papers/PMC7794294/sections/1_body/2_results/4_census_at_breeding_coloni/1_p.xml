<p id="Par27">The first reports of free nesting sacred ibises occurred in 1989 and concerned one nest in a heronry in the Lame del Sesia natural park, Vercelli province, plus some nests in the Cornelle private park, Bergamo province (Supplementary Material 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In 1998 at the Lame del Sesia natural park, 9 nests were estimated, 25 juveniles were observed fledging, and a maximum of 48 adults were counted. In the early 2000s, the only active breeding area remained in the Vercelli province, but trophic movements in the rice fields of the nearby province of Novara begun to be reported. Up to 2006, all the breeding sites were within NW Italy, only one or two breeding colonies existed, and the number of nests remained low. In 2006, the first colony was observed in NE Italy, where the number of occupied sites totalled four in recent years. Outside northern Italy, only a few attempts were recorded after 2016 in northern Tuscany.
