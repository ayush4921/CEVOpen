<p id="Par29">All breeding sacred ibises shared their colonies with other waterbirds. In NW Italy, where most colonies were located, the associated species were Grey Herons 
 <italic>Ardea cinerea</italic> (present in 23% of the sacred ibis colonies), Purple Herons 
 <italic>Ardea purpurea</italic> (5%), Cattle Egrets 
 <italic>Bubulcus ibis</italic>, Little Egrets 
 <italic>Egretta garzetta</italic>, Night Herons 
 <italic>N. nycticorax</italic> (22% for each of the three species) and Cormorants 
 <italic>Phalacrocorax carbo</italic> (6%). Others, less abundant species of colonial waterbirds (e.g. Glossy ibis 
 <italic>Plegadis falcinellus</italic>) occurred in few cases. The frequency of occurrence of these waterbirds in colonies with sacred ibises did not differ significantly from their occurrence in the other colonies found within a 20-km radius but without them (Yates chi-square 5.06, df = 5, P = 0.41). The mixed colonies with sacred ibises in NW Italy were located on small tree patches (7% of cases), trees and bushes within inland wetlands (38%), riverine woodland vegetation (10%), dry woods (20%), reedbeds (3%), and trees in suburban parks or near inhabited landscapes (21%). Again, the frequencies of these habitats did not differ between colonies with or without ibises within 20-km (Yates chi-square 0.99, df = 5, P = 0.91).
