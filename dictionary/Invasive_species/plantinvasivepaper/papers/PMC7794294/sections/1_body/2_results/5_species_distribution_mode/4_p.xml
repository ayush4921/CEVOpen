<p id="Par33">In the rice-field area of north-western Italy, where the sacred ibis is actually more abundant, a detailed assessment of the foraging habitats was performed during field transects. Most individuals were observed in rice fields, particularly in the boundary areas of the rice check (EMB: N = 194 cases), in the partially watered plots (PAR: N = 108), and in watered plots and rice fields (FLO and RIC: N = 76 and 32). Several observations were also performed in stubble or uncultivated land (STU = 86) and in ploughed fields (PLO = 86). The birds were rarely observed in sown fields and meadows (N = 51), did not perch on poplar groves or tree rows, and did not forage in the town interiors nor in their surrounding suburbs (0%).</p>
