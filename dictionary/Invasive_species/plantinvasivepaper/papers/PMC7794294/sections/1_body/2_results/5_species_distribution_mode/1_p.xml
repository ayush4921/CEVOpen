<p id="Par30">In the detailed SDM computed for NW-Italy, we inserted the altitude and the land use class as predictors. The altitudes with a higher percent probability of presence were below 300Â m above sea level, and there was a strong preference for a single land use class, the rice fields (Supplementary Material 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). All other land use classes showed a low predicted probability of presence. The eastern part of the region, where rice fields are widespread, was predicted to be the most favourable location for the presence of the species.
