<p id="Par32">Results of the model which includes altitude, land use, and bioclimatic variables are reported in Supplementary Material 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The VIF preliminary analysis of multicollinearity retained 9 out of 19 bioclimatic variables to be inserted in the SDM. The model confirmed the results of the previous model both for altitudes (below 300Â m) and land use (higher probabilities in rice fields and wetlands). The bioclimatic variable that most influenced the probability of presence of the species was bioclim4 (temperature seasonality), with higher predicted suitability in high temperature seasonality areas. With respect to the previous model, this SDM predicted less favourable conditions for the presence of the species in Sicily, southern Italy, and most of Sardinia (Supplementary Material
