 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Detailed year-after-year distributions are reported in Supplementary Material 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. After the establishment of a first free living group near the breeding colony at Lame del Sesia (NW-Italy) in 1989, the observations occurred mainly within nearby areas until 1995, and in a few localities of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna until 2000. The main expansion in northern Italy occurred in 2010, when the species was abundantly recorded in a wide area on the Po plain, and in central Italy after 2015 when records became common in Tuscany, Marche, and Latium, and some individuals reached Apulia in southern Italy. From 2017, some individuals were observed in Sardinia.
