  <p>Comparing the activities of antioxidant proteins in 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> induced by salinity. 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> were treated with 300 mM NaCl for 7 days. At the indicated time points, 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> leaves were collected and APX activity (A), SOD activity (B), SNO content (C), and GSNOR activity (D) were measured. Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. Means denoted by different letters show significant differences at 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 according to Tukey’s test.
