<p>The cross-communication between H
 <sub>2</sub>S and other small molecular signals, such as NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been thoroughly investigated in plants exposed to biotic or abiotic stress. For example, 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DES1 is involved in ABA-dependent NO production and stomatal closure, and NO acts downstream of H
 <sub>2</sub>S in the ABA-induced stomatal closure.

 </sup> H
 <sub>2</sub>S treatment also improves the tolerance of rice to salt stress or mercury toxicity.

 </sup> Salt stress can induce 
 <sc>l</sc>- activity and raise the production of endogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>S in plant 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>. Furthermore, exogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>S treatment was shown to minimize the salt toxicity effects by modulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes, maintaining K
 <sup>+</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup> homeostasis, and preventing K
 <sup>+</sup>-efflux triggered by NaCl.

 </sup> H
 <sub>2</sub>S also alleviates heat stress in maize, arsenate toxicity in pea, and cadmium toxicity in 
 <italic>Brassica</italic> through the regulation of the ascorbateâ€“glutathione cycle and ROS signaling.

 </sup> However, the mechanism by which H
 <sub>2</sub>S interacts with other signals to modulate plant adaptation to environmental stress is yet to be elucidated. The H
 <sub>2</sub>S signal increases the activity of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) to control stomatal closure.
