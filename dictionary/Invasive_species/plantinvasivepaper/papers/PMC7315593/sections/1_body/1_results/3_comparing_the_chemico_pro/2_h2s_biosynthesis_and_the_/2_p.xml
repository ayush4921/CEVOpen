 </sup> Proteomics data in this study showed that some proteins involved in the H
 <sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis coordinately accumulated after NaCl treatment (

 <sub>2</sub>S signal in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salt stress. Thus, the endogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>S content in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> was measured and found that NaCl gradually induced the generation of H
 <sub>2</sub>S, peaking after 5 days of NaCl treatment. NaCl treatment also induced H
 <sub>2</sub>S generation in the leaves of 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic>, but to a lesser extent than in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> (

 <sub>2</sub>S generation, the enzyme activity of 
 <sc>l</sc>-CD was also higher in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> than in those of 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> after NaCl treatment (

 <sub>2</sub>S generation in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> than in 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic>, and indicate the potential role of H
 <sub>2</sub>S in enhancing 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salt stress.
