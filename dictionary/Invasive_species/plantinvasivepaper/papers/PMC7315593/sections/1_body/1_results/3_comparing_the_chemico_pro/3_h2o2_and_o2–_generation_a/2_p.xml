 </sup> In this study, a series of antioxidant enzymes, such as spot 54 (thioredoxin reductase NTRC), spot 57 (glutathione synthetase), spot 77 (cysteine synthase), spot 84 (SOD), spot 85 (APX), and spot 87 (glutathione S-transferase 1), were found and their differential regulation after salt stress indicated the possible role of antioxidant enzymes in the response to salt stress in
