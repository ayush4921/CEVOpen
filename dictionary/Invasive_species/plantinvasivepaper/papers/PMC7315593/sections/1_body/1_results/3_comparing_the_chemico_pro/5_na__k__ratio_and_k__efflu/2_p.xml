<p>Cellular ion homeostasis is impaired in plants exposed to salt stress, and the cytosol of cells of salt-tolerant plants typically sustain high levels of K
 <sup>+</sup> and low levels of Na
 <sup>+</sup> under salt stress.

 </sup> Plasma membrane H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase and Na
 <sup>+</sup>/H
 <sup>+</sup> antiporter play key roles in maintaining cellular Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> homeostasis.

 </sup> In this study, proteomics data showed that the accumulation of protein spot 16 encoding H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase and spot 111 encoding V-type proton ATPase subunit G1 were increased, indicating that they function in sustaining ion homeostasis in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> after exposure to salt stress. To investigate cellular Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> homeostasis following exposure to salt stress, Na
 <sup>+</sup> content, K
 <sup>+</sup> content, and Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ratio in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> plants were then examined under salt stress. Salt stress increased the concentration of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and decreased K
 <sup>+</sup>, resulting in a sharp increase in the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ratio in the 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> leaves (

  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>A). The increase in Na
 <sup>+</sup> percentage and Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ratio and decrease in K
 <sup>+</sup> percentage were not as obvious in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>
 </xref>A), possibly due to the increased PM H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity.
