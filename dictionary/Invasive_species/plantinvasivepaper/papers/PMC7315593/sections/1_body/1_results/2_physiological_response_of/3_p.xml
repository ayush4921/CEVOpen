<p>In order to further explore the mechanism underlying salt stress response in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>, the comparative proteomics approach was used to monitor the protein profile in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> after 1, 3, and 5 days of 300 mM NaCl stress. A total of 86 proteins were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF and changed significantly in response to salt stress (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with the control (

 </xref>A,B and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). These identified proteins were divided into nine and seven groups based on the annotated and putative biological functions, respectively (

Most of these proteins were metabolism- and energy-related proteins, followed by defense proteins and transcription factors. Proteins associated with epigenetics, protein stability, and hormone metabolism were also detected (

 </xref>B). In addition, we found that proteins involved in the H
 <sub>2</sub>S metabolism, such as protein spot 65 (putative 
 <sc>d</sc>-cysteine desulfhydrase 2) and protein spot 79 (cystathionine Î³-lyase/cysteine synthase), and proteins involved in autophagy, such as spot 44 (autophagy protein 5) and spot 50 (cysteine protease ATG4), were regulated differentially after salt stress (

 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>.
