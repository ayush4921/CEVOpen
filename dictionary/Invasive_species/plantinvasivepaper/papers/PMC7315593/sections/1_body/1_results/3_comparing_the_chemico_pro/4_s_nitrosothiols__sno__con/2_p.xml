<p>Besides H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, NO also acts as a signal that regulates the cellular redox balance. NO-derived RNS, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO
 <sup>–</sup>), dinitrogen trioxide (N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>–</sup>), reacts with cellular GSH to form GSNO, which then transfers the NO group to cellular protein thiols to form the longer-lived SNOs through protein S-nitrosylation.

 </sup> A previous study showed that the metabolism of GSNO could be catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved GSNOR. The proteomic data also showed that the accumulation of GSNOR (spot 69) was upregulated by salt stress (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c01275/suppl_file/ao0c01275_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link>), indicating a potential role of GSNOR in controlling SNOs in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> after exposure to salt stress. Here, the level of SNOs in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> after exposure to salt stress was compared, and the result suggested that salt stress increased SNO accumulation in both 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic>, with the SNO level in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> being markedly lower than that in 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> (

  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>C). Consistent with the proteomic data, the enzyme activity of GSNOR was upregulated in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> after exposure to salt stress. While such an increase in activity was also observed in 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> after exposure to salt stress, the increase was not as striking as in 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>D). These data suggest that GSNOR catalyzes the SNO metabolism in plants after exposure to abiotic stress.
