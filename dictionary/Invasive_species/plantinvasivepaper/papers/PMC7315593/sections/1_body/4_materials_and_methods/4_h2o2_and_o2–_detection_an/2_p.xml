 </sup> Three leaf discs exposed to different salt treatments were punched out and vacuum infiltrated with 10 mL of 1 mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup> of DAB solution for 2 h. After infiltration, using boiling ethanol (95%), the leaves were cleaned for 30 min and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was detected using DAB staining. The accumulation of O

 <sup>–</sup> in leaves after different periods of treatment was determined using 10–2 M NBT reduction. The leaf discs were then vacuum infiltrated for 2 h using 10 mL of NBT and cleaned for 30 min using boiling ethanol (95%).
