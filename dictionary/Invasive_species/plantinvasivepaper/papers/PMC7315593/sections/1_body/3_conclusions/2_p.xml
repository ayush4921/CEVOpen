<p>In this study, physiological and chemico-proteomics approaches were applied to explore the mechanism underlying salt stress tolerance in the invasive plant species 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> compared with the native species 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic>. Additionally, the effects of H
 <sub>2</sub>S signaling on 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> were also determined through an inhibitor experiment. The results demonstrated that H
 <sub>2</sub>S signaling plays a central role in enhancing 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salt stress. Salinity stress triggers 
 <sc>l</sc>-CD enzyme activity to rapidly induce H
 <sub>2</sub>S generation in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>; the H
 <sub>2</sub>S signal activates antioxidant enzymes (APX and SOD), thereby limiting ROS accumulation, and also activates GSNOR, thereby reducing RNS damage. H
 <sub>2</sub>S also improves 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salinity stress by reducing the K
 <sup>+</sup> efflux and thereby maintaining an intracellular Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> homeostasis. Thus, the findings provide insights into the H
 <sub>2</sub>S mechanism underlying salt stress tolerance in the invasive plant species 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and show that H
 <sub>2</sub>S has an important role in this process by modulating the ROS and RNS status of the stressed cells. The findings also provide clues as to how to control this species and curb its encroachment on the native plant species by reducing H
 <sub>2</sub>S signaling.
