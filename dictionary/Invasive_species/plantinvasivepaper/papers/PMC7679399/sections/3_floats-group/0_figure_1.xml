  <p>Experimental design. This design was used for both harvests. Both mycorrhizal (M+) and nonmycorrhizal (M−) pots were pre-planted with a nurse plant 
   <italic>Festuca pratensis</italic>. Soil was disturbed or left intact before target plants were planted, resulting in disturbed or non-disturbed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks in M+ treatment. Each figured pot contained 5 replicates.
