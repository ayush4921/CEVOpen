  <p>Fraction of shoot dry biomass and fraction of shoot P content of native 
   <italic>Inula conyzae</italic> (gray box), growing in pairs with invasive 
   <italic>Echinops sphaerocephalus</italic> (white box) detected in the plant biomass per cultivation pot (i.e., the share of resources diverted to the native plant on a whole cultivation pot basis, with the remaining part of the particular resource being assignable to the invasive plant) as affected by mycorrhizal inoculation (M+: mycorrhizal inoculum added; M−: nonmycorrhizal control), initial soil disturbance (disturbed: substrate in the pot disturbed before target plants inserted; non-disturbed: target plants planted into non-disturbed substrate, resulting in non-disturbed CMNs of M+ pots), and harvest (harvest 1: first harvest; harvest 2: second harvest). Bars represent means accompanied by standard errors (n = 5). Different letters above individual bars indicate significant differences between means at
