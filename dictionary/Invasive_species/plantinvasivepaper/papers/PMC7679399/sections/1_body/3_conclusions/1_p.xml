<p id="Par21">In our current study, we focused on competition of important invasive species from the family Asteraceae in central Europe with a co-occurring native forb, both are abundant in invaded semi-natural plant communities. Among the economically and ecologically important mycotrophic invasive plants in Central Europe, the Asteraceae family is the most abundant. Additionally, we selected species from one family (Asteraceae), as domestic plants of the same family typically bring the least bias.</p>
