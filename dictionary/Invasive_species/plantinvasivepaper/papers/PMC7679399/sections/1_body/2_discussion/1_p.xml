<p id="Par17">In agreement with our hypothesis which predicted AM fungi help facilitate the success of a mycotrophic invasive plant in competition with a domestic plant, our study shows that there were negative effects of AM fungi on proportional total biomass and P content of native 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>. Our results indicate that the presence of AM fungi enhanced the competitive ability of invasive 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> against native 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>. This is in agreement with Callaway et al.
