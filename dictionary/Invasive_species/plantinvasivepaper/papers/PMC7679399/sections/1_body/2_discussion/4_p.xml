<p id="Par20">The mechanisms of mutualist degradation may be mediated by allelochemical production by invasive plants. Allelopathy likely played a role in the invasion success of non-native

 </sup>. While beyond the scope of our current study, it is possible that allelopathic biochemicals produced by invasive 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> decreased mycorrhizal colonization in native 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>, thereby reducing mycorrhizal benefits. However, AM fungi continued to be beneficial to 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic>. Therefore, it is likely that the decrease in abundance of AM fungi in the roots of domestic 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic> when grown with the invasive plant is a reflection of root turnover, as colonized roots died and were replaced by new root growth not able to form associations with the fungal symbiosis. This was also reflected by reduced biomass production of the native plant when grown with the invasive plant.
