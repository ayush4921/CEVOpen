<p id="Par13">To assess competition between the two coexisting plant species, we calculated the fraction of total plant biomass and P content of each native plant (i.e., the relative biomass, or ‘share’ of resources, diverted to the native plant on a whole pot basis, with the remaining portion of the particular resource assumed to belong to the invasive plant). Based on this calculation, both relative biomass production and P content of native

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These interactions reflected the absence of significance between M− and M+ plants at the first harvest, compared to significantly (
