<p id="Par29">The experiment consisted of two harvest times (64 and 91 days after target plants were planted) to assess the effects of disturbance across time. The shoots of all target plants were cut at the hypocotyl–root interface and subsequently dried for 3 days at 65 °C to determine shoot dry weight (hereafter called plant biomass). The roots were washed from the substrate under cold tap water, weighed, and cut into 1.5 cm fragments. The roots were then divided into three sections. One section was immersed in 50% ethanol to determine AM fungal colonization. The second was kept in the freezer at − 20 °C for molecular analyses. The last section was weighed, dried, and weighed again; fresh to dry weight ratio was determined and total root dry weight was calculated for each root system.</p>
