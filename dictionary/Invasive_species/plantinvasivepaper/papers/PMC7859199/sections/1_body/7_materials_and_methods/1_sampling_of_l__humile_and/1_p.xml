<p id="Par15">This study was performed at Kobe Port (34°41′–34°40′ N and 135°13′–135°12′ E) in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, on sunny days from August 2017 to April 2018. As mentioned above, four 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies with different haplotypes (LH1, LH2, LH3, LH4) had previously been detected adjacent to Kobe Port

 </sup>, all of which structured their nests mainly in roadside cracks adjacent to parks, street trees, and factory premises. We collected 5–10 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> samples consisting of 10–20 workers of each supercolony per sample and samples for baseline organisms (i.e., primary consumers, including aphids, mealybugs, and grasshoppers) in each sampling site once a season (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Baseline organisms were used to estimate the TP of each 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolony (see 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">
  <italic>Stable iso</italic>
  <italic>to</italic>
  <italic>pe analysis</italic>
 </xref>). However, when calculating the TP of LH4, we used the same baseline 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>13</sup>C and 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>15</sup>N as for LH1 because LH4 and LH1 were found in very close proximity (ca. 150 m) to each other. Otherwise, the distance between sampling sites was at least 200 m. 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers and other arthropods were sampled by sucking with a fluke tube and using a 68 × 68 cm beating net (N-type, Mushi-sha Ltd., Tokyo).
