 </sup> were weighed to approximately 0.5 mg (approximately 6–7 individuals per analytical sample) into 5 × 8 mm tin cups and then analysed with a Delta V isotope mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) equipped with an elemental analyser. If a sample of a given species weighed less than 0.5 mg, other individuals of this species were added until a total of 0.5 mg was reached.
