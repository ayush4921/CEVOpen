<p id="Par23">The SEAc correction (SEAc: unbiased correction for differences in sample sizes of SEAs) accounts for loss of a second degree of freedom. In addition, a Bayesian-estimated SEAc (SEAb: 10
 <sup>5</sup> Bayesian iterations of SEAc), its credible intervals (10
 <sup>5</sup> posterior draws), CR (maximum

 <sup>13</sup>C), and NR (maximum

 <sup>15</sup>N–minimum

 <sup>15</sup>N) from multiple Bayesian iterations (10
 <sup>5</sup>) were calculated by a bootstrapping procedure, which allowed a robust comparison among the four 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies that had different sample sizes. Probability (
 <italic>P</italic>) values ranging from zero to one were calculated as the likelihood of the differences in SEAb, CR and NR; zero indicated no difference, and 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.6 was considered significant

 </sup>. Then, we calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to confirm the relationship between SEAb and dominance rank (number of introduced countries in the world) as an indicator of the degree of invasion success for each supercolony. The number of introduced countries was determined from Inoue et al.
