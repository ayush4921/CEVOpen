<p id="Par4">To understand the mechanisms and processes underlying the high invasion success of the 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> LH1 supercolony compared with other supercolonies, we focused on differences in trait levels among 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies. In particular, we investigated whether diet breadth differs among supercolonies. In general, diet breadth is an effective driver of invasion success
 <sup>

 </sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the LH1 supercolony has greater diet breadth than other supercolonies, which results in the superior invasion success of LH1 and its subsequent dominance worldwide. Some researchers have attempted to describe the diet breadth of invasive species based on the range of the carbon (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>15</sup>N) stable isotope ratio
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> and reported that the range of 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>13</sup>C and 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>15</sup>N in species with high invasiveness are broader than those of less-invasive species in various taxonomic groups
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, diet breadth differs between more- and less-invasive species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. However, most of these studies are only “interspecific” comparisons between closely related species (i.e., same genus, same family). Thus, we applied this technique to measure the diet breadth of individual 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies (to identify intraspecific variation).
