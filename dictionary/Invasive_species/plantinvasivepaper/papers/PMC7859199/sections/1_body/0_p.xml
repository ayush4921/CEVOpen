<p id="Par2">Biological invasions have increased with the increases in world tourism and trade. However, not all introduced species become successful invaders. To predict invasion success (i.e., successful post-invasion colonization), many researchers have attempted to identify the key traits of biological invaders that facilitate invasion success in new environments and habitats, such as aggressiveness
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>, thermal tolerance
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>, and diet breadth
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. A typical approach for determining such key traits is to investigate differences between more- and less-successful populations of widespread, dominant species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. However, since studies employing this approach have often focused on interspecific differences in biological traits
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, the roles of intraspecific differences in invasiveness and/or biological traits within conspecifics with different genotypes have been largely overlooked. Given that whether the ability of introduced organisms to successfully expand their distributions after invasion may have a genetic basis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, there must also be intraspecific differences (i.e., differences among haplotypes) in invasion success.
