<p id="Par5">In Japan, four 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies with different mitochondrial haplotypes (LH1 (main supercolony), LH2, LH3, and LH4) have been found as of 2017

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. The distribution ranges of the LH2, LH3, and LH4 supercolonies in Japan are narrower (representing less successful invasion) than the range of LH1

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> (representing more successful invasion) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Remarkably, all of the 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies have been detected in only Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture, among the introduced prefectural regions and cities in Japan (see Sunamura et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> for details on the distribution of each 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolony). Furthermore, each of their ranges is limited to several square kilometres. Therefore, Kobe City (Japan) is one of the most suitable areas for a comparative study of the diet breadth of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> supercolonies.
