<p id="Par12">Although the CR of baseline organisms within the sampling site of LH1/LH4 was significantly narrower than those of the others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), the CR of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> LH1 showed opposite trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). These results suggest the possibility that 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> LH1 consumed more diverse baseline resources than the other supercolonies, despite the relatively limited 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>13</sup>C variation of baseline resources. In addition, such a broader range of CR in LH1 supercolony suggests that LH1 has a superior foraging (i.e., resource exploitation) ability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> to other supercolonies. A higher CR value implies the use of a diverse resource base
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, Given that variations in 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sup>13</sup>C occur in association with changes in the microenvironment, an increase in CR can lead to a greater range of resource exploration (i.e., more extensive resource acquisition). This is likely to reflect strong foraging ability, as mentioned by Jackson et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, given that LH1 supercolony is more aggressive than other supercolonies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup> and superior to other supercolonies in food acquisition due to its behavioural characteristics, the ability of workers to explore resources in a broad range of sites/environments might also be the greatest in LH1 supercolony. To validate this possibility, the behavioural characteristics of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers for food exploitation should be compared among supercolonies.
