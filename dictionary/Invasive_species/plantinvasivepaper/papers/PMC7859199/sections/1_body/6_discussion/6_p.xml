<p id="Par14">Previous studies on the mechanisms and processes of biological invasions have mainly emphasized interspecific differences in biological traits and invasion success rather than intraspecific differences

 </sup>. In this context, our study highlights the importance of traitâ€“invasion success relationships, especially at the within-species level rather than at the among-species level, which are well known. Therefore, focusing on the intraspecific variation in addition to the interspecific variation in trait levels should be helpful for assessing potential biological invaders that successfully invade new habitats and then become dominant.
