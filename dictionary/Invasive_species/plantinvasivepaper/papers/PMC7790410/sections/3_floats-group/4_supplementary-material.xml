  <title>Map of High Line Canal greenway in relationship to US EPA level IV Ecoregions.</title>
  <p>The “Character Zones” overlaid on the Ecoregions represent large-scale variation from the southwest to the northeast of the greenway, characterized by a transition from foothills to plains habitat, which is in turn overlaid by different degrees of land use intensity. These habitat and land use factors shape the “character” of the greenway, as the viewshed changes in relationship to topography, type and density of vegetation, and the type and density of surrounding development.</p>
