  <title>Map of greenway extent covered during the opportunistic floristic sampling as measured by daily starting and stopping waypoints logged with a GPS unit.</title>
  <p>The “Character Zones” overlaid on the satellite imagery represent large-scale variation from the southwest to the northeast of the greenway, characterized by a transition from foothills to plains habitat, which is in turn overlaid by different degrees of land use intensity. These habitat and land use factors shape the “character” of the greenway, as the viewshed changes in relationship to topography, type and density of vegetation, and the type and density of surrounding development.</p>
