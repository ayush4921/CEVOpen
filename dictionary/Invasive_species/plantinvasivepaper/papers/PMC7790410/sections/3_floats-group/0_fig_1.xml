  <title>Conceptual diagram illustrating the different research foci, sampling approaches, and research outputs of floristic botanists and plant ecologists, placed within the context of the species-rank abundance curve.</title>
  <p>This curve typifies many plant communities in which a few species are common, while many species are rare. Plant ecology research often focuses on common species that drive ecological processes. Describing these processes requires transects or plots that allow for statistical hypothesis-testing to answer specific questions. This approach necessarily shrinks the area that can be sampled, causing species far out on the tail of rarity to be missed. Conversely, floristic botany focuses on species discovery, taxonomy, systematics, and the building of floras, which do not rely on statistically designed field sampling. This frees floristic botanists to search exhaustively for unique species in a study area, moving them farther out on the tail of rarity for a better estimate of a site’s “true” species pool. Each approach yields unique outputs. For example, the ecological approach may quantify contemporary relationships between plant relative abundances and their environment (top left of figure), while the floristic approach generates specimens, phylogenies, or floras with species distribution maps (top right of figure). The research outputs of each field could be more mutually informative (cycling arrows), e.g., if a collected specimen was linked to a plot-based estimate of that species relative abundance at the collection location.</p>
