   <bold>A-C.</bold> Distribution of species captured by the floristic botany (collections) and ecological (transects) sampling approaches in relationship to functional groups, floristic quality (based on Coefficients of Conservatism or 
   <italic>C</italic> values), and Wetland Indicator Status. The distribution of species among functional groups and 
   <italic>C</italic> values did not significantly differ, while the distribution among wetland indicator status differed. Functional groups: PF = perennial forb; W = woody (and perennial); AF = annual forb; PG = perennial grass; VFG = variable forbs and grasses (annual to short-lived perennials; includes only two species of grasses); AG = annual grass; BF = biennial forb. Wetland Indicator Status: OBL = obligate wetland; FACW = facultative wetland; FAC = facultative; FACU = facultative upland; UPL = upland. See text for statistics and definitions of 
   <italic>C</italic> values and wetland indicators.
