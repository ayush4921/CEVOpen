 <p>Dr. Melissa Islam was instrumental in providing intellectual and logistical guidance for this project. We thank a cadre of Denver Botanic Gardens volunteers for their many hours spent in the field helping make collections, as well as mounting and digitizing specimens for accession into the Kathryn Kalmbach Herbarium. We also thank several Gardens field seasonal staff including Audrey Spencer, Margo Yousse, Meghan McGill, and Katherine Fu, and intern Jodie Kirschner, for contributions to data collection, plant identifications, and map-making. Dr. Janet Wingate, Loraine Yeatts, and Nancy Downs provided expert guidance on difficult identifications of graminoids and cultivated plants.</p>
