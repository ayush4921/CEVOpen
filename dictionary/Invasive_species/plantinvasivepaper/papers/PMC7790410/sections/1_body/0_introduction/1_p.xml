<p>What is the minimum sampling effort needed to adequately document plant community richness and composition? This question forms a fulcrum upon which multiple branches of plant science have revolved for decades [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We still do not have a universal solution, because the answer depends both on the characteristics of the sampled community and the goals of the researcher [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Given the complexity, and increasing urgency, of describing Earth’s biodiversity, it is necessary to continue refining our sampling approaches.
