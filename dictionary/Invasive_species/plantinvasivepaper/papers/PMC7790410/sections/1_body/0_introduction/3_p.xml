<p>Understanding plant community diversity requires documenting both pattern and process. We must first know which species exist, and where (i.e., taxonomic and biogeographic patterns), before we can determine why they exist there (i.e., ecological and evolutionary processes). Botanical specimens, which are routinely collected by floristic botanists, form the backbone of what we know about plant taxonomy and biogeography, from species discovery to the generation of exhaustive and meticulously vouchered local and regional floras [

While such data can in aggregate be used to test hypotheses about what shapes biodiversity, the primary data (i.e., physical specimens and species lists) are not designed to uncover site-level ecological processes. In contrast, ecological data are collected for the express purpose of answering a question or testing a hypothesis [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Unavoidably, this requirement drastically shrinks the area that plant ecologists can sample [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which has led to a multitude of papers concerned with determining “how much sampling is enough?” (with “enough” often approximated by the asymptote on a species accumulation or rarefaction curve) [
