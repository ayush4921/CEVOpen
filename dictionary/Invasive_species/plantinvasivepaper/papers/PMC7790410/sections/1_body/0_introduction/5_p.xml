<p>Here we illustrate that the sampling approaches of botanists and ecologists are complementary, with the former providing critical context about the community species pool, and the latter layering on quantitative data for a subset of abundant species. We demonstrate the utility of implementing both approaches with a case study from an urban greenway in Colorado, USA. First, we compare species richness estimates generated using opportunistic sampling to those generated using ecological (line-point intercept) transects, assuming that the intensive floristic search will best approximate the “true” community species pool (sensu [

We then use rarefaction and species richness estimation to determine how closely the transect-based species-pool estimate reflects the larger species pool. This opportunistic versus bounded comparison of species pools is unusual (although not unique; see [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for examples with mosses and lichens), with most vascular plant studies instead using plots of increasing size to estimate species pools [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Second, we explore whether the composition of the species pools captured by each approach leads to different ecological interpretations of the greenway’s flora. To this end, we compare the taxonomic coverage of each approach, as well as how species are distributed in relationship to functional group, biogeographic origin, floristic quality (based on Coefficients of Conservatism), and Wetland Indicator Status. Third, we integrate abundance estimates from the ecological transects into our interpretation of the greenway’s ecological condition to show that abundance is a desirable, if not necessary, complement to richness in any setting with applied conservation or management goals. Finally, we highlight areas of opportunity for collaboration between floristic botanists and plant ecologists.
