<p>Floristic botanists, quite powerfully, are not tied to plots. They are free to make informed decisions about how much area must be covered to adequately sample a plant community of interest, which can often be completely traversed using an opportunistic sampling approach. Thus, botanical collectors can cover a considerably larger area than ecologists, thereby finding species further out on the tail of rarity (

Further, because botanists collect high-veracity specimens that are in flower or fruit, they usually have the structures needed for a species-level identification. Conversely, as part of their effort to reduce sampling biases, ecologists must identify everything captured in a plot regardless of phenological stage, potentially reducing the veracity of the identification or constraining it to the genus level (especially for graminoids). Still, ecologists typically capture the most abundant species in a community, with such species often driving ecological processes including nutrient cycling and response to disturbances like fire and grazing [
