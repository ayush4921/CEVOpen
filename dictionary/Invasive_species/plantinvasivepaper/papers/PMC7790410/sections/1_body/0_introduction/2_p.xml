<p>Combining knowledge and research tools from multiple disciplines is one way to better describe complex systems [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One instance where collaboration remains elusive is between floristic botanists and plant ecologists. While these groups flank each other on the spectrum of biodiversity scientists, they are often siloed, in part because of their different disciplinary histories and research goals [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here we explore the unique research lenses and sampling approaches that floristic botanists and plant ecologists use to describe plant community diversity. We then illustrate how these different approaches are complementary in describing diversity using research conducted along an urban greenway. We close by discussing the circumstances under which collaboration is likely to be most beneficial in this time of rapid biodiversity loss.
