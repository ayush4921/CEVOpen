<p>We found 452 species using the opportunistic sampling approach used in floristic botany [collections data available; 45] and 126 species using ecological transects (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244982.s005">S1 Table</xref> for full species list). Species richness modeled from the transect data underestimated the floristic estimate by 41% (mean = 184; 95% CI lower bound = 151; 95% CI upper bound = 253; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244982.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This marked underestimate manifested despite using the Chao2 estimator, which statistically accounts for the fact that uncommon species will likely be missed. The species rarefaction curve showed that a 51% increase in our sampling effort, from 45 to 68 transects, would only capture 31% of the species pool observed during the opportunistic sampling (mean = 141; 95% CI lower bound = 125; 95% CI upper bound = 157; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244982.g002">Fig 2</xref>). While neither the species rarefaction curve nor the Chao2 estimator reached a definitive asymptote (although they were distinctly leveling off), our transect sampling effort was based on what we could reasonably achieve with the available financial and personnel resources. We expect that other researchers are similarly constrained in most applied situations.
