<p>The taxonomic coverage of the ecological versus botanical sampling became less complete moving hierarchically from family, to genus, to species (with transects capturing 50% of families [39 versus 78], 36% of genera [103 versus 289], and 28% of species [126 versus 452]; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244982.s004">S4 Fig</xref> for species distributions among families). The distribution of species among functional groups was statistically similar for the two sampling approaches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244982.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.6, df = 7, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.59), although perennial grasses were weakly over-represented (by 6%) along transects, reflecting the pattern found for family distributions (see Poaceae,

 <sup>2</sup> = 9.9, df = 10,

 <sup>2</sup> = 10.6, df = 4, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), with transects underestimating obligate wetland species by 5% (adjusted residuals = -2.05) and upland species by 10% (adjusted residuals = 2.0) relative to the larger species pool. In terms of biogeographic origin, the transects over-estimated (although non-significantly) the proportion of introduced species (55%) relative to the opportunistic sampling (46%; χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.75, df = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.10). The composition of introduced species captured by the two approaches differed in an important respect, with the floristic approach capturing a substantial number of uncommon, non-native garden cultivars (79 cultivars out of 208 introduced species, or 38%) that the transects missed (four cultivars out of 68 introduced species, or 6%).
