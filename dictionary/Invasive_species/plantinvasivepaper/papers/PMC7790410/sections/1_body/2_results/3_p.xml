<p>In terms of abundance, the greenway revealed a typical species-rank abundance curve in which a few species dominated, while a long tail of uncommon species contributed to species richness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244982.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The three most abundant species, which comprised ~50% of plant cover during our sampling window, were three non-native grasses: 
 <italic>Bromus inermis</italic> L. (smooth brome), 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> L. (cheatgrass), and
