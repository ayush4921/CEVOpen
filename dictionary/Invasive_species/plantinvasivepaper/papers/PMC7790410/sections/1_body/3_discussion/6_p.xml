<p>To most informatively link plot- and site-scale diversity data, best practices would be to pair the replicable plot data with equally replicable floristic sampling of the community species pool [e.g., 22,62,63]. Collections-based floristic botany has not fully adopted standardized field sampling practices across individual collectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], which can limit the use of collections data for analyzing hypothesis-driven questions about community-level change in diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The value of specimens and species lists generated using the opportunistic sampling approach could be increased by reporting the spatial extent of the surveyed area [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], as well as the intended goal of the collection event (e.g., an exhaustive inventory [implying species absence] versus targeted sampling based on an investigatorâ€™s taxa of interest). Such reporting practices can be achieved within the Ecological Metadata Language standard contained within a data package [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and would provide additional context for downstream uses of aggregated data (e.g., species pool estimates derived from geo-referenced specimen databases) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, it must be considered that standardizing collections data (or at least reporting accurate areal coverage of survey sites) requires some degree of bounding that is both time-consuming and at odds with maximizing the number of species encountered [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thus, it may only be worth bounding collections-based sampling when the specific question calls for it (e.g., quantifying immigration into experimental plots from the surrounding species pool).
