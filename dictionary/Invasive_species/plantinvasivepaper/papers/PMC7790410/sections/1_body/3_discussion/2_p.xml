<p>The question then becomes whether and when the transect-based sampling constraint, and any attendant underestimate of the species pool, affects how the ecology of the sampled area is interpreted (at least in terms of species richness). To assess this, we grouped species into ecologically meaningful categories to reduce complexity and uncover general patterns that are independent of species identity per se [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We found that based on functional groups and floristic quality (i.e., 
 <italic>C</italic>-values), the ecological condition of the greenway appears similar between the two species pools. This comparable delineation of functional groups is especially desirable given that functional group identity and diversity are routinely used to gauge community response to disturbances such as fire and biological invasions [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In our system, functional traits such as longevity and woodiness (and attendant traits like rooting depth) likely shape soil and hydrologic conditions along the Canal banks. In terms of floristic quality, both sampling approaches captured the bell-shaped distribution of native species and similarly indicate that few conservative (
 <italic>C</italic>-value of 7 or more) species remain along this highly modified urban corridor. These findings corroborate previous work showing that floristic quality performs well when using transects or plots, because mean 
 <italic>C</italic>-values are less dependent on the area sampled than is species richness [
