<p>Broadening out from our greenway example, when should floristic botanists and ecologists develop on-the-ground collaborations to better describe contemporary biodiversity? We suggest that any question about the maintenance of community-level species diversity would benefit from a paired approach, as it is ultimately the interplay of local (competition, predation, microenvironmental variation) and regional (immigration and extinction) processes that shape biodiversity [

To better integrate across spatial scales, it would be powerful to link quantitative data from bounded sampling to floristically based best estimates of the community species pool that functions as the backdrop for species immigration into embedded transects or plots. (While many terrestrial plant studies sample hierarchically across plot sizes to infer species pool sizes, they fall short of breaking free of plots to approach a comprehensive site- or habitat-level survey; [

In particular, the historically heavy reliance upon species richness as a sole indicator of ecosystem health or biodiversity change has proven insufficient, as it fails to capture changes in other key phenomena such as species turnover and changes in species relative abundances [
