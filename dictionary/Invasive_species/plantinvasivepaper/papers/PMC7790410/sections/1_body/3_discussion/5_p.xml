<p>For example, to achieve metric complementarity in a restoration context, a floristic inventory could be used to assess the feasibility of passive restoration (which depends on the community species pool; [

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]), while paired ecological sampling could quantify the degree of habitat degradation and monitor effectiveness of restoration efforts. Invasive species management would also benefit from a combined sampling approach, where initial arrivals of rare introduced species to an area are captured during unbounded floristic sampling bouts, while the spread and population biology of already established populations are monitored using transects or plots. Indeed, integrating researchers versed in alpha taxonomy is critical in invasion biology, as the resolution of taxonomically challenging groups, including those that hybridize, is critical to proper ecological interpretation [

A further boon of integrating floristic botany into settings where the species pool is of interest is excellent temporal sampling of early- to late-season bloomers, which can be missed using the “peak biomass” approach typical of ecological sampling [

Moreover, validation of transect- or plot-based data with vouchered specimens is tantamount to institutional knowledge that can be readily accessed by all researchers who carve out projects from a particular locale. The long-standing specimen and data curation practices used in natural history collections have achieved a level of standardization and data-sharing not yet realized in the ecological realm. However, improvements are being made in this arena, such as the application of the event-based Darwin Core data standard when publishing ecological data, as we have done herein [
