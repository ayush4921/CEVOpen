<p>We calculated the expected number of species in our pooled samples using species rarefaction. The rarefaction curve was produced from 1000 random resamples drawn without replacement from the pool of species in the transects. We extrapolated out to 1.5X the original sample size (68 transects), as extrapolation past doubling or tripling of the reference sample size is not recommended due to increased uncertainty [
