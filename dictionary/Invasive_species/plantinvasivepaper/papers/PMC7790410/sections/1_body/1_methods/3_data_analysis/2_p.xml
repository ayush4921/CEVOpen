<p>We used Pearson’s Chi-square tests of independence ([
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; chisq.test in R v. 3.6.2) to explore whether the floristic and ecological sampling approaches generated different distributions of species in relationship to taxonomic coverage, functional groups, 
 <italic>C</italic> values, Wetland Indicator Status, and biogeographic origin. For each data set (floristic and ecological) we summed species frequencies from the 45 mile markers to alleviate low cell counts within mile markers. When the sampling approaches generated significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) distributions of species among groups, we used the adjusted standardized residuals to assess which groups contributed to the disparity (with residuals exceeding an absolute value of approximately 2 considered important; [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). We could not assign functional groups to nine species that were only identified to the level of genus. We also could not assign 
 <italic>C</italic> values to a subset of species that did not have them available (n = 18 species or 4% of all collections and six species or 5% from transects). The same was true for Wetland Indicator Status, in particular for cultivated species, which are not assigned this type of indictor (n = 76 species, or 17% of all collections, and 10 species, or 8% from transects).
