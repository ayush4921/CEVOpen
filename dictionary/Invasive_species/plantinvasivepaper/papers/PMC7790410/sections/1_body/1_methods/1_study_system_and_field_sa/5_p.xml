<p>We chose the line-point method as the most appropriate for our system, with its narrow and steep canal bank that could not accommodate other plot designs. Additionally, our aim with the ecological transects was to estimate not only species presence, but also composition. For questions about composition, the line-point method is highly repeatable across individuals and rapidly deployed, thereby maximizing sampling replicates across many locations in a single season [

Such transects will capture fewer species than other methods (e.g., Modified-Whitaker plots); however, any bounded sampling approach will cover considerably less area than can be achieved with opportunistic sampling based in the floristic tradition of using the habitat itself as the sampling unit [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, we note that it was not our goal to equalize the temporal or spatial scales of the two sampling approaches (which in our experience is not often done in practice), but rather to sample in a manner that is broadly consistent with collections-based versus ecological disciplines. The particulars of our comparison, such as the sampling window and the use of transects rather than any number of plot types, contextualize the results.
