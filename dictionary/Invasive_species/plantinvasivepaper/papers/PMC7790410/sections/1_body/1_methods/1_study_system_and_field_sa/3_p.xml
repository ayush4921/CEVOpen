The botanical crew consisted of two botanists trained in the local flora and one to two additional non-botanists who assisted with specimen collection.

High-veracity (with identifying structures) herbarium specimens were accessioned for every species encountered during the floristic survey (numbering 1570 specimens, including duplicates; collections data available; 26). Identifications were made using [
