<p>The greenway’s length (with the Canal’s inception located at 39.48362, -105.11293) is demarcated by mile markers that we used to generate a random subset of 45 locations at which the botanical and ecological field crews could synchronize their data collection. As is typical for collections-based floristic surveys, the botanical crew sampled exhaustively from early spring (7 May) through late summer (28 September) to capture early-, middle-, and late-season species. Starting at each of the 45 mile markers, the crew walked in the Canal’s downstream direction, searching the greenway for newly encountered species to collect and accession to the Kathryn Kalmbach Herbarium (KHD) at Denver Botanic Gardens [

Most mile marker locations were sampled once during the inventory, but a few were revisited if they occurred in a vegetation type that would not be re-encountered later in the season at the other mile markers (e.g., mile markers zero and one at the inception of the Canal were the only locations in the foothills shrubland Ecoregion;
