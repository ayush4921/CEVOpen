<p>After delineating the species pools, we chose several ecologically informative metrics to compare them: species distributions among families; plant functional group based on longevity and growth form; floristic quality (based on Coefficients of Conservatism or 
 <italic>C</italic> values) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; Wetland Indicator Status [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; and biogeographic origin (assigned as native or introduced to Colorado according to [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and if introduced, whether it is cultivated). Plant functional groups are extensively used to aggregate large numbers of species into a few classes that are expected to respond similarly to changes in their environment, or to similarly affect their environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Floristic Quality Analysis is often used in the conservation realm to assess an area’s conservation value [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Sites with high floristic quality are relatively pristine, having departed little from the disturbance regime that existed prior to European settlement. Related to this, species in a community can be ranked on a scale of zero to 10 according to their “conservatism,” or their fidelity to habitats that are more (or less) degraded by human use. Species that can only persist in undegraded, native habitats are assigned high 
 <italic>C</italic> values, while ruderal species, which can withstand substantial degradation, are assigned low scores (rankings below adapted from [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]).
