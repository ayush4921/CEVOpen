<p>We first estimated the species pools captured by the collections-based floristic and quantitative ecological sampling approaches, and then compared the pools in ecologically meaningful ways. Species pools are hierarchical and scale dependent, having been variously defined, but they are typically partitioned from larger scale (regional pools), to mid-scale (local pools), to smaller scale (actual or community pools). Here, we define a community species pool according to [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as “the set of species present in a target community,” with our target community being the urban greenway. We consider the species found during the intensive floristic sampling as a best estimate of the greenway’s “true” community species pool and expect that the ecological transects will capture a subset of this larger pool. (We acknowledge that even the intensive floristic sampling will not capture the true pool, but the goal is to employ realistic sampling schemes used in botanical floristics and plant ecology to see how they compare).
