<p>Wetland Indicator Status ranks species according to their dependence on saturated soils, or wetland conditions. This metric is meaningful in our study system because the Canal represents a novel waterway in an otherwise semi-arid landscape. The status rankings are as follows. 1) Obligate Wetland: almost always a hydrophyte, rarely found in uplands; 2) Facultative Wetland: usually a hydrophyte but occasionally found in uplands; 3) Facultative: commonly occurs as either a hydrophyte or non-hydrophyte; 4) Facultative Upland: occasionally a hydrophyte, but usually occurs in uplands; 5) Upland: rarely a hydrophyte, almost always found in uplands [

Our study area occurs on the interface of the Western Mountain Valleys and Coasts and Great Plains regions, which can occasionally have different wetland indicators assigned for the same species. If there was a discrepancy between regions, we chose the more hydrophilic option to generate a conservative list in terms of species reliance upon water.
