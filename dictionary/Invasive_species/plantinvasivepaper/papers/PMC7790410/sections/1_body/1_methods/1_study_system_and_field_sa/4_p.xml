<p>The ecological sampling was carried out over 10 days, from May 22, 2018 to June 6, 2018, to capture a snapshot of plant communities around peak biomass. This method of deploying a concerted sampling effort over a short time period is common in ecological sampling, because it is often of interest to detect treatment differences that could be obscured by confounding time lags between sample dates (as opposed to the floristic botany goal of exhaustively delineating a species pool over time). At each of the 45 miles markers, we laid a 12 m × 2 m transect, the length of which captured habitat variation across the greenway corridor (

 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to make field observations of plant species presence every 0.25 m along the 12 m transect (as well as bare ground, plant litter, and rocks, which we do not report herein) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the associated data set [
 <xref rid="pone.0244982.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the “first hit” was used to generate the reported percent cover estimates (number of hits per species per total number of hits), while the “second hit” was used to add species to our presence list. We also searched each of the two, one-meter-wide belt transects for additional species that were not encountered along the line-point transect. Voucher specimens were collected for the species encountered during the observational ecological sampling (collected outside the transects so as not to influence long-term sampling). However, given the short time period of the ecological sampling, not all specimens had flowers or fruits, and therefore were not of sufficient quality to be curated. All specimens were kept during the field season and subsequent analyses to facilitate identifications, but only higher quality specimens were accessioned to the herbarium [collections data available; 32]. Please note that one example specimen exists for potentially hundreds of field observations (i.e., each time a species was encountered along the transects).
