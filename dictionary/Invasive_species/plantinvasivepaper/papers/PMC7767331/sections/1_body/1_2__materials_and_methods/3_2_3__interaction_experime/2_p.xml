<p>Prior to the experiment, 10 dead 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Meigen) individuals (adequate prey in field experiments with 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> and native species; [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) were placed in the center of the arena, equidistant from the two groups. At the start of the trial, the two entrances to the arena were simultaneously opened, and recruitment and interactions were filmed for one hour with two consumer-electronics RGB cameras BRIO 4K Ultra HD (Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland). On each movie recorded, the species, the source colony, the date, and the conditions (temperature, hygrometry, status) were indicated on the video. All combinations of interactions with 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> facing (i) no opponent, (ii) 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> opponent and (iii) 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> opponent were tested for both colonies of each species and successively for resident and colonizer statuses. Each individual test was replicated three times, resulting in 60 one-hour interactions recorded, covering a wide panel of situations encountered by a new colonizer, e.g., from no competitor (n = 12 videos), to an invasive or native competitor (n = 48 videos).
