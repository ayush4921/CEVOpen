<p>Third, to identify variables varying according to the Argentine ant opponent (
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic>, 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> or no opponent), we performed two discriminant analyses (LDAs) based on the two previous PCAs (package ade4; [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). The significance of the eigenvalues was evaluated using a non-parametric version of Pillaiâ€™s test. Variables having a high proxy of the contribution to the discriminant function, i.e., whose cosines between the variables and the first axe of the linear discriminant analysis were &gt;0.5 (as an absolute value) were considered the best drivers of the differences between species. The discriminant analyses suggested that eight variables were mainly responsible for the differences between the situations with different status and opponent species: the mean number of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers simultaneously present in the whole arena (mean_arena_Lh, M1), the number of preys brought by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> (n_totprey_Lh, M2), the standard deviation of the numbers of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers on the bait over time (ETbait_Lh, M3), the mean number of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers simultaneously present on the bait (mean_bait_Lh, M4), the number of dead 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> individuals (n_deadtot_Lh, M5), the number of dead opponent individuals (n_deadtot_opp, M6), the mean number of simultaneous fights during the contest (mean_fights, M7) and the time when the maximal number of simultaneous fights occurs (t_maxfights, M8) (
