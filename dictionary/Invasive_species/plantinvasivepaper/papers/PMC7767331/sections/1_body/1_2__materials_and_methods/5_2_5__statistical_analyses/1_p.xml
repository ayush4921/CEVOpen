<p>All statistics were carried out using R v. 3.3 (RC Team, Vienna, Austria) software. Based on the kinetic and global variables resulting from the video analyses, 33 ethological descriptors of the interactions have been summarized in four categories, reflecting various aspects of the interactions: the space occupation by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> (5 descriptors), 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>â€™s ability to exploit resources (8 descriptors), the aggressiveness of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> (8 descriptors) and the strength of the competition by the other species (12 descriptors; for interactions with opponents only;

 <xref rid="animals-10-02451-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>). We reduced these variables following three consecutive procedures: (i) remove correlated variables, (ii) run two principal component analyses (PCAs) for the different sets of descriptors, and (iii) run linear discriminant analyses (LDAs), based on the opponent species (coupled in previous PCAs), as explained below.
