<p>Interaction experiments were conducted between 20 June and 15 August 2019. The experimental set-up was as follows (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-10-02451">Supplementary Material, Figure S2</xref>): two small peripheral plastic boxes (79 × 79 × H34 mm
 <sup>3</sup>) were connected by small plastic tubes (diameter 0.8 cm, length 2 cm) to a central arena (165 × 100 × H85 mm
 <sup>3</sup>). Each box was closed with stainless steel mesh to prevent leakage. These boxes were characterized by a resting site opposite the arena, with a source of humidity (small tube with wet cotton), with a 15 × 15 mm
 <sup>2</sup> area covered with a red filter (favorable brightness). For each interaction, one hundred (±2) “naive” workers (i.e., never tested before) were taken from the donor colony, as closely as possible from the food resources to select preferentially foraging workers, and placed in a peripheral box with five brood elements. Water was supplied ad libitum. The taken ants were starved for 72 h prior to each trial [

During this period, one side of the device was open, allowing exploration of the central arena by one of the groups (resident), whereas the other did not have access to the arena (colonizer). The entrance of the resident was re-closed one hour prior to the prey being added.
