<p>Each video was analyzed by one of three observers familiar with the species and the antâ€™s behaviors. To ensure the consistency of results, ten percent of the videos were monitored by two observers simultaneously and ten percent of the videos were examined by two observers separately. All the videos have been analyzed twice (one time per interacting species). For each analysis, several global metrics were measured separately for each species: the time before the first worker leaves the peripheral box, the time between the entrance in the arena and the discovery of the resource and the time before the first interspecific interaction. We systematically recorded the temperature and hygrometry of the testing environment. Kinetic metrics were measured every five minutes for each species: the number of ongoing fights in the arena, the number of dead workers, the number of preys brought into the nest, moved in the arena or still available on the bait, the number of workers in the whole arena and the number of workers on the bait.</p>
