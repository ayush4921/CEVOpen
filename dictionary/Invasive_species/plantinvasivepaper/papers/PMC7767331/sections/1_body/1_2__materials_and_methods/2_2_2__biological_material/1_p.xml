<p>The biological material used for the experiments came from colonies sampled between 23 April 2019 and 5 July 2019, from different sites: two super-colonies of 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> (LnA—45.8248, 5.1004, Balan, France, collected on 19 June and 4 July 2019 and LnB—45.785258, 4.872009, Villeurbanne, France, collected on 21 June and 4 July 2019), two super-colonies of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> (LhA—36.992291, −6.451077, Huelva, Spain, collected on 23 April 2019, LhA’—43.209564, 5.629815, La Ciotat, France, collected on 15 May 2019 and LhB—43.402946, 6.730125, Fréjus, France, collected on 16 May 2019) and two colonies of 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> from Villeurbanne, France (LniA—45.779328, 4.866604, collected 20 June and 5 July 2019 and LniB—45.781247, 4.867727, collected 21 June and 5 July 2019). In 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, the letter A indicates that it corresponds to the main supercolony and the letter B indicates that it corresponds to the Corsican supercolony [

 <xref rid="B31-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; in 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic>, the workers from colonies A and B demonstrate strong aggressiveness between each other, suggesting different supercolonies [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Each collected colony corresponds to three or more pooled nests on the same site. The colonies collected comprised several thousand workers, brood in substantial quantities, and at least five queens for nests belonging to polygynous species (only workers have been collected in 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> monogynous colonies, preventing the colonies’ destruction).
