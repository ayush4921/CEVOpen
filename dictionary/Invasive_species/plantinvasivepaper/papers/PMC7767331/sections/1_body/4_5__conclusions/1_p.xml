<p>Our results suggest that native 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> species could impact invasive ant populations of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> by means of interference competition. Although rare, this report is not the first instance of biotic resistance of native species against Argentine ants through physical aggression or chemicals to successfully defend themselves and their territory (e.g., [

 <italic>L. humile</italic> has become invasive in Southern Europe, the invasion process could be slowed down in Northern Europe by such native dominant species rather than by other invasive ones, even under the scenario of co-occurrence between several highly invasive species [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the antagonistic behavior observed in this study does not necessarily imply that interspecific competition would take place in real conditions, because competition is a process of populations, not of individuals [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further studies on the natural invasion progress and species competitive interactions in the field, especially including the study of long-term interactions, would be needed to eventually extend our conclusions.
