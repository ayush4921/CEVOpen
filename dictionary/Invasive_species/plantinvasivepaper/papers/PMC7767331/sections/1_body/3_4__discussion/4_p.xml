<p>Conversely, some invasive species could be ineffective when facing 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, such as 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> in the present study. For instance, 
 <italic>T. magnum</italic> Mayr has shown considerable potential as an invasive species in Northern Europe, where it thrives in many urban areas and is considered a pest [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A recent study showed that 
 <italic>T. magnum</italic> was systematically excluded by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> from resources and underwent a visible reduction in activity [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The foraging activity of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> was nevertheless reduced in the presence of 
 <italic>T. magnum</italic> due to an increased worker commitment, both in the arena fights and directly in the colony of the competitor. In the present study, the native species 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> was not excluded from the arena by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, and its presence also resulted in a reduced foraging activity of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> due to an increased worker commitment in the arena fights. Moreover, Leonetti et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] suggested that the nest of the opponent could have been perceived as a new potential threat or resource and, therefore, a more valid target for recruitment than the trophic resource. However, this result could differ for other food contents, such as carbohydrate food that could be more attractive than protein sources [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For instance, 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> showed clear avoiding behavior when encountering the dominant species 
 <italic>Formica fuscocinerea</italic> (Forel) at a carbohydrate-rich food source [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
