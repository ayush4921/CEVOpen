<p>Our main outcomes suggested that the native, and not the invasive 
 <italic>Lasius</italic> species, may reduce the propensity of the Argentine ant to collect resources through interference competition. This finding is in contrast with the general established knowledge that aggressiveness and fight strategies of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> may explain its superiority over native ant species [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For instance, Carpintero and Reyes-LÃ³pez [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed that the Argentine ant is a competitively dominant species, because of its aggressive behavior and relative abundance, compared to native species such as 
 <italic>Cataglyphis floricola</italic> Tinaut, 
 <italic>Camponotus pilicornis</italic> (Roger) or 
 <italic>Pheidole pallidula</italic> (Nylander) or 
 <italic>Aphaenogaster senilis</italic> Mayr. When confronted with the Argentine ant, eight native species tended to retreat more frequently than Argentine ants (which also had initiated most of the encounters), which could help them to displace native species [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, some cases in the literature have also found that specific local ants can offer strong resistance and delay or prevent the spread of Argentine ants, especially when encountering ecologically dominant or functionally similar native species (e.g., 
 <italic>T. group nigerrimum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 
 <italic>I. rufoniger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], 
 <italic>La. grandis</italic> Forel [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or 
 <italic>Prenolepis imparis</italic> (Say) [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]).
