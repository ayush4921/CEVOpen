<p>Among the behavioral descriptors of the interactions between the competing ant species, eight significantly discriminated against the opponent species (invasive or native opponents) or status of the opponent (resident or colonizer). When facing 
 <italic>La. niger</italic>, the exploratory behavior of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers was inhibited, especially when 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> was colonizer. Workers of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> brought very few resources, were almost absent from the resources, engaged in fewer fights and killed fewer opponents when facing 
 <italic>La. niger</italic>. In contrast, 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> was not so impactful, not modifying the number of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> in the arena or the quantity of resources brought by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, although 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> engaged in more fights with 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> and killed more opponents. Contrary to what we expected, 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> showed greater competitive ability to hinder 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> resource exploitation than 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> (
