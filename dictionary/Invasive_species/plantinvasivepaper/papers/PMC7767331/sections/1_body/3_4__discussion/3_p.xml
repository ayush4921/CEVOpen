<p>When facing 
 <italic>La. niger</italic>, the risk perceived by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> appeared to decrease strongly its propensity to explore the arena, both for fighting and foraging, especially when exploring novel areas already colonized by 
 <italic>La. niger</italic>. It has been suggested that chemicals laid in the environment could be used by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> as cues for the presence of local species, as they play an important role in the interactions [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A behavioral response to allocolonial or allospecific footprint cues could prevent encounters of potential competitors and thus be beneficial by reducing costs from competition [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Subordinate ant species avoided cuticular hydrocarbons of dominant species [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. 
 <italic>Lasius niger</italic> strongly differentiated between different cue types and avoided cues of allospecifics and allocolonial conspecifics [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the present study, 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> could thus have used chemical signals as well as direct allospecific interactions to evaluate the risk, and limited more its exploration activity when resident 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> were present than when 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> was present. By decreasing the ability of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> to collect resources, 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> could also limit its expansion. This result is even more important as this dominant species is widely established in many environments, and the Argentine ant could therefore be challenged by habitats already occupied by the native ant 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> when spreading north along Europe.
