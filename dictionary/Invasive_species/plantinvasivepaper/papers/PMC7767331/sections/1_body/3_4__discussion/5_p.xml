<p>Our results showed that 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> suffered very few losses during interactions with colonizer Argentine ants (mortality &lt;5%), especially compared to 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> (mortality ~10%). This finding contrasts with Bertelsmeier et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], where dyadic interactions between 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> led to 90% mortality for 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> and 35% for 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic>. The latter ranked second in the dominance hierarchy established between seven highly invasive ant species, and ranked before 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>. The results observed here when 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> interacted with 
 <italic>La. niger</italic> or 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> were therefore unexpected. The fact that the study of Bertelsmeier et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was based only on dyadic or ten versus ten interactions could explain the differences observed with our results. Although interference competition involves aggressive encounters between workers, including physical and chemical aggressions, it does not imply an important effect at the colony level [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In our experiments, we used colony fragments constituted by a hundred of workers with brood and queens for both 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> and 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic>. In these situations, the possibility of many recruits implicated in the fights could thus be the cause of reduced differences in the outcomes of interactions with respect to the results of Bertelsmeier et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is especially relevant for 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, which often relies on group-level processes to successfully displace other species based on cooperative fighting [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, irrespective of their position in the dominance hierarchy, 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> can adopt ‘‘the bourgeois strategy’’ during agonistic encounters with other species, changing its behavior based on numerical dominance: lone workers tend to be submissive in encounters, whereas, when numerically dominant, workers are aggressive. 
 <italic>Linepithema humile</italic> has been shown to adopt this strategy against native species such as 
 <italic>P. pallidula, T. group nigerrimum</italic>, or 
 <italic>Monomorium antarcticum</italic> (Smith) [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, the bourgeois strategy could be a mechanism used by 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> to co-occur with 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this sense, because of the recent expansion of 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> in Europe, where 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> already invades, it was unexpected that the “resident effect” was not a primary determinant of the behavioral syndrome involved in competitive interactions for these species. Most of the parameters studied suggested that the species’ identity was more important than the status as resident or colonizer. However, we evaluated the resident effect as the access to the foraging arena, without accounting for the advantage of an earlier establishment and the consequent increase in density and numerical dominance [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which could partly limit our results.
