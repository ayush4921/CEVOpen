<p>The present study therefore aimed to assess the behavioral mechanisms involved in the interspecific interference competition between invasive species or between an invasive and a native dominant species through laboratory experiments. More precisely, the main objective was to study how a competitor modulates resource exploitation using one the most successful invaders, the Argentine ant (
 <italic>L. humile</italic>) accounting for the resident effect of the established species. We studied interactions between 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> workers facing workers, either of the invasive 
 <italic>Lasius neglectus</italic> Van Loon, Boomsma and Andrásfalvy or of the native dominant 
 <italic>Lasius niger</italic> (Linnaeus) species. Although most studies of the competitive ability of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> measured competition between individual ants or very small groups of workers, we conducted competition tests with groups of one hundred individuals to capture the group effect [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We also studied the effects of either a resident or colonizer status (i.e., familiarized or not with the foraging arena). 
 <italic>Lasius neglectus</italic> is, as 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, one of the 19 species listed as highly invasive by the IUCN invasive species specialist group [IUCN SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group, 2019]. It is a more recent invader, described as a new species in 1990 [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and shown to have a behavioral superiority over 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Both species are widely distributed across Europe and interact with invaded native communities, which often include the native black garden ant 
 <italic>La. niger</italic>, one of the most common and dominant species in Europe. 
 <italic>Lasius niger</italic> is characterized by its opportunism, its aggressiveness, and its ability to use mass recruitment [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], giving it a strong competitor’s potential. We measured 33 behavioral descriptors of the interactions covering the space occupation, the ability to exploit resources and the aggressiveness of 
 <italic>L. humile</italic>, as well as the strength of the competition by the other species. We used controlled laboratory experiments where the behavioral characteristics that discriminate against the competitive ability of the three species can be assessed in the absence or presence of the competitor. As an invasive species, we expected to find evidence that 
 <italic>La. neglectus</italic> has greater competitive abilities than 
 <italic>La. niger</italic>, and therefore may hinder 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> resource exploitation. The species established before the other, and therefore more familiarized with the nesting and foraging site, was also expected to have an advantage in the competitive interactions.
