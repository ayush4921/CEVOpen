<p>Competition between species occurs in two ways. Exploitation competition involves the ability of species to find and exploit rapidly a resource before others, thereby making it unavailable to competitors. Interference competition involves the ability of species to prevent resource use by others (or to expulse them from the resource), either directly by aggression or indirectly by maintaining a territory [

 <xref rid="B2-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Within ant communities, species co-occurrence could be partly explained by the fact that each species is assumed to excel in either competition by interference or competition by exploitation. Species depending on similar resources can coexist by means of a trade-off between the species’ ability to dominate resources and to discover them. This discovery–dominance trade-off occurs when species’ ability to excel at interference competition results in specialized morphological, behavioral, and physiological characteristics that reduce its ability to discover resources in the first place [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For instance, through competition by interference, most ant species affect abundance, spatial distribution, and behavior of other species through aggressive techniques that range from the use of chemical repellents to the establishment of territories [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ant species can therefore be classified as dominant, subordinate, and submissive species [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Invasive ants especially are often highly aggressive, dominant competitors that displace many native species, through both interference and exploitative competition [

 <xref rid="B8-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The dominance–discovery trade-off is indeed broken by these invasive species [

 <xref rid="B10-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Finally, because the species previously established is more familiarized with the nesting and foraging site (hereinafter called “resident effect”), such species could have an advantage during the competitive interactions [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-10-02451" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], for instance due to local numerical dominance.
