  <title>Simple Summary</title>
  <p>Invasive ants are often highly dominant competitors, having strong impacts on native species. Such invaders often exploit resources better than native species, finding them first or collecting them faster. They are also often more efficient when interfering with other species, suffering fewer losses or preventing access to resources. We assessed the competitive behavior of the invasive Argentine ant when facing another invasive species or a native dominant species. The exploratory behavior of the Argentine ant was strongly inhibited by the native dominant species. The Argentine ant brought very few prey resources to its nest and killed few opponents. Conversely, the other invasive species had low impact on the Argentine ant. Contrary to expectations, the invasive species lacked the ability to hinder resource exploitation by the Argentine ant, whereas the native dominant species did. These results suggest that a native species could impact invasive populations of the Argentine ant by interference competition, perhaps better so than some invasive species. In the northern half of Europe, it could prevent further expansion of this highly invasive species.</p>

  <title>Abstract</title>
  <p>Within ant communities, the biotic resistance of native species against invasive ones is expected to be rare, because invasive species are often highly dominant competitors. The invasive Argentine ant (
   <italic>Linepithema humile</italic> (Mayr)) often demonstrated numerical dominance against its opponents, increased aggressiveness, and ability to quickly recruit to food. The present study aimed to assess the behavioral mechanisms involved in the interspecific competition between 
   <italic>L. humile</italic>, facing either an invasive species (
   <italic>Lasius neglectus</italic> Van Loon, Boomsma and Andr√°sfalvy) or a native dominant species (
   <italic>Lasius niger</italic> (Linnaeus)). The resource exploitation by the Argentine ant was investigated during one-hour competitive interactions using 10 dead 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies as prey. When facing 
   <italic>La. niger</italic>, 
   <italic>L. humile</italic> exploratory behavior was strongly inhibited, it brought very few prey resources, and killed few opponents. Conversely, 
   <italic>La. neglectus</italic> had a low impact on 
   <italic>L. humile</italic>. Contrarily to expectations, the invasive 
   <italic>La. neglectus</italic> lacked the ability to hinder 
   <italic>L. humile</italic> resource exploitation, whereas the native 
   <italic>La. niger</italic> did. These results suggest that 
   <italic>La. niger</italic> could impact invasive populations of 
   <italic>L. humile</italic> by interference competition, perhaps better so than some invasive species. While 
   <italic>L. humile</italic> has become invasive in Southern Europe, the invasion process could be slowed down in the northern latitudes by such native dominant species.
