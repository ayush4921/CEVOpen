<p>Comparing the results of different models, we found considerable variation in the extent of invaded areas, even though we used the same input datasets for all algorithms. The most extreme estimates of the total area invaded by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> were generated; the highest was from the DNN model (34.8% invaded) and the lowest was from the SVM model (11.2% invaded). The best‐performing RF model, calculated the total invaded area to be 12.33% of the Afar Region. The other four models—the GBM‐BRT, the ensemble model, the GBM, and the GLM estimated the total invaded area by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> at 16.1%, 14.9%, 14.7%, and 20.1%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34919-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="ece34919-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Hence, the results produced by the ensemble model, the SVM, and the GBM were fairly close to that produced by the RF model (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34919-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
