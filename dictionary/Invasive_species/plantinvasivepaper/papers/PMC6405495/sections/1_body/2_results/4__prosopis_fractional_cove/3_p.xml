<p>Following the evaluation of the different models, the best‚Äêperforming RF model was used to map the current fractional cover of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in the Afar Region. The RF model's sensitivity and specificity values suggest that the model is robust, and its AUC value indicates that the presence of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was correctly mapped with a probability of 97%. A threshold value of 0.326 was calculated from the model for the minimum cover level of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> presence, which corresponds to 0.4% 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> fractional cover found on the ground (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34919-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). According to the RF prediction, about 1.173 million ha of land is invaded by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> at different stages of cover abundances in the Afar Region.
