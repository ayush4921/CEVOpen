<p>As mentioned above the main causes of dispersal are by livestock, human transport and by water which explains well the strong influence of these factors in most models. In contrast to Menuz &amp; Kettenring (
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), our data suggest that landscape structure variables are more relevant for species distribution/invasion at the current stage of invasion than climatic factors (precipitation and temperature), which describe the environmental niche of plant species (Guisan &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). However, at larger spatial scales climatic factors might additionally capture well the distribution pattern of the species (Coutts, Klinkenvan, Yokomizo, &amp; Buckley,
