<p>Among the infrastructure variables, DistVillage was found to be important in all models except in the GLM. Among the environmental variables, Elevation was the most important explanatory variable for the distribution and fractional cover of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in all models except the DNN. While NDVI and DistRiver had a high relative importance in the MLAs, they were removed from the GLM during variable reduction. From a methodological perspective, this suggests that the GLM is not able to relate variables having a linear or radial spatial pattern to the samples used in the models, and therefore, is less suited to explain 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution and fractional cover. It is well known that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is primarily spread by livestock (Shiferaw, Teketay, Nemomissa, &amp; Assefa, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), human transport and along watercourses, thereby promoting discontinuity or jump dispersal (Wilson, Dormontt, Prentis, Lowe, &amp; Richardson, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). However, the GLM was not able to fully capture these phenomena. In the DNN model, Landform exceptionally ranked second in importance, following DistRiver.
