<p>Application of a threshold level to produce binary maps of presence and absence has been tested (Zhou, Chen, Cao, &amp; Chen,

In this study, we also applied threshold levels to distinguish invaded from uninvaded areas with a threshold level of the RF model at 0.326. Based on this threshold, we found a very large area (~1.173 million ha) to be invaded. Our result is in line with the amount of invaded areas estimated by MoLF (
