<p>Detection of the spread and establishment of an invasive plant species is highly important for an effective management at an early stage of invasion (i.e., low to medium cover levels). Soft classification, as performed in this study, based on satellite data, climatic, topographic, and other relevant data enables not only identification of a particular species but also retrieval of that species’ fractional cover even at low cover fractions. Another interesting finding is that all models performed better in terms of specificity than sensitivity (Table 3). This indicates that uninvaded areas (true absence rate) were better identified and classified than invaded areas (true presence rate). A reason for this may be that the model sometimes misinterpreted acacia shrubs present in invaded areas as
