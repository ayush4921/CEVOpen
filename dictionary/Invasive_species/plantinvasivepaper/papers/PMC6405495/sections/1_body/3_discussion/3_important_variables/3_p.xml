<p>The influences of the tested explanatory variables varied in terms of magnitude and direction depending on each model's sensitivity. In the case of NDVI, this is in line with the general observation of greenness, and therefore, also NDVI, increases with increasing 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover. It suggests that particularly NDVI captured during dry season is a good variable for explaining the current distribution of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> due to the plant's evergreen behavior in the study area unlike other plant species shed their leaves during the dry season. The explanatory power of NDVI is further supported by the fact that greenness or NDVI is a consequence of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> presence and cover level but not a cause of its distribution. Our results also show that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover increases with increasing temperature. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> grows best in arid and semi‐arid environments and can stand air temperatures of up to 50°C (Mohamed, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Besides temperature, elevation had a strong influence on 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution in the study area as 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover increases with decreasing elevation.
