<p>Different algorithms produced different results with varying accuracies. Thus, these algorithms differ in their sensitivity (power to distinguish 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution from other vegetation) across spatial variabilities. In this study, we found the RF to be the best‐performing algorithm (AUC = 0.971, 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.797). Surprisingly, the ensemble model (AUC = 0.962, and κ = 0.771) performed slightly less than the RF, although other studies had suggested that an ensemble model would be able to overcome some of the individual models’ limitations (Kim, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and expected to obtain better performance. Our finding indicates that some of the models included in the ensemble model might have introduced errors, thereby impairing or penalizing its performance. Also, the DNN did not perform well which we cannot fully explain. Reasons could be the DNN may not be appropriate for species distribution mapping and requires further investigations.
