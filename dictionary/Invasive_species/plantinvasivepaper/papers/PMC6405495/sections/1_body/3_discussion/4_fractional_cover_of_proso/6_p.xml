<p>Our finding confirms that the RF is a suitable algorithm for fractional cover mapping of plant species. However, based on our experiences gained during this study five important points should be considered in order to achieve good results while applying the RF regression: (a) sufficient and well‐distributed field data samples should be collected in the study area; (b) the number of presence and absence field samples should be proportional to the shares of the study area where the species is present and absent, respectively; (c) the field data values for the dependent variable should be within the range of the expected prediction values, (d) as shown by previous study, the values of explanatory variables used for training need to represent the entire range of values present in the study area (Hengl et al.,
