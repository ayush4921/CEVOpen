 <italic>Prosopis juliflora</italic> (Swartz DC.), hereafter referred to as 
 <italic>Prosopis,</italic> has been introduced to different parts of the world with the aim of providing benefits to rural people, such as the production of fuelwood, charcoal, or construction material (Engda, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Haji &amp; Mohammed, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Mureriwa, Adam, Sahu, &amp; Tesfamichael,

 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Like numerous other introduced plants, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> has become invasive in many places and is increasingly known for its negative ecological and socio‐economic impacts (Shackleton, Le Maitre, van Wilgen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2015a</xref>; Shackleton, Le Maitre, van Wilgen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2015b</xref>; van Wilgen &amp; Wannenburgh, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In Ethiopia, several studies have attempted to assess 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution particularly in the Afar Region (Ayanu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Engda, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Wakie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), but they either focused on relatively small study areas or provided only coarse‐resolution maps of either presence or absence of the species. Yet, at the early stage of its invasion, or at the invasion front, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> often occurs in a patchy mixture with natural vegetation or as single trees, which is challenging to capture by remotely sensed data of moderate spatial resolution. Hence, the development of effective management strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> requires accurate and detailed information on both invaded areas and on the level of invasion across the invaded area.
