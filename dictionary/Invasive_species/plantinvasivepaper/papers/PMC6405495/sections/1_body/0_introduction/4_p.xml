<p>We set out to compare the performances of five MLAs (gradient boosting machine implemented in two different ways, random forest, support vector machine, and deep learning neural network), an ensemble model and a generalized linear model. This analysis helps identifying the best‐performing algorithm in mapping detailed fractional cover of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in the dryland ecosystem of the Afar Region, Ethiopia. All model outputs were validated using a number of performance measures. The best‐performing model was then used to create a 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution and fractional cover map.
