<p>Georeferenced field samples were collected throughout the entire study area using a stratified random sampling approach. Presence and absence plots were selected from invaded and uninvaded areas, respectively. Invaded areas were additionally stratified into heavily invaded and less invaded areas. Within those strata, careful attention was paid to collect representative samples of the entire cover gradient (0%–100%) of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> coverage. In order to reduce spatial autocorrelation, each sampling plot had a minimum distance of 500 m to the next one. A total of 2,722 samples (presence and absence plots of 20 m × 20 m) were collected between September 2016 and March 2017. A plot was considered a presence plot if it contained at least one 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> plant; otherwise, it was considered an absence plot. About 70% of the samples were absence plots while 30% were presence plots. These shares were chosen based on a preliminary rough estimation of the shares of uninvaded and invaded land in the study area, which would avoid any bias of results toward either presence or absence of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (Jiménez‐Valverde &amp; Lobo,
