<p>Populations differed significantly in studied morphological and biochemical traits. This variability is anticipated to affect the ability of specific populations to compete with other plants and response to herbicides, biotic, and abiotic stresses. Successful weed management must target the removal of biomass to limit new seed dispersal and detection strategies of new populations. Source regions may be more suited than others to cope with current and future environmental changes, although measured differences among populations are directly related to genetic differences and maternal effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these aspects for a better characterization and understanding of the strategies and abilities of invasive populations to grow and reproduce in novel environments. This understanding is essential to improve management plans particularly in the context of changing environmental conditions and providing information for propagation, domestication, and breeding programs, as well as conservation of genetic resources for plant species (

In addition, the results showed that many field traits have promise for genome analysis in the future, where combining molecular marker data with agro-morphology can identify genes for weed populations control.
