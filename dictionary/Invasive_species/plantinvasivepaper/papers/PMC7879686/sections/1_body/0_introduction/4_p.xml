<p>Both species interfere with human land use as they are successful colonizers and have considerable impact on plant growth (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Garbari and Pedulla, 2001</xref>). They are adapted to highly unstable and unpredictable environments, can compete with other plants for nutrients, water, light, and space through different survival tactics, and can harbor crop pests or diseases (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Rodenburg et al., 2010</xref>). The number of herbicides that can be used to control them is limited and these herbicides are not very efficient (
