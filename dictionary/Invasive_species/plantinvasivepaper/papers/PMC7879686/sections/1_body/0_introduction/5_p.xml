<p>The ability of plants to vary their morphological traits has long been recognized as a beneficial survival strategy that enables plants to acclimatize to changing habitats (

Plants exhibit a high degree of phenotypic plasticity which enables them to incorporate information from the environment into decisions about their morphology. Changes in morphology are often connected to the conditions under which the plant is growing (

Hence, the same species of plant can occupy and be maintained in diverse habitats by appropriately adjusting plant morphology (
