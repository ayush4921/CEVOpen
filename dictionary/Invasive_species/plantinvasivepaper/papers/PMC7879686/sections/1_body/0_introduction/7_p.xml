<p>In this study, we aimed to better understand the colonization history and capacity for invasiveness of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> by characterizing a suite of morphological and biochemical traits in populations of collected from contrasting habitats. We choose traits that are associated with successful invasions; for instance, specific leaf area (SLA) is a key functional trait representing the amount of light-capturing surface area and thus is used widely to estimate plant carbon acquisition efficiency provides a useful framework to assess invasive plant responses to climate change and the population’s variability (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Barrett, 2013</xref>). This collection was examined for morphological and biochemical variations in order to understand the strategies that have enabled their successful invasion into a wide range of habitats by providing a selective advantage for competitiveness of these varied environments. We hypothesized that (1) populations of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> L. and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> L. from different invaded seed source regions would exhibit variation in plant traits when grown in common garden and (2) populations grown from seeds of the same type of climate zone would display characters more similar to those from the different climate zones. We have found that the biochemical compounds and morphological traits vary significantly in both 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> even when grown concurrently and sympatrically and that the population’s original climate could not accurately predict its morphology or biochemistry. Although variability among populations is expected, these species are able to grow in a wide range of environmental conditions. This knowledge indicates that a “Universal Management Regime” will not be suitable for these species.
