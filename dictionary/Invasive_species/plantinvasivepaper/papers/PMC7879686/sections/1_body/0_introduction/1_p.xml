 <italic>Amaranthus retroflexus</italic> L. (redroot pigweed) and 
 <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> L. (lambâ€™s quarters) are fast-growing weedy annual plants that belong to the 
 <italic>Amaranthaceae</italic> family. They are both listed among the most common dicotyledonous weeds in the world and are widely distributed in many agricultural areas (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Horak and Loughin, 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alebrahim et al., 2012</xref>) where they cause significant problems. They severely reduce the yield of the crops in which they grow while their destructive growth and allelopathic activity make them very competitive resulting in significant decreases in crop yield and quality (
