<p>The correlations coefficients among the morphological and biochemical populations are presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3A</xref>. PH showed significant positive correlation with the LA (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.8), SD (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.87), FW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.9), and SW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.9). FL was significantly negatively correlated with the LN (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.69) and BN (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.74). LL showed significantly positively correlated with LA (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.98), SD (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.78), FW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.69), and SW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.63). The LA was positively correlated with SD (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.83), FW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.73), and SW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.68). The LN was positively correlated with the BN (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.69). SD showed highly significant positive correlated with FW (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.87), but had negative correlation with SW (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.85).
