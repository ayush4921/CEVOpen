<p>To determine if the populations of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> exhibited different biochemical traits, Ca, Cb, TC, Car content, TP, CAT activity, POD activity, and PPO were measured. Like the morphological traits, these biochemical traits all differed significantly among the populations of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic>.
