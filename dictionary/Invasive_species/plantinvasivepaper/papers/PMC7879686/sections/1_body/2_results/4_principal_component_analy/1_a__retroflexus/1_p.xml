<p>In this evaluation, effective traits were divided into four components accounting for 88.22% of the total observed variance. Loading values higher than 0.5 were considered significant as suggested by 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2016)</xref>. Four principal components (PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC4) explained together more than 83.54% of the total variation (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4A</xref>). PC1 related with PH, LL, LW, LA, SD, FW and DW, SLA, and SW explained 35.2% of the total variability. Component PC2 was associated with Ca, Cb, TC, Car, and TP and accounted for 24.17% of the total variability. Component PC3 was mainly associated with FL, LN, and BN and accounted for 14.951% of the total variability. Component PC4 showed the integration with CAT, POD, and PPO activity and explained 9.213% of the total variability. Hence, the morphological and biochemical parameters could effectively explain the existing variability.
