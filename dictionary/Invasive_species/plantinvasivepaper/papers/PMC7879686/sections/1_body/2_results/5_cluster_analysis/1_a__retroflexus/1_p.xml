<p>Cluster analysis was carried out with the Ward method, based on morphological and biochemical parameters. Generally, populations were divided into two main clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). With a decrease in the squared Euclidean distance, the populations were divided into four main sub-clusters: first sub-cluster (Hamedan, Sari, and Moghan populations), second sub-cluster (Gorgan, Shahr-e-Rey, Zarand, and Bojnurd populations), third sub-cluster (Rasht, Rudsar, Yazd, Spain 1, and Spain 3 populations), and fourth sub-cluster (Ilam, France, Ardabil, and Spain 2 populations). The results of canonical detection function analysis to determine the best cut-off point showed more differentiation with four groups (
