<p>Our results suggest that when chlorophylls, Car, and soluble protein contents were reduced in different populations, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased. Even under favorable conditions, ROS production is carried out as the result of different metabolic processes and toxic oxygen derivatives are produced as a result of different stresses. Plants adopt effective systems for scavenging active oxygen species that support them against destructive oxidative reactions (
