<p>We set out to understand the morphological and biochemical traits of invasive weed populations for two main reasons. The first is that by characterizing these traits from populations collected from different locations, we measure the variability that is possible within and between populations and therefore quantify how variable these traits can be. Moreover, as the collection locations have different climates, we can understand better the weeds capacity to be shaped by those climatic zones. As the measured traits are under environmental as well as genetic control, we grew these populations under common garden conditions to ensure any differences we observe in the measured traits were driven by heritable differences in the populations. The second reason to study these traits is that well-characterized collections of wild populations of weeds are a useful resource for plant breeders as they provide information to guide crop improvement through gene introgression, population selection, and conventional breeding practices (
