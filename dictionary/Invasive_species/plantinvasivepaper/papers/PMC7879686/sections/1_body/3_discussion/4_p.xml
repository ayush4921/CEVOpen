<p>Canonical correlation analysis suggested that areas classified as Cfa and Bwk climates according to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system had more value of PPO, POD, and Car, and Bsk and Csa climates had more values of SD, LL, and SLA in 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> L. Similar analysis for 
 <italic>C. album</italic> showed that Bwh, Bsk, and Bsh climates had more value of FL, SLA, and Car, while Cfa and Csa had more value of PPO, POD, and CAT. The analysis also showed that Hamedan and Moghan, Ardabil, and Spain 2 consistently cluster together in both species, but they are classified in different climate conditions. So, measured values among populations showed different results in similar climate classification from which they were collected. Therefore, the climate from which the population was collected is not a good predictor of morphology or biochemistry.
