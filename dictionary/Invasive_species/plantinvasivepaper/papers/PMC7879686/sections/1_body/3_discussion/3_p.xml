<p>Principal component analysis of these data indicated that a combination of PH, LL, LW, LA, SD, FW and DW, SLA, and SW explained the most variability of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic>, while PH, LL, LW, LA, SD, FW and DW, SLA, and SW drove the variability of 
 <italic>C. album</italic>. Scatter plot based on first three components of the PCA indicated that Group I reflected photosynthetic pigments, whereas Group III represented enzymatic activity. Group II and Group IV may indicate morphological traits among the studied 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> populations.
