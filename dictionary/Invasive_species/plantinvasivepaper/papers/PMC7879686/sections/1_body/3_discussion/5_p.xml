<p>Based on the morphological and biochemical traits, cluster analysis established the phylogenetic relationship among the 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> populations. The dendrogram revealed no separate group among populations according to KÃ¶ppen climate classification which supports the conclusion that there is a high level of morphological and biochemical diversity among them.
