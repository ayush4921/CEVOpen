<p>In our investigation, FW showed highest significant and positive correlations with DW; moreover, TP showed highest significant and negative correlations with Ca in both species. SLA showed negative correlations with Ca which is inversely related to leaf thickness and density. At a given cellular composition, leaves of lower SLA typically have higher pigment concentrations per area due to the additional thickness of mesophyll tissue (
