<p>In this study, we measured 12 morphological and eight biochemical traits of 16 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> L and 17 
 <italic>C. album</italic> L. populations. Morphological traits differed significantly within the species. For instance, the BN, FW and DW, LN, LA, and SD differed among the 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> L. populations, and FL, LA, FW and DW, and LN were significantly different among the 
 <italic>C. album</italic> L. Similarly, the measured biochemical traits also varied significantly. TP, POD activity, and Ca in 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> L. and TP, Car content, CAT, and POD activity in 
 <italic>C. album</italic> L. all demonstrated a high coefficient of variation, therefore, high diversity among populations. These traits provide key morphological and biochemical descriptors for each of the major type of weedy population.
