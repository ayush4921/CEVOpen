<p>Generally, TC concentrations showed a significant negative correlation with the level of antioxidant activities. The reaction centers of photosystem I and photosystem II are the major sites of ROS generation in the chloroplast thylakoids (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Asada, 2006</xref>). One of the key factors that affect the balance between the damage and restoration of the photosynthetic activity is the relationship between the stability of the oxidative stress and the activity of the antioxidant system (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kreslavski et al., 2009</xref>). The reduced electron acceptors accumulation may increase the generation of ROS and lead to oxidative injuries. These injuries could enhance Cb degradation or the prevention of its biosynthesis, damage PSII components, and inactivate chloroplast enzymes (
