<p>This research suggests that these heritable morphological and biochemical traits vary between populations from similar climate and suggests the local environments they have adapted to have affected the way the trait was selected. Our data are similar to other studies done with Amaranths. 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Andini et al. (2013)</xref> assessed the variations in morphology of Indonesian Amaranths and compared them with the worldwide variation. They proposed high levels of variability for most morphological traits. 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Thapa and Blair (2018)</xref> evaluated the morphological diversity of close to 300 cultivated grain Amaranths and their wild relatives from two gene banks through field assessments of leaf, flower, and grain characteristics. They concluded that the amaranth collection was a source of diversity traits and adaptation traits. Some other studies have showed that the variability of morphological traits is affected by a combination of species, climate, and soil factors (
