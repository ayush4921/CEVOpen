<p>We also detect a significant variation in antioxidant enzyme activities among the studied various 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C album</italic> populations. Factors such as season, area, sampling site, water, and soil nutrients affect protein content (

 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> populations could alter their biotic and abiotic stress tolerance or resistance. According to
