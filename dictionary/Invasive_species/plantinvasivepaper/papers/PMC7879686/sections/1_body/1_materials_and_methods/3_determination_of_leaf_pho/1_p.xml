<p>To determine leaf photosynthetic pigment content, approximately 0.25 g of fresh plant leaf sample was homogenized in 5 ml 80% acetone. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 15 min at 4°C and 0.25 ml of the clarified supernatant was mixed with 2.5 ml of 80% acetone. The absorbance of acetone extracts was measured at 662, 645, and 470 nm for determination of Ca, Cb, and Car content using a spectrophotometer. The leaf photosynthetic pigments were expressed as mg g
 <sup>–1</sup> on FW basis using the formula listed below (
