<p>ANOVA tests were performed for each morphological and biochemical parameter using SAS package (9.3 SAS Institute, Inc., United States). The simple correlation coefficient among the studied variables using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient method, principal component analysis, and scatter plot of loadings corresponding to the first three principal components were made using the SPSS software (22, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic averages (UPGMA) method was performed using SPSS 16 to determine the individual relationship among populations by adopting the Ward method based on squared Euclidean distance and to determine the best cut-off point of the dendrogram, a canonical discriminant function analysis (
