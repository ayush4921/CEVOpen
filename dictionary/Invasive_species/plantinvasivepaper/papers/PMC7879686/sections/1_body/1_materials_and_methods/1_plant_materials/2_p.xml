<p>To assess the morphological and biochemical traits, seeds from the each population were germinated in plastic trays containing a growing medium without fertilizers. Three weeks after sowing, five plants per population were selected and planted outdoors at the experimental field of the agriculture research of University of Mohaghegh Ardabili during the summer of 2018. Three replicates plots with five seedlings per replicate were planted in each plot. Seeds were planted at a distance of 20 cm in row and 30 cm between rows. At the end of the growing season, 12 morphological traits were evaluated on three randomly selected plants: plant height (PH), inflorescence length (FL), leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW), leaf area (LA), number of leaves (LN) number of branches (BN), diameter of stem (SD), fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), SLA, and seed weight (SW). For the analyses of some of the biochemical parameters: chlorophyll a (Ca), chlorophyll b (Cb), total chlorophyll (TC), carotenoid (Car) and total protein content (TP), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO); the fresh leaf samples were collected and stored at −70°C until analyses.</p>
