<p>Risk-based surveillance is a key element of plant biosecurity. Surveillance activities for invasive alien species that are harmful to plants — primarily insects, plant pathogens and weeds — take place in border (or possibly pre-border) and post-border contexts [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The objective of border surveillance is to intercept these invaders at the introduction or transport stage [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], before they can become established in novel environments [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ordinarily, surveillance effort is targeted at or near ports of entry [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], as international trade and travel account for a large share of global species movements [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>]. The detection methods (e.g. trapping or container inspections) and degree of effort applied in these locations is determined through the pest risk analysis (PRA) process, which identifies high-risk organisms as well as the commodity and geographic pathways by which they are most likely transported [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As with all biosecurity activities, adopting a risk basis for border surveillance decisions is critical due to the huge number of potential species introductions and limited resources to perform surveillance [
