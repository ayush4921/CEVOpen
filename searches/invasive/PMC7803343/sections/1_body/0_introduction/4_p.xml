<p>Although a risk-based approach confers efficiency by narrowing the survey sampling frame, there is the separate issue of cost, which dictates what is feasible when developing a surveillance system [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. An ideal system ensures reliable discovery of an invader soon after its arrival in an area of interest. Unfortunately, incipient populations are notoriously difficult to find [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, surveillance is merely one element of post-border response to invasions; regularly, decision-makers must assess the trade-offs of devoting limited resources to surveillance instead of other management efforts [
