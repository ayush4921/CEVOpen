<p>Furthermore, incorporating realistic constraints and features into optimal surveillance models is a logical extension of prior research. It also honors the fundamental aim of post-border invasive species surveillance: reliable early detection. In short, a higher degree of realism enables the development of a stronger decision support system where survey managers are not forced into adjusting model-derived (and presumably optimal) prescriptions based on their local knowledge. Instead, by giving the managers real-world choices, it should be possible to curtail these on-the-fly alterations and interpretations of the prescriptions, and through that improve the robustness of surveillance campaigns.</p>
