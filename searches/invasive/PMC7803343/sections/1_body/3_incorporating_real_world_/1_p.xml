<p>For each day in a multi-day invasive species surveillance problem, a survey objective can be formulated as finding a route that visits a sequence of sites with a corresponding set of sampling plans. During the working day, a survey crew visits several sites in the area of interest to conduct sampling (e.g. collecting host plant materials, performing visual inspections or checking traps). These visits are scheduled to fall along a route that starts at the main facility where fleet vehicles are stored and the collected samples (if any) are processed. After the sites are visited, the survey crew returns to the main facility by the end of the day. A surveillance campaign over 
 <italic>T</italic> days will require planning 
 <italic>T</italic> routes with accompanying prescriptions of visited sites and sampling rates. The total time that can be spent on survey activities on any day is limited by the working day length (e.g. 7.5â€…h), which must include time to access the sites, perform sampling and return to the main facility.
