<p>A sizeable amount of work on optimal invasive species surveillance has come from operations research literature (see [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] for a review). Optimization models are suited to the complexity of invasive species problems because they take account of the biological and behavioral characteristics of an invader while evaluating the costs and benefits of possible management responses [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Generally, optimization models applied to invasive species combine simulation models, which depict the uncertain invasion process through space and time, with scenario approaches, such that the optimal surveillance is developed with respect to a large number of plausible invasion scenarios, thereby supporting decisions regarding the effective allocation of response resources [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For invasive species, optimal surveillance decisions specify timing, spatial intensity and configuration of surveys [
