<p>Model-based surveillance optimization may require substantial computing effort, particularly since it almost always involves a spatial dimension [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]), facilitated by increasingly efficient optimization software, have made it possible to compute optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time, usually a matter of hours [
