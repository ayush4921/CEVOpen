<p>As this suggests, previous research efforts have differed in terms of their sophistication and level of detail, particularly with respect to practical aspects of invasive species surveillance [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Some analyses have included considerations like search times at survey sites [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or travel costs as they relate to the optimal number of site visits [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Other research has examined the optimality of varying surveillance effort through time rather than assuming it remains constant [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], or optimal surveillance design when surveys stop (and management efforts begin) after an invader is detected [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
