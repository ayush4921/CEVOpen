<p>Most of these examples have addressed one or two practical constraints on surveillance planning. Relatively few studies have attempted to develop broad-scale, multi-day surveillance campaigns (although see [

Multi-day surveillance planning must account for numerous real-world concerns, which include securing access to a variety of sites across the area of interest, allocating visit times to ensure the sites are surveyed adequately and factoring in travel times between them â€” all while remaining mindful of the larger campaign schedule. Furthermore, these logistical details must be managed with regard for daily working time constraints and personnel availability.
