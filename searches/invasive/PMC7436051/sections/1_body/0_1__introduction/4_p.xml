<p>Furthermore, we do not intend to use invasive species in traditional medicines or phytotherapies. We defend the search for active principles and scaffolds, together with detailed pharmacological and toxicity studies, namely the usual route to the discovery of lead molecules. And for that, we must start at the beginning. First, we need to acknowledge the underlying potential of invasive species. Their ease of adaptation and control of the new habitat implies adaptation to different soil compositions, different water and weather stress conditions, ability to find reproductive strategies, competitive advantage, and, of course, resistance to new predators. For that, plants rely on their chemical machinery: their ability to synthesize allelopathic or deterrent compounds may very well mean the difference between life and death, especially when it comes to resistance to predators. The chemistry of invasive species must, as such, be very varied and with an enormous biological activity potential that remains yet to be explored. This, of course, implies new studies in this area, focusing on biological activity of isolated productsâ€”most of the existing phytochemical studies of invasive species focus on biological activity of extracts and no active principles were isolated; the search for the active metabolites should thus be a priority. It is also desirable that these studies focus on the species as invaders, and not on their native constitution. Most probably the prevalence of invasive species over endemic ones relies on a yet unknown biological activity of the metabolites they produce; these are surely responsible for their ease of expansion and dominance of the new habitat, and so their chemistry can surely be correlated to their ability to survive in non-native ecosystems. Moreover, the use of these species as a source of therapeutics would allow a rational use of resources that would eventually mitigate the cost of their removal. Are phytochemistry and bioactive natural products the miraculous solution to the invasive problem? Of course not, but they may be something worth trying, as we are trying to illustrate in this review.</p>
