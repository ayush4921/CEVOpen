<p>The plant invasive phenomenon begins with their introduction (accidental or deliberate), proceeds by establishment of the species (through biotic and abiotic factors), and ends with its spread and impact [

Several theories of the mechanisms involved in the invasion process have been advanced (that may very well act together), including the enemy release hypothesis, the evolution of increased competitive ability, the novel weapon hypothesis and the allelopathic advantage against resident species hypothesis: in short, invasive plants face less or no enemies or predators in the new ecosystem, can thus redirect resources to favor establishment, being more competitive than local species, and may very well develop new biochemical weapons [
