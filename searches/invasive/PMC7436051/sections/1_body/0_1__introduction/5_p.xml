<p>In this paper, we chose worldwide invasive species that are a threat to Portugal where they are recognized by government [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the scientific community [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in order to illustrate their potential as a source of bioactive metabolites: 
 <italic>Carpobrotus edulis</italic>, 
 <italic>Hakea salicifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Hakea sericea, Oxalis pes-caprae</italic> and 
 <italic>Phytolacca americana</italic>. They are all invasive to Mainland Portugal, and 
 <italic>Carpobrotus edulis</italic>, 
 <italic>Oxalis pes-caprae</italic> and 
 <italic>Phytolacca americana</italic> are also invasive to Madeira and Azores. Some of them are recognized by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization either as Pests (
 <italic>Hakea sericea</italic>, invasive also to Spain and France) or Invasive Plants (
 <italic>Carpobrotus edulis</italic>, invasive also to Spain, France, UK, Italy, Malta and Israel, and 
 <italic>Oxalis pes-caprae</italic>, invasive also to Malta, Georgia, and Israel). Although their chemistry is poorly studied, either as native or invasive, several reports exist on the biological activity of their extracts that could, and should, be further explored.
