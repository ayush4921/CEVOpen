<p>The management of the invasion problem includes many features like risk assessment, vector management, early detection, eradication, mitigation and restoration [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Of these, and for the perception of the general audience, early detection, sometimes with the help of the community, and mitigation are the most obvious, the latter being achieved by mechanical means, biological control, and/or chemical remedies. Interesting reviews on the control of invasive species and maintenance of biodiversity can be found in the literature [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, all management and control actions have costs that, in Europe, are estimated as millions of euros [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The search for alternative measures to the current status should thus be addressed. An alternative use for these species should be obtained, since eradication is far from being attained in most cases. We here suggest their use as a source of potential pharmaceuticals that, once available, could generate income, thus reducing the global costs of eradication. We must, however, be cautious in this approach—we do not want to sustain the targeted species, but rather eradicate them. Therefore, we propose eradication procedures that include not incinerating these species or burying them in landfills but rather processing them for chemical constituents. The delicate subject of harvest incentives is already the focus of an interesting review by Pasko and Goldberg [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]: attention must be paid to several points including: biological (population dynamics, overcompensation and dispersal), ecological, and socioeconomical (management goals, market economics) factors, among others. This type of approach would fall in the category of ‘commercial use’ whose issues and risks have also been the subject of the study of the French National Work Group on Biological Invasions in Aquatic Environments (IBMA) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The temporary commercial use of established invasive species is already foreseen in European regulations (provided it is included in management measures aiming eradication) [
