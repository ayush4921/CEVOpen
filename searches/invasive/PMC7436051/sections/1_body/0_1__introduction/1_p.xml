<p>Invasive species are a menace to the ecosystem of their surroundings. These invasions are one of the great threats to biodiversity, since invasive species establish and supersede native species, frequently leading to the extinction of the latter. Invasive plant interactions in the ecosystem comprise the alteration of abiotic or biotic conditions such as nutrient and water availability, and the disturbance of bacterial and fungal communities, as well as of plant–plant and plant–herbivore interactions. Allelopathic compounds may be released by invaders and fire regimes are also affected, whilst the derived increase in decomposition of organic matter influences the nitrogen and carbon cycles. All of these influence the remaining organisms, micro-, animal or vegetable, thus compromising and altering the established biodiversity [
