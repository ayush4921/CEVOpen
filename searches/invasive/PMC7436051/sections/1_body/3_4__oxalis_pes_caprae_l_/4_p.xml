<p>Studies of DellaGreca et al. on the AcOEt, MeOH and water extracts of specimens collected in Bacoli, Naples, where this species in invasive on cultivated lands, led to the isolation of the compounds in

The isolated compounds were tested as to their activity towards the germination and growth of Lactuca sativa (lettuce). The phytotoxicity observed for some of these compounds on germination and growth of lettuce seeds seems to contribute to the invasiveness of the plant and their use as agrochemicals if suitably prepared and/or modified is suggested [
