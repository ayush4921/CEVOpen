<p>Few reports exist on the chemistry of this species. These include the identification of phenolics and flavonoids from the EtOAc, MeOH and BuOH/water extracts of a specimen collected in Crete (

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While compound 
 <bold>12</bold> was isolated, compounds 
 <bold>9â€“11</bold> were tentatively identified by LC-DAD-MS. The extracts exhibited high levels of anti-oxidant activity and the authors suggest that these invasive plants may serve as an inexpensive and renewable source of bioactive compounds [
