<p>The antibacterial properties of this new alkenylresorcinol were studied against several strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the resazurin microtiter assay. Good MIC values were obtained against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains (0.005â€“0.16 mg/mL), including the clinical isolates (SA 01/10, SA 02/10 and SA 03/10) and MRSA strains [
