<p>Three reports can be found on the biological activity of extracts of these species (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03529-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These comprise the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>, EtOAc, MeOH and water extracts of both species, collected at Lisbon, Portugal, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> MR where the twigs’ aqueous extract showed the strongest antimicrobial activity (MIC 7.5–62 μg/mL) against the tested methicillin and vancomycin resistant strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; the antioxidant potential of MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>H. sericeae</italic>, collected at Serra da Estrela, Portugal [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the antimicrobial, antibiofilm and cytotoxic activities of the MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>H. sericea</italic> collected at Serra da Estrela, Portugal, demonstrating that 
 <italic>H. sericea</italic> is a potential source of bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity, namely against several 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, including clinical MRSA [
