<p>Reports on the biological activity of extracts of this species include (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03529-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>): moluscidal activity of the water extract of the berries against invasive snails (
 <italic>Viviparus georgianis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pimephales promelas</italic>) suggesting that 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> could be used as a mollusk control agent in aquaculture applications [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; antifungal activity of the MeOH/water extracts of the aerial parts of a Korean species towards phytopathogenic fungi, confirming that extracts originated from invasive plants can be used directly to develop new and effective classes of natural fungicides to control severe fungal diseases [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; allelopathic activity of the aqueous leaf extract of a South Korean species on 
 <italic>Cassia mimosoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; antibacterial effect of MeOH/water extract of aerial parts of a Korean species on pathogens responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries, suggesting that these extracts have the potential for use in the preparation of toothpaste and other drugs related to various oral diseases [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; antiproliferative activity of the EtOH/water extract (saponin rich) of the roots of a Chinese specimen [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and inhibition of infection by Cucumber Mosaic virus and Influenza virus by a phosphate buffer extract of the leaves of a California specimen [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-03529" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].
