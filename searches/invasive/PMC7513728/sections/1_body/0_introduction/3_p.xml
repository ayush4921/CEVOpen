<p>Having lost most or all of the mutualists and antagonists with which they co‐evolved, invasive species encounter a novel set of ecological interactions and evolutionary pressures in the introduced range (Muller‐Scharer, Schaffner, &amp; Steinger, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). This premise is the basis for the “evolution of increased competitive ability or EICA” hypothesis (Blossey &amp; Notzold, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>), which postulates that an invasive plant's competitive advantage in its new environment is at least partially a product of postintroduction evolution: genotypes that invest less into defence and more into growth are predicted to have higher fitness. Although support for EICA has been inconsistent (Felker‐Quinn, Schweitzer, &amp; Bailey, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Rotter &amp; Holeski, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), one important implication of EICA is that, upon re‐association with natural enemies (either accidental or through biocontrol), the invasive plant may re‐evolve higher investment in defence (Franks, Pratt, Dray, &amp; Simms, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), as better defended genotypes have a fitness advantage under herbivory. Because rapid evolution of defence has the potential to weaken the effectiveness of biocontrol programmes (Muller‐Scharer et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), drive biocontrol agents to alternative hosts (Stenberg, Hamback, &amp; Ericson, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), and/or enhance the noxious properties associated with defence (Zangerl &amp; Berenbaum, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), understanding the likelihood and magnitude of this outcome is an important goal of invasion biology.
