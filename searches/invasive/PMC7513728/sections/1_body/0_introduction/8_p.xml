<p>The goal of this multi‐year study was to test whether, under field conditions, a population history with biocontrol would predict plant performance in the face of herbivory. Over three and half years in a wetland common garden with a robust local population of the biocontrol agent 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp., we grew over 1,000 plants from 17 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> populations that varied with respect to their length of prior exposure to 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. (between zero and ~ 20 years) under ambient herbivory and plant competition. Specifically, we asked: (1) Do populations with a history of exposure to biocontrol experience less damage in a natural setting? and (2) How do field levels of herbivory, and its variability over space and time, affect plant performance?
