<p>Plant defence traits that have evolved in response to selection imposed by herbivores are typically classified as either resistance or tolerance. Resistance traits are those that involve physical or chemical defences to deter or reduce herbivory (Berenbaum, Zangerl, &amp; Nitao, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). Some resistance traits function primarily against specialist herbivores and may become redundant in their absence, while others may target generalists, potentially conferring advantage in the introduced range (Muller‐Scharer et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Tolerance traits are those that help mitigate the impacts of herbivory on plant fitness, such as the ability to regrow or reallocate following damage (Strauss &amp; Agrawal, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>), or to alter phenology (Benning, Eckhart, Geber, &amp; Moeller, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Pilson, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>), including the timing of flowering (Austen, Rowe, Stinchcombe, &amp; Forrest, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Pilson, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) to avoid the heaviest costs of herbivory. Most plant species probably rely on both strategies, and variability in their mode of action, costs, and effectiveness against different herbivores complicates our ability to predict changes in plant defensive phenotypes in novel environments (Carmona &amp; Fornoni, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).
