<p>In our study region of eastern Ontario/western Quebec, 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> populations vary in their exposure to and history of biocontrol, ranging from sites of the original biocontrol release to sites with no previous exposure. This context of putatively different regimes of natural selection by the specialist herbivore offers an opportunity to examine the possibility and ecological consequences of rapid adaptation in resistance or tolerance to biocontrol. Two separate studies have demonstrated that plants from 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> populations with a longer period of exposure to 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. appear to be better defended against this specialist than plants from populations without a history of re‐association (Quiram,

 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, previous studies either examined plant defence traits in situ, making it difficult to disentangle population history from other site‐specific factors, or in highly controlled greenhouse/field situations that differ significantly from natural ecosystems. Herbivory is difficult to replicate under highly controlled, low‐stress environments that may magnify the expression of genetic differences (Johnson, Dinnage, Zhou, &amp; Hunter, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), making the existing results difficult to extrapolate to the natural settings where predicting biocontrol success is most relevant.
