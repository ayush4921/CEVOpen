<p>Evolution of increased resistance or tolerance in response to biocontrol would require sufficiently strong selection by the herbivore and genetic variation in defence traits. Biocontrol agents are chosen specifically for their significant impacts on growth and reproduction of the invasive species, necessary for population regulation (Myers &amp; Bazely, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>); therefore, these herbivores should impose genotype sorting and strong selection on plant defences, especially in the period immediately following their release (Muller‐Scharer et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). And while introduced populations are often genetically less diverse than those in the native range, due to processes such as bottleneck effect associated with the introduction (Dlugosch &amp; Parker, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), a number of studies have shown rapid adaptation in the introduced range (Rapo et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Uesugi et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Zangerl &amp; Berenbaum, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). One well‐known example is 
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic> (purple loosestrife), a common Eurasian invader of wetlands in North America. This species possesses an impressive ability to adapt rapidly to the novel conditions encountered in its introduced range, including clear evidence of earlier flowering phenology along its northward expansion (Colautti &amp; Barrett, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In the early 1990s, a biocontrol programme was initiated in the Canadian province of Ontario by releasing two species of specialist Chrysomelid leaf‐feeding beetles 
 <italic>Neogalerucella calmariensis</italic> and 
 <italic>N. pusilla</italic>, (hereafter, 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp.) (Blossey, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). In spite of widespread establishment of the biocontrol, the success of the programme has been equivocal, with many 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> populations showing little or no evidence of reduction in plant height, density or propensity to flower in the years since release (Grevstad, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Hovick &amp; Carson, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; St. Louis, Stastny, &amp; Sargent, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This outcome raises the question of whether the efficacy of biocontrol may be compromised by the adaptation of the target invader following the agent's release.
