<p>Invasive species are a major source of biological and economic disruption. The predominant explanation for invasiveness, the “enemy release” hypothesis, posits that the rapid population growth and spread associated with invasion are largely due to a lack of (specialist) enemies in the introduced range (Callaway &amp; Aschehoug, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Elton, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1958</xref>; Keane &amp; Crawley, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Classical biological control (hereafter, “biocontrol”) aims to avoid some of the undesirable effects of other control strategies (e.g. herbicides) by re‐establishing the association of the invasive species (target) with its specialist natural enemy (biocontrol agent), such as an insect herbivore (Myers &amp; Bazely, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Enemy release thus provides the theoretical motivation for biocontrol: introducing a specialist enemy should establish population regulation of the invasive species. However, evidence supporting the enemy release hypothesis is mixed, and reduced herbivory does not appear to play a consistent role in the invasiveness of introduced plant species (e.g. Colautti, Ricciardi, Grigoriovich, &amp; MacIsaac, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Schultheis, Berardi, &amp; Lau, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Similarly, the success of biocontrol is difficult to predict; some programmes achieve adequate control of the target species, but others do not, and generalities that could guide future releases have proven elusive (Myers &amp; Bazely,
