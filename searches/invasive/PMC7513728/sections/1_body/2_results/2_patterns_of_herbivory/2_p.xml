<p>Whether considered collectively (repeated measures model) or separately for each year (not shown), a history of biocontrol did not predict a plant's resistance to defoliation by 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, F2, 1,085 = 0.176, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .816), with most populations showing similar levels of defoliation (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The level of damage was highly variable among individual plants in the field, ranging from 0% to complete defoliation (100%) and characterized by skewed distributions (median early‐season damage in each of the three years: 30%, 35% and 35%, respectively). Notably, while herbivory varied significantly across years, a plant's level of defoliation in one year was not a predictor of defoliation in another year, whether at the level of individuals (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), or family means (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; year 1 versus year 2: Pearson's 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.0610, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .482; Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>; year 2 versus year 3: Pearson's 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.110, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .215). Furthermore, although damage varied with early‐season plant size, this relationship differed from year to year, ranging from negative to positive (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). We found that an individual's size at the onset of 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. herbivory (i.e. size at the time of transplant in year 1, or early‐season size in years 2 and 3) was a significant predictor of both defoliation and season‐end biomass (Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Neither population nor family were significant terms in any of the models. Both year and plot (block) explained a significant amount of variation in defoliation (Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), highlighting the substantial variability in herbivory across space and time, which is a known characteristic of this system (Denoth &amp; Myers,
