<p>We did not detect significant variation among populations or families for any of the three main metrics above, probably because it was swamped by the considerable variation among replicates and across years. Therefore, we then examined how, at the level of individual plants, early‐season vigour prior to herbivory and the degree of 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. damage jointly explain the variation in plant performance in years 2 and 3. In both year 2 and year 3, individuals that achieved the highest biomass by the end of the growing season tended to be the most vigorous (or advanced in phenology) early in the season prior to the first bout of herbivory and then suffered relatively lower defoliation (Figures 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a and b</xref>, respectively). Conversely, those individuals that tended to underperform in terms of season‐end biomass tended to exhibit lower to intermediate vigour (or delayed phenology) early in the season and then suffered heavier defoliation. However, by year 3, a substantial proportion of plants exhibiting small early‐season size (or very delayed phenology) eventually reached relatively high biomass; these plants also tended to be the least damaged in that year (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).
