<p>Both plant size early in the season and the level of defoliation sustained in early summer were significant predictors of biomass by the end of the growing season in each year (Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, in spite of the large range of variation in individual plant performance, we found no differences in season‐end biomass with respect to the history of biocontrol across the three years or for any specific year with respect to the history of biocontrol (Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The effect of a plant's size at the onset of herbivory (i.e. size at transplanting in year 1, or early‐season size in years 2 and 3) on its season‐end biomass was positive—a one unit increase in initial plant size was roughly equivalent to a one unit increase in season‐end biomass. The effect of herbivore damage was similar; a one unit increase in % damage was associated with a one unit decline in season‐end plant biomass, irrespective of the history of biocontrol (i.e. a defoliation x history interaction was not significant; Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As with 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. herbivory and early‐season plant size, time and space strongly predicted season‐end biomass (year and plot effects, Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>); plant biomass accumulation in years 2 and 3 was significantly lower than in year 1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), in spite of lower herbivory overall.
