 <sub>2, 1,085</sub> = 0.176, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .816). Likewise, under field conditions and preceding season herbivory, early‐season size did not differ with respect to the population's history of biocontrol (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), although it varied strongly over time and space (year and plot effects, Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). While performance in the greenhouse (i.e. year 1) did not predict plant size in the early season of year 2, early‐season size was correlated across subsequent years (i.e. year 2 versus year 3, and year 3 versus year 4), both at the level of individual plants (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4a</xref>) and family means (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva13053-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4b</xref>). In other words, some individuals and families consistently allocated more to vegetative growth in the spring than others and/or differed in the timing of regrowth. Variation in herbivory and plant performance resonated into subsequent years: defoliation experienced by the early summer and season‐end biomass reached by fall of the preceding year were both highly significant predictors of early‐season plant size the following year (Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, while the relationship with defoliation did not vary with the history of biocontrol (Table 
 <xref rid="eva13053-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the positive covariance between a plant's season‐end biomass and subsequent early‐season size was slightly steeper for plants from the release populations compared to those in naïve populations (biomass x population history interaction:
