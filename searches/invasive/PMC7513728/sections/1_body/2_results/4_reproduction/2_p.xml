<p>Very few plants flowered in the first and second year of the study. We therefore restricted our analysis of flowering to the last (third) full year of the common garden. In year 3, ~13% of plants produced flower buds, and of those, ~75% flowered. Similar to biomass, initial size and damage were the strongest predictors of whether a plant flowered in the last full year of the study, whereas a plant's source population history with biocontrol was not a significant predictor of its probability of bud formation or flowering. The timing of bud and flower formation was significantly impacted by herbivore damage in the first part of the growing season: heavier damage delayed the formation of both flower buds and flowers. We found no effect of population history on the timing of bud or flower formation (TableÂ
