<p>We examined the effects of population history and 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. herbivory on plant biomass across years 1 to 3 in a linear mixed‐effects model (function lmer) with season‐end biomass as a log‐transformed response variable and scaled early‐season plant size and defoliation as covariates. The model also included an interaction term between defoliation and history of biocontrol, as an indirect test of population differences in tolerance to herbivory (i.e. to compare the slopes of regression lines between defoliation and season‐end biomass); all of the other fixed and random factors in the model were as specified above.
