<p>We tested whether the history of biocontrol explained variation in emergent (early‐season) plant size across years 2–4 using a linear mixed‐effects model (function lmer) with the same basic structure as above but without a covariate, on a log‐transformed, scaled response variable (early‐season size). In addition, we repeated this analysis by separately including the following covariates corresponding to the preceding year (i.e. years 1, 2 and 3): the defoliation each plant had suffered, or the season‐end biomass it had reached. These two analyses thus examined whether damage or plant performance in a previous year impacted early plant growth the following spring (i.e. years 2, 3 and 4), and whether this relationship was contingent on the history of biocontrol (i.e. yielded a significant interaction).</p>
