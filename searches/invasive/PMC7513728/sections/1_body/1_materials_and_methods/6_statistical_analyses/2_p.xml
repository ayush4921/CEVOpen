<p>To test whether the history of biocontrol predicted patterns of herbivory (i.e. defoliation) across years 1 through 3, we used a generalized linear mixed‐effects model from the negative binomial family (glmer.nb with logit link function) that best accommodated the skewed distribution of the defoliation data. The model included plant size at the onset of herbivory (initial size at transplanting in year 1, and early‐season regrowth in years 2 and 3) as a covariate, and the fixed factors of population history of biocontrol (naïve, recent or release), year (1 – 3) and plot (1 – 4). Population and half‐sib family were included, along with individual plant ID, as nested random factors to account for repeated measurements over time, allowing us to examine whether there were significant inter‐population or inter‐family differences in the various response variables. We also examined covariation in the levels of herbivory between years, as an indication of genotypic differences in resistance to
