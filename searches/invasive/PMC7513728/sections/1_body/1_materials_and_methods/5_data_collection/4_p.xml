<p>Every spring, the plants then regrew from their below‐ground parts, typically as multiple ramets, which is characteristic of 
 <italic>L. salicaria's</italic> habit (Montague et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In years 2 and 3, immediately prior to the first larval generation of 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. (late May to early June), we measured the height of all stems (ramets) for each plant and used their sum as an estimate of early‐season size; this metric is strongly correlated with above‐ground biomass in the spring (M. Stastny, unpublished data). In the final (4th) year of the experiment, prior to the termination of the common garden, we harvested all plants in late May to obtain their early‐season above‐ground biomass and then safely dispose of them. Therefore, our measurements of early‐season plant size in each of the years 2 through 4 represent an estimate of above‐ground allocation and phenology of regrowth prior to any significant damage by the biocontrol agent. In the analyses (see below), we use initial size at transplanting (year 1) as a covariate along with the early‐season size in subsequent seasons. However, we only use early‐season size as a response variable (see below), as it has a distinct interpretation for natural patterns of plant regrowth and phenology after overwintering in situ, whereas initial size is largely the outcome of greenhouse conditions prior to transplanting. We standardized (i.e. scaled and centred) early‐season size within each of the three years (2, 3 and 4) prior to analysis, allowing us to directly compare these metrics across study years.
