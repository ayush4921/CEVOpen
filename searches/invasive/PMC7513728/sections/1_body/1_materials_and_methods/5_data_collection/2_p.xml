<p>Twice each growing season, and always by the same observer (M. Stastny), we measured herbivory by 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. by visually estimating the percentage (to the closest 10%) of the total leaf area of each plant consumed by the insect (hereafter, % damage; see Johnson, Bertrand, and Turcotte, (
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) for methodological details). The first damage estimate, coinciding with the end (pupation) of the first larval generation of 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp., was taken each year in late June or early July. These data represent the combined herbivory by the overwintering adult beetles and their larval‐stage progeny, with the latter inflicting most of the damage. The second damage estimate, in mid‐August, coincided with the end of the second larval generation. This late‐season bout of defoliation, combining both larval and adult beetle herbivory, was considerably lighter than the first (due to lower insect densities and larger plant biomass) but showed similar patterns; therefore, in the rest of the paper we focus on the early‐season damage.
