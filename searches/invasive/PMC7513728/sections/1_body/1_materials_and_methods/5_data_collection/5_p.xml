<p>The majority of plants (&gt;95%) survived until we ended the experiment in the late spring of year 4, although only a few flowered in the first two years. A proportion of plants that survived were recorded as “missing” during one or more surveys, if a) they did not initiate regrowth until after the early‐season census (
 <italic>N</italic> = 54 and 289 plants missing but surviving in years 2 and year 3, respectively), or b) only below‐ground biomass remained after particularly severe herbivory and the plant did not reappear until the following year (
 <italic>N</italic> = 14 and 185 plants in year 2 and year 3, respectively). Starting in mid‐summer of year 3, we surveyed all the plants every few days to record the date of the formation of inflorescence and the opening of the first flowers.
