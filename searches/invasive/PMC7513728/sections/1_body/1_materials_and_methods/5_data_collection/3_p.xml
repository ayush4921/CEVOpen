<p>At the end of each complete growing season (i.e. years 1 through 3), above‐ground biomass was harvested once most of the foliage had senesced, dried for 48 hr at 50
 <sup>0</sup>C and weighed. These measurements (hereafter, “season‐end biomass”) represent for each individual the combined outcome of above‐ground allocation and herbivory, including plant compensation for damage (see below).
