<p>In late March 2013, we selected eight families per population that captured the phenotypic mean and variance of each population as assessed previously in the greenhouse; these same families and seed material were reported on in a previous experiment (Stastny &amp; Sargent, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The seeds were bulk‐germinated under greenhouse conditions on moist soil (Metro‐Mix, Sun Gro Horticulture) in narrow plastic “conetainers” (66 ml; Stuewe &amp; Sons Inc.) with added side perforations to encourage lateral root growth, and randomized in holding racks that were then placed into bottom‐watering trays (Stuewe &amp; Sons Inc.). The seedlings were thinned randomly until only a single plant remained in each conetainer to yield a total of 1,088 plants (17 populations x 8 families x 8 replicates), grown at 20: 13
 <sup>0</sup>C and at 16:8 hr light: dark photoperiod. Weekly, we rotated the racks among the watering trays to minimize positional effects. In mid‐May, after 6–7 weeks, we transferred the plants under shade cloth to a rooftop garden for approximately two weeks to allow acclimation to outdoor light levels and temperatures. In early June 2013, just before transplanting into the field, we measured plant height after 8–9 weeks of growth (hereafter, “initial size”); this metric of early vigour is strongly correlated with biomass in young plants before branching (M. Stastny, unpublished data).
