<p>In 2012, 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> seeds were collected from flowering individuals from 17 populations throughout a climatically uniform region of eastern Ontario and western Quebec, Canada, spanning ~1 degree of latitude near Ottawa (see Stastny et al. (
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) for details). Six of the populations were selected from the original release sites of 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. in eastern Ontario (Corrigan, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; St. Louis et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) in the 1990s (hereafter, “release”). Another six populations were identified as having been colonized by 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. during its subsequent spread (hereafter, “recent”). The final five populations had not experienced any beetle herbivory (hereafter, “naïve”), as repeated field surveys of the sites failed to detect any beetles or damage (St. Louis et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Stastny &amp; Sargent, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). As much as possible, our selection of populations aimed to avoid any systematic bias in site or population characteristics with respect to the history of biocontrol, disturbance or colonization by 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic>. At each site, we collected seeds from approximately 40 flowering plants, spaced at least 5 m apart; these represent half‐sib maternal lines (hereafter, families).
