<p>In a randomized block design, we transplanted our plants into four plots (blocks), each containing 272 plants (2 replicates of each family per plot, from 8 families in each of the 17 populations, i.e. 136 families), in a regular grid with 1 m spacing. The plants were planted directly in their perforated conetainers, to help distinguish them from the existing 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> plants and to facilitate their eventual removal, without hindering their growth. The surrounding vegetation was trimmed twice in year 1 to aid their establishment, and the plants were fertilized with a 10–20–10 (N, P, K) solution mid‐season. At the request of the landowners, we did not use insecticides to exclude herbivory. It also proved impractical to add insect exclusion cages for logistical reasons in addition to their confounding effects on plant growth. We therefore allowed the plants to grow for the subsequent three years under field conditions including competition from other plants, and under the natural levels of herbivory by 
 <italic>L. salicaria's</italic> main biocontrol agent, 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp.
