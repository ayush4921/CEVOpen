<p>Even in the noisy field environment, the impacts of the biocontrol agent on our study plants were clear: herbivory tended to result in a lower plant size at the end of a growing season, a lower likelihood of flowering/fruiting and multi‐season delays in the timing of flowering. These findings reinforce the empirical basis for the 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. biocontrol programme, and parallel the interactions observed between these two species in their native range (Lehndal et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Our study has important implications for one of the major concerns surrounding pest management—whether the target organism will evolve resistance to the control, lowering its efficacy (Szucs, Vercken, Bitume, &amp; Hufbauer, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). We demonstrate that, in spite of the differences in tolerance and resistance evident under controlled experimental conditions (Quiram, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Stastny &amp; Sargent, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), in a more natural setting, plants from populations with a history of biocontrol exhibited few detectable differences in their ability to resist or tolerate herbivory. This finding suggests that, at least in the ~20 years since its inception, the success of the 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> biocontrol programme is not being hampered by the evolution of increased defence in the invasive target species.
