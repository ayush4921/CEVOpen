<p>On the other hand, our study also demonstrates the striking ability of individual 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> plants to persist in the face of strong herbivory, in spite of the marked spatio‐temporal variation in defoliation and its impacts on plant performance and allocation decisions. Variation in a plant's microsite and/or early‐season growth either enhanced or diminished its ability to grow large and eventually flower, magnifying growth and reproductive differences among individuals and their trajectories over time. Herbivory by 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. in the field is known to be patchy (Denoth &amp; Myers, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), suggesting that this spatial–temporal variability is a feature of the biocontrol agent's biology. Given this patchiness, and the robustness of 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic>, biocontrol on its own may provide insufficient pressure to adequately suppress growth or flowering in many populations, a finding supported by other studies (Denoth &amp; Myers, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Grevstad, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Hovick &amp; Carson, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; St. Louis et al., 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, managers should consider applying multiple control methods simultaneously, such as annual mowing or thinning of plants that have escaped defoliation, in order to support biocontrol programmes. This tactic could also reduce the possibility that certain locations become refuges for reproductive plants that escape herbivory year after year and help to maintain propagule pressure.
