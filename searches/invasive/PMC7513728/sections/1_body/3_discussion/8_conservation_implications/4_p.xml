<p>A final management implication of our study is that additional information and material should be collected from target populations prior to the release of biocontrol agents in order to enhance our ability to measure programme success and/or perform follow‐up studies. For example, in the present study, if seed material from a set of existing 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> populations (including those where biocontrol was planned) had been gathered prior to the release of 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp., we would have been able to more directly search for evidence of a rapid evolutionary response. Moreover, metrics describing the prerelease target populations (e.g. plant density, height, flowering time, reproductive traits and plant community diversity) would provide future biologists an invaluable dataset from which we could determine key factors connected to biocontrol success, including its effect size, currently unknown for most release programmes (e.g. Grevstad,
