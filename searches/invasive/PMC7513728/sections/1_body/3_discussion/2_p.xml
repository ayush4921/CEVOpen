<p>In a multi‐year common garden study, we found little evidence that a history of exposure has significantly altered an invasive plant's response to herbivory by its primary biocontrol agent. Irrespective of their population history of biocontrol
 <italic>, L. salicaria</italic> plants in our study suffered significant defoliation by 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. beetles, and defoliation was an important predictor of plant performance, both within and across the years of the study. Overall, our common garden results revealed that herbivory by the biocontrol agent tended to magnify individual differences in plant performance—the most vigorous plants tended to escape herbivory, allowing them to grow larger more quickly, and eventually, to flower. Smaller, less vigorous individuals in our common garden suffered the highest rates of defoliation, ultimately reached a lower biomass, and were less likely to flower by the end of the study. Interestingly, this pattern of carry‐over across years revealed the only effect of a history with biocontrol that we found: plants from the original release populations exhibited a slightly steeper relationship between a plant's initial size and its season‐end biomass in the previous season, relative to plants from naïve populations. This finding could indicate that the introduction of biocontrol has selected for earlier spring phenology and/or increased allocation into growth prior to 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. herbivory, which has implications for subsequent damage and plant fitness.
