<p>Our results contradict two prior studies of 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> that reported findings consistent with rapid adaptation of anti‐herbivore defence. One, from our own laboratory, found evidence that, in a controlled greenhouse experiment using the same seed material, plants from populations with a history of biocontrol exhibited increased resistance and tolerance to 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. herbivory compared to those from naïve populations (Stastny &amp; Sargent, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The second, performed as a common garden herbivory manipulation with populations from a separate (but similar) biocontrol programme in Minnesota, found that plants from populations with a history of biocontrol were marginally (
 <italic>p</italic> = .077) more tolerant of experimentally imposed herbivory than plants from naïve populations in the second, but not the first, year of the study (Quiram, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Here, we report that in a multi‐year study in a natural setting, individual differences in plant growth and phenology tended to exceed among family and population differences, amplifying the variation in and consequences of herbivory across seasons. We suspect that a weak response to selection, which may be especially common in biocontrol settings (Holt &amp; Hochberg, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>), combined with a high degree of environmental variability in the common garden (both herbivory and environment were controlled in the greenhouse) were the key contributors to the lack of detectable effects of biocontrol history in the field. We expand on these ideas below.
