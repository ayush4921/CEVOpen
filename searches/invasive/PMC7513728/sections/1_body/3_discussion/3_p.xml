<p>Overall, in spite of high variability in defoliation and biomass, plants in our study were surprisingly robust in terms of year‐to‐year survival. Indeed, some plants that seemed to have succumbed to herbivory early in our study had re‐emerged by later censuses and continued to persist until the final season. We conclude that, in the ~20 years since 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. was first introduced for biocontrol in Ontario, any adaptation to its presence by 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> has had little impact on plant defence strategies and biocontrol success in nature. Instead, the spatio‐temporal variability in ecological conditions that the plants encounter, especially herbivory, and plant phenotypic traits, such as size at the start of the season, were the main predictors of plant performance in the face of biocontrol. Our findings imply that the success of the 
 <italic>L. salicaria</italic> biocontrol programme is not being significantly hampered by rapid adaptation to herbivory.
