<p>In general, studies that explore plant adaption to population levels of herbivory are rare and tend to take place in controlled greenhouse settings (e.g. Sakata, Yamasaki, Isagi, &amp; Ohgushi, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Studies where plants are grown in more natural settings are much less common, with mixed support for local adaptation to herbivory. For example, Lehndal, Hamback, Ericson, and Agren, (
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), in a common garden study of nine populations from 
 <italic>L. salicaria's</italic> native range that varied in the degree of herbivory by 
 <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp., found that herbivore damage during the growing season, but not the level of herbivory measured at the source population, was the main predictor of a plant's flowering and seed output. In line with our findings, the authors concluded that the intensity of herbivory in the common garden, rather than local adaptation to the population's historic herbivory level, was the main driver of 
 <italic>L. salicaria's</italic> flowering and seed output. These results contrasted with those of an earlier study by the same group (Lehndal &amp; Ågren, 
 <xref rid="eva13053-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), which were more consistent with local adaptation to herbivory. The authors attributed their conflicting findings to differences in the selection regime across populations and space in the former study, which could have weakened net selection on anti‐herbivore defence.
