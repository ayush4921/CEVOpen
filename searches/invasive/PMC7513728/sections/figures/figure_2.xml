 <caption>
  <p>Variation among 17 populations of 
   <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic> differing in the history of exposure to biocontrol, showing means (±SE) of early‐season plant size following overwintering and prior to the onset of herbivory by the early‐summer generation of the specialist 
   <italic>Neogalerucella</italic> spp. leaf beetles. Plant size in years 2 and 3 was measured as the sum of all stem heights (see text for details), while dry above‐ground biomass was measured in year 4
