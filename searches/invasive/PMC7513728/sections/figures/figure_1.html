 <caption> (a) Means (± SE) of per cent defoliation of Lythrum salicaria by the early‐summer generation of Neogalerucella spp. leaf beetles across years 1, 2 and 3 for the three sets of populations differing in the history of biocontrol (naïve = no prior exposure; recent = secondary colonization, ~5–15 years; release = sites of biocontrol release, ~20 years ago). Bottom panels: scatterplots of 136 half‐sib family means, showing the correlation between defoliation (b) in year 1 versus year 2 and (c) in year 2 versus year 3. The symbols and colours indicate the family's history of biocontrol, as above </caption>
