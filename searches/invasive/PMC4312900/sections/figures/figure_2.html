 <caption> The differential impact on the costs of eradication (solid) and containment (dashed) programmes. Default parameter values are r = 700 m, d = 100 m, s = 5 years and δ = 0·05 (5%). For a given species, the values of d, s and δ are defined, and the size of the occupied zone at which the curves intersect (marked in a) represents the infestation for which containment and eradication are expected to cost the same amount. </caption>
