 <caption>
  <p>Zones in which containment is a valid fallback for eradication. As in Fig.
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> (a), the solid line in each subfigure indicates how large the occupied zone must be for containment to be as economic as eradication in the absence of a breach. Above this line, containment will outperform eradication. In each subfigure, a dashed line is added to show how this relationship would change following each type of breach: Types 0 (a) and IIIb (f) do not change the size of occupied zone for which containment outperforms eradication; Types I (b), IIa (c) and IIIa (e) increase the effective size of the occupied zone, creating a region between the solid and dashed lines in which a system originally best managed with an eradication programme would be more effectively managed with a containment programme following the breach; Type IIb (d) increases the maximum dispersal distance, creating a region between the dashed and solid lines that would be better managed by an eradication programme, even though an assessment in the absence of a breach would have recommended containment.
