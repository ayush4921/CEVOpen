 <caption> A simple model of invasion, consisting of an ‘occupied zone’ (dark shading) of radius r around the current extent of reproductive individuals, and a ‘buffer zone’ (light shading) of width d related to the effective dispersal capacity of the invader, into which non-reproductive individuals may be dispersed. The types of breach are summarized in Table 1. Eradication requires management of both the occupied and buffer zones until the seed bank is completely depleted. Containment requires management of only the buffer zone, but that management must continue indefinitely. </caption>
