 <caption>
  <p>Zones of optimal management in terms of the radius of the occupied zone as a function of (a) maximum dispersal distance; (b) seed bank longevity; and (c) the discount rate. (d) shows the optimum management strategy for any infestation. Each weed (defined by its dispersal capacity and seed bank longevity), infestation (defined by the radius of the occupied zone) and discount rate is represented by a single coordinate in this plot, which falls either in the zone where the costs of eradication are lower than containment, the zone where the costs of containment are lower than eradication, or on the line in between where the costs of eradication and containment are equal.</p>
