<p>Finally, we consider the merit of switching from an eradication programme to a containment programme following a breach of each type. The question is whether a system that is initially well specified as an eradication programme, with an occupied zone smaller than the critical radius for containment, changes its optimal management strategy from eradication to containment as a result of the breach. We assume that the decision to change from eradication to containment is being made as soon as the breach is discovered, and only costs from that point on are considered. This reduces the problem to an analysis of the costs of containment and eradication for the newly specified system.</p>
