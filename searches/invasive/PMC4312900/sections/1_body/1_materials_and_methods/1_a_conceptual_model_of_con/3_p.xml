<p>Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) define three modes of containment breach as follows:
 <italic>Type I</italic> – plants reproduce within the buffer zone;
 <italic>Type II</italic> – propagules are dispersed beyond the buffer zone; and
 <italic>Type III</italic> – plants reproduce beyond the buffer zone (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Because the maximum length of very rare long-distance dispersal events is not absolutely bounded, a containment strategy is likely to eventually experience a breach given the indefinite time frames that containment requires (Panetta &amp; Cacho 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In contrast, an eradication programme can, theoretically, remove all individuals before a breach is experienced. In practice, however, both strategies are at risk of a breach due to rare events, poor parameter estimation or imperfect detection (Carrasco
