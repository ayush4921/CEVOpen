<p>This definition of containment is intended as a starting point and intentionally avoids more complicated refinements, such as management of the occupied zone to gradually reduce propagule pressure (Lockwood, Cassey &amp; Blackburn 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) or ‘partial containment’ aiming to slow the rate of spread (Cacho 
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We refine the definition Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) to refer to the ‘effective’ dispersal distance implicitly determined by the spatial distribution of management effort. It is well known that management strategies should structure the distribution of effort in response to the scales of the ecological processes determining dispersal (Fletcher &amp; Westcott 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, estimating or even defining the maximum dispersal distance of an invasive plant is a notoriously difficult problem (Nathan 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), because in many species, (i) a tiny proportion of seeds experience rare long-distance dispersal events (Nathan 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and (ii) the potential exists for completely different modes of dispersal, for example human-mediated spread, to transport small numbers of seeds vast distances (Higgins, Nathan &amp; Cain 
 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Nathan 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In practical studies, long-distance dispersal is generally defined as either a proportional threshold (e.g. 1% of the number of dispersal events) or an absolute threshold (e.g. 500 m from the parent plant) (Panetta &amp; Cacho 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For this analysis, we use the second definition and assume that the ‘effective’ dispersal distance is being determined by managers. Assuming the same approach is used across eradication and containment strategies, the manner in which they determine this distance does not affect the results or conclusions of our analysis.
