 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) propose that containment is a ‘deliberate action taken to prevent establishment and reproduction of a species beyond a predefined area’. This definition leads to the idea of a ‘containment unit’, consisting of an ‘occupied zone’ containing reproductive plants surrounded by a ‘buffer zone’ that is free from reproductive plants but does receive propagules (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). To contain an infestation every new individual that germinates in a buffer the width of the ‘expected’ maximum dispersal distance (
 <italic>d</italic>) around the occupied zone (
 <italic>r</italic>) must be removed before it becomes reproductive. Management does not eliminate reproductive individuals from the occupied zone, so the infestation continues to disperse propagules into the buffer zone and containment actions must continue unless the management goal changes. These zones can also be used to represent an eradication strategy, in which case every established individual within the occupied zone plus any that arise from seeds that are dispersed to the buffer region must be removed before it reproduces along with every new individual that germinates from the seed bank, until that seed bank is depleted.
