<p>We further split a Type III breach, in which reproduction occurs outside the buffer zone, into two subcategories based on the distance of the individual reproductive event from the original infestation: Type IIIa – a ‘close’ breach, which we assume is outside the buffer zone by less than the effective dispersal distance; and a Type IIIb – a ‘distant’ breach, which we assume is so far from the original infestation that it can be treated as an entirely separate eradication programme.</p>
