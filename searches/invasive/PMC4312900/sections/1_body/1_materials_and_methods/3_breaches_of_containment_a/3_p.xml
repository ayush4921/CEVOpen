<p>We split a Type II breach, in which propagules are dispersed beyond the buffer zone but removed before reproduction, into two mathematically distinct subcategories based on the cause of the breach: Type IIa – a further breach as a result of an undetected Type I breach; and Type IIb – as a result of an originally misspecified dispersal distance. A Type IIa breach implies no further costs over and above a Type I breach. A Type IIb breach, on the other hand, affects both eradication and containment in a manner distinct from a Type I breach. Because the plant derived from the propagule is removed before it matures and reproduces, the occupied zone does not increase, but from the time of its discovery the buffer zone must be increased appropriately for both management strategies.</p>
