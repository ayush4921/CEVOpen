<p>A Type IIIa breach is functionally similar to an extreme example of a Type I breach, in which the occupied zone is expanded by twice the effective dispersal distance. A Type IIIb breach requires that an entire secondary eradication programme be set up at the site of the breach and run for the duration of the seed bank longevity, assuming the individual is found as soon as it reproduces.</p>
