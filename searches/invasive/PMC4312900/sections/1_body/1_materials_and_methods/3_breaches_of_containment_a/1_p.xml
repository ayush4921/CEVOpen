<p>We extend the breach modes identified by Grice

 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) (Table
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>) to capture the relative performance of eradication and containment strategies and summarize the costs of each type of breach in Table
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>. We define a new mode: Type 0 – failure to remove an individual before its propagules are dispersed from within the occupied zone. A breach of this type only affects eradication programmes because the occupied zone is not managed by a containment strategy. A Type 0 breach ‘resets the clock’ on eradication in terms of seed bank longevity.
