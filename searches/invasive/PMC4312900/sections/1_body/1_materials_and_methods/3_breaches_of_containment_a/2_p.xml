<p>In a Type I breach, plants reproduce somewhere in the buffer zone. The worst case scenario is when this occurs close to the outer edge of the buffer zone because both eradication and containment programmes must respond by expanding their occupied zone radius by the effective dispersal distance. An eradication programme must also reset its seed bank clock, while a containment programme will continue indefinitely, as before the breach.</p>
