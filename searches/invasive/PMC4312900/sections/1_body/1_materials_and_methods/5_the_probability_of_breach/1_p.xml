<p>Different types of breach are driven by different ecological and management processes and will therefore be more or less likely in a given system. Broadly speaking, breaches of Types 0, I and IIa represent a failure of detection, and Types IIb, IIIa and IIIb a failure of system specification in terms of dispersal distance. The probability of breach does not enter our current analysis because we focus on the economic cost following a single unexpected breach in an otherwise well-specified management programme, rather than the long-term average expected cost based on breach probability. Some recent studies have begun to assess the importance of the probability of breaches in containment and eradication programmes (Panetta &amp; Cacho
