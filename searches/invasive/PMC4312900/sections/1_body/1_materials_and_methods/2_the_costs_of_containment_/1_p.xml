<p>To model the relative performance of containment and eradication strategies under this framework, we assume a circular infestation of radius

 <italic>d</italic> (m), and seed bank longevity,
 <italic>s</italic> (years). Total ‘costs’ in net present values are the cost of searching for and removing individuals,
 <italic>c</italic> ($ m
 <sup>−2</sup>) multiplied by the area searched every year, A (m

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m1">Eqn 1</xref> shows how the cost, C ($), of either strategy is determined by the area to be searched every year (A) and by how long management must continue (
