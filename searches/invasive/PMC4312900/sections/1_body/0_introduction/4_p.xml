<p>Worse yet, many strategies that identify containment as an option give insufficient guidance as to how it might be achieved in practice. This prevents the management objective being linked to the biology of the invader, its environment or the capacity of managers on the ground. To begin addressing these concerns, Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) proposed a simple definition of a containment unit consisting of an occupied zone inhabited by the invasive species and a buffer zone into which propagules are dispersed (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). In Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>.'s formulation, the width of the buffer zone is related to the ‘maximum dispersal capacity’ of the invader but, because long-distance dispersal does not exhibit a hard maximum limit, the possibility of a containment breach must be recognized (Panetta &amp; Cacho 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In an earlier publication, Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) identified three types of breach that could affect a containment programme. Similar criteria can also be applied to an eradication programme (Fletcher
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and here we extend and generalize Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) types of breach to consider the relative impacts of a breach on eradication and containment programmes.
