<p>From a theoretical perspective, however, many infestations are likely to be no more amenable to containment than eradication because the ecological drivers that determine containment success are the same as those that limit successful eradication. Sharov &amp; Liebhold (
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>) illustrated that the economically optimal strategy for managing the spread of gypsy moth
 <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> L. in the United States changed from ‘eradication’ to ‘slowing the spread’ via a barrier zone, and eventually to ‘doing nothing’ as the area occupied by the infestation increased. Cacho
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) extended this bioeconomic approach to identify ‘critical decision points’ at which eradication, containment or no management were the most economically rational strategy for isotropically spreading scotch broom
 <italic>Cytisus scoparius</italic> L. in Australia. Carrasco
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) extended Sharov and Liebhold's formulation to show that in many cases, the optimal choice between applying an eradication strategy or a strategy designed to slow the rate of spread applied even when parameter estimates were uncertain. Panetta &amp; Cacho (
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) found that because containment was susceptible to breaches by rare long-distance dispersal events, surveillance and fecundity control were likely to be important components of an effective management strategy. They recently extended this work and found that the use of barrier zones was unlikely to be successful for weeds exhibiting fat-tailed dispersal with high median dispersal distances (Panetta &amp; Cacho
