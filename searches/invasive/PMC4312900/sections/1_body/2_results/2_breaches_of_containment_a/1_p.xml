<p>The performance of containment and eradication under the six types of breach differs markedly (Table
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). A Type 0 breach affects only eradication and acts functionally as an increase in seed bank longevity. Type I, Type IIa and Type IIIa breaches affect both eradication and containment, but for a system at the critical radius before the breach, the extra costs are lower for a containment programme than an eradication programme (Table
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). In contrast, a Type IIb breach necessitates an increase in the size of the buffer zone, so always incurs more costs for a containment programme at the critical radius than the equivalent eradication programme. A Type IIIb breach requires an entire secondary eradication, for both eradication and containment, so incurs the same extra management costs.
