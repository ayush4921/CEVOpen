<p>Finally, we consider the merit of switching from an eradication programme to a containment programme following a breach of each type (Table
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>). Before a breach, a well-specified eradication programme will involve an occupied zone equal to or smaller than the critical radius (
 <italic>r</italic> ≤ 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>*</sub>). An eradication breach of Types I, IIa or IIIa will increase the size of the occupied zone. If it becomes larger than the critical decision point (
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>*</sub>), containment will become a more attractive ‘fallback’ strategy than eradication following the breach. In contrast, eradication breaches of Types 0, IIb and IIIb do not change the size of the occupied zone, and so would not be expected to improve the performance of a containment programme relative to an eradication programme following a breach.
