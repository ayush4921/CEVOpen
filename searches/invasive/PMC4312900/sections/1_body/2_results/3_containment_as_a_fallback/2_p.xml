 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). For breaches of Types I, IIa and IIIa, a new intermediate region is added within the eradication zone in which, if a breach is experienced, containment would become a valid fallback strategy. For a breach of Type IIb, a new region is added to the containment zone in which, if an eradication breach is experienced, further eradication is recommended even though a first assessment would have recommended containment. For breaches of Type 0 and Type IIIb, an eradication breach does not change the optimal strategy.
