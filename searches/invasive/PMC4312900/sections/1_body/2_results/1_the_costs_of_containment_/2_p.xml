<p>For a given invasive species being managed at a given discount rate, the parameters d, s and δ are defined and eradication will tend to cost less than containment for infestations that are ‘small’ relative to the critical decision radius,
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>*</sub>, and more for ‘large’ infestations (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>a). The costs of both strategies are equal when the occupied zone is of radius
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>*</sub>, which can be expressed as a multiple of the effective dispersal distance 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m4">eqn 4</xref>. Plotting these relationships allows us to understand how the critical decision point between containment and eradication depends on effective dispersal distance, seed bank longevity and the discount rate (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). Invaders with larger effective dispersal capacities require a larger buffer zone, and the critical radius at which containment outperforms eradication increases. Invaders with long-lived seed banks require long eradication programmes, and so the critical radius at which containment outperforms eradication decreases. An increasing discount rate decreases the future value of money and the future costs of running a long-term containment programme, decreasing the critical radius at which containment outperforms eradication. These relationships can be summarized for all possible invasions in a dimensionless form by scaling the radius of the occupied zone against the buffer width (
 <italic>r</italic>/
 <italic>d</italic>), and plotting against the seed bank longevity and the log of the discount rate (
 <italic>s</italic> ln (1 + δ)). Each possible infestation and management strategy is represented by a single point within this dimensionless space, and its location determines whether it is most economically managed via an eradication or containment programme.
