<p>We plot eqnsÂ 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m3">3</xref> to illustrate how the four parameters differentially affect the costs of eradication and containment (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). As the radius of the occupied zone increases, the costs of both eradication and containment increase, but the proportional costs of eradication increase faster. As the width of the buffer zone increases, the costs of both strategies increase, but the proportional costs of containment increase faster. Increases in seed bank longevity do not affect containment costs, but increase eradication costs. Finally, increases in the discount rate affect both eradication and containment, but decrease the proportional costs of containment faster.
