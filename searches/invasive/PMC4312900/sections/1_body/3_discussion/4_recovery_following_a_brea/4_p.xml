<p>In contrast, a Type IIb breach proportionally increases management costs of containment more than those of eradication, because it increases the size of the buffer zone. This suggests that eradication may be a more effective strategy in systems where the maximum dispersal distance may have been underestimated (Higgins &amp; Richardson 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), perhaps because suitable habitat clustered near the infestation has constrained establishment (Jongejans, Skarpaas &amp; Shea 
 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). An eradication programme that suffers a Type IIb breach will not be served more effectively by ‘falling back’ to a containment strategy after the breach.
