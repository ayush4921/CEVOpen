<p>A Type 0 breach is caused by reproduction within the occupied zone and affects only eradication by extending the life of the seed bank. Containment may offer benefits over eradication in a system prone to a Type 0 breach. However, the occurrence of a single Type 0 breach in a system currently being managed under an eradication programme does not change the relative benefit of switching to a containment strategy following the breach, unless such breaches are expected to recur.</p>
