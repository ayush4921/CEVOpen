<p>Type I, Type IIa and Type IIIa breaches affect both eradication and containment, but for a system with an occupied zone at the critical radius,

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). This perhaps supports the use of a containment strategy in borderline cases where eradication and containment are expected to be comparably expensive, although a full analysis would require a more advanced model capable of accounting for the differing probabilities of breach in eradication and containment programmes (Panetta &amp; Cacho 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In a system currently being managed for eradication, each of these types of breach effectively increases the size of the occupied zone, while maintaining the size of the buffer zone. This increases the r/d ratio of the system, and in cases that were borderline before the breach, the system will move into the region where containment is expected to outperform eradication (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). This suggests that containment may be a valid fallback strategy for a borderline eradication programme that suffers a Type I, Type IIa or Type IIIa breach.
