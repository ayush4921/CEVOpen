<p>With an explicit and sufficient definition of containment, a simple assessment of the sort outlined in this manuscript can quickly ascertain whether containment can outperform eradication, and under what conditions it could provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme. The infestation extent, dispersal capacity, seed bank longevity and economic discount rate specify a unique set of coordinates for any management strategy on Fig.
