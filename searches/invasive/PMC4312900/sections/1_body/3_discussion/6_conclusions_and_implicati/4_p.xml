<p>Finally, our analysis shows that only a breach leading to reproduction in or just outside the buffer zone can justify falling back to containment from a breached eradication programme, and only if the expected costs of eradication and containment were comparable before the breach. If propagules are discovered outside the buffer zone of an eradication programme, a coordinated search of the buffer zone for reproductive individuals should be conducted, and the dispersal distances assumed by the management programme reassessed. If the breach is identified as Type I, IIa or IIIa, then the system should be assessed against Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref> to see whether fallback to containment is justified.
