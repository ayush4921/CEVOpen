<p>Although theoretical studies have shown that containment is not always cheaper than eradication (Sharov &amp; Liebhold

 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), management plans currently in place still invoke containment as a fallback for failed eradication (Thorp &amp; Lynch 
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), often without describing exactly what containment would require. To begin addressing this issue, Grice
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) developed a simple concept of a containment unit that managers could use to ensure that they clearly defined how containment would be implemented. Here, we have built on this concept to provide a simple but general analysis of the relative economic performance of eradication and containment, including the consequences of breaches and the merit of viewing containment as a fallback for a breached eradication programme. The general nature of our analysis means that managers can apply the results generated to any invasion for which the infestation size, dispersal capacity, seed bank longevity and discount rate can be estimated.
