<p>Even without parameterizing the model for a specific invasion, we can see that while containment has one major advantage over eradication - that a smaller area can be managed - this must be balanced against its disadvantage - that a containment strategy does not aim to reduce the population in the occupied zone and must therefore continue to run as long as managers wish to limit the extent of the invasion. Moreover, the two management strategies incur very different additional costs if they experience an unexpected breach. Of particular interest, the additional costs of adapting and continuing a well-specified eradication programme following a breach are higher than the costs of a containment programme for only three of the six types of breach examined, suggesting that containment is not a good default fallback for a breached eradication programme.</p>
