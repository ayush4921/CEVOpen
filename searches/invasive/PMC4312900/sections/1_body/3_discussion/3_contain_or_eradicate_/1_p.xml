 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m4">eqn 4</xref> suggest that containment would be cheaper than eradication only when the size of the occupied zone exceeds a multiple of the dispersal distance determined by seed bank longevity and the discount rate. This threshold is similar to Cacho
 <italic>et al</italic>.'s ‘critical decision points’ (Cacho
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Biologically, this means that containment is less likely to be viable for species exhibiting large effective dispersal distances via fat-tailed distributions, as found by Panetta &amp; Cacho (
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The longer an infestation has been established and the further it has spread, the more likely it is that a containment strategy will be a cheaper option than eradication. This is a similar result to that reached by Sharov &amp; Liebhold (
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>) for gypsy moth in the United States. Of course, the possibility that neither eradication nor containment is economically viable should also be explicitly considered (Cacho
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Some studies have suggested that when funds are limited, optimal outcomes may involve partial containment coupled with fecundity reduction actions in the occupied zone (Panetta &amp; Cacho
