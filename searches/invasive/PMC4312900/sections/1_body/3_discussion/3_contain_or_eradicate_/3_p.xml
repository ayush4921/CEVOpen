<p>The first individual to arrive in a landscape may be easily missed, but as its seeds are dispersed and begin to germinate, the invasive population becomes much more visible. In the worst case scenario, if all the dispersed propagules of this individual become reproductive, the occupied zone will be as large as the maximum dispersal distance. Substituting (

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m4">eqn 4</xref>, we can specify reasonable discount rates to find ‘threshold’ seed bank longevities, above which containment would outperform eradication. For such an ‘early infestation’ and a discount rate of 5% (δ = 0.05), the invader must have a seed bank longevity (s) greater than 29 years for containment to outperform eradication; a discount rate of 10% would yield 14 years. Longer established infestations would be expected to have larger occupied zones, and containment would outperform eradication for shorter seed bank longevities (e.g.

 <italic> </italic>8·5 years when
 <italic>r </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>2
 <italic>d</italic> and δ = 0.10). There are many examples of invaders with seed bank longevities less than this (e.g. lion's tail
 <italic>Leonotis nepetifolia</italic> L. R.Br., gamba grass
 <italic>Andropogon gayanus</italic>, Kunth), but many others with greater seed bank longevities (e.g. siam weed
 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic>, L. King &amp; H.E. Robins). This suggests that in some systems, the choice between containment and eradication is likely to be an important one. Indeed, for invaders with multiple infestations and seed bank longevities near the threshold, the best outcome might be achieved by attempting to eradicate some of the smaller sites while containing the larger ones. This was the approach recommended following review of a long-running programme targeting lion's tail on Rinyirru (Lakefield) National Park in Far North Queensland (Clarkson, Grice &amp; Dollery
