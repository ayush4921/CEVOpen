<p>Containment becomes proportionally more attractive than eradication for invaders with smaller dispersal distances or long-lived seed banks, or for larger discount rates. These parameters are generally fixed outside the managers' control, determined by either the biology of the plant or the economic system, but they can change over time if, for example, further study improves estimates of seed bank longevity. Similarly, parameters may vary between individual isolated sites, such as the limited dispersal capacity of a wind-dispersed species established in a sheltered site. In either of these scenarios, if containment has been initially ruled out, further consideration may recommend it as a viable option.</p>
