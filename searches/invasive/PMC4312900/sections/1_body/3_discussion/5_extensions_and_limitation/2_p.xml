<p>In practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between different Types of breach in the field, especially between types IIa and IIb following the discovery of propagules or seedlings beyond the buffer zone. A combination of further studies, such as a coordinated search of the buffer zone for reproductive individuals driving a previously undetected Type I breach, or an ecological reassessment of the dispersal distances assumed by the management programme, may elucidate the cause of the breach. Both of these drivers have been separately identified during breaches of eradication programmes for
