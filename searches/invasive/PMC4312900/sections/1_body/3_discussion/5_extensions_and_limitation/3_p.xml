<p>The simple model presented here does not consider the different probabilities of breach under containment and eradication strategies because it is focused on the question of the cost following a single unexpected breach in an otherwise well-specified management programme.

Although such an analysis is beyond the scope of the current study, others have recently begun making inroads into this subject (Panetta &amp; Cacho
