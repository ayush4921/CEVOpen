<p>The probability of breach is proportional to the size of the population in the occupied zone. Containment programmes incorporating fecundity reduction can transfer some management resources from the buffer zone to reduce the population in occupied zone. This acts to decrease the probability of all types of breach, but at the same time the reduced management of the buffer zone acts to increase the chance of Types I and IIa breaches. Which effect predominates will be dependent on the characteristics of the species being managed and the cost and effectiveness of management. To date, two other studies have explicitly considered this scenario in the context of optimal strategies under resource constraints. Panetta &amp; Cacho (

 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found that the optimal choice of management for density-structured
