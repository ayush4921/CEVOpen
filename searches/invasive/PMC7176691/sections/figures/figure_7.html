 <caption> Photovoltaic performance of Carbon HTMs based PSCs. ( a) Current density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the invasive plant synthesized graphitic porous carbon annealed at different temperature (EC-GC4, EC-GC8 and EC-GC10) based hole transport material PSC devices. ( b) J–V curves of devices without and with interfacial layer of 80 nm and 150 nm thickness (EC-GC10@CH 3NH 3PbI 3−xCl x). ( c) Comparative study of the J–V characteristics  of the different carbon EC-GC4, EC-GC8, EG-GC10, C/NiS and CC based HTM PSC devices. ( d) J–V characteristics of the champion device-1 c and the inset shows the photograph of the fabricated PSC. </caption>
