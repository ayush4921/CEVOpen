<p id="Par24">The previous reports on organic conducting polymer-based HTMs in PSCs indicate that it has the potential to compete with the conventional solar cells, yet the device stability remains a big concern due to its vital aspect for the onsite photovoltaic application

 </sup>. Hence, the air and moisture stability tests were also carried out on the prepared porous graphitic carbon-based PSCs (they were exposed directly to light and air under the ambient environment). Overall, the fabricated PSC devices using different carbon-based HTMs were exposed to an ambient environment (at 25° ± 5 °C with 70 ± 5% humidity) and their stability was tested for ~1000 hours.
