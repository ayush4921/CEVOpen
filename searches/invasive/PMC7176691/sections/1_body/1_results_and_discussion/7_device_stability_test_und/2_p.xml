<p id="Par25">A comparative study was carried out on the analysis of device stability and deterioration chart for the devices with and without EC-GC10 encapsulated perovskite interfacial layer is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7(a,b)</xref>. It could be inferred from the deterioration test that the device having an interfacial layer (device-1
 <sup>c</sup>) showed better stability with a deterioration percentage of just 5.60% exhibiting a PCE of 8.05% after ~1000 hours. Whereas the stability of the device fabricated without the interfacial layer (device-1
 <sup>f</sup>) encountered a deterioration of more than 63.30% displaying a PCE of 2.62% after 1000 hours. This lower deterioration value for the device-1
 <sup>c</sup> compared to that of the device-1
 <sup>f</sup>, could be attributed to the better interfacial contact between EC-GC encapsulated perovskite/EC-GC based HTM which facilitates hole transfer at the interface and prevents the degradation of perovskite material against air and moisture which resulted in achieving long-term stability
