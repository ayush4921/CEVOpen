<p id="Par21">Although the interfacial layer plays a crucial role in determining the PCE with its effective charge collection capabilities, the previous reports have not focussed much on some of the key parameters such as their thickness which could have a significant effect on the device performance

 </sup>. In this, the necessity and the importance of optimizing the thickness of the interfacial layer has been discussed. As to understand the role of the interfacial layer (EC-GC10@CH

 <sub>x</sub>) thickness in the device performance, a series of devices have been fabricated in this work. The thickness of the interfacial layer of the devices was changed using different spin rotation speeds. The J-V characteristics of the two devices fabricated using the interfacial layer formed with the thickness of 80 and 150 nm are also shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> and their detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. From this result analysis, it could be found that the maximal performance was achieved when the thickness of the interfacial layer is at 80 nm. Here the EC-GC10@CH

 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub> interfacial layer is expected to effectively intercalate into the grain boundaries of the deposited perovskite layer. This resulted in enabling both fast charge transfer (to the back electrode) and reduction in diffusion length needed (boosting the short-circuit current). A decline in the J
