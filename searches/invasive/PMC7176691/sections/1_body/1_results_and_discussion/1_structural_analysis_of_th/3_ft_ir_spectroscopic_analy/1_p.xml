<p id="Par8">Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) spectroscopy has been used to detect the functional groups present in the bio-extracted porous graphitic carbon samples EC-GC4, EC-GC8 and EC-GC10 annealed at different temperatures (~450 °C, ~850 °C, ~1000 °C). Several FT-IR predominant bands present in all the samples at 3706 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1558 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1229 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1035 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are assigned to the stretching vibrations of OH, C–H, symmetrical &amp; asymmetrical C=O, and =C–O–C groups respectively and is shown in Fig.
