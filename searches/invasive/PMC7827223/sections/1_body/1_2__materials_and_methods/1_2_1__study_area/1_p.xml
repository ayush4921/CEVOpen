As a subsequent use, some former peat cutting areas have been rewetted with the aim of regenerating raised bogs. In the surrounding area, parts of the Lichtenmoor have been designated as nature reserves. Former hand peat cutting sites are located at the edges and in parts of the nature reserves. Agricultural areas dominate the remaining areas, mostly grassland, dry to moist moorland forests, scrubby heather and moorland degeneration stages, pioneer stages of moorland rewetting, and peat extraction areas under cultivation. The case study area covers a total area of 62 ha and it is located in the central part of the Lichtenmoor region. To the northeast, it borders a pine plantation, while at its southwest border current peat extraction areas are located. Blueberry plantations can be found throughout the Lichtenmoor, especially on the outskirts of the localities Lichtenhorst, Heemsen, Sonnenborstel, and Steimbke.
