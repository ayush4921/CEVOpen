<p>The number of blueberry bushes varied from 235 in orthomosaic B6 to 687 in B2 (
 <xref rid="sensors-21-00471-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The site areas of orthomosaic B1, B3 and B4 were similar, while orthomosaic B6 is the largest site containing the least number of blueberry bushes and orthomosaic B2 contains the greatest number of blueberry bushes in the smallest area. The ratio could be confirmed by calculating the blueberry bushes per ha (
