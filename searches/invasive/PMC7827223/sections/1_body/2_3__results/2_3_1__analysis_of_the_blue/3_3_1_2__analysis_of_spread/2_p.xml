<p>The first step was to cluster blueberry bushes by using specified distances, of which 3 and 6 m were chosen, due to the calculated area of the blueberry bushes. The average diameter was considered to be 2 m for the different sites, and therefore a diameter of 3 m was found to be appropriate to especially group blueberry bushes that were close to each other. The results of both distances were compared and they are listed in 
 <xref rid="sensors-21-00471-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. When blueberry bushes were located in a range of 3 m, they were clustered with the following results. From orthomosaic B3 to B1, 35.51% to 39.87% were clustered. The highest number of clustered bushes were 33 in B3, followed by 25 in B2 and 10 in B1. In comparison to B1 to B3, B4 and B6 had around 28.3 % clusters with three and more blueberry bushes. The highest number within a cluster was nine for B4 and 13 for B6. After increasing the range to 6 m, the number of blueberry bushes clustered in the group 3 or more bushes increased to 69.57%, which is more than 30 percentage points. B1, B3, and B4 had a similar increase of around 15 percentage points and reached 56.63 % in B1, 50.43% in B3 and 44.35 in B6. With less than 10 percentage points, 37.68 % of the blueberry bushes were grouped together with more than three bushes.
