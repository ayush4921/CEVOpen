<p>Because three orthomosaics were available, a leave-one-mosaic-out cross validation approach was applied in order to evaluate the results. One of the orthomosaics was used for training, another for validation and the last one for testing. In order to ensure that all orthomosaics were used at least once for training, validation, and testing, we rotated them accordingly. This section presents the averages results for the TPR and the accuracy results of the three testing stages that correspond to each orthomosaic.</p>
