<p>The use of deep learning proved to be effective for this problem, but also challenging. As in all artificial intelligence approaches, a sufficient number of images that represent the variability of the desired target is necessary in order to train a supervised model that is usable in practice (in the current studies, this amounted to images that corresponded to 33 hectares). Furthermore, with the size of the current blueberry bush data in these images, careful use of data augmentation as well as a dedicated balancing approach was necessary. In order to improve the detection of blueberry bushes, a larger training dataset would likely be needed. For instance, because blueberry bushes are often planted for blueberry production, those fields could offer a good opportunity to collect new images.</p>
