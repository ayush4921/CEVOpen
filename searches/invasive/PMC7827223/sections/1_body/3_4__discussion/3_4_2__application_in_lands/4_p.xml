<p>In comparison, B2, B3, and B4 showed a high spread in the southern direction, because blueberry bushes of various size were found everywhere and there were higher concentration areas and several spreading centres. These findings can be confirmed with the persistent homology and density map, indicating a high progress of the invasion. The three orthomosaics seem to have a homogeneous distribution and a gradual change to lower numbers in the southern direction. However, the significant differences that were found by the hotspot analysis indicate that there are conditions that influence the distribution of the blueberry bushes, as in site B1. In addition, all three orthomosaics show an area with a small density of bushes, which can probably be explained by the high water content in the soil correlated with unsuitable conditions regarding plant growth. The invasion of the blueberry species was characterised as such and far advanced for B2 to B4. Only B4 has smaller bushes that cover a smaller area, which suggests that the invasion is less advanced than for B2 and B3. The spread will probably increase there in the following years.</p>
