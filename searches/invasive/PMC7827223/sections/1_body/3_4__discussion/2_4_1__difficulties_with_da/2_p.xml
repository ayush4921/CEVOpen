<p>The analysis presented some difficulties in the calculations of the height and surface area of the blueberry bushes. The main problems to determine bush height are occlusions, due to nearby trees and difficulties due to dense floor covering vegetation. As the cluster analysis shows, the high density of blueberry bushes in some areas and their proximity increased the possibilities that the bushes were partly covered and the whole bush area was not visible, as already pointed out by [
 <xref rid="B10-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, bushes were often located close to trees that have canopies that can cover most of a blueberry bush. The areas calculated for the blueberry bushes, exceeding 4â€“5 m

 </inline-formula>, indicated that there has to be more than one bush, which was difficult to identify in the images, as well as for calculating the height. Wetland regions, imaged in the orthomosaics are grassland and covered with dense hassocks. Therefore, the soil is often not visible and the ground annotations often represent the height of the hassocks, which resulted in values of 0 m maximum height and even more bushes showed a value of 0 m, when the median height was calculated for smaller bushes, especially in B4 and B6. Therefore, it is assumed that the hassocks can reduce the real height of the bushes by 30 cm. However, the calculated height values exceeded 3 m, which is unusual for the blueberry species that are studied here. There were errors produced when the annotations contained parts of an overlapping tree canopy, which increased the maximum height. The median height was resistant to outlier values. When ground areas were annotated, the median generally decreased the height values, especially for small bushes. Annotations of the ground need to be set carefully, since the wetland was uneven and depressions could increase the height values of the blueberry bushes. Furthermore, the differences between the max. height and median height can be influenced by the structure of the bush canopy. Because of these difficulties, a correlation between the height and area values of blueberry bushes was not considered, but a comparison of the distribution of these values showed that the distribution was similar and the bush area was larger than the height.
