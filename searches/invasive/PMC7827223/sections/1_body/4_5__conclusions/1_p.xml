<p>In this paper, we introduced a multi-disciplinary methodology to quantitatively evaluate the role of plant species in ecosystems, including invasive species. The use of UAVs makes the approach applicable, even in restricted access areas and it increases the total area that can be studied, greatly exceeding the range of existing field studies. We used this methodology to gather information regarding wetland vegetation. Simple and time-saving methods were applied to classify vegetation and provide information about the properties of the invasive blueberry species found in our study site. The distribution of blueberry bushes was analysed in terms of their density, clustering, and spread. The relative importance of blueberries in the wetland was analysed (number of bushes, bush area, and bush height). This information was transformed into location, density, and hotspot maps to provide advanced visualization tools. Deep learning techniques were used in order to automatically detect and segment blueberry bushes, opening the possibility to further extend the range of similar studies.</p>
