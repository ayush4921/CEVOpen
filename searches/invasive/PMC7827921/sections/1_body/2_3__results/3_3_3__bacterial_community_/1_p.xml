<p>In the bacterial community, all sequences were classified to bacterial domain and assigned to 3948 OTUs across all samples, including 55 bacterial phyla, 122 classes, 143 orders, 215 families, and 301 genera. Proteobacteria (55.31% of the sequences and 36.42% of the OTUs) was the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes (8.54% of the sequences and 9.15% of the OTUs), Chloroflexi (4.64% of the sequences and 7.24% of the OTUs), Acidobacteria (3.83% of the sequences and 5.25% of the OTUs), Nitrospirae (3.68% of the sequences and 1.83% of the OTUs), Gemmatimonadetes (2.40% of the sequences and 2.21% of the OTUs), Verrucomicrobia (2.39% of the sequences and 3.72% of the OTUs), Firmicutes (2.14% of the sequences and 2.79% of the OTUs), Planctomycetes (1.86% of the sequences and 7.06% of the OTUs), Ignavibacteriae (1.38% of the sequences and 1.16% of the OTUs), Latescibacteria (1.19% of the sequences and 2.29% of the OTUs), and Actinobacteria (1.06% of the sequences and 1.61% of the OTUs) (
