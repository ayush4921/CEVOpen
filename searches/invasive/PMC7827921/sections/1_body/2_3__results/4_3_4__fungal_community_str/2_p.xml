<p>The LEfSe analysis showed the abundance of some taxa differed among the SC, TC, and MC samples, respectively (LDA &gt; 3.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). When comparing the MC and TC communities, we found that only the class Eurotiomycetes, order Eurotiales and Ophiostomatales, family Trichocomaceae and Ophiostomataceae, genus 
 <italic>Sporothrix</italic> and species 
 <italic>Sporothrix_sp_1_CMW9492</italic> in the TC community were significantly higher than in the MC community in the 0–15 cm soil layer; whereas only the class Saccharomycetes, order Saccharomycetales, and Dothideales, family Dothioraceae, and genus 
 <italic>Aureobasidium</italic> in the MC community were significantly higher than in the TC community in the 15–30 cm soil layer (

 <italic>Phialemonium</italic>, and species 
 <italic>Phialemonium_dimorphosporum</italic> in the TC community were significantly higher than in the SC community (

 <italic>Phialemonium_dimorphosporum</italic>, 
 <italic>Devriesia_strelitziae</italic> and

 <italic>Phialemonium</italic>, and species
