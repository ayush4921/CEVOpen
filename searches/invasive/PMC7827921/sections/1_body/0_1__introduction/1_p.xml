<p>Mangroves are one of the most important ecosystems in tropical and subtropical coastal wetlands, and they play an important role in maintaining high productivity and biodiversity and providing stable habitats for organisms [

Due to the impact of a large number of human activities in recent years (e.g., emission of nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich wastewater, pollution of organic and heavy metals, over-harvesting of mangrove resources, and invasion of exotic species, etc.), mangrove ecosystem services and their values are facing serious threats [

 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and mangroves are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The invasion of exotic plants not only modifies coastal hydrology and geomorphology of the mangrove ecosystem, increases fire hazard by increasing fuel load, alters light regimes, soil fertility, nutrient fluxes and biogeochemical cycles, particularly ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, but also causes significant changes in the mangrove plants and animals community structure, diversity, and abundance [
