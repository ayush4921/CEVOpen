<p>The CTAB/SDS method was used to extract total DNA from each soil sample by a PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the same sample was extracted three times in total. The NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer was used to detect the purity of the sample, and the Qubit v. 2.0 Flurometer was used to detect the concentration of the DNA sample, and 1% agarose gels was used to detect whether the DNA sample was degraded and contained impurities. A fragment covering the V3 + V4 region in the 16S rDNA gene and a fragment covering the ITS1 region in the ITS rDNA gene were selected to construct bacterial and fungal community libraries. In the 16S rDNA gene region, the primer 341F (5′-CCTACGGG NGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGT ATCTAATCC-3′) amplify the V3 + V4 region, and the BITS (5′-ACC TGCGGARGGATCA-3′) and B58S3 (5′-GAGATCCRTTGYTRAAAGTT-3′) primers amplify in the ITS1 region [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions were carried out in 30 μL reactions with 15 μL of Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs), 0.2 μM of forward and reverse primers, and about 10 ng template DNA. Reaction conditions consisted of an initial 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min.
