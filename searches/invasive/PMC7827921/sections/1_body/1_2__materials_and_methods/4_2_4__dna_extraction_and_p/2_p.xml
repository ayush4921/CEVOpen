<p>PCR products were mixed in equidensity ratios. Then, the mixture PCR products were purified with GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using NEB Next Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) following manufacturerâ€™s recommendations and index codes were added. The library quality was assessed on the Qubit@ v. 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Finally, the library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 using the 250 paired-end protocol.</p>
