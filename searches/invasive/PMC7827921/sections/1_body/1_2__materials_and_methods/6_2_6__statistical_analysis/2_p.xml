<p>Tax4Fun analysis was used to assess the bacterial community potential function by R (v. 4.0.3) [
 <xref rid="B48-microorganisms-09-00138" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which contains six functional groups, including Metabolism, Environmental Information Processing, Genetic Information Processing, Cellular Processes, Human Diseases, and Organismal Systems. In each group, the potential function was further assigned to a second level with more subgroups. FUNGuild analysis was used to assess the fungal community potential function (

The analysis then further subdivided them into 12 sub-categories: Animal Pathogens, Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi, Ectomycorrhizal Fungi, Ericoid Mycorrhizal Fungi, Foliar Endophytes, Lichenicolous Fungi, Lichenized Fungi, Mycoparasites, Plant Pathogens, Undefined Root Endophytes, Undefined Saprotrophs, and Wood Saprotrophs. It also includes three types of fungi with special morphology: Yeast, Facultative yeast, and Thallus [
