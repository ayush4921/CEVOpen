Similarly, we observed that native plants displayed significantly lower AM fungal colonization of their roots when planted in the invaded field soil (39.5% decrease, data not shown) as well as the soil trained by black mustard (49.2% decrease, data not shown). Finally, it was previously shown that there is a phytochemical basis to black mustardâ€™s antifungal effects [
