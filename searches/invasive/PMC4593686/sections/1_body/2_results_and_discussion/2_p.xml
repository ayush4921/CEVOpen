<p>Our results clearly demonstrated a consistent negative impact of black mustard on the mycorrhizas of local native plants at the various sites, mainly through phytochemical inhibition. In study 1, we found that all native plant species in the field were colonized by AM fungi. By contrast, we did not detect any colonization of roots by AM fungi in black mustard (
