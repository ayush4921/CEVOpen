<p>These results show that degradation of the mycorrhizal symbiosis by black mustard is of general significance, and may be highly problematic considering the large range that it has occupied in open fields across North America. This also points to the possibility of an overall strategy by members of the Family Brassicaceae, although clearly we need to study additional species before making any broader conclusions. This Family is one of the 10 most economically important plant Families in North America that are widely used in agriculture as sources of oil (e.g. 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, 
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> and 
 <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> as sources of canola and industrial oil), vegetables (e.g. cole-crops (
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>), swede or rutabaga (
 <italic>B. napus</italic>), turnip (
 <italic>B. rapa</italic>), radish (
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic>)), mustard condiments and fodder [

However, consequences of these intensive cultivations on the abundance and composition of local AM fungi as well as the growth rate of local mycorrhizal-dependent native plants and biological diversity in native communities is not clear. In addition, such intensive cultivation may exacerbate invasion by members of the Brassicaceae, which consequently may cause an inevitable change on the activity of soil microorganisms, nutrient cycling and plantâ€“insect interactions. There is a need for additional research for more informed agricultural decisions over large spatial scales to avoid potential negative impacts of members of the Brassicaceae on native plant communities.
