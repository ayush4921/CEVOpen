<p>Invasive exotic plants may negatively impact the structure and functioning of communities and ecosystems via a number of mechanisms [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One mechanism is the degradation of local mycorrhizal fungi that form symbioses with many native plants [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Many plants depend on this symbiosis for nutrient acquisition and pathogen protection [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been suggested that many invasive plants may negatively impact the symbiosis [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as they are often less mycorrhizal-dependent than their native neighbours. Examples of such invaders in North America are 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (garlic mustard) and 
 <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (black mustard), both non-mycorrhizal plants in the Family Brassicaceae [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Garlic mustard is abundant in forest edges and closed-canopy forest understory in eastern North America, while the black mustard is more widespread and grows in fields and open areas across all of North America [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that these exotic invasive plants may disrupt mycorrhizal associations by producing secondary compounds that directly affect mycorrhizal fungal spore germination, growth and infectivity potential, and hence indirectly impact the growth of native flora that depend on the symbiosis for their growth [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it is not shown if such effects are widespread across the naturalized range. In this study, we have focused on black mustard and conducted a series of comparative field studies at 10 different locations across North America, as well as in the greenhouse. We investigated the effect of black mustard on local arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and growth of local native plants across a variety of locations, where black mustard has invaded.
