<p>The objective of study 2 was to determine whether a local history of black mustard is associated with reduced mycorrhizal colonization and growth in native plants. Soils were collected from the invaded and uninvaded areas at each location (see study 1 above), brought to the laboratory and screened to remove coarse roots and debris. Two soil treatments were prepared: (i) soil with a history of black mustard, and (ii) soil without a history of black mustard. Eight-inch pots were filled with one of the two soil types. For each soil type, we grew single seedlings of each of the 10 native plants. Each native plant species was replicated 10 times, and thus 100 pots for each soil type. In this study, the experimental unit (replicate) was considered to be the plant species (
 <italic>n</italic>=10 for each soil type). Any replication within plant species for each soil type was considered to be a subsample, and thus not a true replicate. Pots were randomly placed on a greenhouse bench. After five months of growth, shoots and roots were harvested, dried at 60
 <sup>°</sup>C for 72 h, and weighed to determine their biomass. An approximately 2 g subsample of roots from each seedling was extracted, stained with Chlorazol Black E and analysed for per cent mycorrhizal colonization by AM fungi [
