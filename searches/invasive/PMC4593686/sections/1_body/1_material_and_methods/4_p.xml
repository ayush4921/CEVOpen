<p>The objective of study 3 was to repeat study 2, but to more explicitly test whether any variation in mycorrhizal colonization and growth in native plants 
 <italic>is caused by</italic> the presence of black mustard. Using eight-inch pots under greenhouse conditions, two treatments (
 <italic>n</italic>=10) were prepared: (i) soils previously trained with one of the native plants, and (ii) soils previously trained with black mustard. Pre-germinated seedlings of each native species were planted in each of these two treatments. After five months of growth, plants were harvested, biomass was determined and roots were assessed for mycorrhizal colonization as in study 2.
