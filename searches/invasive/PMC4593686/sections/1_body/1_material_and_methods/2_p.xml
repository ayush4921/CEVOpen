<p>The objective of study 1 was to determine whether the roots of field-collected black mustard and native plants were colonized by AM fungi. This was done at 10 different locations across the USA. The locations included Kingman, AZ (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Heterotheca subaxillaris</italic> Lam.), San Diego, CA (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Encelia farinosa</italic> A. Gray), Chicago, IL (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Symphyotrichum novae-angliae</italic> L.), Detroit, MI (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Symphyotrichum oolentangiense</italic> Riddell), Socorro, NM (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Aster laevis</italic> L.), Buffalo, NY (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Erigeron strigosus</italic> Muhl), Dayton, OH (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Solidago altissima</italic> L.), Newport, OR (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Symphyotrichum ascendens</italic> Lindl), Richmond, VA (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Chrysopsis mariana</italic> L.) and Seattle, WA (native plant tested: 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L.). We found black mustard invasions at each of the 10 sites. For each of the plant species, we sampled when the target species comprised more than 90% of the individuals shoots within a 5×5 m plot. Roots were collected from 10 randomly chosen individuals of each species, separated from the soil, stained with Chlorazol Black E and analysed for per cent mycorrhizal colonization by AM fungi [

 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> bioassay as described by Klironomos 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
