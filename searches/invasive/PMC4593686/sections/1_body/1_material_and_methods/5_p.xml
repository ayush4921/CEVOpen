<p>The objective of study 4 was to determine whether black mustard produces antifungal compounds that negatively affect mycorrhizal fungal growth. For this objective, root extracts (soaking the roots in distilled water for 48â€‰h) were prepared from the following plant species: (i) 
 <italic>B. nigra</italic>, (ii) 
 <italic>H. subaxillaris</italic>, (iii) 
 <italic>En. farinosa</italic>, (iv) 
 <italic>Sy. novae-angliae</italic>, (v) 
 <italic>Sy. oolentangiense</italic>, (vi) 
 <italic>As. laevis</italic>, (vii) 
 <italic>Er. strigosus</italic>, (viii) 
 <italic>So. altissima</italic>, (ix) 
 <italic>Sy. ascendens</italic>, (x) 
 <italic>C. mariana</italic> and (xi) 
 <italic>Ac. millefolium</italic>. We tested the effect of the above plant root extracts (11 treatments) on the spore germination of a common AM fungus, 
 <italic>Rhizophagus irregulare</italic> using microcosms in the laboratory as described in Stinson 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS150300C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A water control was also included to give 12 treatments.
