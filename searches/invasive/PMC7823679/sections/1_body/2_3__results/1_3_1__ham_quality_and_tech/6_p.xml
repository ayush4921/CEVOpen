<p>The sex of the pigs generated differences for the lean % of green hams (

The higher lean % of green hams from females caused higher weight losses during salting, and higher values of salt content at the end of salting (2.60%) if compared to barrows (2.53%). As for the salt content at the end of salting, the interaction between processing plant and sex was significant (
