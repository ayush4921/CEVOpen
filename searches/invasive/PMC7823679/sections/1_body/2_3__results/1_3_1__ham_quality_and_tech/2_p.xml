<p>The class R, corresponding to an estimated lean % of the carcass in the range 45 to 50% is the most abundant (n = 110) compared to classes O (lean % = 40 to 45%, n = 36) and U (lean %= 50 to 55%, n = 62). In the current study, the lean % of the hams scanned by Ham Inspector
 <sup>TM</sup> shows higher values (R = 62.3 ± 2.7, U = 63.0 ± 2.0, O = 61.6 ± 2.2) than those estimated from the EUROP classification of the corresponding whole carcass.
