<p>The results of the Pearson’s correlation analysis performed between ham traits measured in each processing plant are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Tables S2–S4</xref>. The strongest and most significant correlations were found in plant 2 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S3</xref>): pH was negatively correlated with salt content measured at the first salting step (r = −0.241, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and the weight loss at the end of salting (r = −0.388, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The weight of green hams was negatively correlated with salt content after the first salting in all tested processing plants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Tables S2–S4</xref>), whereas, only for plant 2, the negative correlation coefficient with salt content at the end of the salting process was significant (r = −0.486, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S3</xref>). For all processing plants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Tables S2–S4</xref>), the lean % of green hams was positively related to ham weight losses and to the salt contents predicted after the first and at the end of the salting steps. In each processing plant, the highest positive correlation coefficients have been found between green ham weight and ham weight after the first salting (plant 1: r = 0.999, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; plant 2 r = 0.999, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; plant 3 r = 0.998, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), green ham weight and ham weight at the end of salting (plant 1: r = 0.997, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; plant 2 r = 0.999, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; plant 3 r = 0.996, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and between ham weight after first and at the end of salting (plant 1: r = 0.997, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; plant 2 r = 0.999, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; plant 3 r = 0.999, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
