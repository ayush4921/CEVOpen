<p>Differences in the measured ham traits between processing plants (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were detected. In particular, processing plant 1 handles the heaviest hams between the tested plants (15.1 kg), and hams leaner (62.7%) than plant 3 (60.6%). This condition affects salting weight losses, yielding higher values at the end of salting for plant 1 compared to other plants. The salt % predicted in ham lean content after both salting steps differed significantly between processing plants (
