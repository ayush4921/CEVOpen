<p>The performed GWAS allowed the identification of eight markers displaying a Bonferroni corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-value significant at the chromosome-wide level, reported in bold in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00068-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The most significant association was found for pHu, which is linked to WU_10.2_18_17949287 marker. This SNP is an intergenic variant located at 17 Mb on 
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> chromosome 18 (SSC18). Green ham lean % showed an association with a region on SSC4 at 2 Mb, where the marker ASGA0016987 is located. This SNP is an exon variant of a non-coding transcript (ENSSSCT00000066959.1), and most of the genes comprised in the flanking region are non-coding genes. Green ham weight, ham weight after first salting, and ham weight at the end of the salting showed an association with the same two markers, namely CASI0010463 and WU_10.2_14_144250775. The first is located on SSC15 at 12 Mb, in an intron of the gene 
 <italic>Neurexophilin 2</italic> (
 <italic>NXPH2</italic>). WU_10.2_14_144250775 is an intergenic variant in a region characterized by high gene density, on SSC14 at 132 Mb. Two SNPs were significant for ham weight loss after first salting: ASGA0031014, an intron variant of the gene 
 <italic>Neural Precursor Cell Expressed, Developmentally Down-Regulated 9</italic> (
 <italic>NEDD9</italic>), and WU_10.2_10_74620421, a variant in a non-coding transcript on SSC10. Salt content at the end of salting showed two markers displaying a chromosome-wide significant association. The first (INRA0000796) is located on SSC1 at 13 Mb, and is an intron variant of the gene 
 <italic>Regulator of G Protein Signaling 17</italic> (
 <italic>RGS17</italic>); the second (ASGA0102337) is an intron variant of the gene 
 <italic>GRAM Domain Containing 1B</italic> (
 <italic>GRAMD1B</italic>), located on SSC9 at 50 Mb. Eleven markers showed less significant associations with the ham traits, with adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-values comprised between the chromosome-wide significance level and the threshold of 5.00 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> (
 <xref rid="animals-11-00068-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The complete lists of the top 20 markers most associated with the measured traits are reported in File S1. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S5</xref> reports the complete list of all the genes located in the regions flanking the markers reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00068-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results of the functional association obtained for the genes in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S5</xref> are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S6</xref>. No significant terms were identified, and none of them seemed to indicate a direct involvement of the candidate genes in muscle or fat development. Thus, further discussion of the obtained associations was based on the review of the scientific literature.
