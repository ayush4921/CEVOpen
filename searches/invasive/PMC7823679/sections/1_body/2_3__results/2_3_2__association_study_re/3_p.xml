<p>The results obtained with MEME Suite indicated that none of the identified intronic variants were located in splice sites, but the marker ASGA0031014 fell into an intronic region of the gene 
 <italic>Neural Precursor Cell Expressed, Developmentally Down-Regulated 9</italic> (
 <italic>NEDD9</italic>) harboring several binding sites recognized by 
 <italic>Forkhead box O</italic> (
 <italic>FOXO</italic>) transcription factors (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S7</xref>). The in-silico analysis indicated that the mutation ASGA0031014 changed the sequence recognized by 
 <italic>FOXO3</italic> (
 <italic>q</italic>-value = 0.050; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Figure S1a</xref>), 
 <italic>FOXO1</italic> (
 <italic>q</italic>-value = 0.074; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Figure S1b</xref>), and 
 <italic>FOXO4</italic> (
 <italic>q</italic>-value = 0.074; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Figure S1c</xref>). The sequences recognized by these transcription factors are the reverse complement of the region flanking ASGA0031014, since the 
 <italic>NEDD9</italic> gene is located on the reverse strand (strand âˆ’1 in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Table S5</xref>). For this reason, ASGA0031014 has T/C as alternate alleles in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-11-00068">Figure S1</xref>.
