<p>For each of the found markers, the LSM of the genotypes were estimated and reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00068-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. For pHu, both markers showed genotype distributions quite unbalanced, with GG genotype poorly represented (WU_10.2_18_17949287) or not represented at all (WU_10.2_4_91195648) in our sample. Other identified markers showed a genotypic class poorly represented (
 <italic>n</italic> &lt; 10 animals, i.e., ASGA0016987, ALGA0002237, CASI0010463, WU_10.2_7_118557013) or completely lacking (ALGA0044906, INRA0000796). The weights of fresh thighs and hams after first and at the end of salting were associated with the same markers, namely CASI0010463 and WU_10.2_14_144250775. Furthermore, the marker ASGA0026341 showed an additive genetic effect on both ham weights after first salting and at the end of salting. In fact, the AA animals for this marker showed lower ham weights than GG pigs (

 <xref rid="animals-11-00068-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In particular, the AA animals for the H3GA0000815 SNP were associated with a lower lean % in green hams; the A allele of WU_10.2_7_118557013 was related to higher weights at the end of salting; the G allele of ASGA0031014 showed lower weight losses, and the GG animals for the WU_10.2_14_36295226 SNP presented a higher % of salt adsorbed at first salting. Concerning the ASGA0031014 marker, the three genotypic classes were well represented, following the 1:2:1 ratio.
