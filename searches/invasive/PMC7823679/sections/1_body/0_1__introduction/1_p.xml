<p>The production of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) Parma and San Daniele hams plays an economic role of primary importance in the Italian pig production chain [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and represents a point of excellence for the Italian pork chain. The quality of the raw meat and the carcass composition greatly influence both the suitability of the thighs to obtain high-quality PDO dry-cured hams such as Parma and San Daniele [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The fresh thighs used for the production of PDO Parma hams are obtained from heavy pigs slaughtered at a live weight of at least 140 to160 kg, with an age of at least nine months, and belonging to specific selected breeds defined by Parma ham Consortium [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These requirements are essential for obtaining hind legs with features suitable for long curing periods; additional required parameters of the thighs are the presence of subcutaneous fat of 15 to 30 mm of thickness to minimize processing losses [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These features affect both the aptitude of meat to adsorb salt during the ham salting periods and the weight loss of the ham after salting during the long maturation, which may last from 12 to 24 or more months [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, over time, extensive analytical surveys were carried out to determine the contribution of this food to sodium intake, and medical and public health organizations recommended to reduce sodium dietary intake to prevent hypertension and other diseases [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the amount of adsorbed salt can worsen the technological performances, causing an increase in proteolysis, higher softness, and the production of off-flavors due to the release of free amino acids and peptides during ripening [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The research on environmental and genetic factors involved in salt adsorption and in the sodium amount of dry-cured ham has attracted great interest based on these contrasting nutritional and technological requirements behind the issue of sodium reduction. Several factors contribute to influencing the final salt amount in dry-cured hams; among them, a crucial role is represented by the know-how of the different ham processors [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The ham weight and size, the inter- and intramuscular fat content, the thickness of subcutaneous fat, and the lean meat content of the hind leg represent the main factors that can influence also the aptitude of the ham to adsorb salt [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The study and identification of genes and genetic markers associated with these traits could provide new and important tools for the ham industry for improving ham yield during processing. Also the physico-chemical modifications of thigh muscles post-mortem, such as pH decline, water activity, proteolytic and lipolytic reactions, produce changes in color, taste, flavor, texture [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and salt absorption in the hams [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These traits are affected, at least in part, by the animal genetic background as reported by studies indicating genetic markers associated with 
 <italic>Semimembranosus</italic> muscle (SM) pH and drip loss [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and with enzymes activity in San Daniele hams [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most of these association studies have been performed on the purebred pig lines used in the two-way or three-way crossbreeding schemes [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but few association studies exist between genetic markers and ham ripening related traits measured directly in heavy pigs used for dry-cured ham production. Moreover, the genetic improvement of quality traits of dry-cured hams is difficult because these characteristics cannot be easily measured in live animals and are cost-effective phenotypes.
