<p>In recent years, different non-invasive technologies based on X-rays or near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy were investigated as quality control techniques in the ham industry [

Thus, the identification of genetic markers and new tools to assess and help to predict these traits may be of primary importance for pig production chain and ham processors [
