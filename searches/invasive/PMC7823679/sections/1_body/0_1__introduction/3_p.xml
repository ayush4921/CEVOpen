<p>This work aims to investigate the variability of green ham traits in a sample of 229 commercial hybrid heavy pigs during salting and the genomic regions associated with the measured phenotypes. These regions will be singled out through a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), which will allow identifying DNA markers and candidate genes associated with phenotypic characteristics of the fresh hams measured during the first stages of the ham processing. The identified SNPs might be of interest to improve ham yield after salting and the quality of the finished product. The identification of genetic markers associated with the quality of the thighs for PDO dry-cured hams can offer new helpful tools for the highly innovative pig production chain.</p>
