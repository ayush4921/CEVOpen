<p>All statistics of phenotypic traits were obtained by SPSS version 22.0 software platform (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA); normal distribution of data was investigated before statistical analyses. The boxplot procedure was applied to present the distribution of measured lean percentage of hams, differently labeled according to the EUROP grid (lean carcass grading). Data of ham traits were analyzed using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) procedure; the models included the processing plant and the sex of the pigs respectively, as fixed factors. These factors were included in the model since they are known to affect ham quality [

Finally, the Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between all quality and technological traits of hams in each processing plant.
