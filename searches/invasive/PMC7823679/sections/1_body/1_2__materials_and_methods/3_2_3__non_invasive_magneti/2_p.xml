<p>Two hundred and twenty-nine fresh hams were scanned with the MI system set in the “RAW” mode, installed at each plant. The lean amount expressed as a percentage of ham weight was estimated by using previously developed predictive models reported in Simoncini et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This model was improved, including a greater number of dissected and analyzed hams, and estimating the new prediction accuracy (RMSE = 1.34%). After the first salting and at the end of the salting steps, the unabsorbed salt was brushed away, and the same salted hams were scanned with the MI system set in the “salted” mode. The salt content of the lean part, expressed as a percentage on a wet basis, was estimated by using a previously developed predictive model, in accordance with Schivazappa et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Prediction accuracy of the model including a greater number of dissected and analyzed salted hams was estimated (RMSE = 0.14%).
