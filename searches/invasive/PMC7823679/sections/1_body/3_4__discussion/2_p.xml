<p>With the aim of finding genomic regions and candidate genes associated with the green ham weight, lean %, salting losses, and contents of adsorbed salt, we used sex and slaughter day (and thus also the ham processing plant) as fixed effects in the GWAS model. GWAS indicated eight markers significant at the chromosome-wide level, and eleven with a Pc1df below the threshold of 5.00 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>. The most significant association was found between pHu and the WU_10.2_18_17949287 marker, which is located in an intergenic region of SSC18, harboring the genes 
 <italic>Plexin A4</italic> (
 <italic>PLXNA4</italic>), and 
 <italic>Muskelin 1</italic> (
 <italic>MKLN1</italic>). This association signal with the 
 <italic>PLXNA4</italic> region could support the findings reported by Bordbar et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in Simmental beef cattle. These authors found that the bovine 
 <italic>PLXNA4</italic> gene harbored 18 SNPs significantly associated with muscle development in the Simmental breed. Despite this strong association, no clear biologic evidence supporting the 
 <italic>PLXNA4</italic> role in bovine muscle development was found [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The pHu variability was also found associated with the WU_10.2_4_91195648 marker, on SSC4. Anyway, both WU_10.2_18_17949287 and WU_10.2_4_91195648 markers showed unbalanced genotype distributions, which may have biased the association results, causing an overestimation of the marker effects.
