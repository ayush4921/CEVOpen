<p>Thigh lean % was associated with the marker H3GA0000815 located in an intronic region of the gene 
 <italic>T-Cell Lymphoma Invasion And Metastasis 2</italic> (
 <italic>TIAM2</italic>). Among the identified associations, the H3GA0000815 marker showed the clearest additive effect, with the GG animals showing a higher lean % than those with the AA genotype. The lower frequency observed for the GG genotype in our samples suggests that the favorable allele G may be used in selection schemes to increase lean mass deposition in the pig breeds used for the production of PDO hams. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>TIAM2</italic> gene was found in a previous study to be located in a region displaying a selective signature in a Duroc pig population [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor with a role in intracellular signal transduction and in the regulation of cell migration and cell focal adhesions [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Cell migration and focal adhesions are essential steps in organogenesis, and also muscle development is known to involve a series of morphogenetic events including cell fusion, migration, and epidermal attachment [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Despite the fact that this result seems to agree with a previous study [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], to date, it is not possible to draw a clear hypothesis linking this gene with thigh lean % as the knowledge of the 
 <italic>TIAM2</italic> gene and its roles in pig muscle development is still mostly unknown.
