<p>The development of new technologies enabling a fast and non-invasive measure of green ham potential to be processed into typical dry-cured ham is a goal for pig production chain and PDO ham producers. In the last decade, technologies such as those based on X-rays have been studied [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with the aim of monitoring and gathering information in a non-invasive way on green hams intended for dry curing, focusing on their qualitative traits and the amount of salt absorbed during processing. The Ham Inspector
 <sup>TM</sup> system permits an on-line and non-invasive inspection of the hams, a classification of thighs based on the lean content (calculated as a percentage of green ham weight), and an estimation of salt amount adsorbed in the lean part during the salting stages. The use of Ham Inspector
 <sup>TM</sup> in three processing plants qualified for the production of PDO Parma ham provided the phenotypic data and information to perform the GWAS. At present, green hams allowed to be processed into PDO Parma hams are those labeled as U, R, and O according to the EUROP grid, with a few specific exceptions [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the current study, a high variability in ham lean % within U, R, and O classes was detected. In particular, the thigh lean % estimated from Ham Inspector
 <sup>TM</sup> was higher than the lean % of the corresponding carcasses estimated from EUROP grading. Thus, the thigh lean % given by Ham Inspector
 <sup>TM</sup> and the carcass lean % obtained from EUROP grading provide different information. This is anyway expected, because ham is a lean cut, with a higher lean % than that of the corresponding EUROP carcass class. The measures estimated by Ham Inspector
 <sup>TM</sup> about the lean-to-fat ratio of each thigh proved to be crucial to homogenously group hams during processing [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Processing plants showed differences for all the measured phenotypes, except for ham weight loss after the first salting. This result must be carefully evaluated as the on-field conditions of the present study did not permit to distinguish the specific effect of the processing plant, which included also the effects of the pig genetic type, farm management, and abattoir. Thus, the effect of the processing plant may be overestimated in the present study. The effect of the lean amount of green hams on the processing weight losses is underlined by the positive and significant correlation coefficients displayed in the three plants. This is in line with previous findings: weight losses are indeed known to be greater in hams obtained from animals with greater lean %, whereas the presence of inter, intramuscular and covering fat, containing less water than muscular tissue, is associated with a reduction of weight losses [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As can be expected, the lean % of green hams was strongly related to salt content after the first salting period and at the end of salting: this behavior is related to the higher salt and water diffusion coefficients of Fickâ€™s law in lean hams than in the fat ones [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Currently, the variability detected in the phenotypic traits of processed ham as a consequence of the differences in raw matter and in the production plants remains in full compliance with the tutelary guidelines of Parma hams [
