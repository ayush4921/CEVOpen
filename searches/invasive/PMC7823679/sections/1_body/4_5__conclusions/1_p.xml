<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study describing significant associations between porcine candidate genes and ham traits, measured in a non-invasive way using a Magnetic Induction System. This on-line and non-invasive technology allows the estimation of green ham lean % and the salt content in the salted ones, on a great number of hams during processing. The GWAS identified several markers associated with the measured traits, and SNPs in candidate genes related to the neuromuscular junction, and muscle development during embryonic stages were found associated with lean % and ham weights. Among the markers associated with ham traits, the marker located in 
 <italic>NEDD9</italic> could be of particular interest for further studies and for implementing selection schemes aimed at improving ham yields after the salting steps. Further studies including a greater number of hams and different processing conditions are needed to strengthen the investigated associations.
