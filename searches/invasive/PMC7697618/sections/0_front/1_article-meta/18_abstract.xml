  <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> L. is an expansive perennial that forms persistent, species-poor plant communities. It often spreads in fallow areas, displacing native floristic ingredients. Its expansiveness is largely due to morphological features, but it can also be the effect of allelopathic interaction. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effect of aqueous extracts (decoction, infusion, and maceration) from dry 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves on germination and early growth stages of 
  <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> L. var. 
  <italic>radicula</italic> Pers., in three cultivars: ‘Rowa’, ‘Półdługa’, and ‘Krakowianka’. In comparison to the control, the percentage of germinated radish seeds of ‘Rowa’ cultivar was statistically lower on the infusion and macerate. Regardless of the cultivar, the smallest changes in germination were found in seeds watered with decoction, and the largest with macerate. Seedlings length was most inhibited on macerate substrates, and least with infusion. Regardless of the form of the extract, each of them negatively affected the initial growth of radish seedlings. A fresh mass of ‘Rowa’ seedlings was inhibited by all Canadian goldenrod extracts. In relation to the control, the ‘Krakowianka’ cultivar was the least sensitive to 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> extracts. The total chlorophyll content was the lowest in the seedlings of the ‘Rowa’ and ‘Półdługa’ cultivars germinated on macerate, compared to the control and two others extracts. The percentage of electrolyte leakage depended on the type of extract used and the radish cultivar. The study showed that depending on the cultivar, the aqueous extracts from 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves decreasing of germination and early growth of 
  <italic>R. sativus</italic>.
