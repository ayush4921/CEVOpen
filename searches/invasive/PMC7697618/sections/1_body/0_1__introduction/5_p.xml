 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Bearing in mind reports of allelopathic abilities of Canadian goldenrod, an attempt was made to assess this type of impact on seeds of 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>radicula</italic> Pers. in three cultivars: ‘Rowa’, ‘Półdługa’, and ‘Krakowianka’. The research used radish seeds as a model organism. Radish seeds germinate in a very short time compared to other species. They have low nutritional and environmental requirements. As part of the research hypothesis, it was assumed that aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> (in various forms: infusion, decoction and macerate) exhibit biological activity in relation to the studied radish cultivars, affecting: (1) its seed germination indexes, (2) length, fresh and dry mass of seedlings, (3) total chlorophyll content in seedlings and (4) percentage electrolytes leakage from seedling cells.
