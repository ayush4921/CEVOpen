<p>Abhilasha et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] proved that 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> releases allelochemical compounds into the soil. This invasive alien weed causes severe shifts in the microorganism community in invaded areas, e.g., the enhancement (number of nitrite bacteria, aerobic Azotobacter, sulfate reducer, ammonifier and aerobic cellulose-decomposer), as well as reduction in the growth of denitrifier anaerobic cellulose-decomposer and desulphate reducer [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Sometimes the presence of specific allelochemicals derived from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> could be suggested in tomatoes cultivation due to their inhibitory effect on tomatoes’ soilborne pathogens (i.e., 
 <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic> Trow. and 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> J.G. Kühn) [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although other authors pointed out that 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>’s effect on soil microorganisms cannot last in subsequent vegetation periods and it depends on occurring plants (i.e., plant communities). During the three years mesocosm experiment changes in measured soil enzymes (i.e., β-glucosidase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and acid phosphatase, the enzymes mediating mineralization of C, N and P, respectively) were not clear. Effecta of increased β-glucosidase activity in rgw second year were no longer visible in the third vegetation period. 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> did not affect β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, and acid phosphatase activity increased in 
 <italic>Filipendulion</italic> plant community, but decreased in 
 <italic>Molinion</italic> and 
 <italic>Magnocaricion</italic> plant communities [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, authors, based on fungal biomass content in the invaded soil (accumulated during experiment), concluded that 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> in their invasion strategy seem to follow toward pathogen-free areas as the plants fail to control their fungal pathogens in place.
