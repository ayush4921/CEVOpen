<p>On the first and second days of germination, the significantly highest germination speed (GS) of ‘Rowa’ and ‘Półdługa’ radish seeds was recorded in the control. On the third day, the lowest values of the index were recorded in all three radish cultivars on the macerate. In the following days, the GS was similar to seeds germinated on a distilled water and the decoction, regardless of the cultivar. In the case of the ‘Krakowianka’ cultivar, the highest GS for seeds watered with infusion was observed. For all radish cultivars treated with the macerate extract, a statistically significance decrease in GS values was found. On day 7, for the ‘Rowa’ and ‘Półdługa’ cultivars, the significantly highest percentage of germinated seeds was found for seeds treated with distilled water (control) and decoction. The macerate caused the complete disappearance of ‘Rowa’ cultivar germination. No radish sprouts were observed, but seeds were swollen, their seed coat was cracked in some cases. Significantly the lowest GS values for ’Półdługa’ and ’Krakowianka’ were found for seeds watered with macerate, compared to the control and the other two extracts (
