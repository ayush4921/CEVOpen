<p>Compared to the control, the germination index (GI) values changed depending on the extract used. The largest changes were noted for macerate, in all radish cultivars. The decoction extract had the smallest but still statistically negative impact on the GI for ‘Rowa’ and ‘Krakowianka’. For the ‘Rowa’ and ‘Krakowianka’, no significance coefficient of the rate of germination (CRG) differences, between the control and decoction and infusion were observed. The CRG index for ‘Półdługa‘ was the highest for seeds watered with distilled water. For all radish cultivars germinated on macerate, the lowest values of this parameter were revealed. In the case of the T50 index, for ‘Rowa’ cultivar significant inhibiting influence of all 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> aqueous extracts on the value of this parameter was demonstrated. For ‘Półdługa’, the infusion and macerate extracts decreased the T50, compared to the control. For ‘Krakowianka‘ a statistically significant differences were observed between macerate, and others extracts and distilled water. The seedling vigor index (SVI) index values for radish seedlings germinated on Petri dishes with aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> were significantly lower, compared to the control. The smallest values of this parameter were shown for seedlings watered with macerate. The ‘Półdługa’ cultivar was an exception, for which no differences between the control and the macerate were found (
