<p>The fresh mass of radish seedlings was significantly larger in the control conditions for ‘Rowa‘ and ‘Półdługa‘. For ‘Rowa‘ cultivar, each of the type extracts decreased the fresh mass values. On the macerate extracts, ‘Rowa‘ seeds was swollen and had a crack seed coat, which significantly influenced the lowering of this parameter. The fresh mass of ‘Półdługa‘ seedlings was inhibited by decoction and macerate, compared to the control. For the ‘Krakowianka‘ no statistical differences in the values of this parameter were observed. Generally, the largest inhibition of fresh mass values were revealed for radish seedlings on macerate (
