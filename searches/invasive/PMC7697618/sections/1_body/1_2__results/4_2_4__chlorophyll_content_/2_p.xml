<p>Percentage of electrolytes’ leakage in radish seedlings was the smallest in the control. Each of the aqueous extracts increased the degree of destabilization of the cell membranes of seedlings, regardless of the cultivar. The largest disturbances in water and ion management were found in seedlings of the ‘Rowa’ cultivar watered with macerate, in comparison to tested cultivars and extracts type. The ‘Rowa’ seeds on macerate, unlike the other varieties and extracts, were swollen, their seed coat was cracked in some case, hence most probably such a high% of electrolyte leakage. Compared to the control, for the ‘Rowa’ cultivar watered with decoction, no statistically significant differences were found. However, for the other two cultivars, significant differences were observed in the values of this parameter (
