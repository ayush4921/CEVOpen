<p>The emission of allelochemical substances to the soil by species of the genus 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> may pose a significant threat in the restoration of wasteland for agricultural production [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, one of the tasks in combating invasive weeds, such as goldenrod, is to clarify their adaptation to the environment, both physiologically and ecologically [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This will help to introduce effective and synthetic schemes for their elimination, forecast potential distribution areas and create a system for estimating threats to other species [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In Poland, no activities have been carried out to control and eliminate goldenrod so far. The only treatments used in the practice of controlling 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> are regular mowing, point destruction of plants by pulling or digging, as well as afforestation, which increases shading and worsens habitat conditions for goldenrod [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, further research is needed to find tolerant and susceptible crops to goldenrod to fully assess its allelopathic properties.
