<p>Differences in germination and early growth of radish seedlings in the presence of aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> showed specificity of seed responses. They depended on both the radish cultivar and the type of extract used. Essentially, macerates had the most negative effects on germination and seed growth as well as chlorophyll content and electrolyte leakage. Extracts in the form of decoction and infusion also limited these processes, but to a much lesser extent than macerate. This kind of plant structure response suggests that aqueous extracts from Canadian goldenrod dry leaves in all forms have allelopathic properties. The leaves, from mature and flowering individuals used in the experiment, had a clearly inhibitory effect on the physiology of radish seeds. According to earlier studies on allelopathy [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], this may also suggest that leaves from young plants have even greater allelopathic potential. Therefore, the hypothesis on the biological properties of Canadian goldenrod can be here clearly confirmed. 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> owes its expansion, as an invasive species, not only to clonal growth and interspecies relations [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but also to the production of allelochemical compounds that significantly affect soil microflora and other plants [
