<p>Aqueous extracts from goldenrod also decreased the chlorophyll content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01549-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Chlorophyll is one of the chemical compounds contained in plants that affects their photosynthetic activity and, consequently, the production of biomass. In chloroplasts, it is associated with specific proteins, glycolipids and sulfolipids. Its low content may be caused by inhibition of the synthesis of magnesium and iron chelate and protoporphyrinogen IX [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Observations of changes in chlorophyll content carried out here were significantly related to the type of extract used and the radish cultivar. In these measurements, the ‘Rowa’ cultivar was the most sensitive to the macerate extract. It can be assumed that the observed negative effects of using goldenrod extracts may be an effect of allelochemical compounds. Plants subjected to allelopathy stress vary in color intensity, which shows that they most likely contain less chlorophyll [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The effect of allelochemical inhibitors depends on their concentration in the extract. The reduction of chlorophyll content may be caused by its degradation or may be a consequence of the restriction of its synthesis by allelochemical substances [
