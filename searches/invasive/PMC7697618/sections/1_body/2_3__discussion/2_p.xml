<p>The consequence of the negative impact of Canadian goldenrod on the germination of radish seeds was the inhibition of the elongation growth of seedlings and a decrease in the value of fresh mass. In the case of the dry mass, a statistically significant differences was not noted for tested radish cultivars, watered with three types of extracts (
