<p>(1) After seven days, the germination speed of seeds was the highest for cultivars watered with decoction and infusion, compared to the control. The macerate caused the complete disappearance of ‘Rowa’ germination. On the 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> decoction radish seeds germinated better than on macerate extracts (most similar to the natural source of allelochemical compounds from dead organic debris). The values of germination indexes differed depending on the cultivar. The macerate extract showed a significant reduction in the value of germination indexes for all radish cultivars, in relation to the control. (2) The longest seedlings among all radish cultivars, grown on distilled water, were observed. The most inhibiting properties had a macerate. Regardless of the form of leaves extracts, each of them inhibited the elongation of seedlings of three radish cultivars, in comparison to the control group. The fresh mass of ‘Rowa’ seedlings were significant reduced by each of the 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> extracts. The dry mass for all radish cultivars by 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> extracts was not differ significantly, compared to the control values. (3) The all aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves, for ‘Rowa’ and ‘Krakowianka‘ cultivars, reduced the chlorophyll content. (4) Compared to the control, with the ‘Rowa’ cultivar the highest electrolyte leakage on macerate from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves was revealed. All extracts caused an increase the electrolyte leakage in three cultivars of radish seedlings. The exception was the ‘Rowa’ cultivar treated to decoction, which no statistically significant differences were found in the destabilization of cell membranes.
