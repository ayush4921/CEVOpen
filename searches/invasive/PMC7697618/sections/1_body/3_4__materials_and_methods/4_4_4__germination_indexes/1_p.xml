<p>The germination capacity of seeds were checked every day (by 7 days). After this time, the following germination indexes were determined: a germination rate (GR), and germination speed (GS) [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], seedling vigor index (SVI) [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], coefficient of the rate of germination (CRG) [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], time required for 50% germination (T50) [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. 
 <disp-formula>GR = (number of germinated seeds/total number of seeds) × 100,

 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>GS = ((GT × D)/(GC × D)) × 100,
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where: GT is the number of germinated seeds daily in the treatment, GC is the number of germinated seeds daily in the control, and D is the number of corresponding days. 
 <disp-formula>SVI = (seedling length (cm) × percentage of germinated seeds)/100,

 <disp-formula>CRG = ((n1 + n2 + nn)/((n1 × T1) + (n2 × T2) + (n3 × T3) + …)) × 100,

 </disp-formula> where: n1 = number of germinated seeds on time T1; n2 = number of germinated seeds on time T2; n3 = number of germinated seeds on timeT3. 
 <disp-formula>T50 = ti + ((N/2) − nj) × (ti − tj))/(ni − nj),

 </disp-formula> where: N is the final number of germination and ni, nj cumulative numbers of seeds germinated by adjacent counts at times ti and tj when ni &lt; N/2 &lt; nj.
