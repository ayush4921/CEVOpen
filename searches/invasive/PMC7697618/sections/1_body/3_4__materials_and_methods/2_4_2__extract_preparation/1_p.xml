<p>The dried Canadian goldenrod leaves were ground mechanically in a mill (Braun, 4045 type, Germany), and then aqueous extracts in the form of decoction, infusion and macerate were prepared, according to Tyszyńska-Kownacka and Starek [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The infusion was prepared from 5 g of dry and crushed 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves, which were flooded over with 250 mL of boiling distilled water and left covered for 30 min. After cooling, the extract was filtered through Whatman filter papers. The decoction was prepared from 8.75 g of dry plant material poured with a 1 liter of cold distilled water. The solution was mixed and left for 24 h in the dark, at 20–25 °C temperature. Then, the extract was boiled for 15 min and filtered. A macerated extract was prepared by flooding 5 g of dry leaves of 100 mL cold distilled water and left in the dark, at room temperature for 24 h. After one day, the extract was filtered the same form as infusion and decoction. The extracts were stored during the experiment at 8 °C.
