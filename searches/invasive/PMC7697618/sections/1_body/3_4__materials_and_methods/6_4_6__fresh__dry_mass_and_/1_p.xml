<p>After 7 days of germination the values of fresh and dry masses of whole seedlings (together under–and aboveground parts) were measured. Seedlings were weighted (fresh mass–FM) (Radwag WPS120, Radom, Poland) and dried (dry mass–DM) at 105 °C for 48 h in dryer (Wamed SUP 100, Warsaw, Poland). The tissue water content (% H
 <sub>2</sub>O) was determined according to the formula % H
 <sub>2</sub>O = 100 − ((DM × 100)/FM).
