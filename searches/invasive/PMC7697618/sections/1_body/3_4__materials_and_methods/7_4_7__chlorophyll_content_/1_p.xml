<p>The total chlorophyll content was measured by Chl SPAD by inserting the cotyledon into the clip of the SPAD chlorophyllometer device. It is not invasive method. The electrolyte leakage in radish seedlings was measured according to method used by Redmann et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. After 7 days of germination, single seedlings were placed in polypropylene vials with 30 mL distilled water and shaken for 3 h on a shaker (Labnet, Rocker, New Jersey, NJ, USA) to determine the electrolytes leakage from live cells (E1). The electrolytes leakage was measured by conductivity meter (type CX-701) with electrode (K = 0.92) (Elmetron, Zabrze, Poland). Then the plant material in vials was frozen at −70 °C. After 24 h the shaking procedure was repeated to the total electrolyte leakage from dead cells (E2) was measured. The percentage of electrolyte leakage (EL) was calculated according to the formula: EL = (E1/E2) 100%. The obtained percent results of electrolyte leakages from the control group of seedlings were compared to the values of seedlings germinated on the dishes with aqueous extracts.
