The harvested fresh Canadian goldenrod leaf material was sorted such that pure plant material was selected for drying. Then the leaves were placed in a single layer on sheets of filter paper and dried in the dark, in an dryer at a constant temperature of 25 °C (Wamed SUP-100, Warsaw, Poland) for 7 days. Properly dried leaves had a natural color and crumbled easily. The dried plant material was stored in a silica gel desiccator.
