<p>Seeds of radish cultivars (
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> L. cv. Rowa, Półdługa and Krakowianka) were purified in 5% sodium hypochlorite by 5 min and then washed three times with distilled water. The radish seeds (25 seeds per dish) were placed on sterile Petri dishes (ø 9 cm) with three layers of Whatman filter paper (Grade 1: 11 μm–medium flow filter paper). At the beginning of the experiment, the seeds were watered with the aqueous extracts (6 mL) in different form: decoctions, infusions, and macerate from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves. A control group was seeds watered with distilled water. Every day seeds were watered with 3 mL of extracts and distilled water (control group). The Petri dishes with seeds were placed in a growth chamber (Angelantoni Industrie, Massa Martana, Italy) at 12 h/12 h (day/night) photoperiod, at a light intensity of 200 μmol × m
 <sup>–2</sup> × s
 <sup>–1</sup>; the temperature was 25 °C/20 °C, and the relative humidity oscillated around 70–90%.
