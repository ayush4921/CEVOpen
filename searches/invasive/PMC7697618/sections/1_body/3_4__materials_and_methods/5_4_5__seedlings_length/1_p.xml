<p>Effects of aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> leaves on seedlings growth (length of under-and above ground parts) were measured by a caliper (TOPEX 31C615, Poland), with an accuracy of 0,1 cm, after 7 days of experiment. An inhibition percentage expressed as % index (IP) was measured according to formula used by Islam and Kato-Noguchi [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01549" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. 
 <disp-formula>IP = (1 − (L
  <sub>E</sub>/L

 </disp-formula> where L
 <sub>E</sub>—seedling length (cm) treated with the aqueous extract, L
 <sub>C</sub>—seedling length (cm) treated with the distilled water (control group).
