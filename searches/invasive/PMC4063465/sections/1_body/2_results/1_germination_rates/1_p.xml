<p>A significant negative correlation (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.67, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.025) was identified between germination rates and soil depth, with fewer seeds germinating in soils obtained from deeper soil core layers (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Very few seeds germinated from soil depths below 20 cm (1–2 seeds/layer), and only three seeds germinated from the 8–10 cm soil depth; therefore, these layers were not included in the analysis.
