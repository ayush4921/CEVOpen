<p>Based on 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs dating, the soil in this area was determined to have an average accretion rate of ∼0.20 cm·year
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to 5 years·cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, the pattern (i.e., a smooth, unbroken descending line) of 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs distribution indicated that the soil was relatively undisturbed.
