<p>A principle coordinate analysis (PCO) of the presence/absence allelic data grouped the samples into three clusters (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). Principal components 1, 2, and 3 accounted for 42% of the variation within the data set. The PCO analysis based on principal components 1 and 2 grouped the samples into three clusters (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(A: i, ii, and iii)). The majority of samples (20 of 30) from deep soil layers (L1-1,2,3, and L2-3) formed a cluster with half of the samples (15 of 30) from shallow soil layers (L3-1,2, and L4-3) (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(B: i)). The majority of the other samples (10 of 15) from shallow soil layers (L3-3 and L4-1) formed a distinct cluster (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(A: ii)). The remaining samples were contained within another large cluster (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(A: iii)). This cluster contained all samples from the standing population, the final five samples from the shallow soil layers (L4-2), and the remaining ten samples from the deep soil layers (L2-1,2). The PCO analysis based on principal components 1 and 3 grouped the samples into three main clusters (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(B: i, ii, and iii)) and one outlier (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(B: iv)). The majority of samples (20 of 30) from deep soil layers (L1-1,2,3, and L2-3) formed a distinct cluster (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(B: i)). Half of the samples (15 of 30) from shallow soil layers (L3-1,2 and L4-3) formed another cluster (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(B: ii)). Most other samples were contained within another large cluster (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>(B: iii)). This cluster contained all samples from the standing population, most of the other half of the samples (14 of 15) from the shallow soil layers (L3-3 and L4-1,2), and the remaining samples (10 of 30) from the deep soil layers (L2-1,2). In almost all cases, samples from the same layer in the same core clustered together.
