<p>When data were aggregated for each soil layer, it was observed that seeds germinated from deeper layers had a lower total allele count (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>l</sub>) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>), a lower percentage of polymorphic alleles (P
 <sub>pl</sub>) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>), and a lower population genetic diversity (I) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Increases in 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>l,</sub> P
 <sub>pl</sub>, and I had a significant negative correlation with soil depth (respectively:

 <sub>l,</sub> P
