<p>Private allele counts (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>p</sub>) fluctuated between 0 and 9 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>) and showed a general upward trend as depth decreased; however, the linear correlation between depth and private allele count was not significant (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.52, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.167).
