<p>An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 72% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of the total genetic variation was partitioned within soil layers and 97% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of total genetic variation was partitioned within soil cores (data not shown). This confirms that the patterns of genetic variation observed are due to differences between layers and not between cores.
