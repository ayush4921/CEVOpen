<p>The use of seedlings germinated from sequentially deeper and datable soil layers can be used to track changes in the population genetic structure of an invasive species through time. The success of this approach is likely to depend on the chosen species and location. A species with highly persistent seeds is required, as is a location with soil that has the appropriate characteristics and that can be reliably dated. Neutral genetic markers can be used effectively. An equal number of samples should be randomly selected from all soil layers.</p>
