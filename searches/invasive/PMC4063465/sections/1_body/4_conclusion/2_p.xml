<p>Changes in the pattern of variation in

 <sub>l</sub>, P
 <sub>PL</sub>, and I between deep soil, shallow soil, and the standing population indicate that existing invasive populations of 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> have arisen from an initial genetic bottleneck, followed by active gene flow from other locally occurring populations. As a result, the population allelic content has increased over time. This increase in genetic diversity may have counterbalanced any potentially fitness-reducing effects of genetic bottlenecking, thereby contributing to range expansion and, ultimately, invasive success.
