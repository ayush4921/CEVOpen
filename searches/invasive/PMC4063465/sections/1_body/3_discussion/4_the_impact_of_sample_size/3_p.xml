<p>Secondly, samples were grouped by soil core in the greenhouse, and the growth conditions may not have been uniform for all samples. These variables included shade patterns, and different proximities to ventilation and water sources for the different growth trays. Also, germination was not synchronous for all trays, instead occurring over several months. Temperature and light quality would have varied across this time period. These variables could have exerted, by chance, different selective pressures on different sets of trays. However, once again, due to the use of neutral genetic markers, selection should not have had a major influence on the allelic patterns observed. However, any possible environmental issues in the greenhouse would be minor as it was a semi-controlled environment. Regardless of future studies, the position of each sample should be assigned randomly.</p>
