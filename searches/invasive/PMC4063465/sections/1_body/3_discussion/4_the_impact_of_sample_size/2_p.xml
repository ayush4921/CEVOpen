<p>First, the sample sizes used may not have been sufficient. Fifteen individuals, across three soil cores, were selected from each layer and from the standing population. This number was used because, due to lower germination rates in deeper layers, it was the maximum number that could be harvested from all layers. Brown (
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) and Brown and Biggs (
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) proposed that sampling 10% of the individuals in a population would capture 60–70% of the alleles present. The maximum number of individuals that germinated from any layer was 77 from which fifteen (∼20%) were sampled. However, this may not represent 20% of the total population, as some viable seeds may not have germinated and the three soil cores may not have captured a large enough cross-section of the total seed bank. Therefore, experimental error cannot be completely ruled out. However, compared with the sample sizes used in many other population genetic studies, the use of fifteen individuals to evaluate the genetic structure of a single small population is not unusual (Amsellem et al. 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Wen-Kun et al. 
 <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Chun et al. 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref> and, 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, more soil cores per population and higher sample numbers would be beneficial in future studies.
