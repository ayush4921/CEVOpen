<p>To test the feasibility of using plant material derived from seed bank soil cores to track changes in population genetic structure through time, this study investigated differences in the pattern of genetic variation between 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> seeds germinated from different soil depths (dated using 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs analysis) and compared them with plants from a standing population. There was a general pattern of increasing genetic diversity in the seed bank with time, with the greatest increase relative to deeper soils occurring before the transition between lag and expansion phases. Germination rates were lower in seeds recovered from deeper soils, and total allele counts (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>l</sub>), percentage polymorphic alleles (P
 <sub>PL</sub>), and the level of genetic diversity (I) decreased with increasing depth; however, based on PCO analysis, there were no clear population structure differences between the different layers. Four main nonmutually exclusive influences, which could have contributed to the observed allelic patterns, have been identified. These influences are as follows: differences in seed mortality/viability at different depths; seed movement through the soil; sample size; environmental conditions in the growth environment; errors determining soil accretion rates; and evolutionary processes (selection, founder effect, gene flow, etc.). The evidence indicates that evolutionary processes play the most significant role in influencing the observed patterns. To explain how this conclusion was reached, and to assess the role of other factors, the various possibilities are considered sequentially and evaluated against the available evidence.
