<p>The lack of definitive population structure differences between soil layers could be explained if the ages of analogous soil layers in different cores were not uniform. The soil dates used in this study are from averages obtained from data originating from cores collected on two previous studies. The accretion rates obtained (0.204 cm·year
 <sup>−1</sup> (SD = 0.109)) were variable. If the soil depths in the different cores did not correspond to the same dates, then we would not expect to see definitive population structure differences between layers. However, samples from sequentially deeper layers from each individual core would still have been sequentially older, and changes through time could still have been observed for
