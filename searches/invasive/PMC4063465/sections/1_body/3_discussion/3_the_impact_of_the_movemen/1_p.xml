<p>It could also be argued that the observed allelic patterns were influenced by the effect of seed movement between the soil layers. If we assume that the original seed population from the deeper soil layers was lost, then the pattern of decreasing germination rates with increasing depth could be explained by the downward migration of seeds from the shallower soil layers. However, if this was the case, then there would not be a large difference in the values of

This is because, although fewer seeds would have migrated all the way down to the deeper soil layers, the seeds that did reach those layers would be a random sampling of those from the shallower soil layers and, therefore, would be genetically similar to a random sampling of seeds exhumed from the larger seed population in the shallow soil layers. It can be assumed that some movement of soil/seeds has occurred over the past 90 years, largely due to the action of earthworms (Willems and Huijsmans 
 <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), although visual observations suggest that their numbers are small at this location. This may reduce the usefulness of soil age to conclusively determine the exact age of the seeds; however, it can still be argued that, overall, deeper seeds are older. Where seeds have been sampled from layers that are widely separated, as in this study, they are likely to be representative of seeds originating from populations that are temporally separated. Based on the fact that the soil in Sraheens is largely undisturbed, and on the differences observed for

 <sub>l</sub>, P
