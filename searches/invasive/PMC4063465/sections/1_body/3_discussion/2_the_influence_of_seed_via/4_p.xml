<p>In addition, the soil conditions of the Sraheens site could contribute to the longevity of seeds. More stable temperatures and moisture levels in deeper soils can help maintain seed viability (Fenner and Thompson 
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The soil at Sraheens has a low mean annual temperature (∼10
 <bold>°</bold>C) and, due to its high water content, would be low in oxygen (Bhattarai et al. 
 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Low temperatures and reduced oxygen concentration can reduce microbial activity in the soil (Bhattarai et al. 
 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and increase seed longevity. Low temperatures and limited access to oxygen are also used to ensure low metabolic activity and delay seed aging in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Based on this evidence, it is probable that
