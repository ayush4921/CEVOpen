<p>It could be argued that higher levels of seed loss, due to either enhanced mortality or reduced viability in deeper soil, influenced the values obtained for

 <sub>l</sub>, P

However, in order for depth-related changes in seed mortality or seed viability to have a meaningful influence on the results, these changes would have to be nonrandom in nature. Given that seeds from deeper soil layers are almost certainly older, they are likely to have experienced higher rates of seed mortality/decreased seed viability than seeds in shallow cores (an assumption backed up by the negative relationship observed between germination rates and soil depth). However, unless this loss of seeds had a genetic basis, that is, certain genotypes had an enhanced viability, selecting those individuals that remained in the soil for genetic analysis would be no different than randomly selecting the same number of individuals from the original intact seed population. Furthermore, as AFLPs are neutral markers, the genetic variation observed in this study would not be linked to the fitness of the organism and, therefore, would not be affected by natural selection (Meril√§ and Crnokrak
