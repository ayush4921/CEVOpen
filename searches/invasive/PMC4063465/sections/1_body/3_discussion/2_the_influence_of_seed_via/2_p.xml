<p>To our knowledge, there has been no direct assessment of 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> seed longevity. The closest related species for which seed longevity estimates are available is 
 <italic>Gunnera magellanica</italic>. Based on burial and exhumation experiments (Arroyo et al. 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), seeds that had not germinated after 755 days' burial remained highly viable (78.5% viability). It was also concluded that 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>magellanica</italic> has the potential to produce persistent seed banks. The Gunneraceae also share some characteristics with the Fabaceae (Gonz√°lez and Bello 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), which have frequently been observed to have seeds that remain viable for 50 years or more (Becquerel 
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">1907</xref>; Turner 
 <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">1933</xref>). However, members of the same genus do not always share seed viability characteristics. For example, once exhumed, 
 <italic>Verbascum blattarai</italic> had 42% viable seeds after 100 years of burial, whereas for 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus,</italic> only 2% of seeds were viable (Kivilaan and Bandurshi 
 <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>).
