<p>The mechanisms that govern seed viability are not fully understood; however, seed longevity is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, physiological, and environmental factors (Fenner and Thompson 
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The length of time that seeds can remain viable in soil is highly variable (Thompson et al. 
 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), ranging from less than a year to over one thousand years in extremely rare cases (Thompson et al.
