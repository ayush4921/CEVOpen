<p>An examination of the relationship between percentage changes in genetic variables and the invasion curve for 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> indicates that increases in genetic diversity may be associated with a shift from the lag to the exponential growth expansion phase. Although, owing to the use of neutral genetic markers, no specific inferences can be made, this could imply that adaptive evolution, benefitting from a larger gene pool, has played a role in the expansion of this introduced species.
