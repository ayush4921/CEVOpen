<p>The general utility of the approach used in this study is not limited to AFLP analysis. If such an approach was combined with an analysis of epigenetic variation, MS-AFLP (Hazen et al. 
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), together with an analysis of gene expression and transcriptome sequencing (Fox et al. 
 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), additional information on the genetic contribution to invasive success could be acquired. Such information would make this an even more powerful tool for understanding links between genetic changes, and the establishment and range expansion of introduced plant species.
