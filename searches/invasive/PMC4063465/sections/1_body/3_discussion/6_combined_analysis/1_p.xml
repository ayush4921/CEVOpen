<p>On the basis of this assessment of the possible confounding factors associated with estimates of genetic differences in soil seed populations at varying depths, it is unlikely that seed loss, seed migration, and experimental error can explain the depth-dependent changes in

 <sub>l</sub>, P

 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) that gene flow played a major role in shaping the genetic structure of invasive populations. The study concluded that gene flow helped to counterbalance the reduction in population genetic diversity caused by founder effects and genetic drift, and potentially contributed to the populations' invasive success. The putative source population in this area had values of 97, 46%, and 0.229 for

 <sub>l</sub>, P
 <sub>PL</sub>, and I, in the deepest soil layer (62, 23% and 0.121, respectively), the subsequent increases of the values with decreasing depth, and the higher levels observed in the shallowest soil layer (124, 65% and 0.377, respectively) would be indicative of a population that had previously undergone genetic bottlenecking and subsequently experienced gene flow influenced increases in allelic content through time. The higher number of private alleles in the standing population and the trend of increasing private allele counts with decreasing depth would also be indicative of new alleles arriving through time. Finally, from the PCO analysis, individuals from the deepest soil layer were distinct from the standing population. The results from this study, therefore, support the findings of Fennell et al. (
