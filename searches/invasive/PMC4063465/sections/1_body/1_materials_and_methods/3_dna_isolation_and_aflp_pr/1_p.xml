<p>Isolation of DNA was performed following the protocol outlined by Pich and Schubert (
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). AFLP procedures (Vos et al. 
 <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) were performed following the protocol described by Liscum (
 <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) with only minor modifications, as described by Fennell et al. (
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Four primer pair combinations were used, and 182 putative loci were scored.
