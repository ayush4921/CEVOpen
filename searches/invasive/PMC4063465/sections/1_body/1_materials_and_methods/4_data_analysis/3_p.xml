<p>Principal coordinate analysis (PCO) was performed using the PCO component of PAST 1.94b (Hammer et al. 
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) to visualize the grouping of samples into clusters. For the PCO analysis, principal components were extracted from a distance matrix produced using the Jaccard (
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">1901</xref>) similarity coefficient for binary data. PCO scatter plots were computed showing the clustering of all individuals and the clustering of individuals from the soil cores only.
