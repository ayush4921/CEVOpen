<p>An analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) was performed using GENALEX 6.2 (Peakall and Smouse 
 <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Due to the dominant nature of AFLP markers, each presence/absence of a band was treated as a haploid allele with the second allele at each locus recorded as missing (Bonin et al. 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), an assumption required by GENALEX 6.2 for the AMOVA and allele frequency analyses. The partitioning of molecular variation among soil layers (ϕ
 <sub>PR</sub>), and within soil layers (ϕ
 <sub>PT</sub>), was calculated using a squared Euclidean distance matrix (9999 permutations). AMOVA was also performed within each soil core so that differences between ϕ
 <sub>PR</sub> and ϕ
 <sub>PT</sub> within soil cores could be characterized and compared.
