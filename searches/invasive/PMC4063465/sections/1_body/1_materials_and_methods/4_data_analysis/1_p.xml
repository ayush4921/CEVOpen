<p>From the 75 samples, fragments between 250 and 500 bp were scored as present (1) or absent (0) using the band-matching component of GelCompar2 3.0 (Applied Math, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) and transformed into a binary 1/0 character matrix showing the presence or absence of each fragment for each sample. Fragments with a band frequency below 5% were excluded from the analysis as they are generally considered to be artifacts (Rajagopal et al. 
 <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Fragments smaller than 250 bp were almost entirely monomorphic and formed a dense pattern; therefore, they were also excluded from the analysis (Vekemans et al. 
 <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).
