<p>The total allele count (

 <sub>l</sub>), the number of private alleles (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>p</sub>), and the percentage of polymorphic alleles (P
 <sub>pl</sub>) were calculated for each soil layer within each soil core using GENALEX 6.2. Using the distance component of GENALEX 6.2, the level of genetic diversity for each soil layer within each soil core was calculated based on the Shannon index of diversity (I) (Shannon and Weaver 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">1949</xref>). The percentage increases in

 <sub>l</sub>, P
 <sub>pl</sub>, and I relative to their values in the next deepest soil layer were calculated. The values for the individuals from the deepest soil layer (16â€“18 cm) were not included as there was no deeper soil layer for comparison.
