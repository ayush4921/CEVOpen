<p>Total 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb activity concentrations were measured via its gamma ray emission at 46.5 keV, while 
 <sup>226</sup>Ra, used to establish “supported” 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb concentrations, was determined by assuming equilibrium with its daughter nuclides, 
 <sup>214</sup>Pb (gamma emission at 351 keV) and 
 <sup>214</sup>Bi (gamma emission at 609 keV), following an appropriate equilibration period of at least 3 weeks in a sealed container. Unsupported (excess) 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb was calculated as the difference between the measured total 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and the estimated 
 <sup>226</sup>Ra content. Concentrations of 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs and 
 <sup>241</sup>Am were measured via their gamma emissions at 661.7 and 59.5 keV, respectively. Chronologies and sediment accumulation rates were established by applying the CIC and CRS hypotheses to the measured 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb excess data (Appleby and Olfield
