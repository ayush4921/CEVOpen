<p>The soil used for dating was collected prior to the present study, but from the same areas (within ∼20 m) as those used for the seed bank analysis (collected in 2010). One dating core was collected in 2002 and one in 2006. The cores, 50 cm long and 10 cm in diameter, were sealed with tape at both ends and transported back to the laboratory. After careful removal of soil from the cores, the outer ∼1 cm of soil was removed in case of contamination. The inner part of the core was then cut into 1-cm discs and air dried at approximately 35°C for at least a week. These samples were then passed through a 2-mm sieve to remove all large particles and stones. Subsamples (∼10 g) of the dried sections were then finely ground and homogenized before placing them in low background plastic counting vials prior to 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs dating. The age of the different soil depths was determined radiometrically by high-resolution gamma spectrometry using an Ortec-supplied n-type GMX Series Gamma-X HPGe coaxial photon detector (model GMX-15185) with a relative efficiency of 22.5% and a resolution of 0.546 keV and 1.69 keV (FWHM) at energies of 5.9 keV and 1.33 MeV, respectively. Energy and efficiency calibrations were established using a mixed radionuclide standard solution (SRM 4276) containing 154Eu and 155Eu, supplied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (US), a mixed radionuclide standard solution (7081/4) containing 
 <sup>241</sup>Am, 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs, and 
 <sup>60</sup>Co, supplied by CERCA Framatone ANP (France), and a 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb standard solution (S6/19/110) supplied by Amersham International (UK). Self-absorption of low-energy γ-rays within the sample was corrected for after the method of Yang and Ambats (
