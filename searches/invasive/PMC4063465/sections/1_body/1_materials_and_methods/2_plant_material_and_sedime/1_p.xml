<p>Plant material was sampled from both the standing population and from seedlings that germinated from the soil cores. Five 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> plants that were growing adjacent to each soil core were sampled by removing approximately 5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> of leaf material. Samples from aboveground were preserved on site by drying using silica gel (Environogel), following the method described by Chase and Hill (
 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Once the seedlings from the soil cores had reached a sufficient size (large enough to provide 0.06 g of dry leaf material), they were harvested and preserved using the same silica gel technique. Where five or more seedlings had germinated, five seedlings were randomly sampled from each soil depth and in each soil core, providing a total of fifteen seedlings per soil layer. Sufficient material was retrieved from soil core depths 0–2, 4–6, 12–14, and 16–18 cm.
