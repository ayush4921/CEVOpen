<p>Invasive non-native species are estimated to cost the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars every year (Pimentel 
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and are considered one of the leading threats to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity (Vila et al. 
 <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Understanding the processes involved in the establishment of non-native species and how they contribute to successful invasions is therefore important from both an economic and an ecological standpoint.
