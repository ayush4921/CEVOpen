<p>Soil seed banks play an important role in determining the structure of plant communities (Harper

 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Honnay et al. 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). A meta-analysis of studies that compared the genetic diversity contained within seed banks to that of the standing aboveground vegetation revealed generally higher allele counts in seed banks compared to the standing populations, but with comparable levels of heterozygosity and percentage polymorphic loci (Honnay et al. 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It was concluded that the difference in allele counts is primarily due to the presence of rare alleles in the seed bank, that aboveground vegetation is generally genetically similar to the seed bank, and that any genetic differences are likely to be the result of local selection. This indicates that the genetic structure of seed banks provides a good representation of the genetic structure of aboveground populations. However, research to date on the genetic structure of seed banks has been carried out on endemic species, not non-native invasive ones, and there has been little, if any, research that has used seed banks to investigate temporal variations in genetic structure of a non-native invasive population.
