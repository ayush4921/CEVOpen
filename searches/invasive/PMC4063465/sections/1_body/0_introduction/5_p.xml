<p>Since seeds in deeper soils are generally older (Thompson et al. 
 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Espinar et al. 
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), it is hypothesized that seed banks can provide the information required to examine genetic variation through time, thus providing insights into the evolutionary processes involved in forming invasive populations. To test this hypothesis, 
 <italic>Gunnera tinctoria</italic> seeds were germinated from soil obtained at varying depths at a site in Sraheens, Ireland. 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> is a native of Chile, but has become invasive in a number of countries worldwide, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Azores, the USA, and New Zealand, and it produces a persistent seed bank (Osborne et al. 
 <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Gioria and Osborne 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Further details on the biology and ecology of 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> can also be found in Gioria and Osborne (
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Historical and other evidence indicates 
 <italic>G. tinctoria</italic> has been present in the study area for more than 90 years (Fennell et al. 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gioria and Osborne 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and the negative impacts of this species are likely to be exacerbated by climate change (Fennell et al. 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The soil at this location also possesses characteristics that would limit seed movement and decomposition, and the soil layers can be reliably dated.
