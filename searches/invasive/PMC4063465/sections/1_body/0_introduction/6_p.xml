<p>Amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers (Vos et al. 
 <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) were used to investigate the influence of stochastic processes (founder effects and gene flow) on variations in genetic structure between soil layers and plants growing aboveground. This information was combined with the age profile of the soil, determined using 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs dating, and compared to the recorded changes in distribution of the species at the corresponding time intervals. Potential issues that might influence the reliability of this approach, including how representative the genetic information is of former populations, seed movement between soil layers and variations in seed mortality, dormancy and viability, are also discussed.
