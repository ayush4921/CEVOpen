<p>Recently, Chun et al. (
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) used herbarium specimens to investigate historical alterations in the genetic structure of invasive 
 <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> populations. The results suggested that current invasive populations have arisen from active gene flow and the subsequent admixture of historical populations, incorporating new alleles from multiple introductions. This study showed that including a temporal element in population genetic studies can provide useful information on the evolutionary processes involved in forming invasive populations. However, herbarium material of past populations that are amenable to genetic analyses is rarely available.
