<p>After initial colonization, a lag phase is frequently observed prior to the rapid range expansion of introduced plants (Mack 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), and it has been proposed that evolutionary processes (stochastic and adaptive) that alter the genetic structure of a population during this period could contribute to invasive success (Lee

 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Prentis et al. 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Fennell et al. 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To date, research on invasive plant population genetics has focused on comparing genetic diversity between existing populations from native and introduced ranges (Suarez and Tsutsui 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and between populations at early and later stages of invasion (Chun et al. 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Fennell et al. 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Such studies have provided insights into the role that both adaptive and stochastic evolutionary processes play in shaping the genetic structure of introduced populations; however, they do not directly address alterations in genetic variation through time and have not always provided convincing evidence that evolutionary modifications have contributed to successful invasions.
