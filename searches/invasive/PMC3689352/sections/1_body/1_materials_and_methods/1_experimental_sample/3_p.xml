<p>For each of the three experiments, achenes from each inbred line were stratified in distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O at 4°C for ≥ 4 weeks, sown into moist medium-grade vermiculite, and germinated on open glasshouse benches at 24°C day/20°C night. Either 1 (Moisture Experiment, Habitat Experiment) or two (Light Experiment) replicate seedlings per line were assigned to each growth treatment in a randomized complete block design.
