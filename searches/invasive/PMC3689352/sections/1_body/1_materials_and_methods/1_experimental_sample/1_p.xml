<p>The sample was drawn from three well-established 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations chosen to represent the range of shade habitats in which this species has historically occurred in this region (ARL = Arch Road, Leeds, MA; ORD = Katherine Ordway Preserve, Weston, CT; WEI = Weir Farm, Wilton, CT; site details in Sultan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">1998b</xref>). Achenes (1-seeded fruits) were collected from 10 to 12 plants ≥ 1.0 m apart in each population (September 1994, September 2005). Conditions at these sites have remained generally unchanged since 1994 (e.g. available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> canopy height at ORD and WEI ranged from 3%–97% of full sun in 1994 and from 2%–100% in 2009 (data unavailable for ARL); T. Horgan-Kobelski, S. Matesanz, &amp; S. E. Sultan, unpublished manuscript.
