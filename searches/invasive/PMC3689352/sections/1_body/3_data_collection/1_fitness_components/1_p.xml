<p>Lifetime total achene mass was calculated as air-dried mass of early-maturing achenes plus all mature/immature achenes, flowers, and reproductive support collected at final harvest (mature achenes comprise &gt; 96% of this mass; S. E. Sultan, unpublished data). Early-maturing achenes were collected by rubbing inflorescences to release mature achenes yet allow other flowers to reach maturity, except in the Light Experiment, where they were collected by removing entire inflorescences that contained mature achenes. Mean individual achene mass was calculated from a random sample of 20 mature achenes per experimental plant, and total achene number estimated as (total achene mass/mean individual achene mass). These reproductive tissues were harvested after 9.5 weeks (Light Experiment repl. 2), 8 weeks (Moisture Experiment), and 10.5 weeks (Habitat experiment) in treatment.</p>
