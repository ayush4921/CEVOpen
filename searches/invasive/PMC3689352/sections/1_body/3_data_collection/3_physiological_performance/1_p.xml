 <italic>In situ</italic> measurements were made on mature plants from a random subset of 5–9 lines per population from each collection year, between 1000–1500 h on sunny days from May 22–30, 2006 (Light Experiment) and August 5–14, 2006 (Moisture Experiment). Instantaneous photosynthetic rate (Photosynthesis; μmol CO
 <sub>2</sub> m
 <sup>2</sup>/s) and stomatal conductance (Conductance; mol H
 <sub>2</sub>O m
 <sup>2</sup>/s) were measured on the most recent fully-expanded leaf from a 1° branch using a LI-COR 6200 photosynthesis system with LI-6250 gas analyzer (Licor, Inc.) and Q-Beam 1205 LED lamp (Quantum Devices, Inc., Barneveld, WI, USA). Each datum was the mean of three consecutive measurements during which chamber relative humidity changed &lt; 1%. Data were excluded from 7 Light and 1 Moisture Experiment plants that were senescent. Leaf area tracings for rate calculations were measured with an LI-3100 leaf area meter (Licor, Inc.). Instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE; μmol CO
 <sub>2</sub>/mol H
 <sub>2</sub>O) was calculated as (Photosynthesis/Conductance).
