<p>After 4 weeks (Light Experiment repl. 1), 8 weeks (Moisture Experiment), or 10.5 weeks (Habitat experiment) in treatment, leaf and stem tissues of each plant were harvested, oven-dried (at 100°C for 1 h then 65°C for ≥ 48 h), and weighed to determine leaf and stem biomass. Three leaves from one primary branch per plant were scanned on an LI-3100 leaf area meter (Licor, Inc., Lincoln, NE USA), oven-dried, and weighed to determine specific leaf area (SLA; cm
 <sup>2</sup>/g). Whole-plant total estimated leaf area (TELA) was calculated as (SLA × leaf biomass). Intact root systems were stored at 4°C before being manually washed, oven-dried (at 65°C for ≥ 48h), and weighed to determine root biomass and the whole-plant ratio of root mass/leaf area (g root mass/m
 <sup>2</sup> TELA) was calculated. Total plant biomass was calculated as (total achene mass + leaf mass + stem mass + root mass). Reproductive allocation was calculated as [(total achene mass/total plant biomass) × 100]. Root length was measured on a Comair Root Length Scanner (Hawker de Havilland, Melbourne, Australia) for a random sample of two entire root systems per population, collection year, and moisture treatment. These root systems were oven-dried at 65°C and weighed to determine specific root length (SRL; m root/g root mass). Allocation and/or fitness data were excluded from 4 (Habitat Experiment), 8 (Moisture Experiment), and 18 (Light Experiment) replicates due to harvest error or abnormal growth (3%, 6%, and 7% of experimental plants, respectively; results were not qualitatively affected by these exclusions).
