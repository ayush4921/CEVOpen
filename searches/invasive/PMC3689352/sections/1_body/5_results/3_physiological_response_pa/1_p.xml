<p>All three experimental populations evolved significantly different photosynthetic responses to High versus Low light and to Moist versus Dry soil between 1994 and 2005

Patterns of physiological plasticity in response to light evolved similarly in the three populations: in High light, 2005 genotypes increased photosynthesis more steeply (63% vs 43%) and decreased conductance less (20% vs 39%) than 1994 genotypes (
