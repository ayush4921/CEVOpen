<p>By contrast, evolved changes in photosynthetic response to Dry vs. Moist soil differed dramatically among the three populations (Year × Population and Treatment × Year × Population effects,

In contrast to the evolved changes in physiological responses to light, 2005 and 1994 genotypes from all three populations expressed similar stomatal conductance and WUE in response to Dry versus Moist soil (NS main and interaction effects of Year and Population,
