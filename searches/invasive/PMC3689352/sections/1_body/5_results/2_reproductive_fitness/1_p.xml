<p>All three New England 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations have rapidly evolved to increase reproductive output in mesic or moist, high light conditions (Year and Year × Population effects, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A–C; note however that the Year effect was marginally non-significant for the Moisture Experiment). These increases reflect population-specific patterns of evolutionary change for particular components of fitness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>; Population and Year × Population effects, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). For instance, in the Habitat experiment, 2005 genotypes from the ARL population allocated more biomass to reproduction in the Open/Mesic treatment than those from 1994 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>D), resulting in c. 25% greater total achene mass and number in this treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>A,B). In the ORD population, 2005 genotypes increased reproductive allocation in 
 <italic>both</italic> habitat treatments compared to 1994 plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>H) and also produced larger offspring in the Open/Mesic treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>G), resulting in 30–35% greater achene mass and number across treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>E,F). In contrast, 2005 genotypes from the WEI population did not increase reproductive allocation in either treatment compared to 1994 genotypes, and there was no change in total achene mass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>L,I). However, because 2005 plants in this population 
 <italic>reduced</italic> the size of their offspring in the Open/Mesic treatment compared to 1994 genotypes (though achenes remained significantly larger than those produced by other populations, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 based on Tukeys HSD test; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>K), they produced a greater number of offspring (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>J). Results of the Light and Moisture Experiments generally confirmed these population-specific evolutionary changes in reproductive allocation, offspring size, total achene mass and number (Supplement 1).
