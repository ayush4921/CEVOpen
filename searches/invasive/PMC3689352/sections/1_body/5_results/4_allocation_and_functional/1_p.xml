<p>2005 genotypes expressed greater allocational plasticity in response to light level during the rapid growth stage (week 4) than 1994 plants, producing significantly less root tissue per unit of leaf surface area in Low light, and more steeply increasing this ratio in High light (mean within-genotype increase of 239% vs 125%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>D; significant Treatment × Year effect, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). 2005 genotypes also produced significantly more root mass per unit leaf area in response to the Shade/Moist and Open/Mesic habitat treatments, and to both Dry and Moist soils in full sun (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). These evolutionary changes in allocational response were similar across the three populations (NS Year × Population and Treatment × Year × Population effects, all three experiments, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), though populations differed on average in responses to the contrasting habitat treatments (Population effect, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Whole-plant root scans on a subsample of plants showed that 2005 and 1994 genotypes expressed markedly different plasticity patterns for root morphology in response to contrasting soil moisture levels (
