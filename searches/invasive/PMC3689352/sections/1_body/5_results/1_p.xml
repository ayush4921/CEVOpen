<p>Significant evolutionary change occurred in a number of fitness and functional traits between 1994 and 2005 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>, Year effects). Evolved changes in several traits were environment-specific (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>, Treatment × Year effects), indicating evolution of plasticity. In some cases, evolutionary changes in mean trait values and/or plasticity differed among the three populations (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>, Year × Population and Treatment × Year × Population effects).
