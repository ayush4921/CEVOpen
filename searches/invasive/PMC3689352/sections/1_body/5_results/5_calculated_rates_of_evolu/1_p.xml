<p>Rates of change calculated for the 14 cases of significant (main or interaction) effects of year across populations were low to moderate (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>A), ranging in absolute value from 0.0112 haldanes (= the NS change in achene number in the Shade/Moist treatment, Habitat Experiment; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>A) to 0.1264 haldanes (= the significant change in SRL in the Dry treatment, Moisture Experiment; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>G). Most rates of change (9 out of the 14 significant cases) fell between 0.038 and 0.078. Rates of change within single populations calculated for the 11 cases of significant (main or interaction) effects of year were generally similar (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), ranging from 0.042 to 0.114 haldanes, with 9 of the 11 rate values falling between 0.06â€“0.09 haldanes (
