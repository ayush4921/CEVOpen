<p>For each experiment, we calculated rates of evolutionary change in haldanes and Darwins for traits that showed significant year effects, i.e., for every trait in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> with a significant main or interaction effect of year (Hendry and Kinnison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">1999</xref>). In cases where the main effect of year was significant, we calculated evolutionary rates for phenotypes expressed in both treatments in that experiment; in cases where the effect of year was significant only within a particular treatment, we calculated rates only for phenotypes expressed in that treatment.
