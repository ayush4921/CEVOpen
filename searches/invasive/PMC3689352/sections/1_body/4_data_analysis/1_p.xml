<p>For each experiment, 
 <sc>anova</sc>s using type III sums of squares (JMP version 7.0.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) were performed to test for Treatment, Collection Year, Population, and interaction effects on each trait (Full 
 <sc>
  <bold>anova</bold>
 </sc>). Air temperature and measurement day were included in Light Experiment physiology 
 <sc>anova</sc>s. 
 <italic>Population</italic> was treated as fixed because the three populations were chosen to represent the 1994 range of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> habitats rather than as a random sample (see Sultan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">1998b</xref>). Populations within collection year were pooled in the SRL 
 <sc>anova</sc>. Total achene mass and number and total plant biomass were Box-Cox transformed to meet 
 <sc>anova</sc> assumptions (Zar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">1999</xref>); other traits did not require transformation. 
 <italic>Post-hoc</italic> Tukeys HSD tests were performed where direct comparisons among populations within a single treatment were of interest (Zar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">1999</xref>). When population main effect or interaction terms were significant, separate 
 <sc>anova</sc>s were performed to test for Treatment, Collection Year, and interaction effects within each population (Single-population 
 <sc>anova</sc>). To investigate evolved differences in detail, one-way 
 <sc>anova</sc> were performed testing for the effect of Collection Year within each population in each treatment (one-way 
 <sc>anova</sc>). Because of very low statistical power in the SRL 
 <sc>anova</sc> (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6 per collection year within each treatment), we use a significance threshold of â‰¤ 0.10 rather than the conventional 0.05 in this case (Filion et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2000</xref>; Heschel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2004</xref>). Fitness data for the WEI population were removed from the Light Experiment dataset because the early-achene collection protocol used only in this experiment (see Data Collection, 
 <italic>Fitness components</italic>) caused a disproportionate reduction in the total reproductive output of 2005 WEI genotypes, due to their delayed flowering in full-sun conditions (L. M. Nichols, unpublished data).
