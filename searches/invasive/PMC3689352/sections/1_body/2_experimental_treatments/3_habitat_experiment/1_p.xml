<p>Plants were grown in two glasshouse treatments: Open/Mesic (full sun, 75% field capacity soil moisture) vs. Shade/Moist (85% simulated shade, field capacity soil moisture); details as above. These treatments mimic current habitats in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s introduced range: in typical open sites, maximum light exceeds 90% of PAR and mean soil moisture is 47–80% of field capacity; in shaded sites, mean available light is 5–18% of PAR and mean soil moisture is 58–93% of field capacity (data in T. Horgan-Kobelski, S. Matesanz, &amp; S. E. Sultan, unpublished manuscript).
