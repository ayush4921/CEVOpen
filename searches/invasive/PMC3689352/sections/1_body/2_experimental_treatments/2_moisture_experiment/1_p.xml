<p>Plants were grown in two glasshouse treatments, Dry vs. Moist soil (both in high light). Seedlings at the first true leaf stage were transplanted into filled pots as described above. Plants received full sun (mean midday PAR c.1100 μmol/m
 <sup>2</sup>/s Red: Far-red ratio ≥ 1.07). Mean soil moisture was maintained at 50% (Dry treatment) and 100% (Moist treatment) of field capacity by means of automatic watering systems supplemented with hand watering (see above). Plants were grown in treatment from June 30 to August 22, 2006.
