<p>Plants were grown in two glasshouse treatments, High vs. Low light (both in moist soil). Seedlings at the first true leaf stage were transplanted into 0.8L clay pots filled with 1:1:1 coarse sand: sterilized topsoil: Turface fritted clay (Profile, Buffalo Grove, IL USA) and 2.5 g per pot granular 15:8:12 NPK fertilizer (Agway, Syracuse, NY USA). Plants in High light received full sun (mean midday PAR c.1100 μmol/m
 <sup>2</sup>/s Red: Far-red ratio ≥ 1.07). Low-light plants were grown under adjustable metal frames covered with neutral 85% shade cloth (Hummert, Earth City, MO, USA) overlaid with green plastic filter strips (#138, Lee Filters, Burbank, CA USA) to simulate canopy shade (mean midday PAR c.160 μmol/m
 <sup>2</sup>/s; R:FR ratio 0.68–0.89 based on mid-day measurements with an SKR 110 R:FR meter (Skye Instruments, Llandrindod Wells, UK). Automatic systems delivered reverse-osmosis filtered H
 <sub>2</sub>O to pots via individual tubes (Chapin Watermatics, Watertown, NY, USA), supplemented with hand watering as needed. Mean soil moisture was maintained at 84–90% of field capacity in both Low and High light. Plants were grown in treatment March 31 to April 28, 2006 (replicate 1) or June 6, 2006 (replicate 2).
