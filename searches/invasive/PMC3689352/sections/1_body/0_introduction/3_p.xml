<p>We used a resurrection protocol to test for recent adaptive evolution in established North American populations of 
 <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> (Bl.), an obligately annual plant native to temperate and subtropical Asia that was unintentionally introduced in the early 1900's (Paterson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">2000</xref>; Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2008</xref>). In its native range, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> colonizes moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest paths (Anjen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2003</xref>). In northeastern North America, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> was historically restricted to similar habitats (Sultan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">1998b</xref>), but in the past 10â€“15 years it has begun to spread into open sites that include microsites with high light intensity and potential moisture deficits as well as wet, high-light microsites (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Coincident with its increased ecological breadth, the species is now considered to be invasive in this part of its introduced range (Merhoff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2003</xref>). In addition to the importance of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> as an invasive plant in Northeastern North America, the species serves as an excellent model system for an introduced taxon in the process of making the transition to invasive spread.
