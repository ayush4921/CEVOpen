<p>A powerful approach for studying recent and rapid – i.e., ‘contemporary’ – evolution (Hendry and Kinnison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">1999</xref>) is the use of resurrection protocols (Franks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2008</xref>), in which genotypes are systematically collected from the same populations at different points in time and then raised under common conditions, to quantify evolutionary change within those populations over the collection interval. This approach has been used to document rapid evolution in bacteria (Lenski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">1991</xref>), aquatic invertebrates (Hairston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">1999</xref>), and annual plants (Davison and Reiling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1995</xref>; Franks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2007</xref>), all of which can be stored as dormant propagules to allow for robust comparison of temporal samples. A resurrection approach makes it possible to answer several key questions about evolution in invasive non-native species. First, it can directly test whether evolutionary change has occurred within the introduced range. Such direct tests are a powerful addition to studies that infer evolutionary change by comparing geographically distant or native versus introduced populations of invasive taxa (e.g. Blossey and Nötzold 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">1995</xref>; Blair and Wolfe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2004</xref>; Maron et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2004</xref>; Lavergne and Molofsky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2007</xref>; Keller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>; reviewed in Bossdorf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2005</xref>; Matesanz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2010</xref>). Second, a resurrection approach can assess evolutionary adaptation as a factor in the invasion process by testing whether or not populations have evolved increased functional performance and reproductive fitness in the environments found in the introduced range. If designed appropriately, resurrection experiments can also reveal evolutionary change in trait plasticity expressed by individual genotypes, an aspect of adaptation that can contribute to an invasive species' spread across diverse and/or variable habitats (Sultan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2004</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">2007</xref>). Finally, resurrection studies that compare patterns of change in multiple populations in an introduced range can inform predictions regarding the dynamics of a species' spread.
