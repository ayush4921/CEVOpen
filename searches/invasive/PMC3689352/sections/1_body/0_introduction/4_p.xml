<p>We conducted a series of resurrection experiments on genotypes sampled from three New England 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations both before (1994) and during (2005) the species' ecological expansion into open sites (an interval of 11 generations). We measured ecophysiologically important traits as well as reproductive output to assess the adaptive value of any evolved changes. First, we compared functional and fitness responses of 1994-collected vs. 2005-collected genotypes to contrasting light and moisture levels, in two separate, single-factor glasshouse experiments. In a third experiment, we then compared responses of these genotypes to contrasting glasshouse ‘habitat’ treatments designed to simulate (a) the shaded, moist habitat initially colonized by 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> in northeastern North America, and (b) the full-sun, potentially drier conditions into which the species is now spreading. This suite of experiments documents remarkably rapid adaptive evolution of ecologically important traits and their plasticity in response to increased light intensity and moisture stress in this newly invasive introduced plant. More generally, the results demonstrate that altered patterns of adaptive trait expression can evolve in plant populations in surprisingly few generations.
