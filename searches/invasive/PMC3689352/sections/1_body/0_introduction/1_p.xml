<p>Evolutionary change is now increasingly recognized to occur on a timescale of decades or even years in natural populations of many taxa (Cody and Overton

The potential for introduced species to rapidly evolve adaptations to newly encountered habitats can contribute critically to their success and spread as invasives. Hence, studies testing for rapid adaptive change in populations of introduced species add a crucial evolutionary dimension to the urgent practical issue of biological invasions.
