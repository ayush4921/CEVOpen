<p>The lack of detailed environmental information regarding 
 <italic>P. cespitosum'</italic>s ecological distribution in its Asian home range makes it difficult to assess the species' apparent failure to evolve adaptations allowing its spread into sunny habitats during its long evolutionary history in that range. Possibly the more uniform shade conditions of undisturbed Asian forest understories provided no selective advantage to genotypes able to express high light-adapted phenotypes. It is also possible that open habitats in the Asian range include abiotic or biotic stresses beyond the tolerance of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> genotypes, such as specialized herbivores, pathogens, or competitors, or extreme and/or prolonged moisture deficits. Future studies characterizing the species' ecological range in Asia would help to resolve this question.
