<p>Because light and moisture conditions at the study populations have not altered (see Materials and methods, Experimental sample), it seems unlikely that these rapid adaptive changes reflect a directional selective response to increased light. Rather, these changes in physiological, developmental and fitness plasticity may result from selection in the patchy, temporally-variable light milieu of disturbed shade habitats in the species' introduced range (microsite data in T. Horgan-Kobelski, S. Matesanz, &amp; S. E. Sultan, unpublished manuscript). Pre-existing plasticity may have allowed introduced genotypes of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> to colonize these heterogeneous sites, providing a starting point for further adaptive evolution (West- Eberhard

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2011</xref>; see also Levin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2009</xref>). Because effectively harvesting intense light sharply increases reproductive output, subsequent selection in these variable habitats would strongly favor genotypes able to functionally exploit high light conditions, even if fully open microsites were comparatively rare or intense insolation only intermittent (Kawecki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">1997</xref>). Selection within these patchy habitats could thus have led to the evolution of adaptive plastic responses to high light (and concomitant moisture deficits). Furthermore, such functional plasticity would have pre-adapted 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> genotypes to colonize open sites (see Donohue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2001</xref>), possibly facilitating the species' ecological range expansion into sunnier and potentially drier habitats.
