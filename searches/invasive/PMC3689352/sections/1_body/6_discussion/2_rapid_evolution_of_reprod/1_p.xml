<p>Comparisons of 1994 and 2005 genotypes from three 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations reveal that the species has rapidly evolved in its introduced range to increase reproductive fitness in full sun, very moist to mesic conditions. Alternative explanations for this specific change across years are very unlikely to apply. First, gene flow is quite limited in this gravity-dispersed species, so it is very unlikely that these within-population changes are due to gene flow from hypothetical sun-adapted populations nearby (this is even more unlikely to have occurred in all three geographically distinct populations). Furthermore, trait phenotypes expressed in shade/moist (i.e., ancestral) conditions were in many cases identical to those produced by the 1994 genotypes of the same population, which would not be the case if the populations had been recolonized from other sites. Finally, the populations are clearly genetically distinct from one another, which would not be the case if they had all received immigrants from a common, differently-adapted source. (Both limited gene flow and substantial among-population genetic diversity have been confirmed in a related microsatellite study; S. Matesanz, K. Theiss, K. Holsinger and S. Sultan, unpublished data).
