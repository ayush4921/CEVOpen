<p>This experimental result is strikingly consistent with field data indicating that in the past 1â€“2 decades, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> has begun to colonize open, moist to dry conditions, in addition to the shaded sites that characterize both its native distribution and its initial distribution in NE North America (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Greater fitness in full sun appears not to entail a trade-off with performance in shade: in all three populations, 2005 genotypes maintained or slightly increased reproductive output in shaded treatments relative to 1994 plants. In its introduced range, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> is thus evolving genotypes able to succeed in a broader range of environmental conditions. In contrast to the ecological specialization that results from fitness trade-offs, the ability to both maintain fitness in resource-limited (e.g., low light) conditions and opportunistically maximize reproduction in resource-rich (e.g., full sun) environments is a pattern of fitness plasticity predicted to characterize generalist and invasive taxa (Sultan
