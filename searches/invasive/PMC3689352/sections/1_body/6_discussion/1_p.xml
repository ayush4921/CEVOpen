<p>In this study, we used a newly invasive introduced species to investigate a fundamental evolutionary issue: the potential for rapid evolution of ecologically important traits, including adaptive plasticity. The results may be relevant to other introduced taxa; more generally, they illuminate the timely and indeed urgent issue of potential evolutionary response to novel environmental conditions. Rates of evolutionary change in introduced-range populations of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> calculated in haldanes (phenotypic standard deviations per generation, the most appropriate measure for microevolutionary studies, Hendry and Kinnison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">1999</xref>) were similar to those for evolution of tolerance to heavy metals and road de-icing salt in herbaceous plant populations, but less than the very high rates of evolution that have been documented in several plant taxa for growth traits in response to herbicides (reviewed by Bone and Farres 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2001</xref>). With respect to species introductions, rates of change in the 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations were higher than rates of evolution for growth traits in introduced versus native populations of several biennial and perennial herbs, but lower than the dramatic rates documented for evolution of herbivore resistance in the highly invasive beachgrass 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> (Bone and Farres 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2001</xref>). Evolutionary rates calculated in the present study also fell within the range for published studies of contemporary evolution in molluscs, fish and reptiles (reviewed by Hendry and Kinnison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">1999</xref>).
