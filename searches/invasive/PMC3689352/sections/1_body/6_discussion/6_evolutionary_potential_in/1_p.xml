<p>Evolution of functional and fitness responses has occurred within all three study populations of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> over a recent 11-generation period, demonstrating remarkably rapid adaptive change in an introduced species. In this instance, evolution of responses to full-sun conditions is consistent with the concomitant spread of the species from its original shade distribution into open habitats, and its new status as an invasive in the region.
