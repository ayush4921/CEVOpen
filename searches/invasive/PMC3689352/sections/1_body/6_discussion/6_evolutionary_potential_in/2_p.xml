<p>Along with this shared pattern of adaptive change, differences persist among the populations in absolute reproductive output in both open and shade conditions (cf. 2005 genotypes, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>A, E, I). These population differences in fitness provide an additional, equally fundamental insight to evolutionary change in introduced species. They suggest that idiosyncratic genetic constraints and/or local selective pressures may differently limit adaptive change in populations of introduced taxa (Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2002</xref>), as is the case in native species exposed to novel environmental challenges (e.g., Al-Hiyaly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1988</xref>). Indeed, such population differences can be expected as a result of founder effects and random genetic drift in self-fertilizing species with limited dispersal such as 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>. As a consequence, distinct populations may possess different potentials to persist in, and further adapt to, new habitats within an introduced range. Accordingly, the expanded ecological repertoire that can fuel a species' invasion in a new region may result from evolutionary change in only a subset of its populations (Sakai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">2001</xref>; Lee and Gelembiuk 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>), suggesting that invasion dynamics may be shaped in part by population-level evolutionary events and constraints.
