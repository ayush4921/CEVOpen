<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly document the evolution of increased plasticity for key functional traits in the introduced range of an invasive species. While both adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity have been considered important drivers of species invasions (Sakai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">2001</xref>; Sultan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2004</xref>; Richards et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">2006</xref>), they have often been viewed as separate factors; few studies have examined adaptive evolution of plasticity in introduced species. Nonetheless, such evolution may be a common, critically important event during the well-known lag time between an invasive species' initial introduction to a new range and its later, often sudden switch to aggressive spread (Sakai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">2001</xref>; Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2002</xref>). Several studies have found greater plasticity of invasive species in their introduced than in their native ranges (reviewed in Bossdorf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2005</xref>; Matesanz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2010</xref>), but these studies could not distinguish colonization by a subset of highly plastic, pre-adapted genotypes (e.g., Bossdorf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2008</xref>) from evolution of plasticity in the introduced range. Neutral molecular evidence indicates that in some cases (e.g., Lavergne and Molofsky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2007</xref>) increased plasticity may have evolved within a taxon's introduced range, as has evidently occurred in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>. Further resurrection studies of introduced plants, animals, and microorganisms will help to clarify whether rapid evolution of increased plasticity is a common feature of invasive species. More generally, our results suggest that resurrection approaches could be of broad utility in conservation biology, both to identify recent evolutionary changes that can contribute to invasiveness, and to test for either adaptive or maladaptive contemporary evolution in populations of rare or threatened taxa.
