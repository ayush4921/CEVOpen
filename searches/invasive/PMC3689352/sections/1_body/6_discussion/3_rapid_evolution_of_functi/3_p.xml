<p>Certain evolved changes in allocational plasticity are also consistent with adaptive ecophysiological predictions for shade phenotypes. Relative to 1994 genotypes, 2005 plants decreased root-to-leaf ratio in moist shade (Light Experiment, week 4), where growth depends on maximizing photosynthetic surface area rather than roots (Fitter and Hay 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2002</xref>). However, this changed response appears to be expressed only in juvenile plants, since it was not found in plants grown in the Shade/Moist habitat treatment that were harvested at senescence. A recent meta-analysis comparing populations before and after anthropogenic disturbance found that evolved changes in population-level ‘plasticity’ (defined as change in the population's response slope, in the absence of environment-specific adaptive criteria) were idiosyncratic in plants, with no clear trends in the direction of change for specific types of trait (Crispo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>). The changes here documented in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> also include both increases and decreases in slope (for instance, the evolution of a shallower decrease in conduction rates in high light, corresponding to steeper increases in photosynthetic rates and fitness in that treatment).
