<p>Populations in the introduced range have also recently evolved appropriate functional responses to high versus low light and to dry soil. As a result of changes in both photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, 2005 genotypes had higher rates of carbon fixation in moist, full sun conditions, and significantly lower water use efficiency, than those from 1994. High photosynthetic rate with low WUE is considered a favorable growth strategy for annual plants in moist conditions (Arntz and Delph 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2001</xref>; Geber and Griffen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2003</xref>), since reduced WUE associated with high conductance adversely affects fitness only in dry soils (Heschel et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2007</xref>). Introduced 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> genotypes from 1994 were previously found to have high WUE in full sun relative to annual congeners due to comparatively low rates of both photosynthesis and conductance (Sultan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">1998a</xref>). The evolution of higher metabolic rates in full sun coincides with the species' recent transition from a shade-restricted herb to one inhabiting a wider range of light environments, supporting the view that evolution of novel, adaptive expression patterns for functional traits can promote colonization of new habitats (Lee et al.
