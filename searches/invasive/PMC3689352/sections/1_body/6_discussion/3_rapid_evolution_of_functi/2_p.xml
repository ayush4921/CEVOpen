<p>Along with these changed physiological responses, plants in the study populations have rapidly evolved altered plasticity patterns for root allocation and morphology. The greater root-to-leaf allocation of 2005 plants in high light conditions would maximize the supply of water and nutrients to photosynthetic tissues, allowing opportunistically high rates of carbon assimilation despite the transpirational demands of open habitats (Lechowicz and Blais 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">1988</xref>; Fitter and Hay 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2002</xref>). This plastic response was even more pronounced in 2005 plants growing in mesic and dry soil in full sun, consistent with the increased root uptake surface needed to access limited soil moisture. 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations have also evolved substantially modified, functionally adaptive plasticity for root morphology (Bell and Sultan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">1999</xref>), substantially increasing the root length (and hence absorptive surface area) per gram of root tissue in dry, full-sun conditions.
