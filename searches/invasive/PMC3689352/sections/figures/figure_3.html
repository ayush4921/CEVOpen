 <caption> Rapid evolution of physiology and morphology. Means are shown ± 1 SE for 26–29 genotypes per collection year (pooled from three field populations; A–F) and for six genotypes per collection year (pooled from three field populations; G). Vertical arrows indicate significant main effect of year in full anova; arrows parallel to 2005 norm of reaction indicate significant Treatment × Year effect (see Tables 2 and 3). P-values are given from One-way anova testing for the effect of year within each treatment. *** P &lt; 0.001; ** P &lt; 0.01; * P &lt; 0.05; † P ≤ 0.10. </caption>
