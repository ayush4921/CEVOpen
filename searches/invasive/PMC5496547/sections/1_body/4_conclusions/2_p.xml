<p>Invasive species richness among islands in the West Indies is well predicted by a combination of island area and economic development including GDP per capita and kilometers of paved roadways. Low similarities in invasive species diversity between islands were detected, with most invasive species (&gt;60%) occurring on a single island and only 6% occurring on at least five islands. Evidence suggests that species behaving as invasive in one area have higher probability to become invasive in other areas (Richardson &amp; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The dataset of invasive species presented here could thus be used as a blacklist of unwanted species to prevent their spread across the region and to avoid new introductions of likely invasive species. Overall, our data emphasize the need to limit deliberate introduction of alien species (particularly ornamentals) and reduce anthropogenic disturbance on these fragile ecosystems. Among the 36 plant species listed as the “world's worst invasive alien species” (Lowe, Browne, Boudjelas, &amp; De Poorter, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>), 19 species appeared in our dataset. Considering the extraordinary species richness and extent of endemism of the West Indies floras, the potential negative impact of these invasive species is very high (e.g., Rojas‐Sandoval et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Future studies should consider complete floristic inventories of alien species, including casual and naturalized species that could eventually become invasive. These inventories are particularly relevant because they allow comparative regional analyses crucial for understanding invasion patterns. From a management perspective, there is an urgent need to implement more effective prevention policies at all scales and enforce more stringent national and regional legislations.
