<p>The West Indies, comprising the Bahamas, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, and the islands off the coast of northern South America (Netherlands Antilles and Trinidad and Tobago), is considered one of the biodiversity hotspots with high global priority for conservation due to its biological richness and high levels of endemism (&gt;70% for seed plants; Myers, Mittermeier, Mittermeier, da Fonseca, &amp; Kent,

Currently, the expansion of urban areas and tourism complexes coupled with high population densities and accelerated changes in socioeconomic conditions are generating unprecedented pressure over the natural resources on these islands (Dixon, Hamilton, Pagiola, &amp; Segnestam,
