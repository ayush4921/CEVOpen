<p>The distribution and abundance of invasive species can also be strongly influenced by vectors that facilitate their dispersal (Mortensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0504" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Von der Lippe &amp; Kowarik, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Besides being an indirect measure of economic development, the presence of paved roadways can play a crucial role by serving as corridors for the spread of invasive species as well as by providing particularly propitious habitats (open and disturbed) for their establishment (Pauchard &amp; Alaback, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Sharma &amp; Raghubanshi, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Jolly et al., 2011; Vakhlamova, Rusterholz, Kanibolotskaya, &amp; Baur, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). We found that the total length of paved roadways is indeed a good predictor of invasive species diversity for islands in the West Indies. Previous studies have also shown that paved roadways strongly favor the spread and establishment of opportunistic invasive plant species (Mortensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0504" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Jolly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0503" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Meunier &amp; Lavoie, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). From roadside areas, invasive species can also colonize adjacent undisturbed habitats (Pauchard &amp; Alaback, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Sharma &amp; Raghubanshi, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Von der Lippe &amp; Kowarik, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Vehicles are an important vector for plant dispersal, and road networks associated with higher traffic densities result in high propagule pressure of alien species (Ansong &amp; Pickering, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Von der Lippe &amp; Kowarik, 
 <xref rid="ece32984-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Overall, our models highlight the vulnerability of islands with high economic activity and large paved road networks to the introduction and spread of invasive plant species. This represents an underestimated threat to the already highly disturbed habitats on Caribbean islands.
