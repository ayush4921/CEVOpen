<p>The final database comprises a total of 516 invasive plant species representing 348 genera and 96 families and contributing to 4% of the total flora of the West Indies (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). This database comprises a heterogeneous group of plants in terms of their taxonomical and ecological attributes (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The families with the largest number of invasive species were Fabaceae (88 species), Poaceae (77 species), and Asteraceae (33 species), which accounted for 38% of all invasive species. A total of 34 families were represented by a single species and 78 families were represented by five species or less. The genera with the highest number of invasive species were 
 <italic>Ipomoea</italic> (10 species), 
 <italic>Paspalum</italic> (7 species), and 
 <italic>Eragrostis</italic> (6 species), while 252 genera (72%) were represented by a single invasive species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The frequency distribution of invasive plant species across islands is right‐skewed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), with more than 60% (310 species) of all species only occurring on one island and 6% (32 species) occurring on five islands or more. The most widely distributed invasive species across the West Indies is 
 <italic>Leucaena leucocephala</italic> (Fabaceae) which occurs on all nine islands, followed by 
 <italic>Casuarina equisetifolia</italic> (Casuarinaceae)
 <italic>, Eichhornia crasssipes</italic> (Pontederiaceae)
 <italic>, Megathyrsus maximus</italic> (Poaceae)
 <italic>, Melaleuca quinquenervia</italic> (Myrtaceae)
 <italic>, Ricinus communis</italic> (Euphorbiaceae)
 <italic>, Spathodea campanulata</italic> (Bignoniaceae), and 
 <italic>Terminalia catappa</italic> (Combretaceae), which occur on seven of nine islands (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).
