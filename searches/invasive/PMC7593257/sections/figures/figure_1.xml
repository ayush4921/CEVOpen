  <p>Daily mean soil volumetric water content estimated from marginal means of linear mixed-effects models from 2009â€“2019 in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments. Experiments are represented with different shaped polygons: circles for CV2, triangles for CV4, and squares for M2. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals calculated on marginal means. There were no significant differences in mean soil volumetric water content between warmed and ambient treatments in any of the three experiments.</p>
