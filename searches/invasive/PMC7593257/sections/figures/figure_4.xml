  <p>Plot level relationship of date of 
   <italic>B. tectorum</italic> senescence and mean annual soil temperature at 10 cm depth in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments (
   <bold>Aâ€“C</bold>, respectively). Values from warmed and ambient plots are shown with red triangles and black circles respectively. The linear fits are represented by blue lines and were determined by the geom_smooth function in ggplot2. The linear fits incorporate data from all plots (Ambient and Warming) in each site. R
   <sup>2</sup> values for each linear fit is shown in the bottom left of each panel.
