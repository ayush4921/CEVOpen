  <p>Empirical data for 
   <italic>B. tectorum</italic> senescence 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold>, flowering 
   <bold>(D–F)</bold>, and germination 
   <bold>(G–I)</bold> timing measured weekly in 2010, 2011, and 2015–2019. All phenophases are shown as the average day of year that each phenophase was first observed in each treatment. A value of 0 for day of year corresponds to January 1. A lower value on the y-axis represents earlier timing and a higher value represents later timing. Negative values for day of year indicate that the phenological event took place that number of days prior to January 1. For example, most germination events took place in the Fall and they are shown as negative days for that year (i.e., germination in 2011 took place in the Fall of 2010). Warming treatments are depicted as red triangles and are connected with solid red lines. Ambient treatments are shown with black circles and are connected with dashed black lines. Standard errors of the means are shown with vertical bars associated with the appropriate polygon. Significance of treatment effects is shown in the bottom left of each panel, with NS denoting non-significant effects. Significant differences between the treatment means were determined by Type-II ANOVAs.
