 <caption> Model decompositions for vegetative growing season (A–C), flowering (D–F), and germination (G–I) of B. tectorum in each of the three climate manipulation experiments. The estimated mean number of days each phenological stage was delayed or advanced are represented by the horizontal lines. A lower value on the y-axis represents earlier timing and a higher value represents later timing. The estimated means for the ambient plots are represented by the dashed black horizontal lines and are set to zero as all data are shown relative to the ambient plots for each site and each phenological stage. Solid red horizontal lines represent the mean difference in timing (in Julian days) of the warmed plots relative to the ambient plots (black dashed line). When the solid red line is below the dashed black, line there is an estimated warming-induced advance of that phenophase. When the solid red line is above the dashed black line, there is an estimated warming-induced delay of that phenophase. Significance of treatment effects is shown in the bottom left of each panel, with NS denoting non-significant effects. Significant differences between the treatment means were determined by Type-II ANOVAs. The conditional modes of the random effects for the ambient and warming treatments in each year are shown with black circles or red triangles, respectively. Estimated confidence intervals for these conditional modes are shown with vertical bars within the circles or triangles. Interannual variability of these conditional modes are estimated by their difference each year from the horizontal lines of the means. </caption>
