 <caption> Plot level relationship of date of B. tectorum senescence and mean annual soil temperature at 10 cm depth in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments ( Aâ€“C, respectively). Values from warmed and ambient plots are shown with red triangles and black circles respectively. The linear fits are represented by blue lines and were determined by the geom_smooth function in ggplot2. The linear fits incorporate data from all plots (Ambient and Warming) in each site. R 2 values for each linear fit is shown in the bottom left of each panel. </caption>
