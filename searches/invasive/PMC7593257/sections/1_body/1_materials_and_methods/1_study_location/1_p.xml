Two of the experiments were installed at the same site near Castle Valley, Utah (36.675 N, -109.416W, 1310 m elevation). The soils at the Castle Valley site are classified as sandy loam, calcareous, Rizno series. Soil texture at this site is 61% sand, 25% silt, and 14% clay [as assessed by the Soils Lab at Brigham Young University using a hydrometer (

 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>. Both experiments at the Castle Valley site have a west aspect and the slope ranges from 10°–13°. Prior to establishing the experiments, the Castle Valley site had experienced limited to no anthropogenic activity.
