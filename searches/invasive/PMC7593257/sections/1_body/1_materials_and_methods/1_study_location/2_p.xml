Soils at the Moab site are sandy loam, Sheppard series, with a thin petrocalcic layer at a depth of 0.5 m.

 <sub>3</sub> grass 
 <italic>Achnatherum hymenoides</italic> and the invasive annual C
 <sub>3</sub> grass 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>. The Moab site has a slope of 4Â° with a southern aspect. The site was periodically grazed between 1900 and 2008, and grazing was excluded prior to establishing the experimental plots. Both the Castle Valley and Moab sites have a 1.5 m tall electric fence and 0.5 m tall mesh fence around their perimeters to exclude grazing of cattle and wildlife.
