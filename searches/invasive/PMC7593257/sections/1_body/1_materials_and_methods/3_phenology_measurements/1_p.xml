<p>Phenology measurements began in 2009 at all sites and followed a modified field observation protocol based on 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Wein and West (1971)</xref>. Plots were scored based on the timing and duration of germination, flowering, and senescence phenophases and the Julian day when the transition from one phenophase to another occurred was recorded. Transitions from one phenophase to the next were defined as follows: germination was recorded as the first sign of germination in the plot, flowering was recorded as the first sign of flower budburst in the plot, senescence was recorded when all plants had fully senesced in the plot, and vegetative growing season was calculated as the number of days between the first sign of germination and the first sign of flowering in a plot. In all years, phenophases were scored on a weekly basis but the timing of initiation and termination of weekly surveys differed among years. In 2009 and 2011, surveys started in April and February, respectively, and ended when all plants were fully senesced in June. In 2010, surveys began in February and continued for the year and in 2015–2019 surveys occurred weekly throughout the year, thus these years captured all necessary phenological stages. Phenology was only inconsistently measured from 2012–2014. Due to the shortened measurement times in 2009 and the inconsistent measurements in 2012–2014, only data from 2010, 2011, and 2015–2019 were used in this analysis. During fall 2017, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> germinated at the M2 site, but plants senesced shortly after in early winter and new plants germinated the following spring. These germination and senescence events were excluded from statistical analyses since they were outliers that only occurred once during the experiment.
