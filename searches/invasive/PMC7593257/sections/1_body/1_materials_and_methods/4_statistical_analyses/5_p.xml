<p>In total, twelve linear mixed effects models were constructed to explore microclimate effects (soil moisture and temperature) on each of the four phenology variables (germination, flowering, senescence, and vegetative growing season) in each of the three experiments (CV4, CV2, and M2). All models included additive fixed effects of mean annual soil moisture and mean annual soil temperature. Each model included year and block as random intercepts to account for other aspects of yearly variation beyond changes in soil moisture and temperature and spatial variation across each experiment. Marginal r
 <sup>2</sup> values were calculated to show how much variation in phenological timing was explained by the fixed effects of the models (10 cm soil moisture and soil temperature). Conditional r
 <sup>2</sup> values were calculated to show how much variation in phenological timing was explained by other aspects of annual variation and spatial variation across each experiment. Marginal and conditional r
 <sup>2</sup> values were determined with the r.squaredGLMM function in the ‘car’ package (
