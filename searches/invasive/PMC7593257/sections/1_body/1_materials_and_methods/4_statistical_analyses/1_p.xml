<p>Mean daily soil volumetric water content was aggregated from hourly measurements that began December 1, 2008 and ended December 12, 2019. Data were collected at 10 cm depth from the 3 Decagon EC-5 probes in each plot (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, United States) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20, 20, 10 in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments, respectively). In order to zero each sensor and account for sensor drift, the minimum volumetric water content value for each sensor in each year was subtracted from all other volumetric water content values for each sensor in that year. In addition, all soil moisture data collected in frozen soils (≤0°C) were discarded due to erratic probe behavior.
