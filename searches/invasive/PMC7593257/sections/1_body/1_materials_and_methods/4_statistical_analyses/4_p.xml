<p>We further explored aspects of interannual variation by analyzing relationships of yearly changes in soil moisture and temperature on the timing of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology. Mean annual soil moisture data were collected at 10 cm depth from the 3 Decagon EC-5 probes in each plot (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, United States) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20, 20, 10 in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments, respectively). In order to zero each sensor and account for sensor drift, the minimum volumetric water content value for each sensor in each year was subtracted from all other volumetric water content values for each sensor in that year. In addition, all soil moisture data collected in frozen soils (≤0°C) were discarded due to erratic probe behavior. Mean annual soil temperature data were collected at 10 cm depth from 3 three-tipped thermopiles in each plot. Mean annual soil moisture and temperature were aggregated from hourly measurements in each year when phenology measurements were recorded (2011, 2016–2019 for germination and vegetative growing season and 2010, 2011, 2015–2019 for flowering and senescence).
