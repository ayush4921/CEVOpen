<p>The 20 plots comprising the CV4 experiment were originally selected to have similar biocrust cover (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Zelikova et al., 2012</xref>) and were set up in five blocks to account for downslope spatial variation within the site. Within each block, warming, altered precipitation, warming + altered precipitation, and ambient treatments were randomly assigned to each plot in a full factorial design (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 plots per treatment for a total of 20 plots). In January 2009, temperature treatments in the CV4 plots were increased from 2°C to 4°C above ambient to better capture the range of expected future temperatures. The CV4 plots were subjected to altered precipitation treatments that were intended to mimic small, frequent monsoonal precipitation events. Altered precipitation treatments began in the CV4 plots in the summer of 2006 and continued until 2012 when they were discontinued due to an opportunity to assess biocrust recovery with and without warming (see 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2012</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Zelikova et al., 2012</xref> for additional details). For the CV4 plots, water was applied in 1.2 mm events 5 times every two weeks. Altered precipitation treatments were applied approximately between June 15 and September 15 each year.
