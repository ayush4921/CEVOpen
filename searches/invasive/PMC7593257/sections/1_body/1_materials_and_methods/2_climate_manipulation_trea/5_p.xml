<p>All plots at each site were rectangles that measured 2.5 Ã— 2 m and were oriented such that the long (2.5 m) side ran east to west. All plots were edged with vinyl plastic flashing to prevent overland water flow and minimize roots from growing into or out of the plots. In both CV experiments, where soils are shallow (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Whitney et al., 2017</xref>), flashing was buried to a depth of 15 cm. In the M2 experiment, where soils are deeper, the flashing was buried to a depth of 30 cm. At the center of both sites, meteorological stations were installed with 1-min measurement intervals and reported hourly averages. Precipitation was measured with Texas Instruments TE525WS tipping bucket rain gauges (Texas Electronics Inc., Dallas, TX, United States).
