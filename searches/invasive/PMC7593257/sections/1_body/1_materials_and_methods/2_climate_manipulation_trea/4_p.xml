<p>Two Kalglo MRM 2408 infrared heaters (Kalglo Electronics Co., Inc., Bath, PA, United States) were placed 1.3 m above the soil surface to apply warming treatments at each site. We chose infrared heaters to experimentally warm plots because they have been shown to have a high degree of manipulative accuracy and minimally disturb soil surfaces, which is important for our study area where fragile soil surface biota strongly regulate function (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Wertin et al. (2015)</xref> describe how experimental temperatures were achieved using soil temperature sensors at 5 cm depths and how increasing the temperatures at these depths by 3.57°C and 1.58°C correspond to elevated soil surface temperatures of 4 °C and 2 °C, respectively. Campbell Scientific CR1000 data loggers (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, United States) were programmed to constantly monitor 5 cm deep soil temperatures and toggled lamps on and off in order to maintain 5 cm deep soil temperature differences of +3.57°C in the +4°C warming plots and +1.58°C in the +2°C warming plots relative to their ambient controls. The infrared lamps used for warming have been tested and shown not to emit any visible light that would affect plant phenology (
