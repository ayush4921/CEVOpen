<p>In the fall of 2008, the CV2 plots were constructed within the same large enclosure as the CV4 plots and the M2 plots were installed near Moab, Utah. The 20 CV2 plots were selected to have similar vegetation cover and, as with CV4, the treatments—warming, altered precipitation, warming + altered precipitation, and untreated ambient—were randomly assigned to five blocks to account for downslope spatial variation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 plots per treatment for a total of 20 plots). In contrast to the small, frequent monsoonal precipitation treatments in the CV4 experiment, CV2 had a larger, less frequent altered precipitation treatment which was designed to mimic monsoonal events based on a 30-year average (

The M2 plots were selected for similar vegetation cover, assigned to five blocks to account for cross-site spatial variation, and plots within each block were randomly assigned warming or control treatments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 plots in each treatment for a total of 10 plots). No watering treatments were applied to the M2 site.
