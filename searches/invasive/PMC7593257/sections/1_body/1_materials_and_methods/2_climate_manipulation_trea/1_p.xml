<p>The three complementary climate manipulation experiments experienced one of two levels of warming and one of two types of precipitation treatments (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). One experiment at the Castle Valley site began in 2005 and for most years was warmed to 4 °C above ambient: this experiment will be subsequently referred to as “CV4”. The second experiment at the Castle Valley site began in the Fall of 2008 and increased plot temperatures 2 °C above ambient: this experiment will be subsequently referred to as “CV2”. The experiment at the Moab site also began in the Fall of 2008 and increased plot temperatures 2 °C above ambient. This experiment will be subsequently referred to as “M2”.
