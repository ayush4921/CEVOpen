<p>In each plot, soil temperature and moisture were measured every 15 min and averaged hourly at three soil depths. Soil microclimate probes were placed at 2, 5, and 10 cm depths in the CV2 and CV4 plots and at 5, 10, and 20 cm in the M2 plots (sensor depths varied between sites due to soil depth differences). For soil temperature, three-tipped thermopiles were constructed from 24-gauge Type-E thermocouple wires (Omega Engineering Inc., Norwalk, CT, United States). To assess soil volumetric water content, a combination of CS616 water content reflectometer and Decagon EC-5 soil moisture probes were used (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, United States and Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, United States). CS616 water content reflectometers were installed at 2 cm depths in all plots at CV2 and CV4 and at 5 cm depths in all plots at the M2 site. EC-5 soil moisture probes were installed at 5 and 10 cm depths in all plots at both CV sites and at depths of 10 and 20 cm in the all plots at the M2 site. Foliar temperatures were measured to determine if plants in the experiments received higher levels of warming than what was recorded in the soils. This was achieved using Apogee SI-121 infrared radiometer sensors placed 15–80 cm above 1 focal plant canopy in randomly assigned warming and ambient plots in both CV experiments, depending on the canopy size (Apogee Instruments, Inc., Logan, UT, United States). Plants in the CV4 and CV2 experiments experienced temperatures that were on average 5 °C and 1.6°C higher in the warmed plots than ambient plots, respectively.</p>
