<p>In tracking 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology for seven years across a decade in multiple climate manipulation experiments, we found warming treatments had no significant effect on the timing of germination. This may be partially explained by research showing that the timing of germination is genetically restricted and cannot be explained by interannual precipitation and temperature variation, although the rate of germination is controlled by environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Beckstead et al., 1996</xref>). However, while overall treatment effects on germination were not significant and varied among years, germination was the only phenophase to be delayed rather than advanced in the warming plots, and this was true for each experiment. The relationship between mean annual soil temperature and germination corroborates these treatment effects as warmer years were associated with later germination events (

 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> seeds have been shown to shift thermal optimums for germination with changing levels of soil moisture: at low levels of soil moisture emergence rates are decreased by higher temperatures, but at higher levels of soil moisture emergence rates are increased by higher temperatures (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Allen, 1997</xref>). This speaks to the interactive effects of soil moisture and temperature on germination and lends insight into why warming treatments had larger effects in some years than others.
