<p>In addition to asking questions about how 
 <italic>in situ</italic> climate manipulation affected the phenology of this invasive grass, the longer-term nature of the experiment also allowed us to ask questions about how phenology varied with interannual variations in background climate. We observed substantial interannual variation in the timing of all four measured phenological stages. Interestingly, while germination phenology showed little response to experimental warming, there were large differences in germination timing across years. For example, differences in the timing of germination initiation among years varied by up to 40 and 94 days in the CV experiments and the M2 experiment, respectively. In comparison, the maximum differences in germination timing between warmed and ambient plots within a year were 11 days at CV4 and 30.6 days at M2. In other words, the largest effects of experimental warming were small relative to the range in timing seen across years for 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> germination. We observed similar patterns in the effects of experimental warming vs. interannual variation for senescence and flowering. Annual plants are particularly plastic in their response to interannual variation in temperature and precipitation compared to perennials (

 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> may make the plant particularly adept at dealing with extreme interannual climate variation, except in the cases where insufficient winter moisture is available (

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Wainwright et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Prevéy and Seastedt, 2014</xref>). Indeed, studies suggest 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> senesces prior to the driest summer conditions as a drought avoidance strategy that allows the species to persist in arid environments (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Mack, 1991</xref>). 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum’s</italic> ability to alter senescence, and the timing of flowering, shows a flexibility that could help the species closely track changing climatic conditions. Further, global data suggest plant species that flower earliest in the growing season have the highest phenological temperature sensitivities, thus, part of the strong temperature responses we observed in flowering and senescence may be due to 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> life history traits (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Sherry et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Wolkovich and Cleland, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, although the shortened growing season with warming treatments and in warmer years may point to higher plant stress as temperatures rise, the large phenological plasticity observed for 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> could also suggest success for the invasive plant in a world where climate is changing.
