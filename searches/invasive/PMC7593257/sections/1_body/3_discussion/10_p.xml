<p>Large changes in the timing of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> life stages represent management challenges that additional data could help address. In particular, understanding the fate of this invasive grass with future climate would be of significant use to land managers, as would specific predictions of how phenology will change across time. Management of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> often focuses on spraying or grazing the plant prior to it setting seed (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Whitson and Koch, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lehnhoff et al., 2019</xref>). If increasing temperatures create both earlier seed set and increased variability of the timing of seed set, this would create additional logistical challenges for determining when and where to treat 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> across the landscape. The unique climate manipulation experiments presented here provide insight into the mechanisms through which this highly successful invasive plant may respond to changes in climate, and the effects of experimental warming on 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology offer a glimpse into how the common invasive grass will respond to predicted future climate conditions. The reduced vegetative growing season, the high plasticity observed, and the differences seen across sites improve our understanding of 
 <italic>B. tectorumâ€™s</italic> ability to closely track climatic conditions, which provides forecasting power for the timing of key life stages. Overall, the findings from these experiments can inform predictions of when germination, flowering, and senescence may occur in order to more effectively manage invaded areas and to help identify which ecosystems may be prone to invasion with the continued effects of climate change.
