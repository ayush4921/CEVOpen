<p>We predicted that warming would advance 
 <italic>B. tectorum’s</italic> phenological stages and that altered precipitation treatments would cause phenological delays. We found some support for our warming predictions: although we saw no significant warming treatment effects on germination, warming did significantly advance 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> flowering and senescence, resulting in a shortening of the warmed plants’ vegetative growing season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect any effects of the altered precipitation treatments on 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology. This is most likely due to the fact that altered precipitation treatments occurred outside of the 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> growing season and that these treatments were only ongoing during two years of this study. Non-etheless, we did not observe changes in 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology in response to altered precipitation treatments or the legacy of those treatments.
