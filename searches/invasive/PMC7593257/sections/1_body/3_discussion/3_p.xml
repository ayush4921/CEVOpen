<p>In contrast to germination, both flowering and senescence were significantly advanced by the warming treatments in all three climate manipulation experiments. On average, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> flowering in the +4 °C warmed plots occurred ∼8 days earlier than for plants in the unwarmed plots, whereas senescence occurred ∼3 days earlier. For both flowering and senescence, we observed significant effects of the degree of warming, with larger effects with higher warming levels (e.g., the 4 °C warming in CV4 vs. the 2 °C warming in CV2) (

The patterns of advancing flowering and senescence under warmer conditions was supported by trends in the soil microclimate analysis across years, which showed that mean annual 10 cm soil temperature was significantly related to flowering and senescence timing at all sites and warmer years had earlier occurrence of these phenophases (

Soil moisture may be playing an important role in the timing of flowering and senescence phenology, but we did not observe this relationship in our analysis. Responses to warming may also be influenced by competitive dynamics with native species in our plots (e.g.,
