<p>To address this important unknown, we followed three stages of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology for a decade in 
 <italic>in situ</italic> climate manipulation experiments at two sites on the Colorado Plateau, United States. We used infrared lamps to actively warm plants and soils and hand watering to alter precipitation regimes in a full factorial design. We tracked the phenology of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> germination, flowering, and senescence weekly throughout the growing season to test the following hypotheses: 1. Warming treatments will advance 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> germination, flowering, and senescence and will shorten the length of the vegetative growing season. 2. altered precipitation or the legacy of altered precipitation will delay phenology and extend 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>‘s growing season, and 3. background climate conditions will determine the strength of treatment effects (i.e., the magnitude of treatment effects will vary by year depending on that year’s weather). Our research builds upon a previous study that assessed the first three years of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology under ambient and warmed conditions (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Zelikova et al., 2013</xref>) and allows us to explore whether treatment patterns persisted throughout a decade, as well as to elucidate how interannual variability controls this invasive species’ phenological patterns.
