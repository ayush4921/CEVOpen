<p>Plant community structure and function are governed in part by the timing of key life cycle events (i.e., phenology;

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Godoy and Levine, 2014</xref>). For example, plant phenology regulates growing season length, which determines the timing of seed production and dispersal, and can ultimately influence the competitive and facultative interactions among plants (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Moeller, 2004</xref>). Phenological timing in plants is largely cued to climate conditions, particularly temperature and precipitation (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cleland et al., 2007</xref>). Temperature has been linked to the timing of phenophases for numerous systems and across multiple plant growth forms (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, precipitation patterns are an important driver of plant phenology. Soil moisture, in particular, can stimulate germination and senescence can be delayed in wetter soils (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adondakis and Venable, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Estiarte and Peñuelas, 2015</xref>). In drylands, the timing and magnitude of precipitation events are important for determining growing season phenophases, including flowering, seed production, and senescence (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Prevéy and Seastedt, 2014</xref>). However, the effects of precipitation patterns on phenology are difficult to decipher because precipitation is more variable than, and oftentimes interacts with, temperature (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cleland et al., 2007</xref>). Due to these strong climatic controls over phenology, climate change is having large effects on the timing of green up, flowering, and senescence for plants in drylands and around the world (
