<p>Understanding how climate change will affect 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology would further our ability to identify locations that are more susceptible to invasion, including identification of invasion hotspots that could benefit from increased control efforts (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2019</xref>). Interpreting the climate controls over 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology would also improve spatial-temporal forecasts of how 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> abundance and life cycle timing affect changes in competitiveness and fuel loads into the future (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Compagnoni and Adler, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Underwood et al., 2019</xref>). Further, successful control of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> and promotion of native vegetation is contingent upon 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> eradication 
 <italic>prior</italic> to seed production and before native plants become active (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lehnhoff et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, successful management relies on predicting the timing of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenophases and how invasion will be shaped by future climate (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Garbowski et al., 2019</xref>). However, in spite of the utility of an improved understanding of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenological responses to climate change and of the many projections of potential effects on 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> success, our knowledge of the controls and magnitude of these effects on 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology remains limited. This relatively poor understanding stems from both a lack of long-term observations of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology, and from a low number of climate manipulation experiments in the ecosystems where 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> exists (
