<p>When estimating the effects of interannual variation on the warming treatments, the conditional modes of the random effects showed that, in the earlier years (2010 and 2011), flowering and senescence were not consistently different between warming and ambient treatments, but flowering and senescence consistently advanced after 2014. With only one year of Fall germination recorded in the early years, it is difficult to compare earlier and later year patterns, but modeled conditional modes of the random effects show mixed earlier and later germination timing with respect to the means, and no obvious directional trend over time (
