<p>Linear mixed-effects models examining the relationships between mean annual microclimate (10 cm soil moisture and temperature) and 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenological timing only found a significant relationship between soil moisture and the timing of senescence in the CV4 experiment. In the CV4 experiment, senescence was estimated to occur 1.06 days earlier with every 1% increase in mean annual volumetric water content. All other relationships between soil moisture and phenological timing were not significant. On the other hand, all but two phenophases were significantly related to the mean annual soil temperatures. Warmer temperatures were associated with significant advances in the timing of flowering by 2.98–3.32 days per degree Celsius increase. Senescence also significantly advanced with warmer temperatures as an increase of 1 °C led to an advance of 1.28, 0.75, and 3.51 days in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments, respectively. Additionally, the vegetative growing season (time from germination to flowering) was significantly related to soil temperatures: warmer temperatures led to shorter growing seasons by 4.76–5.82 days per degree Celsius increase. Germination was the only phenophase that was delayed in warmer conditions and was estimated to occur 1.27 days later per degree Celsius increase. Marginal r
 <sup>2</sup> values were &lt;0.1 for all phenophases at all sites except for flowering where marginal r
 <sup>2</sup> values were 0.21, 0.16, and 0.17 in the CV4, CV2, and M2 experiments, respectively. Conditional r
 <sup>2</sup> values were always greater than 0.65 (
