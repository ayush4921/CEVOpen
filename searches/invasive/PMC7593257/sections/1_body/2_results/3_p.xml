<p>Across the years, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology did not respond to altered precipitation treatments nor the legacy of any precipitation treatment. Accordingly, data from the altered precipitation plots were binned with data from the ambient plots and data from the warming + altered precipitation treatments were binned with data from the warming treatments allowing us to look explicitly at the effects of warming on 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> phenology. Warming did not affect the timing of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> germination in any of the experiments. In contrast, both flowering and senescence significantly advanced with warming in all 3 experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For the CV4 and CV2 experiments, of all the phenophases analyzed, warming had the largest effects on the number of vegetative days, followed by flowering phenology, and lastly the timing of senescence (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These patterns shifted in the M2 experiment, which showed the largest warming effects on vegetative days, followed by senescence, then flowering (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Despite no significant germination responses to warming treatments, our models for each experiment suggest that, across years, mean germination dates were delayed in warmed plots relative to controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G,H,I</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These small and non-significant delays in conjunction with large significant warming-induced advances in flowering led to decreases in vegetative days representing the largest treatment effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
