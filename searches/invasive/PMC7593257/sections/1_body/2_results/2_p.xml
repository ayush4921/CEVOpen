<p>From 2009 to 2019, experimental warming increased 10 cm deep soil temperatures above ambient soil temperatures an average of 2.73°C in the CV4 plots, 1.34°C in the CV2 plots, and 1.25°C in the M2 plots (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). From 2009–2019 there were no differences in mean volumetric water content between warmed and ambient plots for any of the experiments when averaged across each year (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Wertin et al. (2015)</xref> describe, in detail, the effects of the altered precipitation treatments on both soil moisture and temperature at 5 cm depths. Briefly, watering treatments did not significantly affect soil temperatures in either the altered precipitation plots or the warming + altered precipitation plots. Additionally, only the small-frequent altered precipitation treatments of the CV4 sites significantly increased soil moisture during the months when plots were watered and the large-frequent watering at the CV2 sites did not show significant measurable effects on soil moisture at the 5 cm measurement depth.
