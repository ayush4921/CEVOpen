<p>In the CV4 and CV2 experiments, all final models had additive warming and altered precipitation fixed effects and no final candidate models included warming and altered precipitation treatment interactions. Final models for M2 included warming as the only fixed effect, because no altered precipitation treatments were applied in this experiment. Model results can be found in
