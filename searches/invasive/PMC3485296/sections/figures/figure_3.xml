  <title>Relationship between 
   <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover categories and total species richness by growth form (vines are included within herbs and woody species include shrubs and trees) and woody (shrubs and trees).

  <p>Lines within the box represent the median values of the number of species found within each invasion category; the bottom and top edges of the box represent 25th and 75th percentiles of all data, respectively; the bottom and top bars represent 5th and 95th percentiles. ANOVA-GLM (quasi-Poisson error distribution); ferns: F
   <sub>4,119</sub> = 3.55, P = 0.009; herbs: F
   <sub>4,119</sub> = 11.44, P = 0.009, woody species: F
   <sub>4,119</sub> = 13.13, P&lt;0.001 (
   <sup>a,b</sup>denote group differences detected by statistical analyses amongst
