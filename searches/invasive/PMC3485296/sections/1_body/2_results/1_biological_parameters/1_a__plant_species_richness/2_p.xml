<p>A significant decline in both native and introduced species richness was correlated to increasing

 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover (&gt;60%) contained on average 56% fewer species than sites with medium to low cover (&lt;60%). Although fewer introduced species were recorded than native species (9 introduced species, 47 native), both groups showed proportionally lower levels of species richness when 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover was above 60%.
