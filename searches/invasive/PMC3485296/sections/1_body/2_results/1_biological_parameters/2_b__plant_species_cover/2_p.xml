<p>According to the similarity analysis (SIMPER analysis results) in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048106-t001">Table 1</xref>, site dissimilarity was better explained by species cover (85.8%) than species presence/absence (71.4%). A lower average cover of most species was associated with high 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover (&gt;60%) when compared to sites with medium to low covers (&lt;60%). The endemic 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata</italic> and the introduced 
 <italic>Cestrum auriculatum</italic> trees exhibited the highest cover in the study area. These two species together contributed 14.9% of the total percentage of dissimilarity in species cover. The most notable difference in cover between sites with low and high cover of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> was seen in the native herbs 
 <italic>Ichnanthus nemorosus</italic> and 
 <italic>Blechum pyramidatum,</italic> and the native shrub 
 <italic>Chiococca alba</italic> (92%, 95% and 82% lower respectively). Conversely, a high cover of the endemic vine 
 <italic>Passiflora colinvauxii</italic> was associated with high 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover.
