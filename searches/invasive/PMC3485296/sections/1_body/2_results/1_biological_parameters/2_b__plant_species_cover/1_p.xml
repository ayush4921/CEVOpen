<p>Species cover of all of the growth form groups showed a significant difference with 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048106-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Fern cover was significantly less in sites where 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover was above 80% (ANOVA-GLM; F
 <sub>4,119</sub> = 9.54, P&lt;0.001). On average, fern cover was about 48% less in sites with high cover. Herb, shrub and tree cover were also significantly lower when 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover was over 60% (ANOVA-GLM; herbs: F
 <sub>4,119</sub> = 20.86, P&lt;0.001, shrubs: F
 <sub>4,119</sub> = 7.27, P&lt;0.001; trees: F
 <sub>4,119</sub> = 35.41, P&lt;0.001). On average, cover values of herbs, shrubs and trees were 82, 78 and 68% less respectively with &gt;60% cover of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic>. The canopy layer (&gt;2 m) was also much less.
