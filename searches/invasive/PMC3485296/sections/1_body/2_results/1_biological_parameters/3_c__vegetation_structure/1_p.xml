<p>A slight change in vegetation structure was associated with increased 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048106-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Vegetation in areas with a 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover less than 20% was dominated by an under-storey (0–0.5 m) composed mainly of ferns (
 <italic>Asplenium auritum</italic> and 
 <italic>Blechnum occidentale</italic>) and herbs (
 <italic>Ichnanthus nemorosus</italic> and 
 <italic>Blechum pyramidatum</italic>) and a prominent canopy (&gt;2 m) dominated by the endemic tree 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata</italic>. Mid-storey vegetation (0.5–2 m) was almost absent and dominated by a few shrubs such as 
 <italic>Chiococca alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Tournefortia rufo–sericea</italic>). In contrast, with 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover above 60%, the under-storey and the mid-storey layers were dominated by 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic>. The density of the canopy layer decreased from 80% to 40%.
