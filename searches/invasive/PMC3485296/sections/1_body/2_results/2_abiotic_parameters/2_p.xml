<p>In general there were no significant differences in soil nutrient composition or pH between sites with high (&gt;80%) and low (&lt;20% cover) 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048106-t002">Table 2</xref>). Although the mean values of soil parameters in sites with high 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover were higher than those with low cover, the difference was significant only when comparing NO
