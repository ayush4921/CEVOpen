<p>A linear model showed a negative relationship between 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover and the proportion of light intensity reaching the understorey (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048106-g006">Figure 6</xref>). At high 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>niveus</italic> cover (&gt;80%), light intensity reaching the under-storey was about 94% lower than the amount of light reaching the mid-storey. In contrast, in sites with a low cover of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> (&lt;20% cover), the light intensity reaching the under-storey was about 45% of that reaching the mid-storey.
