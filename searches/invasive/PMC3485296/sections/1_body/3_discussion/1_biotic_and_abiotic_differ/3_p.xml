<p>The strong correlation presented here demonstrates a probable negative impact of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover on the species richness of the resident plant community of the Scalesia forest. Species richness in each growth form was significantly lower with higher 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover, and overall more than halved when 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover was above 60%. This indicates that the threat of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> may be generalized across all life forms in the recipient community, although ferns may slightly more resilient.
