<p>In terms of abiotic parameters, sites highly infested by 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> had a slightly higher amount of nutrients available in the soil. Changes in soil properties are often recorded in invaded systems. This may be due to an altered species diversity or composition 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Ehrenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Ehrenfeld2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, or due to the invasive species itself, often noted with the invasion of nitrogen fixing species that helps in the invasion process at the detriment of the native flora 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Ehrenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Ehrenfeld2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Higher nutrient concentrations in the topsoil have also been reported in areas infested by some invasive 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> spp. 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Caplan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Innis1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, thus it might have been expected to find a more profound difference in soil nutrients between sites with low and high cover of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic>. It is possible that the invasion of the Scalesia forest has been too recent 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Itow1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> to have a major effect on soil nutrient status, or there may be one or more over-riding factors that mask any correlatory patterns.
