<p>We found that a high cover of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> was associated with lower plant species richness of both native and non-native species, lower cover, and a simplified vegetation structure. While we acknowledge that the data are correlatory, they support perceptions that 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> invasion is harmful to the Galapagos vegetation communities 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Rentera1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and concur with current understanding of the impacts of invasive plants on natural ecosystems and in particular to those associated with invasion by the genus 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> worldwide.
