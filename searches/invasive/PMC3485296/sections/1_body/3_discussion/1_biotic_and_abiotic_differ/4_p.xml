<p>Native species composition (measured by cover and similarity) appears to be slightly more sensitive to higher 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover than richness. Tree species contributed most to compositional dissimilarities between sites with high 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover and sites with medium to low cover, especially the endemic 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata,</italic> and the natives 
 <italic>Chiococca alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Ichnanthus nemorosus</italic> and 
 <italic>Blechum pyramidatum</italic>. The anomaly is the endemic vine 
 <italic>Passiflora colinvauxii</italic> whose presence and cover was correlated positively with 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover. 
 <italic>Passiflora colinvauxii</italic> is present in even the most disturbed systems across Santa Cruz (M. Trueman personal communications).
