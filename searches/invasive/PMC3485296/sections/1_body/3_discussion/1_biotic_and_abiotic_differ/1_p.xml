<p>Despite the great threat posed by invasive plants to the natural ecosystems in Galapagos, almost no impact studies have been carried out there to date

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This study focussed on one of the worst weeds in Galapagos, and its impact on one of the most threatened natural vegetation types, with an aim to determine if the information can help in improving the effectiveness of habitat restoration. The invasion of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> in the Scalesia forest began no longer than 15 years ago 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Itow1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Therefore, the documented high densities of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> have developed recently over much of the study area 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Rentera1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Lawesson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> so it is not known if the patterns we found may change with time. We also acknowledge that our study covered a limited area, a single sampling period at that it was correlatory in nature.
