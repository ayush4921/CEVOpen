<p>This management aim contrasts sharply with the current management objective which is to eliminate 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> from the area. The intensive management approach is partly based on the fact that the area is a tourist site and the forest along the trails is kept ‘clean’ in order to demonstrate the original highland ecosystem to visitors. It is also based on the fact that there have been many successful mammalian eradication programmes in Galapagos (e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Atkinson2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Carrin1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>) leading to the false expectation that all invasive species can be eradicated. However, the expense of this approach ($US 400 ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year
 <sup>−1</sup>) means that only a small area can be under active management, and the resultant disturbance of this highly intensive approach facilitates further invasion of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> and other species.
