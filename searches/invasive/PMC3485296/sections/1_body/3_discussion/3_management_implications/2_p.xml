<p>If the aim of management is to reduce 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> below a threshold of impact on the ecology of the system, we suggest that a conservative maximum of 40% 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover could be a suitable management target. This management target could also act as a guide for the development of any biological control agent. In the case that land managers in the Galapagos have difficulty estimating 40% cover, our results indicate that three species could potentially act as indicators of ecosystem-level impact. The absence of 
 <italic>Chiococca alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Ichnanthus nemorosus</italic> and 
 <italic>Blechum pyramidatum</italic>, may indicate the threshold has been passed and hence provide a useful rule of thumb. The shrub, 
 <italic>Chiococca alba</italic> may be the best choice for an indicator because it is long-lived and can be easily identified by people working in land management.
