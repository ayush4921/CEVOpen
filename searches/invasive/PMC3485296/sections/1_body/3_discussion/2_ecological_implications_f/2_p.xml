<p>We believe that 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> may not be directly responsible for the differences in biological parameters reported here, but it probably contributes to a negative feedback cycle. 
 <italic>Rubus niveus</italic> is a gap loving species, and although the canopy cover of an intact Scalesia forest is almost 100%, it is not dense and there is sufficient light to allow the existence of understorey growth forms 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Itow2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Dense stands of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> are often found in open canopy areas and while there is no evidence that 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> is causing the mortality of mature canopy species in the Scalesia forest, it is preventing species recruitment. The invasion process may also be helped by the dieback events mentioned above.
