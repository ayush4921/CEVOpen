<p>Species diverse communities are often thought to be highly competitive and resistant to invasion

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Ehrenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and forests such as the one studied here have a very simple vegetation structure and species composition 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The Scalesia forest is dominated by the short lived tree 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata</italic> and a few sparse shrub species, suggesting that there are vacant niches 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Itow1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In addition, 
 <italic>S. pedunculata</italic> experiences a periodic massive dieback as a mechanism for regeneration 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Adsersen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Jger2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. As invasive plants normally fill unoccupied canopy spaces and may spread rapidly with forest disturbance such as treefall events, storm damage and stand dieback 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Jger3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, it would suggest that this forest type is highly susceptible to invasion.
