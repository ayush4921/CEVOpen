<p>While 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> has only reached high densities in the Scalesia forest in the last 5 years 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Rentera1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> we can already see that these high densities are correlated to low light levels in the ground stratum, causing changes in the micro-climate normally present in the forest. An abundance of canes and a dense foliar layer produced by 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> creates a dark and wet habitat that is unlikely to be suitable for the recruitment of shade intolerant native species 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Macdonald1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, which dominate this vegetation type and include 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata</italic>

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Itow3" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. In addition, 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> is a scrambling species that may smother native plants, leading to a dense monotypic thicket with little other vegetation present. The ability to regenerate also depends on the available seed bank. It logically follows that as 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> density increases, the cover of native plants will decrease and so will their seed production. In addition to effects on individual species, a reduction in species richness and cover may also change ecosystem functioning (e.g. mutualisms such as pollination and seed dispersal) and services

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Loreau1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. A similar pattern has been observed in another invaded upland community on the island, where a 7-year study showed that the presence of 
 <italic>Cinchona pubescens</italic> was correlated with a reduction in species diversity and cover of most species by at least 50% within the invaded area, compared to the control site
