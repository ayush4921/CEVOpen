<p>On Santa Cruz Island, the Scalesia forest is situated within the humid zone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048106-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and receives a mean annual precipitation of approximately 1845 mm 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Trueman1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Soils are up to 1 m deep, of basaltic origin, well weathered, and sandy loam in texture 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Laurelle1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This humid zone habitat is the most fertile in the archipelago; the forest is dominated by the endemic tree 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata</italic> and constitutes the habitat of many endemic and native species. Historically, Scalesia forest has been cleared extensively so that only 1% of this habitat type remains on Santa Cruz Island

 <italic>R. niveus</italic>. The Scalesia forest at Los Gemelos, a 200 ha fragment within the Galapagos National Park on Santa Cruz Island, is one of the best remnants of this moist vegetation type in Galapagos
