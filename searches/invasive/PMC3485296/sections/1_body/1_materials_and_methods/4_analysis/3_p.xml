<p>Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to assess the relationship between the 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover categories and the abiotic and biological parameters. ANOVAs were used to test the significance of parameters. SIMPER analysis (in PRIMER) was used to determine the contribution of each species to the average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index between two 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover categories that represent the grouping of the 5 categories used in previous analyses (0–60%, n = 86; 60–100%, n = 38). This grouping into two was based on previous statistical analysis that indicated a significant difference in species diversity when 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover was 60% or greater. This method of analysis determines which species contribute most to the differences, i.e. which species cover was correlated most closely with 
 <italic>R</italic>.
