<p>Seventy nine species of

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. There is anecdotal and quantitative evidence that these species have negative long term impacts on natural ecosystems, preventing the regeneration of native species

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Tassin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, due to high competitive abilities for resources (such as water, nutrients, space and light), high growth rate, rapid maturity and multiple modes of reproduction 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Caplan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For example, the dense canopy produced by 
 <italic>R. fruticosus</italic> excludes light from the soil surface, effectively dominating other species in the ground stratum 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Groves1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the early stages of invasion 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> spp. will grow over, or occupy gaps within native vegetation and in later stages they can severely restrict regeneration in native forests
