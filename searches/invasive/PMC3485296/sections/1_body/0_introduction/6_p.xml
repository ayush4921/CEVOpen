<p>Hence, the broad aim of this study was to increase knowledge on the effects of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> on the remnant 
 <italic>S. pedunculata</italic> forest at Los Gemelos in Santa Cruz to help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its management. Our specific objectives were twofold: Firstly, we assessed differences in the vascular plant diversity, cover and structure of native communities of the Scalesia forest at Los Gemelos along a 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover gradient. Secondly, assuming that 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> actually is the cause of these differences, we determined a potential threshold level of cover for impacts on native plant diversity and cover. We hope that this information can help increase cost effectiveness in conservation management.
