 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Vitousek2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. At the ecosystem level, invasive species can change nutrient cycling, hydrology and fire regimes. At the community level, they may affect vegetation structure, trophic links, availability of space, water, nutrients, light, pollinators and soil properties necessary for germination
