 <italic>Rubus niveus</italic> is considered the worst alien plant species in the Galapagos archipelago 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Rentera1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Renteria1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In spite of this, to date, no quantitative study has been carried out on its impact there. This species was introduced for agricultural purposes to Santa Cruz Island in the late 1960s and to San Cristóbal Island in the early 1970s 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Lawesson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Subsequently, it has been discovered in Floreana Island (2000), two volcanoes of Isabela Island (Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul (2000)), and Santiago Island (2001). 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> should be considered a transformer species: one that changes the character, condition, form or nature of ecosystems over a substantial area 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Pyek1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It can invade grass, bracken, shrub land and forest alike. It forms dense thickets up to 4 m high, displacing native vegetation and threatening native communities such as the 
 <italic>Scalesia pedunculata</italic> forest 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Rentera2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Richardson2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Soria1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In the agricultural zone, 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> has spread aggressively and as a result the land is useless for agriculture, causing serious economic problems for the farmers. It is already a widespread and serious problem on Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal islands. On the islands where it has been more recently introduced, it is spreading rapidly, especially following the eradication of introduced herbivores, and has proven difficult to eradicate, and expensive to manage 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Renteria1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. For example, managing 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> in the remnant 
 <italic>S. pedunculata</italic> forest in Santa Cruz Island, costs the Galapagos National Park Service approximately $US 400 ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Garca1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, this investment is made with little understanding of either the impact of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> on native plant communities or whether the control is effective in reducing 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> density to below a threshold of impact on the forest.
