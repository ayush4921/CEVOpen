<p>In invasive species biology, correlations of densities of a whole range of non-native taxa have often been used to infer causality of native biodiversity loss (e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Rosenthal1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). However, caution is needed in inferring causation from correlative studies as it can lead to misunderstanding 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Stromberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Two ways to improve the demonstration of causality in correlative studies of plant invasions are to measure change over time, or to develop a sampling strategy that accounts for both spatial heterogeneity at a landscape scale and stochastic events

 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Ujvari1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. While demonstrating impact through experimental manipulation is preferable 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Simao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, studies of this type are labour intensive. In the few cases where they have been carried out, results indicate that the mechanism for reduction in the richness and relative abundance of native species can be direct (i.e. competition) or as an indirect consequence of habitat disturbance 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-MacDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0048106-Didham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, where no impact is found, it is possible that the long time lag between cause and effect means that evidence may only become apparent in the future
