 <p>Originally from Asia, 
  <italic>Rubus niveus</italic> has become one of the most widespread invasive plant species in the Galapagos Islands. It has invaded open vegetation, shrubland and forest alike. It forms dense thickets up to 4 m high, appearing to displace native vegetation, and threaten the integrity of several native communities. This study used correlation analysis between a 
  <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover gradient and a number of biotic (vascular plant species richness, cover and vegetation structure) and abiotic (light and soil properties) parameters to help understand possible impacts in one of the last remaining fragments of the Scalesia forest in Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. Higher cover of 
  <italic>R. niveus</italic> was associated with significantly lower native species richness and cover, and a different forest structure. Results illustrated that 60% 
  <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover could be considered a threshold for these impacts. We suggest that a maximum of 40% 
  <italic>R. niveus</italic> cover could be a suitable management target.
