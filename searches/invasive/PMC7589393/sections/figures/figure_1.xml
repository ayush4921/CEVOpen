 <caption>
  <p>Principal coordinate analysis based on weighted Unifrac distances of the bacterial community inhabiting the endosphere (spheres), rhizosphere (squares) and bulk soil (triangles) (
   <bold>a</bold>). Types of communities were split in two plots to observe the effect of elevation differences on rhizosphere and soil (
   <bold>b</bold>) and on endosphere samples (
   <bold>c</bold>). Percentage of community variance explained by each axis is indicated in parentheses and PERMANOVA pseudo-F and 
   <italic>p</italic>-values for elevation and compartment effect are reported in the text. Symbol color indicate sites, symbols in red shades are found at high elevation and blue shade at low elevation.
