 <caption>
  <p>Heat-maps based on pair-wise SIMPER analysis showing the scaled abundances of the first 30 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that are primarily responsible for differences in bacterial community composition between high and low elevation in three types of communities: Soil (
   <bold>A</bold>), Rhizosphere (
   <bold>B</bold>) and endosphere (
   <bold>C</bold>). Sites label is located at the top of each column (H = high elevation; L = low elevation). The colors of the taxa names indicate the Phylum to which they belong.
