  <p>Potential function differences among elevations in each type of community. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Relative abundance of different functions based on the FAPROTAX database in the three types of communities. Elevation effect was tested with aligned rank transform for non-parametric factorial and significant differences are indicated with asterisks. Triangle symbols indicate potential functions that were increased in sites with a tendency to be higher in high or low elevation sites. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Potential soil denitrification activity. Different letters indicate significant difference among elevations (t-Welch test 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
