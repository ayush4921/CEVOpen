 <caption> Principal coordinate analysis based on weighted Unifrac distances of the bacterial community inhabiting the endosphere (spheres), rhizosphere (squares) and bulk soil (triangles) ( a). Types of communities were split in two plots to observe the effect of elevation differences on rhizosphere and soil ( b) and on endosphere samples ( c). Percentage of community variance explained by each axis is indicated in parentheses and PERMANOVA pseudo-F and p-values for elevation and compartment effect are reported in the text. Symbol color indicate sites, symbols in red shades are found at high elevation and blue shade at low elevation. </caption>
