  <p>Relative ASV composition in 
   <italic>Elytrigia atherica</italic> endosphere, rhizosphere and soil from each site at high salt marsh elevation (sites H1–H3) and low elevation (L1–L3). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Bar plot showing the phyla with at least 0.5% abundance, “Other” indicate the group of taxa with less than 0.5% abundance. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Phyla associated with either high or low elevation in each type of sample. Box plot shows root-mean-squared error resulted of the forward selection method. The apparent discrimination accuracy of these balances is 1.
