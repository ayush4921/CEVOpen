 <caption> Potential function differences among elevations in each type of community. ( a) Relative abundance of different functions based on the FAPROTAX database in the three types of communities. Elevation effect was tested with aligned rank transform for non-parametric factorial and significant differences are indicated with asterisks. Triangle symbols indicate potential functions that were increased in sites with a tendency to be higher in high or low elevation sites. ( b) Potential soil denitrification activity. Different letters indicate significant difference among elevations (t-Welch test p &lt; 0.05). </caption>
