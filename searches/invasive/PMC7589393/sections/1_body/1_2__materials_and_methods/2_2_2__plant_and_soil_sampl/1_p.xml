<p>In each plot, three PVC cylinders (Ø 10 cm; 10 cm high) were hammered into the soil, dug out with the alive 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> plants and placed in sterile plastic bags. For measuring the Specific Leaf Area (SLA), the third leave counting from the top of three healthy plants from each plot were clipped and pasted on a sheet of paper with transparent tape. The sheets contained scales of known length for calibration and were scanned. Leaf area was calculated using ImageJ version 1.52n (US National Institutes of Health). Leaves were dried in the oven at 60 °C for 72 h, weighted (to the nearest 0.1 mg) and SLA was calculated by dividing the sum of the three leaves’ area by the total dry mass [
