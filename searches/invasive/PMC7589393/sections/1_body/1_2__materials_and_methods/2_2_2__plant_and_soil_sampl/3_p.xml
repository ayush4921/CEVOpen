<p>Six cores of bulk soil (Ø 3.5 cm: 10 cm depth) at random points inside the plot were taken and placed in a sterile plastic bag, which was sealed and transported to the laboratory on the same day. In the laboratory, any plant material was removed from the soil, after which the soil was sieved (4 mm mesh size) and homogenized to represent a composite sample. From each composite sample, 10 g of soil was placed in a sterile tube and frozen at −20 °C for DNA extraction. Approximately 500 g soil was kept at 4° C for physicochemical measurements and potential denitrification rate (PDR). Soil physicochemical parameters measured were texture, pH, moisture content, soil organic matter content (SOM), the content of sodium (Na), total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and nitrogen in nitrate and nitrite (N-NO
 <sup>3−</sup>, N-NO
 <sup>2−</sup>) and ammonium (N-NH
 <sup>4+</sup>). For detailed methods see
