<p>Data analyses were carried out in R v3.6.2 (R-Core-Team, 2017). The collinearity between salt marsh height above sea level and estimated flooding frequency was VIF &gt;10; therefore, we only report flooding frequency as a predictor variable. To test relationships between soil abiotic parameters, plant traits and site characteristics, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the scaled and centered variables using the “prcomp” function from the stats package.</p>
