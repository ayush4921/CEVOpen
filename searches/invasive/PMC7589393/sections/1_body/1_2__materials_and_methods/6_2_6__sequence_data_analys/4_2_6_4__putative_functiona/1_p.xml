<p>Functional profiles of bacteria ASVs were predicted using the FAPROTAX (v1.2: [
 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]) database, from which nine functions relevant for this study were selected: cellulolysis, chitinolysis, fermentation, ligninolysis, nitrification, nitrogen fixation, ureolysis and xylanolysis. For this, the bulk soil and rhizosphere samples were normalized to 10,118 and 4520 sequences, respectively, to increase sampling depth in more diverse communities. Differences on the predicted functional profiles among elevations in each compartment were assessed by a Welch 
 <italic>t</italic>-test using a “t.test” function in R. Potential denitrification activity was measured following [
