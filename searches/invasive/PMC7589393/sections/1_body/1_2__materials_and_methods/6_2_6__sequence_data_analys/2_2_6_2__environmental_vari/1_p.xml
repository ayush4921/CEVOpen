<p>To visualize which environmental variables and plant traits were influencing the bacterial community compositions, we constructed a Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity distances with the ordination function in “phyloseq”. Then, we obtained a stepwise model from the constrained ordination method to know which environmental parameters were influencing the bacterial community composition with the function “ordistep” in the vegan package. A prior collinearity test of the variables was performed with the Hmisc package. Moreover, a mantel test was used to detect linear relationships between dissimilarity matrices of the plant traits and plant-associated bacteria in endosphere and rhizosphere with the function “mantel” with Pearson correlation method in the “vegan” package.</p>
