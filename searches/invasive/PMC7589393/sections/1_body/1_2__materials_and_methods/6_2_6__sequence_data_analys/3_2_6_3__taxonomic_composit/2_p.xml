<p>Further we investigated the endosphere bacterial communities in more detail. First we calculated the proportion of taxa found exclusively in endosphere and the proportion of ASVs shared among the three types of samples using UpSet package [
 <xref rid="B49-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and visualized them in Venn diagrams. A similar approach was used to calculate and visualize the shared endosphere ASVs among elevations. In order to determine the endosphere taxa closely associated to 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> and disentangle how these taxa vary according to elevational ecotypes, we filtered the ASV endosphere dataset to obtain the endosphere core bacterial community. The filtering was based on ASVs present in 90% which accounted for at least 0.0001% of the total ASV relative abundance of the endosphere samples. The relative abundance of the core community in endosphere samples was compared among elevations using a 
 <italic>t</italic>-test using a “t.test” function.
