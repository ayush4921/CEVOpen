<p>Relative abundances of the major taxa were visualized in bar plots and differences of phyla sample types were calculated using a Kruskal–Wallis test with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the function “summarize_taxonomy” from the mctools package. To identify the phyla whose relative abundance were associated to either HE or LE elevation in each type of sample, we applied a stepwise algorithm implemented in the “selbal” package [
 <xref rid="B46-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This method was selected for the advantages to preserve the compositional data principles and that the effect of the stage of succession can be considered as a covariate in the model. The abundance dataset of the ten more abundant phyla along with a group named “other” comprising the low abundant phyla were added to the model and the most optimal variables were represented graphically. Moreover, to asses which ASVs were responsible for the dissimilarity among elevations in the three community types we applied the similarity percentage (SIMPER) method based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity distance [

 <xref rid="B48-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). This method ranked the ASVs which contributed to the dissimilarity among elevations and we selected the top 30 ASV and their abundance was scaled by site to be visualized in a heatmap with the function “heatmap.2” of the ggplot package.
