<p>Rhizosphere and endosphere DNA extraction was performed following standard procedures with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, belowground plant tissue was separated from aboveground tissue using sterile scissors. Loose soil was manually removed, and the total root biomass was split for rhizosphere and endosphere procedures. The rhizosphere samples consisted of 4–5 g of roots and ~2 g rhizomes, placed in a flask containing 180 mL sterile sodium pyrophosphate (Na
 <sub>4</sub>PO
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>) (0.1%) to which some sterile 3-mm glass beads were added, shaken at 200 rpm at 25 °C for 1 h. The suspension was transferred to a 50 mL tube and 3200×

The roots of endosphere samples were washed thoroughly with tap water until soil particles were not visible. Then, 4 g of roots and ~2 g rhizomes were placed into a flask containing 150 mL sterile distilled water plus 100 mL sterile 2% Tween 20 and sonicated for 5 min (Branson 1510 Ultrasonic Cleaner, Danbury, CT). The roots were then surface disinfected by immersion in 1.5% sodium hypochlorite and mixed at 200 rpm at 25 °C for 10 min, in 96% Ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (3 times for 3 min each). To check for sterility, we took the last rinsing 100 µl of water and tissue from the last rinsing for blotting on R2A and 869 1/10 plates. The plates were checked for 2 to 5 days [
