<p>To partially amplify the 16S rRNA gene, 25 µL PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using the FastStart High Fidelity (Roche) kit following the protocol by [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but using 10 ng of DNA sample instead of 5 ng. We used a 515F–926R primer set, spanning the variable region V4-5 [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The forward primer also contained a barcode sequence (10-mer) to allow pooling of multiple samples in one sequencing run. Amplicon size was confirmed in 1% agarose gels, and the three PCR products of each sample were pooled together to reduce PCR bias. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The fluorescence of the purified amplicons was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on a TECAN infinite M200 Pro (Maennedorf, Switzerland) plate reader using at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission. Amplicons from all samples were pooled in equimolar concentration (30 ng/sample) and sequenced at Genewiz (South Plainfield, USA) on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer using a 2 × 300-bp read configuration. The obtained sequences were deposited in the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the BioProject ID PRJNA642700.
