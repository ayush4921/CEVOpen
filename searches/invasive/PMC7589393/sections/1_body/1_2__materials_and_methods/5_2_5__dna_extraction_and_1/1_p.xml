<p>DNA from soil, rhizosphere and endosphere samples was isolated using 0.5 g of bulk soil or rhizosphere soil or 0.5 mL suspension, using the DNeasy Power Soil kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Except we performed the initial incubation with 50 µL lysozyme (10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 35 °C for 30 min and added 0.2 g 0.1 mm sterile glass beads to improve DNA isolation. Extracted DNA was quantified using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
