<p>We showed that ecotypes of 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> differ in root endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria composition. This difference in bacterial community composition as a function of saltwater inundation frequency is partly due to direct effects of flooding frequency on plant phenotype, as well as the indirect effect of salinity differences on soil bacterial communities. The LE ecotype harbors more halophylic bacterial species that may contribute to the saline stress alleviation, while the HE ecotype may be more associated to endomycorrhiza species to increase water uptake in dry summer periods. Together the results suggest that the dynamic genotypic and phenotypic adaptation of this holobiont to diverse local salt marsh conditions can be also linked with the establishment of microbial interactions with local free-living microorganisms.
