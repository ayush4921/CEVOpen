<p>Significant environmental changes pose challenges for plants, as they must respond through ecological and/or evolutionary adaptations. For instance, plant (genetic) adaptation to new environmental conditions might affect plant–microbiome interactions whereas the capacity of microorganisms to rapidly adapt environmental and host changes can alter host evolution [

 <italic>E. atherica</italic> exclusively dominated at low inundation frequency at sites situated high above sea level, but for some decades now it has spread to low elevation sites, causing a decrease in the diversity of plants down the elevational gradient [
