<p>In addition to the effects of soil edaphic factors on soil microbiome along salt marsh elevation, the high variability in flooding frequency—which translates into variation in soil aeration and salinity—influences soil parameters along vegetation successional stages [

 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our results indeed showed that the bulk soil bacterial composition was correlated to successional stage, and we suggest that impact of plant litter quantity and quality might explain this relationship. Plant litter mass was higher in HE sites, with the oldest site (H1) having the highest amount of litter. This accumulation of litter through time is due to dominance of

In addition, presence of high-quality litter from subdominant plant species varies across successional stages and elevation, hence, their litter quality and root-exudates also may influence the dissimilarity of saprophytic microbial communities found in bulk soils [

Overall, the observed effects of elevation and successional gradient on soil bacterial communities are in agreement with previous findings that identified sodium and organic matter content as the most important abiotic factors driving the soil microbiome assembly within a site and across successional stages, respectively [
