<p>Multiple edaphic factors, such as pH, moisture and organic matter content shape soil bacterial community composition. In the soil of LE we observed higher contents of clay, sodium, moisture, organic matter and nitrates than in that of HE, which is in accordance with previous studies in Wadden sea salt marshes [

 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Despite the richer nutrient content observed in LE sites, this did not result in higher bacterial richness in bulk soils compared to HE soils, as indicated by lower bacterial phylogenetic diversity in LE compared to HE. Given that phyla such as Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria, which are less tolerant to sodium-rich and waterlogged conditions [
 <xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], showed an evident decline from HE to LE sites, we speculate that the lower diversity observed in LE is caused by the decrease in the abundance of bacterial phyla sensitive to sodium, which is high in LE soils [
