<p>A prerequisite for accepting the hypothesis that the bacterial communities associated with the endosphere of each plant ecotype are linked to their adaptation to environmental conditions consists in the ability of plants to select for bacterial traits that alleviate stress. For instance, nitrogen is often the limiting soil nutrients restraining plant growth in saline environments [

In this context, interaction with microbes could contribute to nitrogen acquisition, as demonstrated by the higher abundance of taxa with the potential ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in the endosphere of ecotypes from HE, which showed lower soil nitrogen content, especially in 53-year-old sites [
