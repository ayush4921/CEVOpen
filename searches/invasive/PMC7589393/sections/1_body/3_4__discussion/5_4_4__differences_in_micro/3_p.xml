<p>Finally, the difference in bacterial-ecotype interaction was also mirrored to other microbes, as observed for the endomycorrhiza-ecotype interaction. The association of mycorrhiza with 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> is facultative [
 <xref rid="B81-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]; hence, in waterlogged, very dry or saline soils colonization it is not favored due to low mycorrhizal inoculum potential [

 <xref rid="B83-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], explaining the low colonization in LE plants. However, even in low mycorrhizal colonization, mycorrhiza might increase 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> tolerance to higher soil sodium content in LE [
