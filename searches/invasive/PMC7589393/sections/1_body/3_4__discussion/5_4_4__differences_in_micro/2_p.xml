<p>The most abundant taxa found in the root endosphere, i.e., Gammaprotobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacterioidetes, are known as successful root colonizers in multiple plant species [

 <xref rid="B76-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Many of these endophytic genera positively impact plant growth by e.g., providing phytohormones, such as indole acetic acid, or modulating production of reactive oxygen species [

 <xref rid="B77-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Notably, we observed an enrichment of marine genera such as 
 <italic>Marinomonas</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp.—bacterial species that are associated with the endosphere of halophytes—in ecotypes from LE [

 <xref rid="B78-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. There is evidence that 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp. can contribute to plant growth [

 <xref rid="B79-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] by synthesizing 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which reduces the accumulation of ethylene in the plant, thus alleviating a common stress response (growth inhibition) associated with salinity [
 <xref rid="B80-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Therefore, a higher abundance of 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> in LE ecotype may indicate a higher ability of this ecotype to alleviate saline stress, which agrees with higher sodium content at LE elevation.
