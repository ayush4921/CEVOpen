<p>Salt marsh elevation modulates the composition of bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere both indirectly—i.e., via the impact of elevation on bulk soil communities that act as local bacterial species pool (see previous section)—and directly, through differences in exudation patterns and litter quality which are often associated with different plant species. In this study we demonstrated that plant ecotypes also have an important, direct impact on host-microbial interactions and rhizosphere community composition, given that each 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> ecotype, i.e., growing at HE or LE, harbors a distinct rhizosphere bacterial community. In the case of the LE ecotype, differences in rhizosphere composition could be explained by the ability of this ecotype to grow fast in response to higher rich-nutrient soil [

Regarding the HE ecotype, the differentiation in rhizosphere community composition was explained by the difference in the endomycorrhizal colonization, which its known to contribute to the rhizosphere bacterial community assemblage by stimulating some species while suppressing others [

 <xref rid="B66-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], corroborating our evidence on the potential role plant phenotypes in microbiome selection in the rhizosphere. This microbiome differentiation as a function of genotype and phenotype in both 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> [

 <xref rid="B68-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] leads us to suggest that the plant microbiome may play an important role in allowing these invasive species to successfully spread across the salt marsh.
