<p>The aim of the present study was to assess the extent to which the association between 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> and its bacterial communities was affected by elevation and its associated soil biotic (mycorrhiza presence, soil bacterial communities) and abiotic factors (flooding frequency, pH, nutrient content). Differences in plant-associated bacteria between salt marsh elevations could indicate that bacteria can potentially play an important role in 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic>â€™s range expansion within sites across elevations. We therefore sampled plants as well as rhizosphere and bulk soils from LE and HE sites in three locations across a salt marsh of a barrier island. Given that the level of interaction between plant roots and associated microbiome might be dependent on microbiome localization, we sampled the free-living soil bacterial communities, as well as those living around (rhizosphere) or in the roots (endosphere). Additionally, potential factors influencing these interactions, such as plant traits, root mycorrhizal colonization and soil physicochemical parameters were measured. We hypothesized that (i) salt marsh elevation will lead to differences in soil properties with higher levels of soil moisture and sodium content at LE and higher mycorrhizal colonization in HE plants. Moreover, we tested whether (ii) elevation drives soil, rhizosphere and endosphere bacterial (functional) composition. We expected that soil and rhizosphere bacterial composition, and their potential functions, are driven by elevation and thus inundation frequency. Moreover, we expected that the compositions of endosphere bacterial communities are partially independent from rhizosphere and bulk soil communities and specific to each plant ecotype, and therefore vary with the salt marsh elevation.
