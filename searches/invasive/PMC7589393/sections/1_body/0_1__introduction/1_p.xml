<p>Plants may show phenotypic and genotypic adaptations to particular stressful environmental conditions. Plant adaptation can be modulated by their associated microbes, which can contribute to fitness by providing metabolic capabilities and by modulating pathways’ increasing tolerance of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses or nutrient-limiting conditions [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of these phenotypic changes are expressed in response to an environmental cue, for example mycorrhizal fungi can change root morphology in low-P soils [

 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the ecological aspects of plant genotype and microbiome interactions have been largely studied, especially in the context of agriculture, the consequences of this microbially driven phenotypic plasticity on plant evolution remains poorly understood [

 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This evolutionary perspective, which requires an overview of patterns in plant–microbiome interactions and phenotype responses in natural ecosystems, might play an important role in plant range expansion and adaptation to global change scenarios. In this context, placing invasive plant species under the perspective of holobiont (plants plus associated microbiome) [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-01619" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] might improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving successful adaption and competitive advantage in new environmental conditions [
