<p>Plantâ€“microbe associations have an important role in plant competitive ability in terms of establishment, invasion and persistence in habitats. For example, comparing invasive species against rare plants, the former have shown a higher positive soil feedback attributed to a slower accumulation of pathogens compared to the latter [

However, the role of microbial interactions in plant invasion success in multi-stressed ecosystems, such as salt marshes, is currently poorly known [
