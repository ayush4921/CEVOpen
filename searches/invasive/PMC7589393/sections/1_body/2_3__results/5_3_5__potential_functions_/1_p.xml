<p>Functions related to organic matter degradation, such as rhizosphere xylanolysis, increased in LE. Soil ligninolysis tended to be higher in HE, while fermentation tended to be higher in LE (

Processes related to N-cycling, such as nitrogen fixation was enhanced in the HE endosphere, and also in the soil and rhizosphere but only in HE 53-year-old sites (

Potential denitrification activity was higher in LE soils than HE soils (t.ratio = âˆ’3.17, df = 3.59,
