 <italic>p</italic> = 0.027). Moreover, a difference between soil and rhizosphere bacterial communities due to stage of succession was observed (age of succession, df = 2, pseudo-F = 13.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but this difference was only between H1 (78 years old) and H2-H3 (53 years old), whereas no effect on stage of succession among LE sites was observed. Endosphere bacterial composition did not differ according to stage of succession. Similar clustering patterns were clear in the ordination of unweighted UniFrac and Brayâ€“Curtis distances, suggesting that low abundance ASVs also contributed to differences among elevations (
