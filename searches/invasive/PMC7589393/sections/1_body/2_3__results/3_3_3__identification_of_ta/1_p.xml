<p>Taxa abundance differed among the three type of communities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01619-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For instance, Proteobacteria abundance was significantly higher in the rhizosphere than in soil, 37.9% and 29.2%, respectively (KW FDR, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomyces were more abundant in soil (KW FDR, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than rhizosphere. The most dominant taxa in the endosphere was Proteobacteria and this phylum was more represented in LE sites compared to HE sites, comprising 91.3% of the ASV and 79.3%, respectively.
