<p>In soil, the 30 ASVs ranked as the principal ASVs that explained the separation between elevations represented 10.21% of the total Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity metric (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01619-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In HE soils higher abundances were found of 
 <italic>Chitinophagaceae</italic>, Acidobacteria, 
 <italic>Burkholderiaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Anaerolinaceae</italic>, while in LE soils 
 <italic>Cyclobacteriaceae</italic>, Alphaproteobacteria and 
 <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic> were more abundant. In the rhizosphere, these 30 ASVs comprised 10.22% of the total variance. The predominant taxa found at HE were 
 <italic>Chitinophagaceae</italic> and Betaproteobacteria, whereas in LE these were 
 <italic>Flavobacteriaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Saprospiraceae</italic> and Alphaproteobaceria such as 
 <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic>. In the root endosphere, the selected ASVs comprised 65% of the total variance, with 
 <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic> being more abundant in HE, and genera considered as marine, such as 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> and 
 <italic>Marinomonas</italic> in LE. However, in this type of community, the differences in composition were at lower taxonomic level because some genera were found at both elevations, for example, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic>.
