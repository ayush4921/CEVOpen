<p>Several site, plant and soil characteristics were driven by elevation, and soil and associated root bacterial communities followed the same pattern. HE sites had a higher percentage of sand, pH and ammonium content, which in turn resulted in a high mycorrhizal colonization and a strong influence on bacterial community structure (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-01619">Supplementary Material S9</xref>). Bacterial communities in H1 clustered apart from H2 and H3 due to the stage of vegetation succession, higher plant litter mass and lower C:N ratio found in this site. LE sites had a higher organic matter, moisture, sodium and nitrate content. These soil characteristics together with flooding with salt water influenced plant responses to inundation (e.g., higher specific leaf area), as well as plant–bacteria associations. The effect of environmental variables on bacterial communities was greater at LE, given that soil, rhizosphere and endosphere bacterial structures clustered together (

 <italic>p =</italic> 0.04) and ammonium content (F = 1.59, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) had a strongest influence on the soil bacterial community, whereas elevation (F = 2.54, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.010) and ammonium content (F = 1.46, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.025) strongly impacted the rhizosphere bacterial community. Moreover, rhizosphere but not endosphere bacterial communities were associated with plant traits (mantel
