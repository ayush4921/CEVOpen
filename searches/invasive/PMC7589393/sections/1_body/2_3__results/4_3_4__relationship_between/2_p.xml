<p>In order to identify which bacteria taxa were associated to 
 <italic>E. atherica</italic> regardless of their ecotype, we obtained the core endosphere. The core endosphere comprised 10 ASVs corresponding to 8 genera: 
 <italic>Acidibacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Altererytrobacter, Marinomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (2 ASVs), 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, 
 <italic>Sphigorhabdus</italic> and 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> (2 ASVs) which together represented 18.9% of total abundance in H1, 10.2% in H2, 17.1% in H3, 22.4% in L1, 49.4% in L2 and 33.2% in L3. The abundance of the core was higher in LE (35% ± 11) compared to HE (15.4% ± 3.73) (t = −2.76, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014) mainly due to enrichment of 
 <italic>Marinomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> (
