<p>We observed that both HE and LE endospheres shared around 60% of the ASVs with bulk and rhizosphere soil, while the rest was exclusive to root internal tissue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01619-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b). Moreover, ecotypes only shared 28.5% of ASVs in their root endosphere. The majority of non-shared ASVs were found in the endosphere community at HE (43.4%) compared to 28.1% in the endosphere at LE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01619-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). Importantly, the majority of ASVs that were exclusive to the roots were not found in the inner root of the other ecotype. For instance, in HE 85.5% of the total non-shared ASVs were found exclusively in HE and in LE was 75.6%. Together these results indicate that although endosphere communities at both elevations were shaped by the availability of local bacteria—as the majority of ASVs are transmitted horizontally from the exterior soil—those that are endosphere specific (around a third of their ASVs) are also ecotype specific.
