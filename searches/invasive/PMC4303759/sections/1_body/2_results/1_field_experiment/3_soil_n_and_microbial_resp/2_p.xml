<p>Between early and late sampling, microbial community composition in all treatments became more negative along PC axis 1 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F3">3</xref>; ANOSIM statistic = 0.21, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Early in the season, AC made microbial communities similar to native soil. This was due to decreases in an unidentified bacteria and an Actinomycetales, and increases in aMicrococcaceae, a Pseudomonas and a Flavobacterium species (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F2">2</xref>, ANOSIM statistic = 0.21,
