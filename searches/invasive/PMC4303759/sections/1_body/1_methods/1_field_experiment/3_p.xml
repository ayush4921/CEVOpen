<p>At each of the nine sites, seven 15 m × 15 m plots were established with a 5-m buffer between plots and the following treatments were applied randomly: four concentrations of coal-based AC, 100 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (100), 400 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (400), 700 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (700), 1000 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (1000), one wood-based AC at 1000 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (1000w) and a control that received the same physical disturbance and seeding as the treatments but no AC, 0 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (0). Each site also had one ‘complete’ control (CC) with the same physical disturbance but no AC or seed addition. Activated carbon used was a commercial grade, coal-based carbon powder with a 300 mesh size and iodine number (measure of pore content) &gt;500 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> and wood-based carbon with a 330 mesh size and iodine number &gt;500 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> (Carbon Activated Corporation, Compton, CA, USA).
