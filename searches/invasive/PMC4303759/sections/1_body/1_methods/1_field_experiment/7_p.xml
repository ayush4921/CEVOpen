<p>In 2011, to determine the effect of AC on N cycling rates, N mineralization rates were determined in the 0, 100, 1000 and CC plots for all nine sites using the buried bag technique (
 <xref rid="PLU072C39" ref-type="bibr">Robertson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1999
 </xref>). Briefly, in early June, 10, 4-cm-diameter core samples were collected to a depth of 15 cm in each plot. Five samples were processed immediately and five were placed individually into polyethylene bags and reburied for 1 month. From each core sample, 10 g of soil was extracted in 100 mL of 2.0 M KCl. Inorganic N was determined from colorimetric analysis of KCl extracts using a Lachat autoanalyser (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO, USA). Rates of microbial mineralization were calculated using the change in NH
