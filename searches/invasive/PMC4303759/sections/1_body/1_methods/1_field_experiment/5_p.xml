<p>Vegetation responses to AC treatments were assessed using the point-intercept method. Vegetation was assessed in each of nine 1-m
 <sup>2</sup> subplots located in a 3 m × 3 m grid within each plot. Vegetation surveys were performed during the peak growing season (June) in 2011–2013. Additionally, germination success was assessed in three 10 cm by 10 cm in each of the nine subplots within each plot, in May 2011.
