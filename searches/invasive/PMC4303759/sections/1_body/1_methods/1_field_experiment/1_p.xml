<p>To test the effectiveness of AC in the field at a large scale, an experiment was conducted in nine former agricultural fields located in the Methow Valley, WA, USA (48°37′N, 107°10′W, 580–880 m above sea level). Fields were on Newbon-Conconully soil series association (coarse-loamy, mixed mesic Typic Haploxerolls).
