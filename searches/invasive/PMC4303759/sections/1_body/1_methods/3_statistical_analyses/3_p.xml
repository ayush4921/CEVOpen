<p>To compare the effects of different AC concentrations, treatment effects in the 0, 100, 400, 700, 1000 and 1000w plots were tested on the percent cover of native species, non-native species and native : non-native ratio using a two-way randomized block design with repeated-measures and subsamples ANOVA. The fixed effect was treatment and year, and random effects were field and treatment within field. Treatment effects on germination, net N mineralization and nitrification rates were treated separately using a one-way randomized block design with repeated-measures and subsample ANOVA. For all tests, a post-hoc Tukeyâ€“Kramer method was used to adjust for Type I error and determine pairwise differences among least square means. Means from raw data are reported.</p>
