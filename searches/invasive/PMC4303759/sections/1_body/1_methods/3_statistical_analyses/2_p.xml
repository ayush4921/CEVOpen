<p>To test the effect of the high concentration treatment, treatment effects on the 0, 1000 and CC plots were tested on the percent cover of native species, the percent cover of non-native species and the ratio of native to non-native species (native : non-native) using a two-way randomized block design with repeated-measures and subsample analysis of variance (ANOVA). Fixed effects were treatment and year, and random effects were field and treatment within field.</p>
