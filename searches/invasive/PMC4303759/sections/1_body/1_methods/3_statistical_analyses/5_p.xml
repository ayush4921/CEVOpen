<p>For the greenhouse experiment, effects of treatment were tested on the ratio of native : non-native aboveground biomass, native aboveground biomass, non-native aboveground biomass, native belowground biomass and non-native belowground biomass using a three-way factorial in a completely randomized design ANOVA. Fixed effects were treatment, native species and non-native species; pots were considered replicates and included in residual effects. Additionally, monoculture non-native biomass was tested in a one-way factorial with treatment and non-native species as fixed effects. Post-hoc Tukey–Kramer was used to adjust for Type I error and determine pairwise differences among least-squared means. Prior to the analysis, pots with no total growth were removed from the dataset. Above- and belowground biomass raw values were square-root transformed and native : non-native aboveground ratio data were log-transformed to better meet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance. All tests were considered significant at the

 <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.10. All significant differences indicated in figures are at the 
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.05 level. All field and greenhouse analyses were conducted using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS for Windows v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
