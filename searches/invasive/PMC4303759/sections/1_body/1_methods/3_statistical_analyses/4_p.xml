<p>Differences in microbial community composition between 0, 1000 and native plots both early and late in the growing season were explored using principal component analyses. Operational taxonomic units not present in at least 10 % of the samples were removed from analyses because such uncommon organisms were unlikely to distinguish treatments. Operational taxonomic unit abundances determined for replicate cores within a plot were averaged prior to analyses. All analyses were performed using the Vegan package in ‘R’ (
