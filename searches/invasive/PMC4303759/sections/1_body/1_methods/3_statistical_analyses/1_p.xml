<p>Two sets of tests were conducted on the field data. First, to determine if results were similar to those from the previous small-scale experiment (
 <xref rid="PLU072C28" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski and Beard 2006</xref>), we tested the effect of the high concentration of AC on plant growth responses. Second, to determine at which concentration AC had measurable effects on plant growth, we tested the effects of multiple AC concentrations.
