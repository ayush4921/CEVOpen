<p>Three successful germinants of each species were planted per pot. After 3 weeks, the tallest individual of each species was allowed to remain in each pot. Greenhouse conditions were at a mean temperature of 22 °C and sodium lamps were used to maintain 14 h of light daily. All pots were watered daily. Pots were rotated within the greenhouse weekly. After 3 months aboveground biomass and belowground biomass for each species in each pot were dried at 70 °C until constant weight, weighed and recorded. For consistency with the field experiment, we refer to native species in the greenhouse experiment as native and non-native species as non-native.</p>
