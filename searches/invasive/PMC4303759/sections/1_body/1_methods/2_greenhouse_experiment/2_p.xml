<p>One native and one non-native plant species were grown in each pot. For the plant species listed below, all possible nativeâ€“non-native pairing combinations were replicated for each treatment. Each pairing was replicated 15 times in AC-live and control-live treatments, and 12 times in AC-sterile treatments. Species included the most common species found at the study site: three native grass species: 
 <italic>F. idahoensis</italic>, 
 <italic>K. macrantha</italic> and 
 <italic>P. spicata</italic>, and two native forbs: 
 <italic>L. sericeus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. sagittata</italic>, and five common non-native species: the grass 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> and four non-native forbs: 
 <italic>C. diffusa</italic>, 
 <italic>L. serriola</italic>, 
 <italic>Tragopogon dubius</italic> Scop. and 
 <italic>S. altissimum. B. sagittata</italic> grew in &lt;10 % of the pots and was removed from primary analysis. Non-native plant growth in the pots in which 
 <italic>B. sagittata</italic> never grew was used as a measure of the direct effects of AC and sterilization on non-native plants (i.e. in the absence of competitors). Native seeds were purchased and local Methow Valley varieties were used when possible (BFI Native Seeds). Non-native seeds were collected from the Methow Valley in summer 2011.
