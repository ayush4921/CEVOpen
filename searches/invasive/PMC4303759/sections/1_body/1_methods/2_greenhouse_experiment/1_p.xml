<p>To isolate the mechanism through which AC changes plant growth, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in an Agricultural Research Station greenhouse facility at Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA, from August to November 2011. A total of 740 1-L polyethylene pots (7.6 cm width and 20.3 cm height; Stuewe &amp; Sons, Model MT38, Tangent, Oregon, USA) were randomly assigned to one of three soil treatments: live soil with AC, sterile soil with AC and a control live soil. All pots were filled with a steam sterilized 6 : 1 ratio of sand and peat. The two treatments that received live soils (i.e. both AC live and control live) were inoculated with 5 % by volume field soil collected from the Methow Valley. Similar to the 1000 treatments in the field experiment, the two AC treatments received 1 % AC by mass, which was mixed throughout the pot. A coal-based, 300 mesh, commercial grade AC was used. To sterilize soils with minimal physical disruption, soils in ‘AC sterile’ treatments were inoculated with 5 % by volume gamma-irradiated (25 kGy) field soil prior to AC addition (JS8900 Batch Gamma Irradiator, Steris Isomedix, Temecula, CA, USA;
