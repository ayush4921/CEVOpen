<p>In a rare field test using AC, 
 <xref rid="PLU072C28" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski and Beard (2006)</xref> found that high concentrations (i.e. 1000 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>) of AC decreased non-native plant growth and increased native plant growth in small field plots. That research suggested that AC effects were caused by decreasing either allelopathy or plant–microbe communication but not likely due to changes in nutrient availability (
 <xref rid="PLU072C26" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="PLU072C27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The goals of the present study were 3 folds: (i) to test AC effectiveness in restoring native plant communities in large-scale treatments, (ii) to identify the lowest effective AC concentration and (iii) to determine whether AC effects on plant growth are microbially mediated or caused by influencing the effects of allelopathy. To address the first and second goals, we monitored plant composition in large (15 m × 15 m plots) plots treated with different concentrations of AC and control plots in nine non-native-plant-dominated fields. We used two approaches to address the third goal. First, we assessed how AC treatments and control plots affected soil microbial composition using pyrosequencing to describe the archaeal and bacterial communities. Second, to determine whether AC effects required living microbial communities, plant growth in live and sterilized AC-treated soils was compared in a greenhouse experiment.
