<p>One recently developed belowground approach that has been used to decrease invasive plant growth is the use of activated carbon (AC). Made from coal, nutshells or wood, AC is a highly porous substance that binds organic compounds through van der Waals force. Activated carbon is essentially a cleaner form of biochar from which everything except the carbon skeleton has been removed. Activated carbon adsorbs most organic compounds, but is poor at adsorbing alcohols, glycols and non-organic compounds (e.g. ammonia and nitrate;

Activated carbon is also different from reduced organic compounds (i.e. sugar or sawdust) in that AC does not provide resources to heterotrophic organisms and is therefore not expected to affect non-native plants by slowing nutrient cycling rates (
