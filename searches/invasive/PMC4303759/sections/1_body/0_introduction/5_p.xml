<p>Activated carbon has been used extensively in allelopathy research for its ability to bind organic molecules (

 <xref rid="PLU072C1" ref-type="bibr">Abhilasha 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)
 </xref> found that AC effects were sometimes present in live soils but not in sterilized soils, indicating that AC effects were sometimes caused by plant–microbe interactions. Further, 
 <xref rid="PLU072C27" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski (2011)</xref> found that AC addition changed soil microbial community composition and subsequent plant growth. The relative importance of these mechanisms remains unknown but in either case (i.e. allelopathy or plant–microbe communication), AC may be expected to decrease non-native growth.
