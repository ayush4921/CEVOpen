<p>It is necessary to consider the cost of AC application before considering broad use. Costs for tested AC concentrations are approximately: 100 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>: $454 ha
 <sup>−1</sup>, 400 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>: $1817 ha
 <sup>−1</sup>, 700 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>: $3180 ha
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1000 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>: $4543 ha
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1000 w g m
 <sup>−2</sup>: $5618 ha
 <sup>−1</sup>. Due to its high cost, AC is not a practical large-scale restoration tool. However, it may be useful for targeted treatments, in relatively small sites, such as restoring abandoned oil pad sites. Because AC is eliciting community changes by decreasing positive microbial interactions with non-native species, it is likely more beneficial to further research and explore techniques that manipulate particular plant–microbe interactions (i.e. through inoculation).
