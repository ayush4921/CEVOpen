<p>Native plant responses were not as strong in this study as in the previous smaller-scale field experiment (
 <xref rid="PLU072C28" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski and Beard 2006</xref>). This may have been because the larger-scale application techniques (i.e. tractor discing rather than hand mixing) used in the current study were likely to produce less consistent AC incorporation into the soil. Additionally, more than twice as much rain fell during the first spring of the large-scale experiment relative to the small-scale experiment (i.e. 21.5 versus 9.3 cm precipitation between March and May;

As a result, native plants established vigorously in control plots during the large-scale study, making it difficult for any treatments to increase native plant growth beyond seeding success. The fact that AC effects were observed in the greenhouse, small-scale study (
 <xref rid="PLU072C28" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski and Beard 2006</xref>) and the current large-scale study suggests that AC effects are consistent across a wide range of conditions.
