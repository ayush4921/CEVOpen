<p>There is rapidly growing interest in the use of biochar (

 <xref rid="PLU072C7" ref-type="bibr">Biederman and Harpole 2013</xref>). Our results suggest that AC effects on plant growth are fundamentally different than biochar effects on plant growth. Our results suggest that AC decreases plant growth by suppressing beneficial plant–microbe interactions, and that this benefits native plants by suppressing the growth of weeds that rely on fast growth rates. Thus, we suggest that most biochar is unlikely to be weed suppressive unless it has a very high C : N ratio (e.g. &gt;300 : 1) or it is applied at very high rates (i.e. &gt;5 % by volume of soil) that can interfere with plant–microbe communication (
