<p>Two other goals of this experiment were to test the effectiveness of (i) lower concentrations of AC and (ii) wood-based AC. We wanted to test the effectiveness of wood-based carbon because wood-based AC treatments would hold the benefit of fixing carbon into soils and may allow the development of on-site production. On-site carbon production could have the benefit of both removing woody materials that present a fire hazard while simultaneously fixing carbon in the soil. In both cases results were variable and therefore difficult to interpret. In the third year of the study, the native: non-native ratios were greater in 400, 700 and 1000 treatments suggesting that at least 400 g m
 <sup>âˆ’2</sup> of AC are needed for native plant restoration. Results, however, were not consistent across years so further testing with different concentrations in different sites is recommended. Plant responses to wood-based AC were even more variable, with wood-based AC having a greater native : non-native ratio than coal-based AC in the first year and a lower native : non-native ratio than coal-based AC in the third year. It is difficult, therefore, to conclude whether or not wood-based AC is a suitable alternative to coal-based AC.
