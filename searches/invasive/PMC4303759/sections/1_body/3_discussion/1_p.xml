<p>In both field and greenhouse experiments, AC decreased non-native plant growth and increased the relative abundance of native to non-native plants. At the end of the 3-year field experiment, this effect was evident at AC concentrations &gt;400 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F2">2</xref>D). In the greenhouse experiment, the fact that AC decreased non-native growth in monoculture pots (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F5">5</xref>) indicated that AC effects occurred regardless of competition or allelopathy. The fact that non-native growth decreased only in live soils suggested that AC effects were microbially mediated (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F4">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F5">5</xref>). The fact that AC decreased non-native growth suggested that AC either increased negative plant–microbe interactions or decreased positive plant–microbe interactions. Because AC is known to indiscriminately bind the organic molecules that allow communication and the development of interactions among soil organisms, we suggest that the most likely explanation for the microbially mediated decrease in non-native plant growth in AC plots is that AC decreased the development of positive plant–microbe interactions that have recently been suggested to dominate plant–soil interactions (
