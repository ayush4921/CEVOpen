<p>Similar to previous research conducted on a smaller spatial scale (1 m × 1 m plots), we found that the addition of 1000 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> of coal-based AC to larger plots (15 m × 15 m) using more real-world application techniques (i.e. tractor discing rather than hand mixing) increased the ratio of native to non-native plant species (

 <xref rid="PLU072C27" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski 2011</xref>). Non-native species were the drivers of this community composition change (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU072F2">2</xref>). More specifically, non-native cover decreased from 24 % cover in seeded controls to 19 % cover in plots treated with 1000 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> coal-based AC. This effect of AC was similar to the effect of adding native seed: adding native seed decreased non-native cover from 31 to 24 %.
