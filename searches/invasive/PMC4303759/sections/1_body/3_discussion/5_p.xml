<p>Results from microbial analyses are consistent with the idea that AC affects plant growth by changing microbial composition. Early in the spring, before plant growth, microbial communities in AC-treated soils (1000 g AC m
 <sup>−2</sup>) were more similar to undisturbed native soils than to control soils (0 g AC m
 <sup>−2</sup>). More specifically, early season AC soils and native soils were associated with an increase in an unidentified bacterium and Actinomycetales, and with a decrease in a Flavobacterium. However, late season, only native soils were associated with these OTUs. This suggested that AC created a soil microbial community that was similar to native plants, but that once non-native plants grow on these soils the microbial community returns to a composition more similar to that associated with non-native plants. Flavobacterium have been noted for their plant growth promoting activity (

 </xref>), so a decrease in Flavobacterium is consistent with a decrease in positive plant–microbe interactions. Actinomycetales have been found to affect fungal infection (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2004
 </xref>), so it is possible that AC treatments increased Actinomycetales, which either increased fungal pathogen infection or decreased mycorrhizal infection. These potential mechanisms are purely speculative, but help narrow down a long list of soil organisms to those that are more likely to have important effects on plant growth. Follow-up experiments testing the effects of these different organisms (i.e. tests of Koch's postulates) will be needed to test their effects on native and non-native plant growth.
