<p>In a large-scale field application, AC increased native restoration even when applied in a year with a wet spring that resulted in vigorous native plant growth. Previous results from a small-scale experiment suggested that this effect may be greater in drier years. A greenhouse experiment suggested that AC decreases non-native plant growth by suppressing the development of positive plant–microbe interactions—not by suppressing allelopathy or nutrient cycling rates. Bacterial analyses suggested that Actinomycetales and Flavobacterium are good candidates for future testing of AC effects. Activated carbon application remains a blunt and costly restoration tool that may only have applications in high-value lands, but results demonstrate the potential for soil-based manipulations that can be used to guide plant community development.</p>
