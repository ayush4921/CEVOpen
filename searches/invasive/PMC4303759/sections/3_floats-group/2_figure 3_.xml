 <caption>
  <p>Principal component analysis of archaeal and bacterial OTUs associated with native plant communities (native), control + seed-treated soils (CS) and activated-carbon-treated (AC) soils both early in the growing season prior to plant growth (early) and near the end of the growing season (late). The blue arrow shows the effect of adding AC to treated soils. The grey, yellow and green arrows show how microbial communities changed over the growing season in AC-treated, seeded and native plots, respectively. The table inset shows the bacteria associated with PC1 and PC2. K = kingdom, F = family, O = order and G = genus.</p>
