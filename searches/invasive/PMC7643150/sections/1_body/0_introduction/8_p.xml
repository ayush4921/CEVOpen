<p id="Par9">Our objectives were to forecast the potential influence of buffelgrass on the Saguaro National Park landscape, including loss of native desert vegetation and altered fire dynamics given ecological uncertainties, and to identify which uncertainties most influence forecasts and thus may have the largest impact on management decisions. We examined the sensitivity of STSM results to model initialization and to ecological uncertainties across an expert-identified range of possible values

 </sup> along with uncertainty related to stochasticity between individual model runs. We explored the potential impacts from buffelgrass competition alone versus impacts of an altered disturbance regime (i.e., fire). We considered two groups of uncertainties: those associated with underlying landscape characteristics at the start of the simulation (model initialization scenarios) and those associated with model parameterization including infill rates and the influence of precipitation on infill rates (ecological scenarios). The simulations were run in the absence of management actions and highlight the potential range in the magnitude of the invasion if buffelgrass is left untreatedâ€”an important metric requested by regional experts.
