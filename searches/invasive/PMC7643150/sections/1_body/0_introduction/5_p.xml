<p id="Par6">Buffelgrass is an invasive perennial grass native to Africa that has been introduced widely as a forage species and for erosion control
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Following its introduction, buffelgrass has spread and become invasive in many natural areas globally where it has various impacts on native ecosystems. Various species distribution models exist for buffelgrass, including global and regional models under current and future climate that provide information on its potential distribution
