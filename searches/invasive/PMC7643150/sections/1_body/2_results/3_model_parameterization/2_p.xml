<p id="Par27">There was a large shift towards the &gt; 50% and converted cover classes in the wet-fast infill scenarios; this shift was greater on average for the variable wet-year timing simulations than the constant wet-year timing simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). By the end of the wet-fast infill simulations, buffelgrass has occupied most of the susceptible landscape, with invaded state classes occupying &gt; 8800 ha in all scenario groups out of 9735 ha of susceptible area (low initialization) to &gt; 10,600 ha out of 12,013 ha susceptible area (high initialization).
