<p id="Par36">Invasive species’ impacts vary widely, and the grass-fire cycle is a well-studied case of invasive grasses altering the scale, frequency, and/or intensity of wildfires while also promoting further invasion

 </sup>. Our simulation results reflect the combination of these two processes, with a similar pattern of increasing invasion over time but with faster invasion with the inclusion of fire, particularly in the wet-fast scenarios. SAGU staff were concerned about the number of fires that could burn to the forest edge as these could potentially lead to much larger fires and modify the frequency of fires currently observed in the forest ecosystem, and historically this fire pattern has not existed. The simulations showed that this pattern could potentially be an issue in the future, with the desert ecosystem carrying fire to the forest.
