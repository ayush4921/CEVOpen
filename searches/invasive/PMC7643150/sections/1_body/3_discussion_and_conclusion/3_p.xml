 </sup>. Neither study showed a relationship between growth and precipitation, but the first study did not include annual time steps and the second only collected 3 years of data; further, both studies were within relatively homogenous climate areas whereas Saguaro National Park encompasses greater variability in climate conditions. Results may also be influenced by the spotty nature of precipitation where weather data from a nearby climate station may not represent the weather experienced by the buffelgrass patch. Additionally, other meteorological variables have important, but not fully understood, impacts on buffelgrass growth and reproduction, including precipitation duration, humidity, wind, cloud cover, and temperature
