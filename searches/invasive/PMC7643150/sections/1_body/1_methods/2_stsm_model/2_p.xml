<p id="Par12">Because we were specifically interested in investigating the impacts of ecological uncertainty on buffelgrass forecasts in SAGU, we used a modified version of the Jarnevich et al.

 </sup> STSM that eliminated management-induced ecological transitions between state classes, retaining all ecological transitions including seed dispersal, buffelgrass cover increases, seedbank mortality, and fire-induced ecological transitions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Because we excluded management actions, we further modified the original STSM by collapsing the detected and undetected classes that describe whether a cell is known to be invaded or not into states distinguished only by cover class (e.g., ‘detected &lt; 1% cover’ and ‘undetected &lt; 1% cover’ both became ‘ &lt; 1% cover’).
