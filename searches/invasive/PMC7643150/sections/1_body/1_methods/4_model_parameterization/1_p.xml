<p id="Par15">Regional experts defined the transition between buffelgrass cover classes as deterministic based on amount of time spent in a state class, but expressed uncertainty related to the amount of time required in each state before transitioning. We elicited values from regional experts related to the time required before transitioning to the next buffelgrass cover class including lower-quartile, median, and upper-quantile estimates for each transition time
