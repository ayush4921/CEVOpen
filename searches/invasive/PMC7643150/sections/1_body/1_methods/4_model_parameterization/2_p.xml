<p id="Par16">Regional experts also indicated that patch infill rates could be influenced by precipitation amounts during the monsoon season. This influence could be broken into two pieces: the probability that a year is ‘wet’, and a patch infill acceleration factor resulting from greater precipitation in a ‘wet’ year (hereafter referred to as wet-year infill acceleration factor). To determine the probability of a ‘wet’ year, we examined historic climate variability to calculate the probability of having a year with above median monsoon length and above median cumulative monsoon precipitation. We compared individual years from 1987 to 2016 to a 30-year median of monsoon length and cumulative monsoon precipitation using data from the nearest long term weather station, located at Tucson International Airport (GHCND:USW00023160; obtained from

This comparison resulted in 26.7% of years with values above the 30-year median. We also calculated the lower-quartile (10% of years) and the upper-quartile (57% of years). We randomly assigned years as being ‘wet’ within the simulations based on these probabilities using the random number function in R version 3.4.2
