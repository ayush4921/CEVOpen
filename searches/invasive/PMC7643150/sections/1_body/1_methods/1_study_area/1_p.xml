<p id="Par10">Saguaro National Park (here forth referred to as SAGU), located in the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona, is divided into two units separated by the city of Tucson (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> online). The 27,279 ha Rincon Mountain District (RMD) located to the east of Tucson has a greater elevational difference and includes a desert ecosystem, grassland ecotone, and high-elevation forest. The 9726 ha Tucson Mountain District (TMD) located to the west of Tucson is smaller, sits at a lower elevation, and includes only the desert ecosystem. Despite the geographic separation the two units are managed as a whole, so we modeled the two districts together in our simulations. Climate, recorded by the Tucson International Airport Weather Station (period of record 6/1/1946 to 6/9/2016 from Western Regional Climate Center), is arid/ semi-arid characterized by monsoonal precipitation (average of 29 cm/year) with an average January minimum temperature of 3.7 °C and average July maximum temperature of 37.4 °C.
