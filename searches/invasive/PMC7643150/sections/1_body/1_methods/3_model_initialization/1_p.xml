<p id="Par13">We conducted sensitivity analyses on a key uncertainty in model initialization: the total amount of SAGU defined as being susceptible to buffelgrass establishment. Each grid cell of the desert ecosystem was assigned as susceptible or unsusceptible based on a habitat suitability model developed for SAGU

 </sup>. The habitat suitability model produces continuous values between 0 and 1, and a threshold value is selected to discretize the predictions into binary suitable or unsuitable classes. To test the sensitivity to the habitat suitability threshold decision, we varied threshold value between 0.45 and 0.55, which resulted in different amounts of grid cells assigned to the susceptible strata. These values increase (0.45) and decrease (0.55) the estimated amount of susceptible area on the landscape by roughly ± 10% relative to the original index used for simulations (0.50) that was determined based on the habitat suitability model evaluation
