<p>The leaves of 12 samples from the four treatments were collected for mRNA isolation. After being fully ground, total RNA from frozen leaves was isolated using TRIzol reagent. RNA integrity and purity were checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit) with a minimum integrity value of 7.5. The cDNA library of each sample was constructed as follows. First, mRNA was isolated from total RNA with magnetic beads containing Oligo (dT) primer. Subsequently, the enriched mRNAs were fragmented in fragmentation buffer, and then, first‐strand and second‐strand cDNA were synthesized and amplified using an ABI Step One Plus Real‐Time PCR System. Finally, these cDNA library preparations were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq X Ten from both the 5′ and 3′ ends, and 150‐bp paired‐end reads were generated.</p>
