<p>One hundred milligrams of each fresh leaf sample from the four treatment was ground with a sterile pestle and morter. The samples were transferred into 15‐ml tubes followed by the addition of 10 ml 96% ethanol. After mixing well, the tubes were placed at 4°C for two days. The samples were centrifuged at 17925
