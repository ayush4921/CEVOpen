<p>In order to investigate whether the chlorophyll and carotenoid content of plants were changed under different light conditions, the experiment of chlorophyll content measurement for each treatment was repeated three times in this study. The data of chlorophyll and carotenoid content were analyzed by one‐way analysis of variance, and the mean (±
 <italic>SD</italic>) was the average calculated from three biological replicates. Letters on the bars represent a significant difference at 
 <italic>p</italic>‐value ≤ .05 (LSD test) among different treatments compared with the control group.
