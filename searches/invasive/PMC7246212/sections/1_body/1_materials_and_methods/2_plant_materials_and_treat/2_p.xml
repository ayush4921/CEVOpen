<p>In this study, we transplanted 36 rhizomes, respectively, originated from 36 plants of the hexaploid

 <italic>canadensis</italic> growing at the suburb of Wuhan city to the open air garden in Wuhan University (30°32′N, 114°25′E), Hubei Province, China. After three months (from February to April) of cultivation in pots under natural conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we selected 12 of the 36 plants with similar growth status and randomly divided them into four groups. One of these groups was used as control, and the other three groups were covered with one layer, two layers, and three layers of shade net, respectively. In the control treatment (L), plants were cultivated under natural light. In the three different levels of shade treatment with one‐, two‐ and three‐layer shade nets, the natural irradiance availability was reduced to 50% (L
 <sub>1</sub>), 25% (L
 <sub>2</sub>), and 10% (L
 <sub>3</sub>), respectively, via black shade nets that were clamped to a metal frame at a height of 150 cm (Semchenko, Lepik, Gotzenberger, &amp; Zobel, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Light intensities were measured by a handheld luxmeter (SMART Digital Lux Meter AS 813). After cultivation for 21 days, we collected leaves from the four treatment groups, with each containing three replicates. The leaves in each plant were collected from the top third to fifth leaves, and these leaves were prepared for RNA extraction, quantitative real‐time PCR analysis, and chlorophyll content measurement.
