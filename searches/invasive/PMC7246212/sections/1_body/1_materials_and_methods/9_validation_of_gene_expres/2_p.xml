<p>The quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) technique was used to validate gene expression from RNA‐Seq. RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent from each independent biological sample. In order to prevent the presence of DNA in extracted RNA samples, all the RNA samples were treated with DNase I to digest DNA. cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription of each RNA sample. Specific primers for 12 randomly selected genes were designed using Primer 5 software (Lalitha,
