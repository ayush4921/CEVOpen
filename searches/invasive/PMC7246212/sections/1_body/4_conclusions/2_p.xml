<p>Invasive species consistently display the trait of phenotypic plasticity to adapt to various environments. The results from this study confirm that shade levels strongly affect phenotypic changes and physiological responses in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic>. The expression levels of photosynthesis and antioxidant enzyme‐related genes were altered in response to shade stress. This phenomenon suggests that

 <italic>canadensis</italic> has enhanced photosynthesis and ROS scavenging abilities to absorb large amounts of light and ensure normal growth. While the expression of secondary metabolism‐related genes was also affected under shade stress, this phenomenon was indicative of an adaptive strategy to retain fitness under harsh conditions. The expression network analyses revealed the important roles of candidate genes for shading tolerance in
