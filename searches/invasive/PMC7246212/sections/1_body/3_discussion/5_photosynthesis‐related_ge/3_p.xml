<p>The pathway of “photosynthesis‐antenna proteins” includes light‐harvesting chlorophyll protein complex I (LHCI) and II (LCHII)‐related genes encoding subunits consisting of the photosystem I‐antenna and photosystem II‐antenna complex, respectively. Photosystem II‐antenna complexes include major antenna complexes (LHCII), such as Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3 proteins, which bind several pigment molecules, such as chlorophyll

 <italic>b</italic>, zeaxanthin (Zx), and lutein (Lut), playing a vital role in photosystem II (van Amerongen &amp; Croce,
