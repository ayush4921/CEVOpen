<p>To adapt to adverse environmental conditions, many plants have developed different mechanisms in response to abiotic stresses. Most transcription factors (TFs) can act as regulatory proteins that play an important role in these mechanisms (Wang, Yang, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). For example, the TIFY family is a novel plant‐specific gene family that participates in the regulation of various plant‐specific biologic processes (Sun et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The AP2/EREBP superfamily is one of the largest and most conserved gene families in plants, and expansion of the AP2/EREBP superfamily may have enhanced the wide adaptability of cotton (Liu &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Furthermore, the WRKY and MYB TF families play a vital role in diverse regulatory and multiple stress response processes in plants (Li et al.,
