<p>Leaf area and leaf angle insertion are considered to be responses to the shading environment and increase with shade application (Ajmi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Under limiting irradiance, leaves developed large areas to capture more light sources and help the plants maintain better performance (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Yang, Sun, Zhang, Cochard, &amp; Cao, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Furthermore, leaf insertion angles are important in determining the transmission of radiation for vegetation canopies, and the direction of leaves depends greatly on the light exposure (Raabe, Pisek, Sonnentag, &amp; Annuk, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Under shade stress, to absorb more light, the plant leaf angle insertion can be extended to 100°, while under normalized light, to avoid excess sunlight, the leaf angle insertion always ranges from 30° to 60° (Larbi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In our study, all the plants under shading treatment had a larger leaf area and leaf angle insertion than those cultivated under natural light. Such a strategy will assist the capture of light energy by
