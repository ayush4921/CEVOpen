<p>Chlorophyll is the most important photosynthetic pigment in photosynthetic processes, and the chlorophyll content is always significantly affected by shade stress (Alridiwirsah, Harahap, Akoeb, &amp; Hanum, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Under shade stress, plants increase their light use efficiency by increasing leaf chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic>, total chlorophyll content, and decreasing chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic>/
 <italic>b</italic> ratios (Dai et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Gregoriou, Pontikis, &amp; Vemmos, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), and if the available light source is reduced in a shade environment for photosynthesis, the chlorophyll content will be increased (Muhidin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Our results revealed a significantly increased chlorophyll content (chl 
 <italic>a</italic>, chl 
 <italic>b</italic>, and chl 
 <italic>a</italic> + 
 <italic>b</italic>) in the different treatment groups. These results were consistent with the linear increase in shade stress, concurrent with a significant decrease in the chl 
 <italic>a</italic>/
 <italic>b</italic> ratio. The carotenoid content increased in the three treatment groups with no significant differences among them. The ratio of carotenoid content with total chlorophyll was decreased with the reduction of light radiation. This phenomenon indicates that the photosynthesis system in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> has a wide range of strategies to adapt to shading stress and increase its light use efficiency by regulating the content of chlorophyll.
