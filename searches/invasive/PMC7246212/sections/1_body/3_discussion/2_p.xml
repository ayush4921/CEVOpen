<p>Previous studies have elaborated that invasive species consistently show adaptive potential and rapidly adapt to novel environments (Bertelsmeier &amp; Keller, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Liu, Li, &amp; Xiong, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Furthermore, these species often have the ability to express different phenotypes in response to changing or novel environmental conditions and display higher plasticity, even in low‐resource systems (Funk,

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic>, an invasive plant, could adapt to low‐light conditions in a shade stress environment by adjusting the morphology, growth, photosynthetic physiology, and other characteristics, and it exhibits a certain plasticity in response to low light intensity (Du et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanisms of shade stress acclimation in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> have not been determined. In the present study, the gene expression and morphological traits of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic>, cultivated with different levels of shade conditions, were used to understand the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to shade stress.
