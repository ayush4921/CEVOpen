<p>The gene expression results obtained from the high‐throughput sequencing were validated by quantitative reverse transcription‐PCR (qRT‐PCR) analysis. A total of 12 randomly selected key candidate genes from each of four different treatment groups were used for validation. As anticipated, the qRT‐PCR results for the different groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>) were consistent with the sequencing data. The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Table
