<p>To understand the molecular basis of the phenotypic differences in shade conditions, we generated transcriptome profiles based on RNA‐Seq analyses. The leaf samples of three different shade conditions and one natural light condition were used for RNA‐Seq analysis with three biological replicates. In total, 12 libraries were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform, with each library satisfied with a Q20 percentage greater than 98% (ranging from 98.41% to 98.82%) and single read length of 150 bp (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36206-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The clean reads were assembled into 123,598 unigenes with an average length of 1,029 bp and N50 length of 1,443 bp. The sequencing data have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (accession number: PRJNA577291). The assembled unigene sequences were aligned by searching the Nr, Swiss‐Prot, COG, and GO public databases (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36206-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Based on the annotated unigenes, 76,060, 74,710, 74,406, and 77,965 unigenes were identified to be expressed by FPKMs in the L, L
 <sub>1</sub>, L
 <sub>2</sub>, and L
 <sub>3</sub> group, respectively. By redundancy analysis of annotated genes from these four groups, a total of 83,575 unigenes were identified, with 67,237 unigenes detected in all four groups and 1,204 unigenes that were unique to the L group, 592 to the L
 <sub>1</sub> group, 651 to the L
 <sub>2</sub> group, and 2,488 to the L
 <sub>3</sub> group (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The expressed genes were divided into four ranges according to the FPKM, and approximately 21.3% of the genes were expressed in the range of 0–1, 41.3% in the range of 1–5, 30.7% in the range of 5–30, and 6.7% were above 30.
