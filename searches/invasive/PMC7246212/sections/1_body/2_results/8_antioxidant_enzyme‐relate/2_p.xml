<p>In this study, some antioxidant enzyme‐related genes, such as 
 <italic>SOD</italic>, 
 <italic>CAT,</italic> and 
 <italic>POD</italic>, were differentially expressed in the shade conditions compared with the control, and most of them were upregulated (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>). In addition, other related DEGs which can encode antioxidant enzymes were also collected. For example, four glutathione peroxidase genes (
 <italic>GPx</italic>) encoding enzymes catalyzing the conversion of glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were upregulated. Among four ascorbate peroxidase genes (
 <italic>APX</italic>) encoding enzymes catalyzing the conversion of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate, three were upregulated and one downregulated. Of eight glutathione S‐transferase (
 <italic>GST</italic>) genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the conversion of glutathione (GSH) to R‐S‐glutathione, six were upregulated and two downregulated. Two ascorbate oxidase (
 <italic>AO</italic>) genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the conversion of dehydroascorbate to ascorbate, one was upregulated and another downregulated. These DEGs could encode related antioxidant enzymes in response to shading stress. Furthermore, the number of antioxidant enzyme‐related DEGs increased as the light intensity was reduced, and most were upregulated. These results indicated that the activity of antioxidant enzymes might be enhanced in
