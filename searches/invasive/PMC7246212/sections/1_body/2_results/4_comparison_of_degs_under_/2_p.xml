<p>When we examined the number of DEGs for each of these three comparisons (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), we observed that the reduced light intensity condition had a greater impact on gene expression (i.e., more DEGs) in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic>. There were 376 DEGs in the comparison of L
 <sub>1</sub> versus L, with 124 being upregulated and 152 downregulated. Similarly, there were 1,649 DEGs (788 upregulated and 861 downregulated) in the L
 <sub>2</sub> condition comparison and 2,087 DEGs (1,054 upregulated and 1,031 downregulated) in the L
 <sub>3</sub> condition compared with their light‐grown counterparts (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). According to the overlap of DEGs among these three comparison groups, 71 DEGs appeared in all three groups; in addition, 139 unique DEGs were identified in the L
 <sub>1</sub> versus L group, 1,205 in L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L, and 1,549 in L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). From each of comparison, nine DEGs were categorized into five TF gene families in L
 <sub>1</sub> versus L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), and 69 DEGs were categorized into 14 TF gene families in L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), and 73 DEGs were categorized into 26 TF gene families in L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The number of differentially expressed TF genes increased as the degree of shading stress increased. Nine transcription factor genes were differentially expressed in L
 <sub>1</sub> versus L, and all of them were included in the other two comparison groups, while seven TF genes were also expressed in the other two comparison groups. Moreover, 29 differentially expressed TF genes were coexpressed in L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L and L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L, with 39 and 43 specifically expressed in L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L and L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Most of these differentially expressed TF genes were upregulated; the 
 <italic>AP2‐EREBP</italic> and 
 <italic>Tify</italic> TF genes were most predominant in each comparison group followed by the 
 <italic>MYB</italic>, 
 <italic>WRKY,</italic> and 
 <italic>bHLH</italic> TF genes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results showed that the expression level of shading stress response genes in 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> was increased with reduced light intensity. In addition, the regulation of these DEGs may participate in an acclimation strategy to different light conditions in 
 <italic>S</italic>.
