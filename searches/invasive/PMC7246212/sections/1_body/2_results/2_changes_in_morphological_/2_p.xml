<p>To investigate how shade affected 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> growth, changes in plant morphology was observed under three treatment groups in comparison with control plants. Three levels of shading treatment significantly increased the plant height, leaf angle (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and leaf length (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) compared with the control. Interestingly, the two‐layer shading net (L
 <sub>2</sub>)‐treated plants had the highest growth height and largest leaves. The plant height and leaf area of the three‐layer shading net (L
 <sub>3</sub>) were smaller than those of the L
 <sub>2</sub> but higher than those of the one‐layer shading net (L
 <sub>1</sub>) treatment groups. In the three different shading treatment groups, the leaf angle and total content of chlorophyll increased with the reduction of light intensity and were significantly higher than the control group. In addition, there was a significant difference in total chlorophyll content between the L with L
 <sub>1</sub>, L
 <sub>2</sub>, and L
 <sub>3</sub> groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b also increased with the reduction of light intensity, and most groups were also significantly different from each other (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). The carotenoid content in the three treatment groups increased compared with the L group, while there were no significant differences among these three groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In contrast, the ratio of Chl 
 <italic>a</italic>/Chl 
 <italic>b</italic> and carotenoid/total Chl in each group decreased with reduced light intensity (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36206-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). These results suggest that 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> can exhibit different phenotypes and pigment levels under shade stress compared with natural growth condition.
