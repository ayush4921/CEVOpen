<p>To further explore the function of DEGs, GO functional enrichment was conducted. A total of 3,466 DEGs from the three compared groups were evaluated with GO enrichment and enriched into 49 GO terms classified into three main GO categories (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Many genes were significantly enriched in GO terms related to photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secondary metabolism synthesis (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36206-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). For example, in the category of cellular component, GO terms, such as “photosystem,” “photosynthetic membrane,” “thylakoid part,” “photosystem I,” “photosystem II” and “chloroplast,” which related to the photosystem were significantly enriched. In the category of molecular function, GO terms, such as “germacrene‐A synthase activity,” “pigment binding,” “peroxidase activity” and “sesquiterpene synthase activity,” which related to ROS response and secondary metabolite synthesis were significantly enriched. In the category of biological processes, GO terms, such as “photosynthesis,” “photosynthesis, light harvesting,” “protein‐chromophore linkage photosynthesis,” “light reaction oxidation‐reduction process,” “light harvesting in photosystem I” and “hydrogen peroxide metabolic process,” which related to photosynthesis and ROS response were enriched. All the significantly enriched GO terms were analyzed by REVIGO to further identify representative nonredundant GO terms (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The expression of most of these significant enriched genes was induced under the shade conditions, for example, many photosynthesis‐related genes were upregulated in GO terms such as “photosystem I,” “photosynthetic membrane,” “chloroplast thylakoid photosystem II” and “photosynthesis, light harvesting” (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results suggested that genes involved in these GO terms might play important roles in the response to shade stress. During this process,
