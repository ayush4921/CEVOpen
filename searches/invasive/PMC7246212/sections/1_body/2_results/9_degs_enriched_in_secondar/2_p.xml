<p>According to the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, many DEGs from the three compared groups were enriched in secondary metabolism‐related pathways, such as “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” and “flavonoid biosynthesis.” The number of DEGs in these two pathways increased with the reduction of light intensity and was significantly enriched in L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L and L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L. In contrast, the proportion of downregulated genes among these three comparisons increased in the “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” pathway, in which 34 DEGs were collected and most were upregulated in the three shade treatment groups compared with the L group, such as the 
 <italic>PAL</italic>, 
 <italic>C4H</italic>, 
 <italic>4Cl,</italic> and 
 <italic>C3′H</italic> genes (Figure

 <italic>CHS</italic>, 
 <italic>DFR</italic>, 
 <italic>F3′H,</italic> and 
 <italic>FLS</italic> genes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9d</xref>). In addition, some of these secondary metabolite synthesis‐related DEGs in this pathway in the L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L group were downregulated compared with L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L. These DEGs will respond to changes via induction or suppression in response to different levels of shading. These results indicated that shading stress might affect the secondary metabolism level in
