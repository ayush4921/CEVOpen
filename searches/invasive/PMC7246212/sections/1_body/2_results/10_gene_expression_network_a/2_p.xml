<p>In this study, 3,466 DEGs from three comparison groups were analyzed by WGCNA. These DEGs were parsed into 23 gene expression modules, with the number of genes in each module ranging from 43 to 871 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>). The module–trait correlation analysis showed five significant coregulatory modules (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), with three in the L group shown in turquoise, dark red, and red and two in the L
 <sub>3</sub> group shown in dark green and blue (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>). Therefore, the genes in the dark green and blue module may be vital for the L
 <sub>3</sub> group. A total of 43 DEGs and all of them were upregulated in L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L, which clustered in the dark green module. These DEGs include plant hormone signal transduction process‐related genes, such as 
 <italic>BSK</italic> (BR‐signaling kinase) gene and 
 <italic>ARF</italic> (auxin response factor) gene, and antioxidant‐related genes such as 
 <italic>AO</italic> which encode ascorbate oxidase. A total of 297 DEGs, 267 upregulated and 30 downregulated in L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L, were clustered in the blue module. Most of these DEGs were photosynthesis‐related genes, such as 
 <italic>Lhc</italic>, chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast thylakoid membrane, and carbon fixation. Meanwhile, antioxidant enzymes‐related genes, such as 
 <italic>POD</italic>, 
 <italic>SOD</italic>, 
 <italic>CAT</italic>, 
 <italic>APX,</italic> and 
 <italic>GST,</italic> and secondary metabolism‐related genes, such as 
 <italic>PAL</italic>, 
 <italic>C4H</italic>, 
 <italic>CAD</italic> and 
 <italic>CHS</italic>, were also clustered into this module. In addition, some transcription factor genes, such as 
 <italic>EREBP</italic>, 
 <italic>ERF</italic>, 
 <italic>WRKY</italic>, 
 <italic>TIFY,</italic> and 
 <italic>bHLH</italic>, may encode corresponding TFs and play a regulatory role in this module. Based on the network analysis for the blue module, the top 300 paired DEGs with a weight value above 0.71 were chosen for exhibition (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>). Some hub genes with a connect degree ≥7 significantly expressed genes were related to photosynthesis and present in the network, such as 
 <italic>Lhcb1</italic>, 
 <italic>Lhcb2</italic>, 
 <italic>Lhca1</italic>, 
 <italic>Lhcb5</italic>, and 
 <italic>RBLC</italic> gene (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36206-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These hub genes may play a key role in the response of 
 <italic>S</italic>.
