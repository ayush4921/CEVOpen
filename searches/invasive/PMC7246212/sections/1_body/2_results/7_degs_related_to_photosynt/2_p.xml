<p>Many DEGs related to the photosynthesis process were collected. For example, photosystem I reaction center subunit‐related genes (
 <italic>Psa</italic>), such as the 
 <italic>PsaD</italic>, 
 <italic>PsaE</italic>, and 
 <italic>PsaH</italic> gene, and photosystem II core complex protein‐related genes (
 <italic>Psb</italic>), such as the 
 <italic>PsbO</italic>, 
 <italic>PsbQ,</italic> and 
 <italic>PsbR</italic> gene, were differentially expressed. Other photosynthesis‐related DEGs were as follows: cytochrome b6 complex and photosynthetic electron transport genes (
 <italic>Pet</italic>), such as 
 <italic>PetC</italic>, 
 <italic>PetE,</italic> and 
 <italic>PetF</italic> gene; F‐type ATPase synthesis‐related genes, such as the ATP‐gamma gene (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>); light‐harvesting chlorophyll protein complex genes (
 <italic>Lhc</italic>), such as the 
 <italic>Lhca1</italic>, 
 <italic>Lhca2</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lhcb2</italic> gene (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>); and carbon fixation process‐related genes, such as the ribulose‐bisphosphate carboxylase gene (
 <italic>RBLC</italic>), phosphoribulokinase gene (
 <italic>PRK</italic>), and glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase gene (
 <italic>NADP</italic>). Furthermore, some Chl‐related genes, such as the 
 <italic>ChlP</italic>, 
 <italic>ChlH,</italic> and 
 <italic>HemH</italic> gene, were also differentially expressed in the shade condition groups when compared with the control (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>). The number of these photosynthesis‐related genes increased with reduced light intensity. These results suggested that 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> may cope with shading stress by regulating the expression of photosynthesis‐related genes.
