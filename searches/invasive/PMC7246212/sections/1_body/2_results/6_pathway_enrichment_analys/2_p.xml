<p>According to the KEGG pathway analysis, 81, 117, and 125 pathways were enriched in L
 <sub>1</sub> versus L, L
 <sub>2</sub> versus L, and L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L, respectively. The top 20 enriched pathways in L
 <sub>1</sub> versus L (Figure

 <sub>2</sub> versus L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), and L
 <sub>3</sub> versus L (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>) were ranked by Q‐value. Most of genes in these pathways such as “photosynthesis” (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>), “photosynthesis—antenna proteins” (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36206-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,” “carbon metabolism,” “carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms,” “starch and sucrose metabolism,” “stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis,” “isoflavonoid biosynthesis,” “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “plant hormone signal transduction” were significantly enriched (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36206-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). The KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the number of significant enrichment pathways increased as the light intensity was reduced, and the DEGs that were significantly enriched in these pathways are likely to play essential roles in coping with shading stress in
