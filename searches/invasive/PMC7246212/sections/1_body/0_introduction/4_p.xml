<p>Invasive plants can spread across diverse habitats via individual plasticity (Williams, Mack, &amp; Black, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). When dispersed in a shaded environment with low light intensities, invasive plants frequently develop a greater leaf area and biomass to enhance their light capture and utilization efficiency to adapt to the reduced light conditions (Du et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). This phenomenon reveals that plants have developed some regulatory processes to adapt to shade conditions and may enable their invasion into wider areas.
