<p>To date, the biological processes of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> in response to shading stress have been unclear. The present study provides a comprehensive description of the differential gene expression patterns in this plant under different degrees of shading. We examine the consequences of three different light intensity levels of shade treatment on the morphological, physiological, and transcriptional characteristics of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic>. Based on the comprehensive analysis, candidate shade stress‐responsive genes are identified in comparison with control natural light conditions. These findings will contribute to understanding how 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> adapts to the shade environment and may help to elucidate how it has become an invasive species.
