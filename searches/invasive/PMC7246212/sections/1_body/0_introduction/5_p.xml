 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> L. (Asteraceae), native to North America, has successfully invaded many areas worldwide. The success of invasion can be related to the plant's high phenotypic plasticity (Du et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> has a relatively wide niche with different soil properties in Europe (Szymura &amp; Szymura, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and can rapidly spread in non‚Äênative regions with different climatic conditions (Li, Du, Guan, Yu, &amp; van Kleunen, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Currently, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>canadensis</italic> has been naturalized in many areas and is considered one of the most destructive and widespread invasive species (Wang, Jiang, Zhou, &amp; Wu, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), distributed in multiple areas, including farmland, the sides of roads, and upland forests.
