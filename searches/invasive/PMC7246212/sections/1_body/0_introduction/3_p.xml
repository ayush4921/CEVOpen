<p>Light is one of the most prominent environmental factors for plant growth (Wang, Chen, Botella, &amp; Guo, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Light not only affects the rate of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity, and the production of biomass, but also it also regulates all aspects of development in plants (Li, Xin, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Wu, Chen, Sun, Deng, &amp; Chen, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Shade can cause certain metabolic changes as well as imbalances in photosynthesis and carbohydrate production, potentially limiting plant growth and stability (Huang, Zhang, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Sajad et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Plants are able to respond to changes in light decreased conditions by adjusting a range of physiological and morphological characteristics, such as the specific leaf area, leaf size, biomass allocation pattern, and chlorophyll content (Feng &amp; van Kleunen, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Legner, Fleck, &amp; Leuschner, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Plants can respond to light decreased environments by altering gene expression levels, for example, photosystem‐related genes are differentially expressed, and most transcription factor (TF) genes are induced under shade conditions in 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Gibberellin biosynthesis genes are found to play a role in shade tolerance in 
 <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> (Li, Katin‐Grazzini, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The expression of genes related to photosystem I and photosystem II could be affected by various light conditions (Rogowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Shade avoidance and tolerance responses in plants could be reflected in the alteration of expressed genes, such as those involved in hormone signaling and pigment biosynthesis (Ranade, Delhomme, &amp; García‐Gil, 
 <xref rid="ece36206-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>).
