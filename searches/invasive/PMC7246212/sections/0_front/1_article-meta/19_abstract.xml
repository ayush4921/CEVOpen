 <p>The invasive plants are widely distributed in different external environments and have a good adaptive ability. Through the analysis of gene expression in the leaves of 
  <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> under different shading conditions, the genes that played an important role in responding to shading stress were screened out. The differential expression of these genes may play an important role in the response of 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> plant to light avoidance environment. It is possible to cope with different light intensities, which are likely to play an important role in the process of 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> expanding invasion and forming invasive species. At the same time, it also provides a theoretical basis for the distribution of 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic>.
