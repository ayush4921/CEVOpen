 <caption> Gene expression network analysis. (a) Clustering dendrogram of genes, with dissimilarity based on topological overlap, together with assigned merged module colors and theory final module colors. (b) Module–trait associations. Each row corresponds to a module eigengene, column to a trait. Each cell contains the corresponding correlation and p‐value. The table is color‐coded by correlation according to the color legend. (c) Interaction analysis of the selected DEGs. The bubble size represents connect degree of each gene </caption>
