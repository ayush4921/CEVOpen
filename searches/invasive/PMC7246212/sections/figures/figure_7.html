 <caption> Top 20 enriched KEGG pathways among the annotated DEGs across three comparisons. (a) L 1 versus L group; (b) L 2 versus L group; and (c) L 3 versus L group. The y‐axis on the left represents KEGG pathways, and the x‐axis indicates the enrichment factor. Low Q‐values are shown in red, and high Q‐values are shown in blue. The bubble size represents the number of enrichment genes in each pathway </caption>
