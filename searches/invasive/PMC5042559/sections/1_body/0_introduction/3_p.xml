<p>The invasive annual winter grass medusahead (
 <italic>Taeniatherum caput-medusae</italic> [L.] Nevski) has invaded much of the western USA and has been shown to decrease soil carbon stocks, reduce native plant diversity, and enhance fire frequency [

 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that underlying variables, such as habitat type and seedbank density, might mediate control efforts. Despite increasing recognition that bacterial and fungal communities can influence plant invasion dynamics, only two published studies have investigated the direct relationship between medusahead and soil microbial communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These studies have conflicting results, suggesting both that the interaction between medusahead and soil microorganisms might or might not enhance its own invasion. Understanding medusahead effects on the soil microbial community is critical for enhancing predictions of invasion effects and for developing effective management strategies.
