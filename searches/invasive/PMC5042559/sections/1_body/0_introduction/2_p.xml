<p>Soil microbial communities might mediate relationships between invasive plant species and their ecosystem impacts [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Soil microbial communities, which are typically dominated by fungi and bacteria, can be altered by invasive plants directly through growth facilitation or inhibition near the root zone [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and indirectly through changes in abiotic conditions (e.g. pH or nutrient availability) that occur in tandem with weed establishment [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, species-specific effects of non-native grasses on soil nutrients have been shown to subsequently modify soil microbial community composition, biomass, and bacterial:fungal ratios [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition to being vulnerable to impacts from aboveground plant dynamics, soil microbial communities may also play an important role in mediating the success of plant invasions [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, extant soil biota have been shown to enhance invasion success of some of the world’s most noxious invasive plants, such as exotic knotweeds (
 <italic>Fallopia</italic> spp.) [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, it has been concluded that invasive species may be differentially affected by soil bacterial or fungal pathogens as compared to native plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but see [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which could be important for developing reliable control strategies for invasive plants that demonstrate resistance to current management efforts.
