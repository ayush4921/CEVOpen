<p>We investigated how soil microbial communities differ across the invasion front of medusahead in experimental plots in open grassland and oak woodland habitat in the Sierra Foothill region of California, USA. We attempted to understand (1) if medusahead modifies soil microbial communities across the invasion front (simulated by differences in seed density) within systems; and (2) how soil microbial communities differ between areas where medusahead invasion is successful (open grassland habitat) and not successful (oak woodland habitat), and the factors that could be responsible for these differences. We hypothesized that medusahead would modify the soil microbial communities within each habitat. We expected this for two reasons. First, early work on this species [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as more recent work on other invasive annual grasses with similar invasion dynamics to medusahead, have demonstrated linkages between the soil microbes and invasion success [

 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], so we would expect strong effects from the extant soil microorganisms. We also hypothesized that soil microbial communities (in particular symbiotic and pathogenic fungi) would differ between areas where medusahead invasion is typically successful (open grasslands) and typically not successful (oak woodlands). In California, invasion of winter annual grasses can be strongly limited within oak canopies [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], possibly due to the different microbial communities associated with oak trees compared to adjacent open grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Through shading, litter input, and hydraulic lift, Mediterranean oak trees can also modify a wide variety of soil edaphic factors, such as pH and organic matter concentrations, which directly influence soil microbial communities (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). At present, we do not know what role, if any, soil microbial communities play in mediating the likelihood of successful medusahead invasions.
