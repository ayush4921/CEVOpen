<p>Plant communities are typically composed of a combination of native and non-native species. The majority of these non-native species are benign, demonstrating little to no negative effect on neighboring organisms. However, a small fraction of these non-native plants are characterized as invasive because they are able to profoundly modify local plant and animal communities, nutrient cycling, hydrological regimes and fire frequency [
