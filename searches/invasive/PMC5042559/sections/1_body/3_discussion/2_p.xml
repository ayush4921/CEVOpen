<p>Using reciprocal soil transplant experiments, [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported higher medusahead biomass in introduced soil than in native soil, which suggests that medusahead success is partially due to release from native soil pathogens [

 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition to escaping from soil pathogens, certain plant invasive species have been shown to accumulate local pathogens [

 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Although previous studies have reported that medusahead is sensitive to antagonistic fungi [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], we observed important differences in bacterial and fungal community composition between open grassland sites where medusahead is typically found in high densities and oak woodland sites where medusahead is typically found in low densities. Specifically, we found significantly higher abundances of fungal pathogens in open grasslands compared to oak woodland habitats. Environmental conditions in the grassland habitat are likely more ideal for both soil and foliar fugal pathogens, which can be important drivers of above ground plant dynamics (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). Indeed, these pathogens have been documented in grasslands in other studies (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). These results collectively highlight the potential contribution of microbial mechanisms (e.g., via pathogen accumulation) to medusahead dominance in California grasslands. Because the differences in bacterial and fungal communities exist in the absence of medusahead, it is more likely that favorable grassland soil microbial communities facilitate medusahead establishment instead of resulting from the invasion itself.
