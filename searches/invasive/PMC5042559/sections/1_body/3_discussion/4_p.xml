<p>The context dependency associated with invasion success and weed management efficiency is well documented for both medusahead as well as other weedy species (e.g. [

Environmental changes, such as exacerbated drought conditions, might modify suitability of oak woodland habitat and perhaps enhance invasibility of previously resistant systems. Therefore, given the complex relationships between aboveground and belowground biota [
