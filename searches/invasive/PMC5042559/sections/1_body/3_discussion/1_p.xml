<p>Soil biota has been implicated in the facilitation of invasive plant dominance [

 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, not all invasive species support plant-soil microbe feedbacks as a driver of invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We attempted to identify how relationships between the weedy annual grass medusahead and soil microorganisms might mediate invasion success. Unexpectedly, we did not find evidence for medusahead density effects on the soil microbial communities across a simulated invasion front in either habitat. This supports other studies that have documented instances where soil communities are unresponsive to the presence of invasive weeds in arid grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and in other systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, several aspects of our experiment could hinder our ability to capture an existing relationship between medusahead seed density and soil microbial communities. First, we assessed the relationship between medusahead seed density and bulk soil microbial communities and not rhizosphere communities. Rhizosphere microbial communities are different from bulk soil communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], so the potential effects of medusahead invasion intensity on microbial communities may be observable at smaller spatial scales in the rhizosphere (but see [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Second, although this study was conducted across two growing seasons, there may have been insufficient time for soil microbial communities to respond to different seed densities of medusahead [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although microbial communities have been shown to respond to changes in aboveground plant communities in as little as a month [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], these communities could be especially slow to respond to the presence of weeds in environments where soil edaphic factors are slow to change in response to invasion. Moreover, in California grasslands, soil appears to be particularly buffered from aboveground changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Third, extracellular microbial DNA and DNA from dead cells can persist in soils for years and thus, obscure DNA-based present estimates of soil microbial composition [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Finally, as this study only assessed the composition of the microbial communities, we cannot eliminate the possibility that medusahead seed density can influence the activity and function of belowground soil communities.
