<p>Soil microbial community similarity patterns were represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the Bray-Curtis distance metric. We used nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) based on 1,000 permutations [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to assess the explanatory power of the different treatments on soil microbial richness and community similarity patterns, respectively. Differences in the proportion of taxa and fungal functional guilds were tested using non-parametric Wilcoxon tests after false discovery rate (FDR) correction [
