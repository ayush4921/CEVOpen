<p>Microbial diversity was assessed using high-throughput sequencing methods to describe the composition of taxonomic marker gene sequences. For bacterial analyses, we sequenced the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, using the 515-F (
 <monospace>GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA</monospace>) and 806-R (
 <monospace>GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT</monospace>) primer pair [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For the fungal analyses, we sequenced the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region of the rRNA operon, using the ITS1-F (
 <monospace>CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA</monospace>) and ITS2 (
 <monospace>GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC</monospace>) primer pair [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The primers included Illumina adapters and an error-correcting 12-bp barcode unique to each sample. PCR products were quantified using the PicoGreen dsDNA assay, and pooled together in equimolar concentrations for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. All sequencing runs were conducted at the University of Colorado Next Generation Sequencing Facility.
