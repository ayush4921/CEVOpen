<p>A defoliation treatment was applied to half the plots in April 2014. This treatment was intended to simulate a mowing or grazing regime included in a typical management program. Defoliation was applied when 75% of the medusahead tillers were in the ‘boot’ stage within a plot. All standing biomass in treatment plots was clipped using electronic shears positioned approximately 15cm above the soil surface.</p>
