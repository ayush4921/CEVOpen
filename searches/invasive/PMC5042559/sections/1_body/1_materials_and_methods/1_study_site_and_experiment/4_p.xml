<p>The experimental site was mowed, solarized to enhance seedbank germination and then sprayed with glyphosate herbicide to kill existing and newly germinated plants. In September 2013, fully replicated (n = 4) plots were hand seeded with one of five densities of field-collected medusahead (0, 100, 1000, 10000, and 50000 seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup>), mixed in with 500 grams of medusahead thatch. Immediately following the addition of medusahead seed, 6,000 seeds each of neighboring grass species (annual rye, and Blando brome) and 4,000 seeds of a clover mix were added—for a total of 16,000 neighbor seeds—to maintain a realistic competitive environment. Medusahead tiller density the following season reflected the seeding rate. This treatment was expected to simulate differences in medusahead invasion intensity from low to high infestation [
