<p>To understand how factors associated with the oak woodland habitat might contribute to medusahead invasion, an additional set of replicated 1m
 <sup>2</sup> plots were installed in the open grassland sites. Treatments were deployed in order to simulate environmental factors associated with the oak woodland habitat, and included the presence of shading, the presence of oak litter, and the presence of both shading and litter. Shading was applied via 50% shade cloth suspended over the plots, and litter was applied by collecting 500g of litter from under paired oak canopies and distributing it evenly over treatment plots. Medusahead seeds (at a density of 50000 seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup>) were then introduced to these plots.
