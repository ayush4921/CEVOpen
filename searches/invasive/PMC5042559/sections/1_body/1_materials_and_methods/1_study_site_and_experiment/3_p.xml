 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, plots (1m
 <sup>2</sup>, separated by 2m) were installed in open grassland habitat and paired oak woodland habitat. The two habitats differ in the identity of dominant herbaceous species and the presence of leaf litter [
 <xref rid="pone.0163930.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Average soil temperatures and soil moisture in the top 5cm of soil were also lower in oak woodland plots (18.4°C and 1.6%, respectively) compared to open grassland plots (22.2°C and 6.4%, respectively).
