<p>The total number of phylotypes across all soil samples was 5604 and 4349, for bacteria and fungi respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163930.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The average number of phylotypes per soil sample was 1781 and 687, for bacteria and fungi respectively. Oak woodland soil samples tended to harbor more bacterial and fungal phylotypes than open grassland samples (although the differences were not statistically significant; ANOVA P &gt; 0.05;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163930.s002">S2 Fig</xref> for Shannon diversity). Both bacterial and fungal soil community composition were significantly different between open grasslands and oak woodlands (PERMANOVA R

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.28, P &lt; 0.001, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163930.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref> respectively). Bacteria from the proteobacterial classes alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and Acidobacteria subgroup 6 as well as fungi from the Pezizomycetes, Agaricomycetes and Eurotiomycetes classes were more abundant in oak soils than in grassland soils (Wilcoxon test P &lt; 0.01 after FDR;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163930.s005">S1 Table</xref> for results at the genus level). Acidobacteria from the classes Solibacteres and Acidobacteriia, Spartobacteria, Planctomycetia and Phycisphaerae, and fungi from the classes Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes and Glomeromycetes were more abundant in open grassland soils (Wilcoxon test P &lt; 0.01 after FDR;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163930.s005">S1 Table</xref> for results at the genus level). As expected from the contrasted fungal taxonomic composition, oak woodlands were different from open grasslands based on the overall abundance of fungal functional guilds (

 <italic>Drechslera</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species) were more abundant in open grasslands (Wilcoxon test P &lt; 0.01 after FDR;
