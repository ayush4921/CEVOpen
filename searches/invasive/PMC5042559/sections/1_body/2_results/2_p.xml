<p>We found no significant effects of seed density treatments or clipping treatments on soil microbial richness (ANOVA P &gt; 0.05 for both bacteria and fungi; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163930.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) or microbial community composition (PERMANOVA P &gt; 0.05 for both bacteria and fungi; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163930.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>) within each habitat type. Likewise, for those plots where we simulated the oak environment, we observed no significant effects of the litter or shade treatments on the richness of soil bacterial communities (Wilcoxon test P &gt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163930.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) or bacterial community composition (PERMANOVA P &gt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163930.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). For fungi, we detected weak significant effects of litter on richness (Wilcoxon test P &lt; 0.01; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163930.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and on fungal community composition (PERMANOVA R
