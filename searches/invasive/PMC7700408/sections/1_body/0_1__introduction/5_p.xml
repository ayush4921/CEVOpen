 <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> is also spreading in the Black Sea region. In 2014, it was first recorded for Crimea [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and East Turkey [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and three years later, in 2017, in the Adjara Region in southeastern Georgia [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Based on these data, we hypothesized that 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic> could also spread to the Black Sea Coast of the Russian Caucasus. We performed field surveys that confirmed this hypothesis. Herein, we report the first records of 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in European Russia, namely in Sochi. This city is located a great distance from the previously known localities of 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in the surrounding regions: About 500 km from Crimea, about 450 km from east Turkey, and about 250 km from Adjara.
