<p>It is interesting that 
 <italic>D. suzuki</italic> has become a global invader very quickly. In particular, in less than 10 years after the first record in Europe, this species has spread over much of Europe, from the Netherlands in the north to the Balkan Peninsula in the south. It has also spread to West Asia, North America and South America, Africa, and Oceania [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our findings in the Russian Caucasus demonstrate that this species could be present in many other regions and stay unnoticed there for a long time. It indicates that the real range of the species could be more extensive than it is believed now, and special surveys should be made in different regions of the world to discover new populations. It is not difficult to find the spotted-wing drosophila if it is established in the region. A variety of simple types of traps bated with wine, vinegar, or grape are shown to be effective to collect drosophila.
