    "Spotted-wing drosophila <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> (Matsumura) is one of the most important invasive pests of fruit and wine production worldwide. This species feeds on <i>Prunus</i> spp., <i>Rubus</i> spp., <i>Fragaria</i> spp. (Rosaceae), <i>Vaccinium</i> spp. (Ericaceae), <i>Vitis</i> spp. (Vitaceae), and other soft fruits. It causes significant damage because, unlike most other <i>Drosophila</i> species, it oviposits and feeds on healthy fruits. <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> is a quarantine pest that is included on the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) A2 List. This species is native to East Asia and has been rapidly spreading through Europe since 2008. Herein, we report the first records of <i>D. suzukii</i> in European Russia. In 2017 and 2020, we placed baited traps in different districts of the resort city of Sochi (Black sea Coast of the Caucasus, Krasnodar Territory, Russia). Three specimens of <i>D. suzukii</i> were collected in June 2017, two specimens in September 2017, and 44 specimens in September 2020. Specimens were identified by the typical female ovipositor, spotted wings of the males, and other morphological characters. Krasnodar Territory is one of the main fruit-producing regions of Russia. Therefore, populations of this pest should be monitored and measures to minimize economic damage should be taken."
