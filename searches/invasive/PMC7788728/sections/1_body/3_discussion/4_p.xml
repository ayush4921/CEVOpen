<p id="Par58">While the origins of viruses that replicate in plant and insect vectors remains unknown, such as those within order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> and 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, the discovery of possible intermediate forms has been suggested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Whereas tenuiviruses are known to be plant viruses that replicate in the insect vector tenui-like viruses have been reported from non-plant vectors. Li, Shi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reported the first tenui-like virus, 
 <italic>Horsefly horwuvirus</italic> (virus WhHV), associated with a pool of horseflies (family 
 <italic>Tabanidae</italic>), and proposed that it may represent a transitional form between plant-infecting virus and arthropod-specific viruses. In addition, a partial genome sequence of another tenui-like, FCTenV1, has been reported associated to 
 <italic>Culex annulirostris</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. While these two tenui-like viruses have been reported associated with flies (Order Diptera), we characterized a new tenui-like virus sequence closely related to the FCTenV1, associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> transcriptome (Order Hymenoptera). Interestingly, in contrast with WhHV, which lacks an ambisense coding strategy, the SINV-14 genome sequence exactly mirrors the genomic structure of typical plant tenuivirus, predicted to encode proteins using ambisense strategy, and also has the conserved sequences at the ends of all four segments identical to those found in tenuivirus genomes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, B). While these virus sequences may represent different steps of transitional viruses forms between tenui-infecting plant and those insects-specific viruses, the direction of the process, whether they come from plant to insect or otherwise, remains unknown.
