<p id="Par57">Our analysis of RNA obtained from geographically and temporally different samples suggests shifts in the virome of native and invasive fire ants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In established exotic populations of the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> Yang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] identified SINV-1 and SINV-2 and hypothesized that while these two viruses may persist, the more virulent virus, SINV-3 arrived with founders but caused high host mortality resulting in individual carriers of the virus being rapidly eliminated. Nine additional viruses were identified in 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> RNA samples from the native South American range of the species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The viruses described here show distribution and composition that varied according to geographic location and 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> stage (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To date, four of five viruses previously reported associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> in introduced areas have also been described to occur in its native origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although viral diversity associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> has been well studied in Argentina, the viruses reported in this study have not been detected there yet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting that these viruses may not be present in the sampled area in Argentina, and even that new host-virus associations may have occurred in introduced areas.
