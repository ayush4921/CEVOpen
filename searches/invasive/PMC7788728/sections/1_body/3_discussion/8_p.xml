<p id="Par62">We presented strong evidence that the sequences from SINV-14 may be from a virus that has been associated long-term and may actively replicate in ants. However, the possibility of this virus, and other tenui-like viruses, replicating in plants is unknown. The presence of the protein carrying an NS4 domain, that is related to cell-to-cell and long-distance movement in plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] in insect viruses is puzzling. Solenopsis invicta virus 14 NS4 is highly divergent showing 19.85 to 24.4% of identity compared to other tenuivirus (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S2). In addition, mutation in most sites associated with cell-to-cell and long-distance movement (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S2), suggests that this protein might have lost the capacity to move viral genome in plant, whereas its maintenance in insect viruses may be related to another role acquired through functional diversification. The possible function of the plant virus movement protein from insect viruses is of significant interest, and its role in insects and plants remains to be addressed.
