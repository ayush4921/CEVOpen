<p id="Par63">Altogether, based on virus abundance compared to housekeeping genes, abundant viruses with viral reads higher than 0.01%, phylogenetic relationship, complete viral coding sequence regions recovered, and compositional bias for SINV-14, our results suggest that four out five viruses reported here, those being SINV-14, SINV-15, SINV-16 and SINV-17 are truly replicating in 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic>. Our results suggest fluid shifts in the virome of this invasive species. Further research describing this virome in native and invasive regions and ecosystems could provide insight on virus evolution and invasion mechanics.
