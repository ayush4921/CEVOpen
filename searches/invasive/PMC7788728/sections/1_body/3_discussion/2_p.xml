<p id="Par56">Using a transcriptome approach, we searched for RNA viruses in the SRA data collected from 
 <italic>S. invicta.</italic> Curiously, while a great diversity of positive and negative sense viruses have been reported from ants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and other arthropods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> virome has been composed mainly of   ssRNA viruses in the order 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic>, with no negative sense RNA viruses previously reported. One factor that could be responsible for this bias is the selection of polyadenylated RNA for library preparation in previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The utilization of unbiased library preparation, using ribosomal depletion methods, besides the detection of + ssRNA viruses, has enabled the discovery of many viruses with non-polyadenylated genome, especially within order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The fact of some of the libraries used here were prepared using this approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] allowed us to characterize the first bunyavirus reported from ants. In addition, we also reported for the first time another negative sense virus within the order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic>. Although we did not perform any amplification step of viruses genomes characterized here, the presence of untruncated ORFs carrying intact functional domains (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3), the high abundance of viral reads, and the similar organization and genomes sizes compared to other closely related viruses strongly suggest that we obtained the correct full-length or near full-length genomes sequences (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The only exception is SINaDNV, due to the linear single strand DNA genome, only active transcriptional units were sampled using our transcriptome approach and further investigation is needed to reveal its full-length genome structure.
