 <italic>S. invicta</italic> is a ground-dwelling ant that feeds on a broad diet that may include plant and insect exudates, prey, and decaying matter. Thus, the opportunities for exchange of virus particles from the environment, whether native or novel, are many. The social nature of ant colonies where exchanges of biological fluids among colony members of all castes and life stages must occur also facilitates distribution of virus within the colony. Distinguishing clearly between different host/microbe relationships and forms of virus transmission (horizontal and vertical) will be challenging with invasive ant systems.
