<p id="Par59">Phylogenetic incongruence observed between the nucleocapsid protein compared to the other proteins strongly suggests that SINV-14 may have a recombinant/reassortment origin, where the RNA3 or part of it was acquired from a divergent phenuivirus. While it could be argued that this might be an artefact due to assembling a segmented genome using a transcriptome approach, the fact that we did not find any other contigs related to phenuiviruses, the high read abundance, the constant association between these four segments across different libraries and the presence of the conserved tenuivirus sequence located at the ends of genome segments (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), suggest that they are part of a unique genome, rather than being an artefact. In addition, phylogenetic congruence among different segments indicate that they are in an intimate codivergence process (Additional file
