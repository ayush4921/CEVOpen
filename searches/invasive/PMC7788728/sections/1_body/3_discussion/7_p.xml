<p id="Par61">While SINV-14 is evolutionarily closely related to insect tenui-like viruses and plant tenuivirus, the synonymous codon usage and dinucleotide analyses demonstrate a distinct compositional bias compared to FCTenV1 and WhHV, and all other viruses analyzed here, indicating that the virus may be actively replicating in ants rather than plants and other insects. The active replication may have driven the virus genome to distinct compositional bias at the nucleotide level, while maintaining protein integrity at the amino acid level and close relationship with those of other tenui-like viruses, as observed through phylogenetic analysis. The fact that most sequences examined here are probably from viruses that replicate in plant or vertebrate hosts and also in the insect vector could be the reason driving such difference between SINV-14, most likely associated only with ant, compared to other viruses. Furthermore, phylogenetic congruence across different segments that mirror the genetic structure of invasive
