<p id="Par44">Virus sequences were found associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> transcriptomes collected from three geographic locations in the U.S. and one location from Taiwan, representing different stages of the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> life cycle (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). De novo assembling of non-host reads (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) from 13 libraries followed by BLAST analyses revealed the presence of complete or near-complete genomes sequences of 4 putative new single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses, tentatively named S. invicta virus 14 (SINV-14), SINV-15, SINV-16 and SINV-17, and one partial genome sequence encompassing the almost full-length coding sequence of a putative ssDNA virus, named S. invicta-associated densovirus (SINaDNV; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Sequence comparisons revealed extensive divergence across ORFs and genomic regions with most of them sharing less than 40% amino acid identity compared to those closest homologous sequences previously characterized (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). In addition, typical domains associated with RdRp and other proteins involved in virus replication, encapsidation, and entry into the cell were found and characteristic of known virus groups, again supporting the viral identity of those sequences (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Further analyses demonstrated that SINV-14 and SINV-15 fit within the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> and 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The two other + ssRNA genome sequences, SINV-16 and SINV-17, were included within the family 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic> and into an unclassified group closely related to a proposed new genus of insect-infecting viruses “
 <italic>Negevirus</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], respectively. Finally, the partial ssDNA virus sequence SINaDNV was included into family 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> subfamily 
 <italic>Densovirinae</italic>.
