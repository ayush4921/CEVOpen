<p id="Par54">To further verify the relationship between SINV-14 and 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic>, we also analyzed the codon usage and dinucleotide bias (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Principal component analysis of codon usage based on RdRp, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and NS4 protein, clearly separate SINV-14 from plant viruses (tenuivirus and orthotospovirus), and non-plant viruses (phenuivirus, orthobunyavirus and tenui-like viruses; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A–D). Based on the RdRp, three very clear clusters were observed, representing plant virus, non-plant virus and SINV-14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Interestingly, the two tenui-like viruses (WhHV and FCTenv1) were closer to plant tenuiviruses than SINV-14, based on RdRp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Moreover, while SINV-14 clearly clustered separately from other groups, based on glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and NS4, this separation was not very clear between plant and non-plant viruses and tenui-like viruses, as observed for RdRp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A–D). We also performed principal component analysis on nucleotide bias obtaining similar results to the codon usage analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E–H). Whereas the RdRp cluster was not very clear, based on plant and non-plant viruses, for all other genes SINV-14 clearly separated from any other group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E–H), and again, tenui-like viruses (WhHV and FCTenv1) were closer to other groups than SINV-14.
