<p id="Par53">Interestingly, SINV-14 abundance was much higher in a sample prepared from a dissected brain compared to those from the whole body (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Considering the abundance of all segments, SINV-14 from the brain sample was 17-fold more abundant compared with 
 <italic>cox1</italic> gene, whereas abundance of those samples prepared from whole body varied 0.135 to 2.69-fold higher than 
 <italic>cox1</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, the abundance of segments was asymmetric (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). The reads mapping on RNA1 were significantly more abundant, followed by RNA3 and RNA4, with RNA2 the least abundant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C).
