<p id="Par52">To infer host-virus association and differentiate putative viruses truly replicating from those that may be a contamination, we calculated the percentage of viral reads for each library and compared with three housekeeping genes, 
 <italic>cox1</italic>, 
 <italic>rpl18</italic> and 
 <italic>eif1-beta</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). While the abundance of all three housekeeping genes were relatively stable across different libraries, it differed among them, with 
 <italic>cox1</italic> most abundant, followed by 
 <italic>rpl18</italic> and 
 <italic>eif1-beta</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Likewise, virus abundance was relatively stable within species, except for SINV-14 that varied between 0.130 and 8.394% of viral reads compared to the total reads, considering the complete genome sequence (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For SINV-14 and SINV-16, read abundance was significantly higher than 
 <italic>eif1-beta</italic> and 
 <italic>rpl18</italic>, with no difference compared to 
 <italic>cox1</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). SINV-17 abundance was significantly lower than 
 <italic>cox1</italic> and higher than 
 <italic>eif1-beta</italic> and 
 <italic>rpl18</italic>. In contrast, SINV-15 abundance was the lowest one among them, being significantly lower than 
 <italic>cox1</italic>, with no difference compared to 
 <italic>rpl18</italic> and 
 <italic>eif1-beta</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). In addition, SINV-14, SINV-15, SINV-16 and SINV-17 abundances were higher than 0.01% of reads compared to entire library (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The only exception was SINaDNV, that had a very low abundance compared to housekeeping genes and other viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
