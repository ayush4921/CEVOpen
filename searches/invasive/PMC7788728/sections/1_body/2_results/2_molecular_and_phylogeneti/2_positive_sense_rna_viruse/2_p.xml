<p id="Par49">The SINV-17 genome consists of a linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA with approximately 10,341 nt predicted to encode three putative ORFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). ORF1 was predicted to encode the longest protein containing the viral methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp domains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). ORF2 and ORF3 were predicted to encode structural proteins, which contain domains associated with virion glycoproteins of insect viruses and virion membrane proteins of plant and insect viruses, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Interestingly, while ORFs 1 and 2 were most similar to Hubei virga-like virus 8, an unclassified virus isolated from a pool of individuals of the family Scutigeridae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], ORF 3 showed significant identity to Loreto virus isolated from 
 <italic>Anopheles albimanus</italic>, a member of the proposed genus 
 <italic>Negevirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). In accordance with identity analysis, SINV-17 was most closely related to Hubei virga-like virus 8, appearing to represent a sister clade to the proposed genus 
 <italic>Negevirus</italic>, and possibly representing a new genus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C).
