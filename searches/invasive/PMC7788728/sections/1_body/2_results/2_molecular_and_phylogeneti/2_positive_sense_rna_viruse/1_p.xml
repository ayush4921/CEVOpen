<p id="Par48">SINV-16 has a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome varying from 10,355 to 10,369 nt (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D) with genome organization like viruses included in the order 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic>. The single ORF predicted encodes a large polyprotein (2910 amino acids) including RdRp, helicase, and the canonical picornavirus capsid protein domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Sequence comparison revealed significant identity with two unaccepted iflavirus-related species, pink bollworm virus 4, and Hubei myriapoda virus 1 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp domain clearly clustered SINV-16 within genus 
 <italic>Iflavirus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), most closely related to Hubei myriapoda virus 1, in a well-supported clade composed also by pink bollworm virus 4 and 
 <italic>Dinocampus coccinellae paralysis virus</italic> (DcPV). These results indicate that SINV-16 is a new iflavirus reported from 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic>.
