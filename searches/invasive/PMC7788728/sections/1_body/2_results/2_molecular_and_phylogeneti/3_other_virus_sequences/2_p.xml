<p id="Par51">In addition to the RNA viruses, we also characterized a partial genome encompassing the almost full-length coding sequence of a single-strand DNA virus (SINaDNV), predicted to encode three ORFs on the positive strand, with typical organization of viruses within the family 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). The ORFs 1 and 2 were overlapped and were most similar to NS1 and NS2 of mosquito-infecting densoviruses, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2), whereas ORF3 showed significant similarity to capsid protein of Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell densovirus (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequence of ORF1 clustered SINaDNV with viruses within subfamily 
 <italic>Densovirinae</italic> and genus 
 <italic>Brevidensovirus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). While these results strongly suggest SINaDNV is a new densovirus species, further investigation will be needed to reveal its whole genome organization.
