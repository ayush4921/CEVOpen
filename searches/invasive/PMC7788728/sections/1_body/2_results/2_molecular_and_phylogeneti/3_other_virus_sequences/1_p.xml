<p id="Par50">Two small contigs were found showing significant similarity with RNA virus sequences. The first one was 430 nt in length and exhibited highest identity with a hypothetical protein encoded by Beihai tombus-like virus 6 (41.13% sequence identity; 97% coverage; E-value = 4e-17; GenBank access: APG76145.1), isolated from a pool of marine crustaceans within the genus
