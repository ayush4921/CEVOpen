<p id="Par46">To further determine the taxonomic placement of SINV-14 within the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, Bayesian phylogenetic trees were inferred for representative ORFs from all four segments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In accordance with identity analysis, SINV-14 RdRp was most closely related to that of FCTenV1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). These two viruses clustered closely to the tenui-like 
 <italic>Horsefly horwuvirus</italic> (Wuhan horsefly virus, WhHV), the only species within the genus 
 <italic>Horwuvirus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Moreover, SINV-14 glycoprotein and NS4 phylogenetic trees were congruent with RdRp, clustering closest to FCTenV1 and composing a sister clade with typical plant tenuiviruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B and C). Interestingly, the phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein was incongruent compared to those of other viral proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). It was more closely related to that of otter fecal bunyavirus and other representative viruses within family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> rather than plant tenuiviruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D), in accordance with the identity analysis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).
