<p id="Par47">The SINV-15 genome comprises a linear negative-sense, single strand RNA varying from 10,113 to 10,135 nt (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), showing a typical organization of viruses within order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Domain-based BLAST search confirmed that ORFs 1 and 5 carry nucleocapsid and RdRp conserved domains, respectively, whereas no conserved domains were identified for ORFs 2, 3 and 4 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Thus, these ORFs were inferred based on comparative analysis with other known related viruses. According to identity analysis, phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of RdRp clustered SINV-15 closest to Formica fusca virus 1 (FfusV-1) and Formica exsecta virus 4 (FeV-4), both currently unaccepted species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The clustering of these three viruses closely related to 
 <italic>Orinoco virus</italic> (ONCV), suggests that they are putative new members of this genus within the family 
 <italic>Nyamiviridae</italic>.
