<p id="Par45">The SINV-14 genome sequence consists of a linear, negative-sense single-strand RNA composed of four segments, with similar organization of typical plant tenuiviruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). A domain-based BLAST search was performed confirming the presence of conserved domains from typical members of family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> for RdRp, glycoprotein, putative NS4 and non-nucleocapsid protein (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Identity analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of coding regions across all segments demonstrated an extensive divergence with those most closely related viruses (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). While most ORFs were most similar to that of tenui-like virus Fitzroy Crossing tenui-like virus 1 (FCTenV1) and otter fecal bunyavirus, the ORF encoded in the positive strand of RNA4 was related to those of non-nucleocapsid proteins from plant tenuiviruses (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Interestingly, the ORF encoded on the negative strand of RNA4 contained the specific domain of movement proteins (pfam03300) of plant tenuiviruses (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Further sequence analysis revealed the presence of conserved sequences at the ends of all four segments identical to those found at tenuivirus genomes (3′-ACUUUGUGU and ACACAAAGU-5′; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], indicating that full length genome segments were likely assembled from the RNA-Seq datasets.
