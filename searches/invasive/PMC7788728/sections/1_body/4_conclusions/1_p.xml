<p id="Par64">The present study expands our knowledge about viral diversity associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> in introduced areas. In addition to revealing new virus-host interactions, contributing to better understanding of viral evolutionary history and emergence, the discovery of new viruses expands the range of agents with potential to be used in biocontrol programs, which will require further biological characterization. By understanding these interactions, we may be better equipped to cope with ongoing global changes and introductions of invasive organisms and their associated viruses.
