<p id="Par36">The red imported fire ant, 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>, is an invasive pest causing significant ecological impact and economic loss in invaded areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Originating from South America, 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> was accidentally introduced into the southern region of the United States (U.S.) almost a century ago, becoming a serious problem [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since then, it has spread throughout the southeastern U.S. and more recently into Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, and California [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Limited introduction events, likely associated with small founder populations, led to a significant reduction in natural enemies and enemy diversity associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> in introduced areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> populations may reach sizes even greater than those observed in its native range, making control difficult and even more costly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. High densities observed in 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> populations in the U.S. have facilitated its dispersal across the world, contributing to repeated introduction events in several countries, such as China, Taiwan, and Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Morrison et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] demonstrated, based on predictive models, that most tropical and subtropical regions worldwide are potentially appropriate for 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> infestation. Highly competitive ability, generalist feeding habits and high populations densities make 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> a successful invasive species causing huge disturbance in biodiversity by displacing native ants and other arthropods in introduced regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Currently, chemical insecticides are the most common control strategy used against 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Low efficacy due to temporary effects of chemical applications, high cost in extensive areas, and off-target effects harmful to beneficial and other native species are substantial impairments to addressing invasive ant damage and expansion. Therefore, establishment of management strategies that are both environmentally friendly and self-sustainable are necessary.
