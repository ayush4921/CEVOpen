<p id="Par35">Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals on earth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. High throughput sequencing has led to huge advances in revealing previously unknown diversity of insect viruses, significantly contributing to filling deep phylogenetic gaps along evolutionary history within the most diverse viral lineages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, like insect diversity, the diversity of viruses associated with insects is far from clear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While many studies have focused on viromes of arbovirus-transmitting insects, especially those involved in transmission of medically important viruses, such as mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], other groups that are important pests either impacting agricultural or natural ecosystems, such as invasive ants, have been less studied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition to contributing to better understanding of basic aspects of virus ecology and evolution, these studies may contribute to new opportunities to use viruses as tools to develop more sustainable insect control methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
