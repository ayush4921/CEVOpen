<p id="Par38">Here using a metatranscriptome approach, we identified and molecularly characterized five new virus genome sequences associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> in two introduced areas, U.S and Taiwan. These investigations utilized existing publicly available RNA sequences deposited in NCBI GenBank as Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data files (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Five new virus sequences were found associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic>, with the first negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) virus sequences included in the orders 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> and 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> reported. In addition, two + ssRNA viruses sequences, included in the family 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic> and an unassigned species, and a partial ssDNA virus sequence, were also characterized.
