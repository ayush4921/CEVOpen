<p id="Par37">Classical biological control has been one strategy used in an attempt to control this pest in the U.S., with viruses considered a promising resource to be used as biopesticides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Over the last decade, a great effort has been made in characterizing the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> virome pertaining to potential use in biological control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To date, the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> virome is composed of mainly positive-sense single-strand RNA (+ ssRNA) viruses in the order 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic>. These include eleven viruses from families 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Polycipiviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Soliniviridae</italic> and two unclassified viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally, one double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and one single-strand DNA (ssDNA) of the families 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>, respectively, have been characterized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While most of these viruses have been reported associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> in its native range, only the species 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta virus 1</italic>, 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta virus 2</italic>, 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta virus 3</italic>, 
 <italic>Solenopsis invicta virus 6</italic> and 
 <italic>Nylanderia fulva virus 1</italic> have been reported in the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although great progress has been reached in identification and molecular characterization of the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> virome, the effect of these viruses and their potential use in biological control will require additional investigation. Interactions among 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> and Solenopsis invicta virus 1 (SINV-1), SINV-2 and SINV-3, have been the only ones previously characterized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. SINV-1 was shown to affect claustral queen weight making them lighter than uninfected ones, whereas SINV-2 directly affected fitness of queens by reducing their reproductive output [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. SINV-3 was shown to be the most aggressive virus, causing significant mortality in 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> colonies, with greatest potential as a biological control agent [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].
