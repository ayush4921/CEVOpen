<p id="Par41">For phylogenetic analyses, one representative sequence for each taxon most closely related to viruses described here was retrieved from GenBank according to BLASTx analysis. ORF integrity was checked and extracted using ORF finder and the presence of conserved domain characteristics for each group was checked at CDD before proceeding to phylogenetic analysis. For highly divergent data sets, regions comprising protein conserved domains were extracted using a script written in R software according to coordinates obtained from CDD for each sequence, and only the conserved domain was used (as indicated below in the figure legends). Multiple sequence alignments of deduced amino acid sequences were prepared using the MUSCLE option in MEGA7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Alignments were manually checked and adjusted when necessary. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian inference performed with MrBayes 3.2.6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Estimates of the amino acid model were automatically conducted by setting the prior for the amino acid model to mixed, as implemented in MrBayes. The analyses were carried out running two independent runs of 20,000,000 generations with sampling at every 1000 generations and a burn-in of 25%. Convergence between runs were accepted when average standard deviations of split frequencies was lower than 0.01. Trees were visualized and edited using FigTree and Corel Draw, respectively.
