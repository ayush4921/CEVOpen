<p id="Par40">Sequencing reads were trimmed for quality (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) and de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.1 with default settings. Reads associated to 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> were first filtered by mapping them back to the 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> genome (GenBank accession: GCA_000188075.2) and only unmapped reads were used for de novo assembling (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Contigs were compared against NCBI non-redundant protein sequence (nr) using BLASTx and those predicted to contain near full-length and intact coding sequences homologous to viral sequences previously described were confirmed by mapping reads back to obtain consensus sequences for each library. Potential open reading frames (ORFs) of the putative new viruses were predicted using ORF finder (NCBI) and by comparative analysis with those related viruses. For identification of conserved functional domains, a domain-based BLAST search was performed against the Conserved Domain Database (CDD). ORFs that did not present any conserved domain were predicted based on comparative analysis with other known closely related viruses [
