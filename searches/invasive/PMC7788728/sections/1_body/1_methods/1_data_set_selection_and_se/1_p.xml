<p id="Par39">Contigs corresponding to putative new virus genome sequences were initially obtained from a transcriptome project studying differential gene expression between larvae and pupae stages of 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> collected in Mississippi, U.S. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To further investigate and characterize viral diversity associated with 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic>, six libraries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] were downloaded from GenBank’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and analyzed. In addition, to determine whether those viruses were present in other locations in U.S. and abroad, several transcriptome libraries deposited at SRA were compared against those previous putative viral contigs using BLASTn. Libraries that presented high abundance of reads mapping to putative viral contigs with an E-value cutoff lower than 1e
 <sup>−2</sup> were downloaded and further analyzed. The final data set analyzed here consisted of 13 libraries, all from 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> transcriptomes. Detailed information on the samples are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All information about sample collection, RNA extraction, library preparation and high throughput sequencing has been previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
