<p id="Par42">Most samples used here were prepared from whole bodies of ants, and to differentiate truly replicating viruses from those that might be from food contamination or commensal organisms, viral abundance was compared with abundance of three housekeeping genes: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (
 <italic>cox1</italic>), that presented high transcriptional levels, ribosomal protein L18 (
 <italic>rpl18</italic>) and translation elongation factor 1 (
 <italic>eif1-beta</italic>), both with lower transcriptional levels. Viral and internal genes abundance were calculated as percentage of viral or housekeeping reads per total number of reads in each library (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Differences among groups was assessed using non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by post hoc multiple comparison test using Fisher’s least significant difference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] using Agricolae package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] in R software. The data were log-transformed before statistical testing. Thus, a virus sequence was suggested to be from a virus hosted by 
 <italic>S. invicta</italic> if they qualified in at least two of the criteria as previously suggested by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with slight modifications: (i) virus abundance was within the range or higher abundance than housekeeping genes; (ii) viral reads per total number of reads in a library was higher than 0.01%; (iii) they were phylogenetically close to another insect virus; and (iv) complete viral coding sequence regions were recovered.
