 <caption> Compositional biases of Solenopsis invicta virus 14 (SINV-14) differ from plant tenuivirus and tenui-like viruses associated with flies. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of synonymous codon usage ( A– D) and dinucleotide bias ( E– H) of SINV-14 and other viruses that infect plants and animals (vertebrate and invertebrate) are shown. Scatterplots show the first two principal components that account for the largest variance (shown in parenthesis) in the data set with ellipses representing each group and dots individuals. Viruses were divided into two main groups: plant viruses include those that replicate in plants and insect vectors belonging to the genera Tenuivirus and Orthotospovirus and non-plant viruses including those that do not replicate in plants belonging to the genera Orthobunyavirus and representatives within family Phenuiviridae. For detailed information of the data set see Additional file 4: Table S4. For NS4 protein, comparison was performed only for SINV-14, Fitzroy Crossing tenui-like virus1 (FCTenV1) and tenuiviruses, as this gene is not shared by other groups.
