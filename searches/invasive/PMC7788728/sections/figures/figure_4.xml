  <p>Boxplot of housekeeping genes and viruses abundance. 
   <bold>A</bold> Abundance among housekeeping genes from all libraries were compared. Abundance was calculated as percentage of housekeeping or viruses reads per total number of reads in each library. 
   <bold>B</bold> Abundance between viruses and housekeeping genes were compared. Statistical test was performed among virus and housekeeping genes abundance from the same libraries. 
   <bold>C</bold> Normalized abundance of S. invicta virus 14 (SINV-14) segments significantly differ among them. Normalized abundance was calculated by dividing the abundance of each segment by the total abundance of the entire genome. Box plots with different letters indicate significant differences between groups according to non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by post hoc multiple comparison test using Fisher’s least significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Box plots show the first and third quartiles as a box, horizontal line corresponds to the median and whiskers correspond to 1.5 times the inter-quartile distance (IQR) from the difference between first and third quartiles
