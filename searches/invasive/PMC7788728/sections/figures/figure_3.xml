  <p>Evolutionary history of new viruses associated to 
   <italic>S. invicta</italic> transcriptome based on Bayesian inference. Midpoint-rooted phylogenetic trees were constructed based on 
   <bold>A</bold> conserved domain (pfam00946) of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of S. invicta virus 15 (SINV-15) and representative species of the order 
   <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, 
   <bold>B</bold> conserved domain (pfam00680) of RdRp of S. invicta virus 16 (SINV-16) and representative species of the families 
   <italic>Iflaviridae</italic> and 
   <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> and 
   <bold>C</bold> full-length amino-acid sequences of RdRp of S. invicta virus 17 (SINV-17) and representative species of the proposed new genus 
   <italic>Negevirus</italic> (unassigned to any family) and families 
   <italic>Virgaviridae</italic> and 
   <italic>Kitaviridae</italic>, are shown. 
   <bold>D</bold> Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on full-length amino-acid sequences of non-structural gene 1 (NS1) of S. invicta-associated densovirus (SINaDNV) and representative species of the family 
   <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>. Bayesian posterior probabilities are shown at the nodes. Nodes with posterior probability values between &gt; 0.65 and ≤ 85 are indicated by empty circle, &gt; 0.85 and &lt; 0.95 are indicated by half-filled circles and those with values ≥ 0.95 are indicated by filled circles. The scale bar at the bottom indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Branches highlighted in red indicates viruses characterized in this study. Genera/Families/Subfamilies are shown at right side
