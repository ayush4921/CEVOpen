 <caption>
  <p>Genome organization of five putative new viruses associated with 
   <italic>S. invicta</italic> transcriptomes. Predicted open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins homologous to known viral proteins or conserved domain that they encode are represented and colored according to their orientation in the genome (dark blue: those encoded on positive strand and light blue: those encoded on negative strand). Graphic representation of 
   <bold>A</bold> segmented negative single-strand RNA genome S. invicta virus 14 (SINV-14) and 
   <bold>B</bold> conserved consensus sequence located at the ends of tenuivirus genome segment (5′-ACACAAAGU and ACUUUGAGU-3′) detected in SINV-14 genome. Dashed lines indicate incomplete sequence. Nucleotides highlighted in red differ from consensus sequence. 
   <bold>C</bold> Negative-sense single-strand RNA genome S. invicta virus 15 (SINV-15), and positive-sense single-strand RNA genomes 
   <bold>D</bold> S. invicta virus 16 (SINV-16) and 
   <bold>E</bold> S. invicta virus 17 (SINV-17) are shown. 
   <bold>F</bold> Partial double-strand DNA genome of 
   <italic>S. invicta</italic>-associated densovirus (SINaDNV) is represented. RdRp and L: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; G: glycoprotein; N: nucleocapsid protein; p3: unknown; NS4: non-structural protein 4; NCP: non-nucleocapsid protein; P: phosphoprotein; M: matrix protein; CP: capsid protein; H: Helicase; V: viral methyltransferase; F: Ftsj-like methyltransferase; NS1and NS2: non-structural protein 1 and 2, respectively
