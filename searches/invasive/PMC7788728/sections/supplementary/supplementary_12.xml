    <bold> Figure S2</bold>: Alignment of non-structural protein 4 (NS4) amino acid sequence of SINV-14 with those from typical plant tenuiviruses. Positions with single conserved amino acid are highlighted in black, groups of similar properties are highlighted in light gray and positions in SINV-14 that shares the same amino acid with at least one plant tenuivirus sequence, are highlighted in dark gray. Sites containing residues essentials for cell-to-cell movement and long-distance movement are indicated by asterisk and filled circle, respectively. These sites were mapped using Maize stripe virus (MSpV) as a model (59). Matrix of pairwise identity of NS4 amino acid sequence are shown at the bottom of the figure. Multiple sequence alignment and pairwise identity were generated in Clustal O v. 1.2.4. European wheat striate mosaic virus (EWSMV), MN044345; Rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV), MG566077; Echinochloa hoja blanca virus (EHBV), L48441; Rice stripe virus (RSV), D10979; Maize stripe virus (MSpV), L13438.
