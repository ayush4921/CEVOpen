 <caption>
  <p>Differences in bee community composition between native plant plots (pink symbols) and non‐native plant plots (dark red symbols) displayed by non‐metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS, stress value = 0.14). Sites are plotted for spring/early summer (circles) and late summer/fall (triangles) separately, resulting in two data points per site. Each symbol represents one site in one season. Corresponding native and non‐native plots of the same site in the same season are connected with gray lines</p>
