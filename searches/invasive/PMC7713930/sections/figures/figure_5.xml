  <p>Bee abundance (a) as number of individuals (n) and bee species richness (b) per sampling event at native and non‐native plots by season (data pooled for both observation years). Statistical differences between native versus non‐native plants per season were assessed with LMMs (Table 
   <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and are indicated here with asterisks when significant: *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. This and the following box plots show the interquartile range (IQR) of data, which extends from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. The line within the box indicates the median. The lower whiskers extend to the smallest observation, but not further than 1.5 * IQR from the 25th percentile. The upper whiskers extend to the largest observation, but not further than 1.5 * IQR from the 75th percentile. Outliers are plotted as individual points
