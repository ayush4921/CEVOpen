 <caption> Species specificity ( d′) of the five most abundant bee species shown for (a) native and non‐native plantings and for (b) season. The d′ index provides information on the degree of specialization of individual species and ranges from 0 (not specialized) to 1 (highly specialized). It is based on interaction links between bee species and plant species, but also takes into account the dominance of each linked plant species in the interaction network. Thus, bee species visiting the most dominant plant species are considered less specialized than bee species visiting plants that are rarely visited by other bee species. Statistical differences between plant types and seasons per bee species were assessed with LMMs (Table  4) and are indicated here with asterisks when significant: * p &lt; .05, ** p &lt; .01, *** p &lt; .001 </caption>
