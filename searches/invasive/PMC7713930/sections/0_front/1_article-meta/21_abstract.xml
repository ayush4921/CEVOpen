 <p>We show that non‐native plants are similarly or even more attractive to native bees than native plants. However, foraging patterns, bee community assemblage, and bee‐plant network structures were different with lower levels of specialization at non‐native plants. Thus, adding non‐native plants to native pollinator friendly plantings can be beneficial to wild bees, but should be confined to already disturbed human‐dominated landscapes to exclude potentially negative effects on native plant communities.
