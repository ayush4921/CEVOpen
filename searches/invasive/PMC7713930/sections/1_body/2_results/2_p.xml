<p>Over the 2‐year study period, 17 out of the 20 initially seeded pollinator friendly plants came to flower within native plant plots and 18 within non‐native plant plots (Tables 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Non‐native plants started flowering about 5 weeks earlier than native plants in both years (Tables 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the second year, many plant species of both plant types started flowering about 2 months earlier and also flowered longer. In both years, both native and non‐native plants were still flowering when observations ceased.
