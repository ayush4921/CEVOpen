<p>We recorded eight oligolectic bee species (Fowler, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) in pan traps, two of which visited our experimental plants. Three females of 
 <italic>Osmia distincta</italic> were caught on the native 
 <italic>Penstemon laevigatus</italic> (Table

 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1–S6</xref>). 
 <italic>Melissodes desponsus</italic> typically forages on 
 <italic>Cirsium</italic> plants (Fowler, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) which were not included in our experiment. Almost all 
 <italic>M. desponsus</italic> recorded were males and captured exclusively on non‐native plants (i.e., on 
 <italic>Cosmos bipinnatus</italic> (7 males, 1 female) and on 
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> (1 male)) (Table
