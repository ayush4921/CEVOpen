<p>On native plants, a total of 719 bees of 20 genera and 49 species were hand netted, and a total of 989 bees of 23 genera and 63 species were hand netted on non‐native plants. When comparing only sampling events in which all plots were sampled (once both native and non‐native plants started flowering), we found 718 bees at native and 881 bees at non‐native plots. Bee community compositions differed between native and non‐native plots (PERMANOVA:

 <italic>df</italic> = 1; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Of the total of 72 hand‐netted species, 11 species were captured only within native plots and 23 species only within non‐native plots. Many bee species, such as 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Halictus poeyi/ligatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bombus bimaculatus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Lasioglossum tegulare</italic>, occurred on both native and non‐native plants, but were more abundant within non‐native plots (e.g., 88 vs 382 visits to native and non‐native plants, respectively, by 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Other bee species, such as 
 <italic>Xylocopa virginica</italic>, 
 <italic>Lasioglossum trigeminum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Augochloropsis metallica_metallica,</italic> were more abundant on native plants (e.g., 228 vs 16 visits to native and non‐native plants, respectively, by 
 <italic>X. virginica</italic>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> was the only non‐native bee species visiting our experimental plants.
