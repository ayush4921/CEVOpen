<p>When we analyzed the subset of data for which floral cover and floral richness were available (year 2017), we found that bee abundance and bee species richness were best explained by floral cover and increased with increasing proportions of floral cover (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Additionally, bee abundance increased with plant diversity in the early and late season as did bee species richness in the early season (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Moreover, in the late season, more bee species visited non‐native than native plots (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). In spring and early summer of 2017, floral richness was twice as high in non‐native (mean ± 
 <italic>SD</italic>: 7 ± 2) than native (3 ± 2) plots while floral cover was similar (native: 15.9% ± 19.0%; non‐native: 17.0% ± 14.4%). In summer of 2017, floral cover was highly variable and floral richness similar across plot types (floral cover, native: 35.3% ± 20.7%; non‐native: 24.3% ± 12.1%; floral richness, native: 6 ± 1; non‐native: 7 ± 2), and in late summer and fall, floral cover and richness were higher in native than non‐native plots (floral cover, native: 40.0% ± 20.4%; non‐native: 21.2% ± 11.8%; floral richness, native: 7 ± 1; non‐native: 5 ± 2 (mean ± 
 <italic>SD</italic>)).
