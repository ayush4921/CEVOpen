<p>Bee abundance and species richness recorded per hand‐netting event differed between native and non‐native plots in some but not all seasons (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In spring and early summer, both abundance and species richness were significantly lower at native plots than at non‐native plots (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Species richness was also significantly lower at native plots in late summer and fall (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These differences of bee abundance and species richness at native and non‐native plots per sampling event also remained when restricting analyses of spring and early summer to sampling events where both plant types were flowering (Table
