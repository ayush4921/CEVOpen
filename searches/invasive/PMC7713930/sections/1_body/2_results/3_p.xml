<p>A total of 3,744 bees representing 31 genera and 120 species were recorded in this study. Pan traps sampled 2,036 bees, representing 30 different genera and 107 different species (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> for complete species list). With hand netting, 1,708 bees were sampled, comprising 25 different genera and 72 different species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Some of the bee species were only recorded with one of the two sampling methods: Pan trapping sampled 89% of the total of 120 bees, and 48 species (40%) were sampled exclusively. Hand netting sampled 60% of all species seen in this study, 13 species (11%) exclusively.
