<p>The specialization (H2′) of the recorded plant–bee networks also differed between plots and seasons (Table

 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1–S6</xref>). Native plants were part of more specialized networks than non‐native plants, and early season networks were more specialized than late season networks (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). These trends also remained when removing honeybees (
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>) from networks (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36826-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>, also see 2.3 Statistics). Early season networks included fewer plant and bee species (Figures
