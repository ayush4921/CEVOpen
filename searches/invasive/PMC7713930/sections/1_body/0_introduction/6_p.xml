<p>In this 2‐year study, we experimentally tested how flowering plants grown from seed mixes composed of either native or non‐native seeds affected the abundance, species richness, and community structure of bees. We also investigated the specialization of visitation networks and the specialization of individual bee species. As both native and non‐native seed mixes were comprised of bee‐friendly plant species, we expected similar bee abundances and species richness for native and non‐native plantings. Furthermore, we expected bees to forage in a more specialized manner on native than non‐native plants. Our study is the first to experimentally compare native versus non‐native pollinator friendly plant communities planted in plots of the same size in a common garden experiment.</p>
