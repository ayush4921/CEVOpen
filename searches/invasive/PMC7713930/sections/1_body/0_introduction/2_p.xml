<p>Bees are important pollinators worldwide and largely rely on pollen and nectar of plants as main food resources (Carvell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Michener, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Vaudo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Reductions in plant abundance and diversity as a consequence of land use change are considered one of the reasons for the currently observed decline in bee populations worldwide (Baude et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Kennedy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Robinson &amp; Sutherland, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Winfree et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). As a consequence, providing adequate and sufficient floral resources may be a key measure for supporting wild bee populations (Vanbergen &amp; Initiative, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). To provide food resources for bees, many seed companies, botanical associations, and other interest groups have compiled and promoted “pollinator friendly” plant lists and/or seed mixes. The nectar and/or pollen from these mixes of plants are believed attractive to pollinators, but this assumption has not been extensively tested (Ratnieks &amp; Garbuzov, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Hicks et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) showed that nectar and pollen quantity and quality varied among 23 pollinator friendly plants, but they did not assess bee visitation, while Garbuzov and Ratnieks (
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) found highly fluctuating bee visitation rates among 32 UK garden plants. Therefore, the attractiveness of pollinator friendly plants for bees deserves further exploration.
