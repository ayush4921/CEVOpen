<p>Many commercially available pollinator friendly plant mixes often include both native and non‐native plants (Fowler,

 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Selecting plants for pollinators based on the quality or quantity of floral rewards, rather than their native range, may benefit bees and support conservation efforts. However, non‐native plants may adversely affect native bee communities by providing floral resources of inappropriate nutritional value or by benefiting generalist over specialist bee species. The (long‐term) effect of non‐native plants on bee communities warrants further investigation (Garibaldi et al.,
