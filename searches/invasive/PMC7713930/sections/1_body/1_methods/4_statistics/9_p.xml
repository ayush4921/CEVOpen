<p>Network analyses as well as statistical analyses on differences of bee abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity, and bee community composition between native and non‐native plots were based on data from hand netting, while data from pan traps were only used to gain information on the potential pool of visitors to experimental plants. Data from pan trap sampling were not used to test for effects of plant nativity on bee community composition due to the close proximity of native and non‐native plots. Bees with uncertain identification were included in analyses of abundances, but not in analyses of bee diversity or bee community composition.</p>
