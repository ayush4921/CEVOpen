<p>We visualized and analyzed plant–bee visitation networks with the “bipartite” package (functions “plotweb,” “networklevel,” and “specieslevel” (Dormann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>)). Species that could be identified to genus level only were included in networks if no other species of the same genus was present (i.e., 
 <italic>Melissodes</italic> and 
 <italic>Sphecodes)</italic>. The H2′ index within the function “networklevel” was used to compare the community‐level specialization of each network (Blüthgen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). At the species level, we used the 
 <italic>d</italic>′ index of the function “specieslevel” to compare the specializations in plant visitation of single bee species within a network (Blüthgen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). We assessed species specificity (
 <italic>d</italic>′) of the five most abundant bee species and only included those 
 <italic>d</italic>′ values for these species that were based on more than two observations per network.
