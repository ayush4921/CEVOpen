<p>For network and species specificity, we obtained always one H2′ value and one 
 <italic>d</italic>′ value (per species) for each of the 18 networks (i.e., each native and non‐native plot at each of the three sites for each of the three seasons pooled across years). Our models for network and species specificity included plant nativity and season as fixed effects and site as a random effect. To ensure that trends in network specificity were not heavily influenced by the behavior of the non‐native and domesticated honeybee (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>), we performed additional network analyses excluding this species.
