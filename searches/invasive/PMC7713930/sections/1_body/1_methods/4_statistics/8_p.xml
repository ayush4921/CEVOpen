<p>To analyze bee community composition, we visualized data using non‐metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS; function “metaMDS,” “vegan” package) with a Bray–Curtis distance matrix based on the abundances of different bee species (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Differences in bee community composition between native and non‐native plots were then assessed using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; “adonis” function in the “vegan” package; 100 000 permutations) also based on Bray–Curtis distances between abundances of bee species (“vegdist” function, “vegan” package (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>)). As only bees were included in this analysis and not their temporally changing interactions with plants, we only included data of the early and late seasons here and excluded the midseason to avoid pseudoreplication.
