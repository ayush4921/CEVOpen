<p>All statistical analyses were performed with R version R 3.5.1 (R Core Team,

 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Data were collected over a period of 4–6 months per year corresponding to the entire flowering period of experimental plants. The data set therefore comprised bee and plant species that did not necessarily co‐occur due to different phenologies. To restrict network analyses to co‐occurring species, we followed the approach by Kantsa et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) of composing several phenologically matched networks. We differentiated between three partly overlapping seasons, that is, spring to early summer (April 1–July 15), midsummer (June 1–August 31), and late summer to fall (July 16–October 3). For each season, data were pooled across years. Midsummer overlapped with the early and late seasons in order to smoothly incorporate the phase of transition from early to late season, capturing the late species of the early season and the early species of the late season. It is nevertheless important to treat midsummer as a distinct season, as many studies often focus exclusively on this time period (Chrobock, et al.,
