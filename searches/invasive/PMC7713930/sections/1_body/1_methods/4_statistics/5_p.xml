<p>Due to the earlier flowering of non‐native plants resulting in a higher number of sampling events at non‐native plots, we based our comparisons of bee abundance and richness on visitations per sampling event. To additionally account for the uneven sampling, we performed supplementary analyses for spring/early summer (the only season were sampling days differed) which were restricted to those sampling events where plants of both types were flowering.</p>
