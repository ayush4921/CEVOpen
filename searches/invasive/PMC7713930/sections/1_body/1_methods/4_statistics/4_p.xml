<p>We analyzed differences in bee species richness per sampling event, abundance per sampling event, network specificity (H2′) per season, and species specificity (
 <italic>d</italic>′) per season between native and non‐native plots using linear mixed‐effect models (LMM; “lmer” function, “lme4” package (Bates et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>)). Data were log‐transformed where necessary (i.e., bee species richness and abundance) in order to achieve a normal distribution (as visually assessed with histograms and tested with Shapiro tests). We calculated models for species richness and abundance (per sampling event) for each season and included plant nativity as a fixed effect and site and Julian date as random effects. As floral variables were measured in 2017 only, we did not include them in our main models. However, we composed additional models for the data of 2017 which included floral abundance and floral richness as fixed effects to test for their effect on bee diversity and abundance (see Table
