<p>Final species determination was done by Sam Droege at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. Species and sampling information of all bees were made publicly available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.discoverlife.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.discoverlife.org</ext-link>. Note that bee individuals of 
 <italic>Halictus poeyi</italic> and 
 <italic>Halictus ligatus</italic> were indistinguishable and therefore placed in one group (i.e., 
 <italic>Halictus poeyi/ligatus</italic>) as were 
 <italic>Hylaeus affinis</italic> and 
 <italic>Hylaeus modestus</italic>.
