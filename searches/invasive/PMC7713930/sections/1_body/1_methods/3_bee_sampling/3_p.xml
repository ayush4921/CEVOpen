<p>On each day of hand netting, bees were also sampled with pan traps (except for 15 July 2016). Additionally, we sampled bees with pan traps once in April 2016 and once in May 2016 before plants started flowering. We followed guidelines by Droege (
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) for pan trap sampling. We placed twelve pan traps (3.5 oz) filled with soapy water and colored in fluorescent blue, yellow, and white along plot edges in the morning, before the hand netting started. We recollected the traps in the evening, after hand netting was finished. When recollecting traps, we drained the soap water with paper–nylon mesh paint strainers (190 μm) and stored the specimens separated by plot in 70% ethanol. The sampling days of pan trap sampling were identical for all plots. Overall, we obtained 9 and 13 samples per plot or 54 or 78 samples in total, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
