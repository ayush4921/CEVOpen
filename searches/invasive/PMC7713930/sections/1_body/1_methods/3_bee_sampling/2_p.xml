<p>Bees were sampled by hand netting and with pan traps between April and October in 2016 and 2017. Sampling took place approximately every 2 weeks (13.3 ± 5.7 days (mean ± 
 <italic>SD</italic>) between consecutive sampling events) on rain‐free and (mostly) sunny days. Each year, hand netting started as soon as the first plants started to bloom (resulting in different starting points for native and non‐native plots) and was performed during 30‐min random walks through plots: All bees observed to touch reproductive flower parts were captured from flowers with a ziplock plastic bag. Nectar‐ or pollen‐gathering behavior was not distinguished. We stored bees in 70% ethanol for identification. All plots were sampled within 1 day between 9:00 and 18:00 in alternating random order. Hand netting was always performed by the same person (N. Seitz). Note that 
 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic> closed its flowers very early in the day, which is why these plants could not be observed later in the day. We therefore conducted additional sampling of 
 <italic>C. intybus</italic> in the morning of the next day (2 August 2017 and 25 August 2017). Furthermore, sampling on 1 August 2017 was interrupted by rain and therefore continued the next day. Over 2 years, 21 hand netting events were conducted across sites. In 2016, non‐native plots were sampled eight times and native plots five times due to a later onset of flowering at native plots. In 2017, non‐native plots were sampled 13 times and native plots 11 times at site B and 10 times at sites A and C due to a later onset of flowering at these sites. We at least partly accounted for these differences in flowering time by calculating bee numbers per sampling event (see 2.3 Statistics for details).
