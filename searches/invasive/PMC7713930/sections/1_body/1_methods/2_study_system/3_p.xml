<p>Both the native and non‐native seed mixes contained 20 different flower species and two grass species each (Tables 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece36826-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Grasses are typically added to pollinator friendly meadows as they also provide nesting or overwintering sites for insects and can protect wildflowers by preventing soil erosion (Lee‐Mäder et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The plants in the seed mixes were chosen to fulfill the following criteria: (a) pollinator friendliness as assessed through consulting existing databases on pollinator friendly plants (i.e., by The Xerces Society, Pollinator Partnership, USDA, Royal Horticultural Society, Ernst Conservation Seeds); (b) complementary flowering periods spanning the whole season of bee activity; (c) an even distribution of flower colors; (d) a mix of different plant families; (e) mostly perennials (12–15 species) with a few annuals/biennials (5–8 species) to facilitate establishment in the first year; (f) adaptation to medium to dry and sandy soil; and (g) availability from seed retailers.
