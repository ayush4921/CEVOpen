<p>The study took place at the Beltsville research farm of the University of Maryland, USA. The Beltsville facility spans 116 ha in a rural landscape with forest fragments, creeks, ponds, and agricultural fields. At the research farm, we established three experimental sites which were 1–1.7 km apart from each other (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Each site had two plots: one sown with a native pollinator friendly seed mix and one sown with a non‐native pollinator friendly seed mix (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece36826-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Plots were 10 × 10 m in size, and the distance between the two treatment plots was 20 m. The central coordinates for the three sites were 39.025705, −76.842232 (site A); 39.018170, −76.821249 (site B); and 39.007196, −76.820480 (site C).
