<p>The occurrence of more specialists in a plant–bee network can be one reason for an increased network specialization. Another reason can be more specialized interactions of generalist species. In our study, most bee species were generalists. Although generalist bees typically feed on a broad range of floral resources, their foraging patterns and thus their level of specialization can vary with the spectrum of plants available (Cook et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). For example, three out of the five most abundant generalist species in our study showed more specialized foraging when feeding on native plants. While we did find that non‐native networks were comprised of slightly more plant species than native networks, this difference should not have affected network or species specialization, as both

 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). One reason for a more specialized foraging behavior of generalists on native plants could be overall stronger differences in chemical profiles between native plants, with specific plant species better meeting the nutritional requirements of specific bee species. Native generalist bees could also have evolved a higher degree of specialization on certain native plant species, through adapting to their chemical repertoire.
