<p>Previous studies comparing the attractiveness of native and non‐native plants found inconsistent results. Notably, none of these studies strictly focused on pollinator friendly plants or differentiated between seasons (e.g., Lopezaraiza‐Mikel et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Morandin &amp; Kremen, 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), which may explain why our study found non‐native plants to be, depending on the season, similarly or more attractive to bees compared to native plants.
