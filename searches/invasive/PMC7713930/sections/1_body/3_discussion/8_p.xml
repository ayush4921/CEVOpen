<p>The flowering periods of our plants changed from one year to the next. In the second year, many plants started flowering earlier and flowered for longer periods than in the first year. These changes were likely due to the early stage of the (small scale) meadow established in the first year. Overall, our survey focused on bee visitation of meadows in establishment as opposed to long‐established pollinator friendly vegetation. Lee‐Mäder et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) indicated that regular flowering of (perennial) wildflower meadows does usually not begin before the third year after establishment. Both native and non‐native plantings had few plant species in the early establishment phase. However, the scarcity of flowers in spring was more pronounced for native than non‐native plots in both years, which likely explains at least part of the differences in bee abundance observed for the spring/early summer period. This agrees with Mallinger et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) who pointed out that floral resources are often scarce in natural grasslands in spring and that bees therefore rely on additional floral resources provided by woodlands or anthropogenically managed habitats. Where woodlands are not available, non‐native plants as part of pollinator friendly meadows may provide valuable resources for the local bee community at times when native plants are still scarce or absent. Their inclusion in pollinator friendly seed mixes should nevertheless be treated with extreme caution, because, even though they may benefit pollinator communities, non‐native plants, such as invasive plants, may exert unpredictable and potentially detrimental pressures on native animal and plant communities (Chrobock, et al.,
