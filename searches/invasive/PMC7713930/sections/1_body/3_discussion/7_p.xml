<p>Network specialization also changed over the seasons for interactions involving both native and non‐native plants. Specialization was highest in the early season and decreased toward fall. The higher degree of specialization coincided with a lower number of plant species as part of the networks in spring, which is not uncommon for grasslands (Mallinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36826-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The drop in network specialization may be a consequence of an increase in relative abundance of very generalist generalists toward the end of the flowering season (e.g., honeybees and bumblebees). These bees can forage on a broad spectrum of plant species and tended to also decrease their level of specialization toward the end of the flowering season. Unfortunately, we are not aware of other studies which have assessed changes in network and species specialization over the flowering season and can therefore not relate our findings to other studies.
