<p>To conclude, our study suggests that non‐native plants can complement native pollinator friendly plantings, because they are visited by a broad spectrum of bees and buffer gaps in grassland native plant flowering times, particularly in early spring. However, non‐native plants also alter the composition of plant communities, may not support as many specialist bees, and appear to affect individual and network specialization of bee communities with unknown consequences for plants and bees. Given the already severe alteration of our ecosystems as a result of anthropogenic activities worldwide, the use of selected non‐native plants in meadows or flower strips along crop fields as food resources for bees and other pollinators can be considered a pragmatic possibility to partially compensate for the scarcity of natural habitats and native plants in landscapes heavily dominated by humans. We should, however, make sure to prevent the spread of non‐native plant species to (semi‐)natural areas, where they may disturb established natural plant and bee communities with unknown consequences for these ecosystems. We therefore suggest that non‐native plants should only be included, with caution, in pollinator friendly plant mixes used in human‐dominated landscapes and only when complementary to native pollinator friendly plants. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of analyzing entire flowering periods instead of focusing solely on specific seasons (e.g., summer) and of taking into account phenological matching for network analyses (see also Kantsa et al. (

More research that experimentally compares native versus non‐native pollinator friendly plant mixes in different regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, at different scales and with other plant species would be helpful in order to best support local bee communities and to globally improve conservation strategies for bees.
