<p>Our study showed that a seed mix of non‐native pollinator friendly plants was well accepted and frequented by a diverse bee community. Depending on the season, non‐native plants attracted either similar or higher numbers of individuals and species compared to native plants. Particularly in the early and late season, many bees chose non‐native over native plants, while no differences were found in the middle of summer. Generally, bee visitation increased with increasing floral resource coverage, which has also been shown by previous studies (Banaszak,

For spring and early summer, native plants were still scarce which likely contributed to the smaller number of bees sampled. During summer and fall, when numbers of flowers were similar across plots, non‐native plants still attracted more bees. One possible explanation for this difference is that late flowering non‐native plants offered higher quantities of nutritionally more attractive floral resources. Alternatively, non‐native plant flowers may have had more attractive visual or olfactory cues than native plants.
