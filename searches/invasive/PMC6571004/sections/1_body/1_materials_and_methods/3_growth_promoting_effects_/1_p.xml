<p>According to phylogenetic analysis, six isolates were randomly selected from three dominant genera to study their effects on the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings, including two 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (WS29 and WS14), three 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> (XM06, XM04, and WS05) and one 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> (XS01). Seeds and soil were, respectively, collected from wild 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and cropland in Kunming city, Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Seeds were surface sterilized by submerging them in 4% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min and were rinsed with sterile water five to six times. A substrate that included cropland soils, humus, and vermiculite were mixed at a proportion of 3:2:1 and sterilized three times at 24 h intervals by autoclaving (121 °C, 0.135 MPa, 2 h). Five milliliters of bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>9</sup> CFU/ml) of each isolate mixed with 50 ml of sterile water was separately injected into a sterilized plastic cup (700 ml) containing 20 g sterilized soil mixture and sown with approximately 30 surface-sterilized seeds of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in each cup, and the cup was sealed with sterilized PTFE bacteria filter membranes. The assay was repeated three times for each isolate, and the control group was not inoculated with bacterial suspension. Seeds were germinated in an RXZ-380D growth chamber (Ningbo Southeast instrument Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China) with a temperature of 25/20 °C (day/night), light intensity of 12,000 lux for a 12-h photoperiod and humidity of 60%.
