<p>R 3.5.2 was used for random sampling among all isolates, and the OTU rarefaction curve at 97% sequence identity was plotted in Excel 2013 (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA). The Shannon diversity index of each 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individual was calculated using Excel 2013 (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2003</xref>). One-way ANOVA was used to compare Shannon diversity across different study regions. A nonparametric test was used to compare the production capacity of growth-promoting products between sampling areas. To meet the normality assumption, log transformations were applied to IAA accumulation and the phosphorus solubility index, and a square-root transformation was applied to siderophore units. One-way ANOVA was used to calculate these three kinds of growth-promoting products produced by 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> reNFB across the dominant genus, and the homogeneity test of variance passed or failed to select Duncan or Dunnett T3 for pairwise comparison. In addition, we performed linear regression analysis between the Shannon diversity index of each 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and their reNFB growth-promoting product productivity.
