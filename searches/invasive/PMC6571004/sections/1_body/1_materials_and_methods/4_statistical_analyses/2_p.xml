<p>Log transformations were applied to the root and shoot biomass of the experimental seedlings to meet normality and homoscedasticity assumptions. Independent-samples 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the different effects of each bacterial treatment and sterilized control on the growth performance of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings. In addition, we calculated the response index (RI) to evaluate the effect of reNFB on the shoots and roots of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings. RI was calculated as follows: (variable
 <sub>inoculation</sub> âˆ’ variable
 <sub>sterility</sub>)/variable
 <sub>sterility</sub> (
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Williamson &amp; Richardson, 1988</xref>), where variable
 <sub>inoculation</sub> and variable
 <sub>sterility</sub> were the shoot or root length and biomass of each cup (replicates), with inoculation treatment and sterilized control, respectively. Normality assumptions were not met; thus, nonparametric tests were used to compare the differences in RI between shoots and roots.
