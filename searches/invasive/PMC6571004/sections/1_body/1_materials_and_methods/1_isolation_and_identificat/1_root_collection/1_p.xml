<p>We collected 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> roots from five regions in Yunnan Province (22°37′–25°52′N, 99°18′–104°10′E, 1,708–2,128 m), Southwest China, and named them XM, CY, XS, WS, and YL (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All of the sampling sites were along roadsides and had been badly invaded by 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> with coverage of more than 80% (visually estimated). In August 2016, three mature and healthy 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were selected in each region, and the whole plant was dug up with a shovel and then brought back to the laboratory together with its rhizosphere soils. The roots were used to isolate endophytic bacteria within 3 days after collection.
