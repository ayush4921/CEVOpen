<p>The reNFB of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> selected from above were inoculated into test tubes containing five ml yeast-mannitol (YM) liquid culture medium and cultured for 24 h under the conditions of 28 °C and 180 r/min. Then, one ml of bacterial suspension was taken and centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 rpm to obtain the bacterial precipitate. Total genomic DNA was extracted directly from the bacterial precipitate of each isolate using an AxyPrep Bacterial Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit. The primers 27F (5′-CGA AGT AGT TTG ATC CTG GCT-3′) and 1523R (5′-AGG AGG TGA TCC AGC CGC A-3′) were used to amplify approximately 1,500 bp of 16S rRNA (

 <sub>2</sub>O. The amplification was run in a Veriti® 96 Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) (3 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 54 °C, and 100 s at 72 °C, and 7 min at 72 °C). PCR products were tested by 1% gel electrophoresis and then sent to the Beijing Genomics Institute for bidirectional sequencing.
