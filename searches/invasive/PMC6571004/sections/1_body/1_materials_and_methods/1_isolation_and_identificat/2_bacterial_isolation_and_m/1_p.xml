<p>We cut 10 randomly selected fine-root fragments from each harvested 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individual, rinsed them with tap water in empty petri plates and surface sterilized them as follows: fine roots were submerged in 95% ethanol for 10 s and 5% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min and were rinsed with sterile water three to five times, and then the surface water of the roots was dried with sterile filter paper. Roots were printed on nutrient agar culture medium (1,000 ml distilled water containing beef extract one g, peptone five g, yeast extract two g, NaCl five g, and agar 15 g, pH 6.8–7.0) to confirm that the surface sterilization was successful. Then, the disinfected fine roots were cut into fragments of approximately 0.5 cm for detection of endophytic bacteria. In total, 150 root fragments were subjected to testing. The thoroughly surface-sterilized root fragments were placed in separate centrifuge tubes containing 150 μl of sterile water, crushed with a sterilized pipette tip, and streaked with inoculation tools onto modified yeast-mannitol agar (YMA) culture medium (1,000 ml distilled water containing D-mannitol 10.00 g, yeast extract 3.00 g, MgSO

 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in this experiment. After 3–5 days of culture, a single colony with good growth and without Congo red absorption was selected for purification.
