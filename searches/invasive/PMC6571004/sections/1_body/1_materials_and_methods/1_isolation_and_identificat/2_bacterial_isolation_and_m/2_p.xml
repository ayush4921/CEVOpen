<p>Numerous studies have shown that bacteria that can grow normally in medium lacking nitrogen have the potential to fix nitrogen (

In order to screen out the candidate bacteria with nitrogen fixation from the endogenous bacteria obtained by the above steps, the purified isolates were inoculated into nitrogen-free liquid medium (1,000 ml distilled water containing KH
