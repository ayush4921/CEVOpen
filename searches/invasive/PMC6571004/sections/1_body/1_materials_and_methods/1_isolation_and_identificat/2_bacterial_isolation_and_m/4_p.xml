<p>We processed the raw sequence data with SeqMan software (DNAStar 7.1, Madison, WI, USA) to pair the merged bidirectional sequencing DNA, resulting in a single sequence with a length of approximately 1,400 bp. Based on the GenBank database, we carefully conducted sequence homology analysis and sequence correction and then cut out chimeric bases using ClustalX 2.1 (
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>). After that, we grouped the resulting sequences that were approximately 1,300 bp long into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% sequence identity with Mothur 1.35.1 (
