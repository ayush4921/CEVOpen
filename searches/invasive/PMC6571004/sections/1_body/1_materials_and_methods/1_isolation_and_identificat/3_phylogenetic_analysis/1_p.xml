<p>We randomly selected representative isolates from each OTU, and the closest relatives of the representative isolates were searched and downloaded in the GenBank nr/nt database (2018.06) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Dataset S1</xref>). Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the sequences of both representative isolates and reference strains using MrBayes 3.2.5 (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist, 2001</xref>) and raxmlGUI 1.5b1 (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Silvestro &amp; Michalak, 2012</xref>). Bayesian analysis was performed in two million operations with the model GTR+T+G and parameters nst = 6 and rates = gamma, which was calculated by the jModelTest 2.0 (
