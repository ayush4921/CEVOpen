<p>Salkowski’s reaction was used to test IAA accumulation of

Then, five μl of bacterial suspension was inoculated into five ml of liquid King’s B medium (five ml glycerine containing peptone 20.0 g, K

 <sub>4</sub> 1.5 g, and MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>•7H
 <sub>2</sub>O 1.5 g, pH 7.2 ± 0.2) containing L-TRP (0.5 g/ml), which were incubated at 28 °C and 180 r/min for 72 and 144 h, respectively. After that, bacteria cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 rpm, and 500 μl supernatant and 500 μl Salkowski reagent (ferric chloride 12 g, concentrated sulfuric acid 430 ml, and deionized water 570 ml) were mixed and allowed to react for 30 min in the dark prior to the absorbance value being measured at 530 nm in a SpectraMax

 <sup>384</sup> (Molecular Devices Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). King’s B medium that was not inoculated was used as a reference instead of supernatant. The assay was repeated three times for each isolate. After subtracting the reference absorbance values from the sample, the IAA content of each isolate was calculated using the regression curve of the IAA standard (
