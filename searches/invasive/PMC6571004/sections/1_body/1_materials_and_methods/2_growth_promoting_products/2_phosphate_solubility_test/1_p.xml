<p>Phosphate solubility was determined by measuring the diameters of the transparent circle formed by dissolution of phosphate on glucose yeast (GY) medium (1,000 ml distilled water containing glucose 10 g, yeast powder two g, and agar 15 g, pH 7.0) containing K

Five microliters of bacterial suspension, which was activated by YM liquid medium, was inoculated into five ml of liquid King’s B culture medium for 48 h at 28 °C and 180 r/min, and then five μl of King’s B culture with bacteria was inoculated onto the GY test plate. Sterile water was used as a control instead of a bacterial suspension. The assay was repeated four times for each isolate. The ratio of the transparent circle diameter to the colony diameter indicated the phosphate solubility index of each isolate, and solubility indices equal to 1 were considered negative (
