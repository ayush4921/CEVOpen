<p>A chrome azurol S (CAS) liquid assay was used to test siderophore production (

 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Schwyn &amp; Neilands (1987)</xref>, was injected into the 100 μl centrifugal supernatant of King’s B bacterial culture (as mentioned in the IAA accumulation test), which reacted for 60 min at room temperature, and then the absorbance value was measured at 630 nm in a SpectraMax

 <sup>384</sup> (Molecular Devices Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Liquid King’s B medium was used as a reference instead of supernatant. The assay was repeated three times for each isolate. Siderophore units were calculated by (Ar − As)/Ar, where Ar and As represent the absorbance values of the reference and sample, respectively, and percentages of siderophore units less than 10% were considered negative (
