<p>Exotic plants are able to change soil nitrogen cycling in an invaded range (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Rout &amp; Callaway, 2009</xref>), and the increase in available soil nitrogen can improve the competitiveness of invasive plants (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2008</xref>). These facts undoubtedly imply that the abundance and diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria may be important factors for plant invasion (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez-Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp; Freitas, 2007</xref>). Until now, many efforts have focused on nitrogen-fixing bacteria of invasive legumes (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Lafay &amp; Burdon, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Parker, Malek &amp; Parker, 2006</xref>); however, the characterization of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in invasive non-legumes has been limited. In this study, 150 endophytic bacteria were initially isolated from roots of invasive 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> by using modified YMA culture medium, and 131 isolates were preliminary determined as reNFB by continuous culture for seven generations in nitrogen-free culture medium (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Aeron et al., 2015</xref>). The dominant reNFB of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> was 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (61.1%), 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> (9.2%), and 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> (8.4%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> have been widely reported as endogenous NFB of nonlegumes (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Santi, Bogusz &amp; Franche, 2013</xref>). For example, nitrogen-fixing 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. have been isolated from stem and leaf tissues of sugarcane (
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Magnani et al., 2010</xref>), barley seeds (
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Zawoznik et al., 2014</xref>), and wild rice roots (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhary et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> accounted for 61.1% of the reNFB of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, suggesting a possible important contribution of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> to 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> competitiveness. 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> are mainly reported as NFB of legumes (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Lafay &amp; Burdon, 2006</xref>), in nonlegumes, for example, 
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Biswas, Ladha &amp; Dazzo (2000)</xref> demonstrated that 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> could infect rice and increase rice yield. The genus 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> was first proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Hiraishi, Shin &amp; Sugiyama (1997)</xref> as a reclassification of a misnamed strain, and until now, its interaction with plants has not been clear. 
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2004)</xref> isolated 
 <italic>Duganella violaceinigra</italic> sp. from a forest soil sample collected from Yunnan Province, Southwest China. In this study, 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> were isolated as reNFB, indicating that soil-dwelling 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> can infect 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and may make an important contribution to 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasiveness. In addition, compared to another study of nonsymbiotic NFB inhabiting rhizosphere soils of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in Yunnan Province (
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> accounted for only 8.2% and 7.0%, it can be concluded that there are differences between reNFB and nonsymbiotic NFB of 
 <italic>A. adenophora.</italic> Therefore, there might be host specialization in the interaction between 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and reNFB. Although plants can dramatically modify their soil environment to shape the soil microbial communities through the rhizosphere effect (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Bremer et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Jones, Nguyen &amp; Finlay, 2009</xref>) and improve themselves growth performance, the selective accumulation of specific reNFB, for example, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, may be an effective strategy for the growth advantage of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>.
