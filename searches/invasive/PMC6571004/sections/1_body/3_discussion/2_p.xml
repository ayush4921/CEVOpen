<p>It was previously reported that the endogenous bacteria of the same plant species revealed regional endemism (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and we also found that there were marked differences in the community composition and diversity of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> reNFB in different regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, the regions in this paper were distributed in a relatively large geographic range, and there were certain differences in environmental background, which might explain the differences in reNFB of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. However, differences in reNFB diversity might be related to plant growth stage. It was reported that the diversity of functional endogenous bacteria was distinct in different stages of plant growth (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Loaces, Ferrando &amp; Scavino, 2011</xref>). The five regions were distributed in three latitudes, where 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> might be in different development stages under certain light and temperature conditions when we sampled in August.
