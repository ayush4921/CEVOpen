<p>Notably, the Shannon diversity index was negatively correlated with the productivity of all growth-promoting products, and all were statistically significant, with the exception of IAA in 144 h (

 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> was similar, we speculated that even though the microbes had functional redundancy (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Miki, Yokokawa &amp; Matsui, 2014</xref>), the infection of functional microbes to host plants still had a certain threshold limit, by which the deficiency of microbial functions for host growth had to be compensated by improving their diversity or vice versa, resulting in a trade-off between quantity and diversity of functional microbes assembled within plants. There is some evidence for this concept in a previous study, where 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Torres-Cort√©s et al. (2018)</xref> suggested that nutrient availability during germination elicited changes in the composition of microbial communities by potentially selecting microbial groups with functional traits linked to copiotrophy. Thus, it represents a compelling field for further investigation of the interaction between reNFB and 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in vivo.
