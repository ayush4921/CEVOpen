<p>Previous studies have shown that plant endogenous bacteria are able to not only fix nitrogen but also accumulate IAA (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan, Bagyaraj &amp; Sharma, 2013</xref>), dissolve phosphate (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Kuklinsky-Sobral et al., 2004</xref>) and produce siderophores (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Loaces, Ferrando &amp; Scavino, 2011</xref>). We measured 131 isolates of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> reNFB and found that all isolates accumulated IAA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3B</xref>), 67 isolates solubilized phosphorous (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and 108 isolates produced siderophores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Among the three dominant genera, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> showed the highest growth-promoting product productivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3E</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3H</xref>). Previously, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> were reported as excellent producers of various crop growth regulators that stimulate plant growth (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Pastor et al., 2014</xref>) and inhibit pathogen infection (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Khare &amp; Arora, 2010</xref>). However, 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan, Bagyaraj &amp; Sharma (2013)</xref> showed that the production capacity of growth-promoting products of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. isolated from sugarcane was higher than that of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. It is suggested that different 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains from different hosts vary in IAA-accumulation capacity. Moreover, all of these growth-promoting products were measured in vitro in this study and may be different in vivo because the specific functions of reNFB in living plants are also influenced by plant physiological and environmental pressures (
