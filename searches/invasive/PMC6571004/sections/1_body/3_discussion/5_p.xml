<p>In the inoculation experiment, we verified the positive effect of reNFB on the seedlings of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). The isolate WS05 (
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> sp.) revealed the best growth-promoting effect, while its IAA accumulation, phosphorus solubilization, and siderophore production was relatively low among the six inoculated isolates. The results indicated that the growth-promoting products of reNFB were not the crucial factors influencing seedling growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in the conditions of this experiment. However, the diversified NFB may differ from one another in terms of the other functions they perform within an ecosystem, and the changes in habitat conditions may also lead to changes in the main mechanism of microbial effects. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Moseman et al. (2009)</xref> indicated that NFB showed various physiological and ecological functions in three wetland invasion systems. There is no doubt that the invasive process of plants will encounter many unknown environments. At this time, the multifunctional characteristics of reNFB are particularly important. Moreover, the positive effect of reNFB on the roots of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings was stronger than that on the shoots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6</xref>). The reason for this finding may be that most endogenous bacteria have tissue specificity (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Lodewyckx et al., 2002</xref>), which means that reNFB likely produce various growth products to function preferentially in the roots.
