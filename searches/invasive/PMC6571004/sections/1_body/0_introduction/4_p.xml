 <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> (Sprengel) R. M. King and H. Robinson is a perennial herb of the Compositae family that is native to Central America but a noxious weed in Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Hawaii. It first invaded Yunnan Province, China, in the 1940s and is now widely distributed in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Tibet provinces in Southwest China and has continuously spread east- and northward at a rate of approximately 20 km/year (

 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> has shown a strong acclimation capacity to a wide range of nitrogen environments (

 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al. (2007)</xref> showed that available soil nutrients (N, P, and K) were greatly increased in soils that were heavily invaded by 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. 
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated that, compared to noninvaded habitats, 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> accumulated more abundant and diverse nitrogen-fixing bacteria inhabiting rhizosphere soils in heavily invaded areas, suggesting a potential role of the nitrogen cycle, which is driven by bacteria, in the invasiveness of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. However, no study has been conducted on the investigation of endophytic diazotrophs of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, as well as their effects on promoting the growth performance of seedlings.
