<p>Recent studies have indicated that the newly established relationship between hosts and local microbes have greatly impacted the competitiveness of invasive plants (
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Putten, Klironomos &amp; Wardle, 2007</xref>). For example, it has been suggested that invasive plants maintain long-term dominance by accumulating local pathogens (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Eppinga et al., 2006</xref>) or beneficial microbes (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Putten et al., 2013</xref>). Most invasive plants can form mutualistic relationships with local microbes, of which symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) play an extremely important role in gaining additional nutritional resources for invasive plants that are competing with native plants (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez-Echeverría &amp; Traveset, 2015</xref>). Currently, the associations between root endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (reNFB) and invasive legumes are widely studied. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Lafay &amp; Burdon (2006)</xref> showed that the invasive leguminous plant 
 <italic>Cytisus scoparius</italic> in Australia was able to form nodules with 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic>. 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Parker, Malek &amp; Parker (2006)</xref> further demonstrated that the biomass of 
 <italic>C. scoparius</italic> when inoculated with 
 <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> was twice that of a noninoculated plant. 
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2009)</xref> also demonstrated that 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic>, a leguminous plant from North America, could invade China’s barren regions by forming nodules with bacteria in local soils.
