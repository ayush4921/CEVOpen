<p>Ongoing globalization and climate warming have enhanced the migration of species (

 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Moles, Gruber &amp; Bonser, 2008</xref>). Invasive plants that thrive in new environments have been reported to inhibit local plants from competing for more living resources through allelopathy (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bais et al., 2003</xref>) and other mechanisms (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Hierro, Maron &amp; Callaway, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the invaded ecosystems tend to have higher net primary production compared to native ecosystems (
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">Wilsey &amp; Wayne Polley, 2006</xref>), indicating that the growth requirements of invasive plants have a high environmental capacity. Invasive plants promote the development of their own communities through highly efficient nutrient cycling (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenfeld, 2003</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al. (2008)</xref> reviewed that the pools of carbon and nitrogen in the invaded systems were significantly increased. Thus, nutrient improvement can be proposed as an important contributor to the success of invaders over native flora. Previously, increased nitrogen input was well documented to facilitate the invasion of exotic species in new habitats (
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Siemann &amp; Rogers, 2003</xref>) and enhance the dominance of invasive plants (
