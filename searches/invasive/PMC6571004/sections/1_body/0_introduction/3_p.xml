<p>However, in addition to the root nodules of legumes, a variety of nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been isolated in the roots, stems, and leaves of nonlegumes, which are named endophytic diazotrophs (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Olivares et al., 1996</xref>). These endophytic diazotrophs have been reported as an important mechanism in facilitating the invasion of the exotic plant 
 <italic>Sorghum halepense</italic> in grasslands where nitrogen sources are extremely scarce (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Rout &amp; Chrzanowski, 2009</xref>). In addition to nitrogen fixation, endophytic diazotrophs have also been shown to promote plant growth with their secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2016</xref>), including indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA) accumulation, phosphorus solubilization, and siderophore production (

 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, studies on the relationship between endophytic diazotrophs and invasive plants are important for better understanding the mechanisms underlying the colonization and dominance of invasive plants in nonnative habitats. Unfortunately, thus far, little is known about endophytic diazotroph communities of invasive nonlegumes in a relatively large introduced geographic range or their effects on promoting the growth of invasive plant seedlings.
