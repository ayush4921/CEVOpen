<p>In this study, we first isolated endophytic diazotrophs of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> roots, named potential reNFB, in a large geographic range and attempted to explore the community composition and phylogeny of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> reNFB from different regions. Second, we detected the growth-promoting products of all obtained reNFB, including IAA accumulation, phosphorus solubilization, and siderophore production, and analyzed the differences in the ability of dominant reNFB to produce growth-promoting products. Finally, we carried out an inoculation experiment with the focal isolates to verify the growth-promoting effects of reNFB on the seedlings of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>.
