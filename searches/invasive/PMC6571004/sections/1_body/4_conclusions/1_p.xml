<p>In conclusion, there were a variety of endophytic NFB inhabiting the roots of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, and the dominant genera ranked by number were 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Duganella</italic>. The number of reNFB was similar across different geographical regions, but the composition and diversity were markedly different. In addition to nitrogen fixation, the reNFB also distinctly accumulated IAA, dissolved phosphate and produced siderophores. Furthermore, plants with high reNFB diversity generally had low growth-promoting product productivity. The inoculation experiment verified that reNFB had a significant positive effect on the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings, particularly on root growth. It is necessary to carry out further studies on the response of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> to reNFB under various environmental conditions.
