<p>Of the 131 reNFB isolated in this experiment, 66 isolates were able to simultaneously accumulate IAA, dissolve phosphate and produce siderophores, including 57 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp., three 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> sp., one 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> sp., one 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> sp., one 
 <italic>Nocardioides</italic> sp., one 
 <italic>Variovorax</italic> sp., one 
 <italic>Pseudarthrobacter</italic> sp., and one 
 <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. All 131 reNFB could accumulate IAA, and the content of IAA in most isolates gradually increased with increasing incubation time. For example, the number of isolates with a yield of IAA greater than 10 Î¼g/ml increased from 19 isolates with an incubation time of 72 h to 29 isolates with an incubation time of 144 h (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3B</xref>). A total of 67 isolates of reNFB were able to dissolve phosphate, accounting for 51.15% of the total isolates, mainly distributed in XM, CY, and YL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3C</xref>). There were 108 isolates that could produce siderophores (siderophore units greater than 10%), but only 10 isolates in XS could produce siderophores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In addition, the ability of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> to dissolve phosphate and to produce siderophores was relatively high among the three dominant genera (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3H</xref>), while the accumulation of IAA in the genus 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> was the lowest among the three dominant genera (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3F</xref>). Interestingly, the calculated reNFB Shannon diversity index of each 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individual was negatively correlated with the capacity of reNFB to produce growth-promoting products, and all were statistically significant, with the exception of IAA at 144 h (
