<p>Root endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria differed in their effects on the growth performance of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). The average shoot length of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings treated with 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> sp. (OTU02; XS01) was lower than that of the control group, all others revealed positive effects on various plant growth metrics. The WS05 isolate (
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> sp.) was the best growth-promoting isolate of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> among these six reNFB, which greatly increased the length of shoots (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and roots (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and had an evident positive effect on shoot biomass (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>wet</sub> &lt; 0.001; 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>dry</sub> &lt; 0.001) and root biomass (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>wet</sub> = 0.004; 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>dry</sub> = 0.005). Compared to the shoots, the six selected isolates showed a stronger positive effect on the roots of seedlings, and the wet- and dry-biomass RI of roots were significantly higher than that of shoots (
