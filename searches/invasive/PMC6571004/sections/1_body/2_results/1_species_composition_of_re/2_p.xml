<p>At the genus level, there were clear differences in the composition of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> reNFB among the study regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>). WS contained the most abundant isolates (11 genera), while YL had the least abundant isolates (three genera).With the exception of XS, in which 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> (39.1%) was the most abundant reNFB, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was the most dominant reNFB in the other four regions, accounting for 65.5% in XM, 83.3% in CY, 44.4% in WS, and 89.3% in YL. The Shannon diversity index calculated at 97% of the identity level showed that the diversity of XS and WS were significantly higher than that of CY, XM, and YL (
