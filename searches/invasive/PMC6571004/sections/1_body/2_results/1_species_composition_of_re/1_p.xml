<p>In total, 150 isolates were obtained from the roots of 15 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individuals across the five regions mentioned above by using YMA selective medium, but only 131 isolates were able to grow continuously for seven culture generations in nitrogen-free medium, including 29 isolates from XM, 24 from CY, 23 from XS, 27 from WS, and 28 from YL. In the phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), these isolates were placed into three phyla at 97% sequence identity and included Proteobacteria (92.4%), Actinobacteria (4.6%), and Firmicutes (3.1%). All isolates in Proteobacteria were further divided into three subgroups, including alpha (18.2%), beta (14.1%), and gamma (67.8%). At the genus level, the dominant isolates were 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (80 isolates, 61.1%), followed by 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> (12 isolates, 9.2%) and 
 <italic>Duganella</italic> (11 isolates, 8.4%). Other genera had an occurrence frequency of less than 3.0%.
