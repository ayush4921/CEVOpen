 <caption> Effects of focal reNFB on the growth performance of A. adenophora seedlings, including the shoot lengths (A), root lengths (B), shoot wet-biomass (C), root wet-biomass (D), shoot dry-biomass (E), root dry-biomass (F). 1 represents Pseudomonas sp. (OTU01; WS29); 2 represents Pseudomonas sp. (OUT 01; WS14); 3 represents Duganella sp. (OTU02; XS01); 4 represents Rhizobium sp. (OTU03; XM06); 5 represents Rhizobium sp. (OUT11; XM04); 6 represents Rhizobium sp. (OTU17; WS05); and Con. represents sterile water control. Log transformations were applied to wet and dry biomass (Câ€“F). Significant difference is the comparison between treatment and control by using Independent-Samples t-test and marked as following (*&lt;0.050, **&lt;0.010, ***&lt;0.001). Error bars depict the standard error for the average growth performances of A. adenophora. </caption>
