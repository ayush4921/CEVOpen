 <caption> Response indices (RI) of shoot and root lengths of wet and dry biomass of A. adenophora seedlings. Significant difference is the comparison between shoot and root by using nonparametric tests ( P length = 0.521, P wet-biomass = 0.037, P dry-biomass = 0.037) and mark as following (n.s. &gt;0.05, *&lt;0.05). The long horizontal lines represent mean value. Error bars depict the standard deviation for the average RI of A. adenophora shoot and root, respectively. </caption>
