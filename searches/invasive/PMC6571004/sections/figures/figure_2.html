 <caption> The species composition at the genus level (A) and the Shannon diversity index at the 97% identity level (B) of A. adenophora reNFB from different study regions. Error bars depict the standard error. Black dots show the values of the Shannon diversity index. One-way ANOVA was used to compare Shannon diversity indices across different study regions ( F = 8.628, P = 0.003), and the homogeneity test of variance was passed ( P = 0.412), and Duncanâ€™s multiple range test was used for pairwise comparison. Different lowercase letters indicate that the difference was significant, and identical lowercase letters indicate nonsignificant differences. </caption>
