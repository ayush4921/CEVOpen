 <caption> IAA accumulation (A, B), phosphorus solubility index (C) and siderophore units (D) of the total reNFB from each study region. Differences in IAA accumulation (E, F), soluble phosphorus index (G) and siderophore units (H) among the three dominant genera. The colorful points represent the values of growth-promoting products of each isolate. The horizontal lines in (A–D) indicate the median number of each study region. The horizontal lines and whiskers in (E–H) represent the mean value and min to max values, respectively. A nonparametric test was used to compare the production capacity of growth-promoting products between sampling areas. Log-transformations were applied to IAA accumulation and the phosphorus solubility index in (E–G), while square-root transformations were applied to siderophore units in (H). Bars with different lowercase letters in each figure are significantly different at P &lt; 0.05. </caption>
