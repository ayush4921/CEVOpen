 <caption> Linear regression analysis between the Shannon diversity index of each A. adenophora and their reNFB growth-promoting product productivity. Log transformations were applied to IAA accumulation and the phosphorus solubility index in (A–C). Square-root transformations were applied to siderophore units in (D). The equation for the regression of 72 h IAA accumulation and Shannon diversity index is Y = −0.1367* X + 0.6502 (A). The equation for the regression of 144 h IAA accumulation and Shannon diversity index is Y = −0.1085* X + 0.8565 (B). The equation for the regression of phosphorus solubility index and Shannon diversity index is Y = −0.127* X + 0.1979 (C). The equation for the regression of siderophores units and Shannon diversity index is Y = −0.08961* X + 0.5673 (D). </caption>
