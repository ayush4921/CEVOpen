 <caption> Phylogenetic tree of representative potential reNFB OTU of A. adenophora and their best blast matches showing their phylogenetic affinities. The bootstrap values and posterior probability are indicated at the branch node, shown as MrBayes/maximum likelihood. Each OTU and its occurrence time in XM (solid circle), CY (open circle), XS (solid square), WS (open square), and YL (solid triangle) regions is indicated in parentheses, as well as the GenBank accession numbers of reference sequences. The scale bar represents 6% estimated sequence divergence. Flavobacterium johnsoniae (NR_074455.1) was used as the out-group. </caption>
