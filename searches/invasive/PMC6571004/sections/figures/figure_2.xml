  <title>The species composition at the genus level (A) and the Shannon diversity index at the 97% identity level (B) of 
   <italic>A. adenophora</italic> reNFB from different study regions.
  </title>
  <p>Error bars depict the standard error. Black dots show the values of the Shannon diversity index. One-way ANOVA was used to compare Shannon diversity indices across different study regions (
   <italic>F</italic> = 8.628, 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.003), and the homogeneity test of variance was passed (
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.412), and Duncanâ€™s multiple range test was used for pairwise comparison. Different lowercase letters indicate that the difference was significant, and identical lowercase letters indicate nonsignificant differences.
