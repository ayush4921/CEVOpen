<p>In total, 53 alien plant species were targeted by research. The focus of 17 of the relevant studies (35%) lies on providing a list of alien plant species and their effects on forest ecosystems, while 31 studies (65%) analyze or test the impact of specific selected species. Only 28% (n=17) of the studies do not describe at least one impact mechanism of alien plant species on regeneration (
