<p>Almost no information on the actual effectiveness of management measures is provided in the studies, and we therefore conclude that science and practical forest management need to be linked better and more closely. Long-term experiments developed together with forest managers and owners may help to improve the translation of research results into practice. The review results also show that we lack species-specific experiment designs to investigate the effects of impact mechanisms or management measures in detail.</p>
