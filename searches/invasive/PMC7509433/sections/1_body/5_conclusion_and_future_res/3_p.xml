<p>Knowledge on the possible impacts of alien species is crucial for decision-making processes. For example, forest managers may ask whether natural regeneration is less likely to succeed without further investments into eradication measures when alien plants such as 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> occur on their managed sites. Invasive plants species are increasingly representing a problem in terms of management of the regeneration of native tree species. In the context of climate change and the expected increase in disturbances in forest canopies, studies on demographic traits and gap dynamics will become more important in order to identify the early stages of biological invasions by species following the “sit and wait” strategy. Oftentimes, the spread of IAS is promoted by the destruction of natural biotopes resulting in plant-sociological disadvantages for the regeneration of native trees.
