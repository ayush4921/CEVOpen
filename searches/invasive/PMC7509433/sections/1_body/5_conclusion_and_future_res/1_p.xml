<p>Alien plant invasions impact forest regeneration directly and indirectly. The 48 studies included in our synthesis discuss a total of 53 invasive alien plant species existing in European temperate forests. We identified five impact mechanisms through which alien plant species affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition, chemical impacts, physical impacts, structural impacts, and indirect impacts through interaction with other species. Among these impact mechanisms, competition is by far the best-analyzed. Our synthesis shows that physical and chemical impacts as well as changes in soil properties can have significant effects on native species composition and thus on natural regeneration. Further species-specific studies would be very useful in this context to attain a better understanding of ecosystem processes, but also of the influence of forest management purposes. In general, more research is needed to achieve a better understanding of the effects of forest management measures.</p>
