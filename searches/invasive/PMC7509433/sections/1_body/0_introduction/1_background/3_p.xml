<p>Besides human-mediated disturbances, natural disturbances are also increasing due to climate change. Events such as storms, flooding and forest fires provide alien plants with opportunities to invade temperate forests (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Jarčuška et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Lapin et al., 2019</xref>). These changes in the species composition of understory may impact the competition between IAS and native species and affect site conditions. We argue that alien plant species may be influencing the successful regeneration of tree seedlings.
