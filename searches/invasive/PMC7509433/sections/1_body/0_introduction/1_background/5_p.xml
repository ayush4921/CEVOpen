<p>Besides the above mentioned factors, however, different phases of the regeneration process are reportedly also affected by above-ground and below-ground competition between tree seedlings and plant species of the understorey herbaceous vegetation cover (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">De Lombaerde et al. (2019)</xref> argue that manipulation of the overstorey cover (also tree layer or canopy cover) to reduce its abundance and shade-casting ability can increase tree seedling competitiveness. However, stress factors during the regeneration phase of seedling establishment are particularly impactful in regard to the renewing of forest ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Terwei et al., 2013</xref>). In managed forests, the regeneration is following a series of anthropogenic disturbances due to silvicultural measures, such as harvesting and soil preparation, in addition to the above mentioned biotic and abiotic factors. During plantation establishment or natural forest regeneration, forest ecosystems may be impacted especially heavily by alien plant invasions due to the increase in light and nutrient availability that intensifies competition for limited sources. Furthermore, understanding the impact mechanisms of alien plant species during the critical stage of forest regeneration has important implications for invasive species management and forest management in general.
