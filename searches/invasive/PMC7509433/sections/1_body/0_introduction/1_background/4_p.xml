<p>Forest managers distinguish between two types of regeneration (also referred to as rejuvenation), meaning the process by which forests are renewed: natural and artificial regeneration. Natural regeneration is based on recruitment deriving from seeds (seedlings) without human assistance, while artificial regeneration implies the planting of seedlings or the sowing of seeds. The regeneration process of forest trees occurs in different phases: a seedling phase, a juvenile intensive height growth phase and a maturity phase (

The success of both natural and artificial regeneration in European temperate forests is affected by a large number of biotic and abiotic factors. Gap dynamics, light intensity, soil humidity, climate-induced disturbance regimes as well as soil properties and the composition of the regeneration layer all modulate regeneration (
