<p>A key component of biological invasions are human activities that modulate the introduction and spread of alien species, and a large number of human activities supporting the spread of alien plant species have been identified (

Furthermore, the construction of forest roads can promote the spread of alien plant seeds and specimens through the movement of contaminated soil and construction material (
