<p>Invasive alien or non-native plant species (hereinafter: IAS 
 <italic>sensu</italic>
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Pyšek et al., 2004</xref>) are one of the major threats to global and local biodiversity (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">IUCN Council, 2000</xref>). In addition, biological invasions have negative socio-economic and human health impacts (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Howe and Smallwood, 1982</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Villamagna and Murphy, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Shackleton et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Potgieter et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2019</xref>). The rapid spread of few IAS in forests was mediated by the positive socio-economic effects of potentially invasive plant species in urban and rural areas (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Kowarik, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Vaz et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Vaz et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Castro-Díez et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, several policies, risk assessments and legislations are now in place to regulate the spread of IAS in forest ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Heywood and Brunel, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Brundu and Richardson, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Pötzelsberger et al., 2020</xref>). The threats caused by IAS in forest ecosystems include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Knapp and Canham, 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Ashton et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Vilà et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Medvecká et al., 2018</xref>). The establishment and spread of alien plants in temperate forest ecosystems have not been widely considered until recently (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Essl et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>), and European temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in particular were previously considered less affected than other landcover types (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Chytrý et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). However, an increasing number of studies now indicate that temperate forests as well as other forest biomes might not be as resilient as previously assumed (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">McEwan et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Dreiss and Volin, 2013</xref>). In boreal forests, for instance, an ongoing invasion of alien plants was detected, despite the relatively low levels of anthropogenic disturbance (
