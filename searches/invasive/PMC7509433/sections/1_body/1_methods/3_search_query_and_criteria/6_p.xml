<p>In the next step, every duplicated publication was removed, which left 250 publications to be examined more closely. The final selection step was to read the abstracts of these 250 papers to obtain an overview of their contents. Completion of this process left a final number of 134 publications. In addition, we contacted IAS researchers known to members of our research group and asked them to provide lists of their publications during the past years (

In the end, we had 143 publications to read in full in order to determine whether they provided any answers to our research questions. This reading left us with 74 relevant papers, 26 of which were important in terms of background information but did not deal with our specific research questions. We thus ended up with a grand total of 48 papers relevant for answering our meta-studyâ€™s research questions.
