<p>To address our research questions, we decided to take a closer look at Central Europe, establishing a clear structure by using the terrestrial ecoregions classification according to the WWF (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">WWF, 2020</xref>). The terrestrial ecoregions include 14 major habitat types ranging from the wettest of forest types to the driest and hottest desert conditions. Each of these 14 major habitat types has a wide range of ecoregion categories, which are in turn divided into subtypes. For Europe, this subtype classification is equivalent to the Digital Map of European Ecological Regions (hereinafter DMEER) (

 </xref>. The major habitat for Central Europe are the “temperate broadleaf and mixed forests” with their two habitat subtypes “palearctic temperate coniferous forests” and “palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forests”. The typical characteristic of the “temperate broadleaf and mixed forests” is a forest structure consisting of four layers: The main layer is a canopy with dominant mature species, which is accompanied by a second layer of trees, a shrub layer, and a grass and herb layer. Within the habitat subtype “palearctic temperate coniferous forests”, we reviewed studies pertaining to countries belonging to the subdivision “Alps conifer and mixed forests”. Within the habitat subtype “palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forests”, we reviewed studies pertaining to countries belonging to the subdivisions “Dinaric Mountains mixed forests”, “Pannonian mixed forests”, “Central European mixed forests”, and “Western European broadleaf forests”.
