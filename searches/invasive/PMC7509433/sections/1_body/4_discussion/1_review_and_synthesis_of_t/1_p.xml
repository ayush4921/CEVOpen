<p>This synthesis is based exclusively on the results of 48 empirical studies conducted in European temperate forests, and its general applicability should therefore be tested in future research. Furthermore, forest management was not included in the search queries, and the synthesis of IAS management approaches and measures consist mostly of expert recommendations that have not been tested in field trials and experiments. Nevertheless, we offer a classification reflecting the approaches taken in IAS management over the past three decades. More detailed information may be included in technical reports in various local languages that were not analyzed within this meta-study.</p>
