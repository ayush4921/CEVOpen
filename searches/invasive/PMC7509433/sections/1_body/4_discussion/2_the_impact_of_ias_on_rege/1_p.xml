<p>Temperate forests are not resistant to invasion by alien plant species, which can have a negative influence on the forest regeneration of native tree species. The systematic review of 48 studies determined 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration. The effect however was not reported evenly for all forest types in Central Europe (

 </xref>). Riparian forests for instance accounted for the largest portion of studies within our review (25% of all studies) as well as for the highest numbers of IAS. This is in line with 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Medveck치 et al. (2018)</xref> who also report the highest percentage of non-native species in riparian forests and highlight that IAS are well-adapted to riparian forests. Their success may be reasoned by occurrence of frequent disturbances and nutrient enrichment due to periodic flooding events in riparian forests (e.g.
