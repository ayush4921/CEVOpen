<p>Less concrete measures for individual IAS were also found in the studied literature. 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ammer et al. (2011)</xref> launched one of the few experiments to observe how 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> affects the natural rejuvenation of birch and the artificial regeration of spruce and fir. They were able to prove statistically that 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> does not limit the growth of rejuvenation; only isolated losses of fir trees could be determined. This is due to the different growth rhythms of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and the examined tree species. The height growth of the native trees begins much earlier than that of the annual 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, which seems to decouple the competition for resources. The study did not investigate whether the sprouting of trees is affected by 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (
