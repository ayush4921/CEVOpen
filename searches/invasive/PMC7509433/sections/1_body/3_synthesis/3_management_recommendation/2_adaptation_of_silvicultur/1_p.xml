<p>Recommendations concerning the adaptation of silvicultural measures include preventive actions such as the recommendation to plant more native tree species. Furthermore, continuous tree cover and longer rotation periods are recommended where appropriate to promote shadier conditions. The slight thinning of forest areas should be avoided to reduce the risk of management disturbances that may function as pathways for the introduction of alien plant species into the forest. Finally, alternative cutting regimes to simple clearcutting, such as selection or shelterwood systems applied in close-to-nature silviculture, should be preferred (
