<p>Physical impact on regeneration refers to changes to the physical biotope characteristics of the native environment, nutrient and/or water cycles, disturbance regimes, or natural succession. Changes in soil humidity due to invasion by alien plants are among the main effects in this category. This impact is described, for example, for the alien shrubs 
 <italic>Prunus laurocerasus</italic> (

 <italic>Prunus serotina</italic> (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Terwei et al., 2013</xref>). The physical impact observed of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> and 
 <italic>Ailanthus altissima</italic> on co-occuring tree species in temperate forests is linked to the demographic process through which individuals decrease in size and delay mortality (
