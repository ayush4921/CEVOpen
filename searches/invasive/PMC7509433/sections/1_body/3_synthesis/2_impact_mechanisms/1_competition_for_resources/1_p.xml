<p>Competition—defined as the process of alien plants competing with native tree species for resources—is the most commonly reported impact mechanism of alien plant species on the regeneration of tree species. According to the literature analysis, competition for light has the greatest impact on tree seedling establishment (

 <italic>Conzya canadensis</italic>, was in particular observed in nutrient-rich forests and frequently disturbed sites, such as the riparian mixed oak–elm–ash hardwood forests along great rivers (Fraxino-Ulmetum and Ulmeto-Quercetum) (
