<p>Hybridization of alien plant species with native tree species as well as the impact mechanisms of disease transmission from alien plant species to native tree species and parasitism of native tree species by alien taxa, which can cause direct or indirect deleterious effects on native tree species, are not relevant for the regeneration of tree species. These impact mechanisms were not described in the 48 analyzed papers.</p>
