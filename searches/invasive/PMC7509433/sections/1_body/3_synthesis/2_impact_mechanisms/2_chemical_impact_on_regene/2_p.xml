<p>Few among the examined studies deal with the release of allelochemicals, which impact the regeneration of neighboring tree seedlings directly (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Gaggini et al. (2018)</xref> found that the alien species 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> changes the soil fungal and bacterial communities in conifer and mixed forests by releasing naphthoquinones. Another aspect of chemical impacts is the fact that the chemical composition of plant litter from alien plants such as 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> can cause high levels of nitrogen in the upper soil horizons, thereby exerting an effect on regeneration (
