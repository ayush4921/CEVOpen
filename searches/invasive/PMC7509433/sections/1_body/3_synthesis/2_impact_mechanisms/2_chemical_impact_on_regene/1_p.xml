<p>Chemical impact on regeneration refers to changes caused by the alien plant to the chemical biotope characteristics of the native environment, nutrient and/or water cycles, disturbance regimes or natural succession. The indirect chemical impact of legume plant species, which have the ability to fix nitrogen from the air, leads to structural ecosystem changes and the creation of new plant communities and therefore negatively affects the forest regeneration.</p>
