<p>This mechanism refers to alien plants interacting with other native or alien taxa (e.g. through any mechanism including pollination, seed dispersal, apparent competition and mesopredator release). Such indirect impacts have been found e.g. for 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> in regard to the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis with a negative impact on the regeneration of 
 <italic>Acer pseudoplatanus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Ruckli et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, microarthropod species richness can be affected by 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> invasion in terms of changes to the nutrient cycle, which may indirectly impact regeneration (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Rusterholz et al., 2014</xref>). Apparent indirect competition however was observed for 
 <italic>Amorpha fructicosa</italic> in poplar and willow habitat and for 
 <italic>Ailanthus altissima</italic> and 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> in conifer and mixed forests (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Radtke et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">RadovanoviÄ‡ et al., 2017</xref>). However, detailed studies analyzing the complexity of the indirect impact mechanisms of IAS in ecological network of European forest ecosystems are rare.
