<p>This result is in harmony with almost all of the described EOs derived from the plant kingdom [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The EOs derived from plants were characterized by the abundance of compounds structurally based on isoprene units, especially the terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Monoterpenes were characterized as the major compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f002">Figure 2</xref>), representing 45.05%, including oxygenated monoterpenes (43.27%) and monoterpenes hydrocarbons (1.77%). Fifteen monoterpenes in oxygenated forms were found to be the main class of compounds among all the identified constituents with an abundance of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate (25.71%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f003">Figure 3</xref>), terpinene-4-ol (4.77%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f003">Figure 3</xref>), and dihydromyrcenol (2.90%). However, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-
 <italic>P</italic>-2-menthen-1-ol was represented as the minor compound from all the identified oxygenated compounds. On the other side, three monoterpene hydrocarbons were identified representing 1.77% of the whole mass including m-cymene (0.97%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (0.55%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinolene (0.25%). The 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Chrysanthenyl acetate, a major monoterpene in our study, was already reported as the main compound in EOs of numerous plant species belonging to different families such as
