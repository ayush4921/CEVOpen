For islands, we additionally used the distance to the nearest continental landmass and the distance to the nearest landmass (including islands). As physical environment variables, we used topographic heterogeneity, average annual temperature and humidity (measured by the aridity index that is calculated as annual precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration, and was taken from the Global Aridity and PET database,

For island regions, we further used the year of first pre-historic settlement and the year of first modern colonization (for yet uninhabited islands we used 2100 as replacement value). As data screening indicated a potentially pronounced curvi-linear relationship between the response variables and average annual temperature, this predictor entered all models with a linear and quadratic term; for all other predictors only linear terms were used.
