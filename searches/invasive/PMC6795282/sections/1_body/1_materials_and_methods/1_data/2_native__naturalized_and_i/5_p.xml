<p>To standardize scientific names, each naturalized and invasive plant inventory was compared to The Plant List (TPL 2014, version 1.1; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theplantlist.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.theplantlist.org/</ext-link>; see

 </xref> for further details), the most comprehensive working list of all plant species (
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Kalwij 2012</xref>). This taxonomic standardization was done with the help of the R package 
 <italic>Taxonstand</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Cayuela and Oksanen 2014</xref>). For each species, we kept the name accepted by The Plant List. Species that were not found in The Plant List, also not after accounting for spelling differences, were kept in the database using the names as used in the source data. In total, the database includes 13 168 species of which 13 033 are recognized by The Plant List (12 498 as accepted and 535 as unresolved names). The remaining 135 species could not be identified as they do not occur in The Plant List, and among those 11 are ornamental cultivars of unknown origins.
