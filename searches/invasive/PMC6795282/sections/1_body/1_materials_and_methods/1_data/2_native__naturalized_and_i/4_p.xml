<p>We aimed at including the most comprehensive and most recent regional inventories. Indeed, &gt;95 % of the data sources are from the last two decades. Moreover, since some of the original source lists included alien species that are cultivated only or have non-persistent populations in the wild, we excluded those species whenever such information was provided, or contacted experts of the regional floras to filter out species of doubtful naturalization status. Furthermore, for European countries that differentiated between archaeophytes (alien species that arrived until the year 1492) and neophytes (species that arrived after the year 1492), we kept only the latter, because the alien status of some species classified as archaeophytes is disputed; moreover, this classification is not available for most other regions of the world, which would prevent us from achieving a standardized assessment of naturalized and invasive alien species numbers.</p>
