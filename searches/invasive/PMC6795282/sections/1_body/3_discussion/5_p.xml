<p>We identified geographic isolation of islands as a key factor for RRN and RRI alike—corroborating a recent finding for naturalized species numbers on (sub)tropical islands for several taxonomic groups (

 </xref>). Thus, RRN and RRI are highest in regions that are far away from major world economies. Island isolation—as measured by increasing distance from the nearest continent—promotes plant invasions, most likely because colonization by natural means is more difficult for distant islands (
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt and Kreft 2013</xref>); this, in turn, leads to fewer native species and more unoccupied niches (

 </xref>). Alarmingly, remote islands are not only most affected by plant invasions, they also harbour particularly high numbers of endemic species (
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>) that are put at risk from invasive plants. High rates of plant naturalization on islands have prevailed since the 19th century, and there are no signs of a slow-down in naturalized plant accumulation rates (
