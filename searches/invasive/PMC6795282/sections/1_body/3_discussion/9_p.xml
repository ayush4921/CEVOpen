<p>Topographical heterogeneity has a substantial, though divergent influence on RRN on island and mainland regions. The fact that mountainous mainland regions are less affected by plant naturalizations (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>) than their island counterparts (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Kueffer 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>) may indicate that topographically heterogeneous islands offer unoccupied niche space to newcomers that is not, or to a lesser degree, available in mainland regions with their longer evolutionary histories. In addition, mountains on islands often are less isolated from densely populated regions (e.g. at the coasts) than mainland mountains. However, RRI is negatively affected by topographic heterogeneity both on islands and in mainland regions indicating that invasive species currently are less common in mountains than in lowland regions (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Pauchard 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>). As alien species are predominantly introduced into more densely populated lowland areas, from where they spread into mountains (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Alexander 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>), this negative relationship may partly be caused by propagule pressure and historical legacies, i.e. the time needed to spread from lowland areas into mountains, and to become invasive.
