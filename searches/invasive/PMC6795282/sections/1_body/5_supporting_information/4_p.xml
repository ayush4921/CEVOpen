 <bold>Figure S3.</bold> Partitioning of the explained variation in regression models of global alien vascular plant species numbers grouped into biogeographic, physical environment and socio-economic variables. Shown are the ratios of naturalized (A) and invasive (B) plant species per native ones, and the absolute numbers of naturalized (C) and invasive (D) plant species. Biogeographic variables include hemisphere, Old vs. New World and the island-specific variables distance to nearest continental mainland/landmass; physical environment variables include topographic heterogeneity, temperature and humidity; and socio-economic variables include human population density, per-capita GDP, proportion of agricultural land, and human colonization histories on islands (Table S1). Intersections of circles in the diagrams represent the variation jointly explained by two or three classes of variables; negative values may occur due to suppression effects and are not shown. Mainland vs. island region and region area were core predictors included in all predictor subsets fitted for this analysis; these predictors explain variation in the models not shown here.
