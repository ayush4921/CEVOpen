 <caption>
  <p>The global biogeography of alien vascular plant species. Shown are the relative richness of naturalized (RRN) (A) (
   <italic>n</italic> = 761 regions) and (B) of invasive (RRI) (
   <italic>n</italic> = 359 regions) plants, i.e. ratios of naturalized and invasive vascular plant species in relation to native species, respectively. Boxplots show the relative richness of naturalized and invasive plants for island and mainland regions. Differences between island and mainland regions were assessed by Mannâ€“Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> tests, and are highly significant in both cases (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
