 <caption> Odds of high abundance for (a) R. multiflora, (b) B. thunbergii with different land-use histories. Each point indicates the odds that each invasive species will be highly abundant (&gt;10% cover) in a given land-use history ± 95% confidence intervals ( n = 1074 plots for R. multiflora and n = 558 plots for B. thunbergii). Asterisks indicate a significant difference from always forested (i.e. forested continuously since at least 1939) plots (* p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001) and sample sizes are given in parentheses. Plots with R. multiflora or B. thunbergii cover class of 1–2 were categorized as low abundance plots and plots with cover classes of 3–6 were categorized as high abundance plots. Analysis of the always developed and developed to forest land-use categories were not complete for B. thunbergii due to small sample size. </caption>
