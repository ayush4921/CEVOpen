 <caption> Probability of occurrence of R. multiflora versus distance to a road. Individual points represent plot-level observations of R. multifloraâ€™s occurrence (1 = present, 0 = not present,n = 4388 plots). The best fit line was fitted using the generalized linear model of occurrence versus log distance to road and provides the probability of R. multiflora occurrence at varying distances from roadways. </caption>
