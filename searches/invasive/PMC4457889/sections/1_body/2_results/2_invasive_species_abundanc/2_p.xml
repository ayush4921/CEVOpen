<p>Abundance of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> varied by land-use history within PNR, with cover above ten percent (high abundance) in 19% of always forested plots, 47% of agriculture to forest plots, 29% of developed to forest plots, 35% of logged plots, 54% of mined plots, and 11% of developed plots. As predicted, disturbance by humans increased the probability that an invasive species would be highly abundant and the inclusion of land-use history significantly improved model fit (LR Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 28.18, df = 5, p &lt; 0.001). The probability of high abundance of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> was significantly greater in all land-use categories compared to always forested sites, except sites that had experienced development (
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). For example, for a plot that was previously agricultural, the log odds of high 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> abundance increased by 1.50 (Wald Z = 4.473, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds increased by 4.46. For forest that had previously been logged, the log odds increased by 1.44 (Wald Z = 2.297, p = 0.022) and the odds by 4.24. Previously mined plots had the highest probability of having a high abundance of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> with the log odds increasing by 1.99 (Wald Z = 3.540, p = 0.0004) and the odds by 7.37. Proximity to roads did not significantly increase the probability of abundant 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic>, and inclusion of distance to road did not significantly improve model fit (LR Χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.00, df = 1, p = 0.317).
