 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> was widespread throughout the reserve, occurring in 1080 plots (24%) and 258 blocks (50%, 
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Occurrence varied by land-use history within PNR, with 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> occurring in 18% of always forested plots, 74% of agriculture to forest plots, 65% of developed to forest plots, 27% of logged plots, 64% of mined plots, and 35% of developed plots (
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). As predicted, disturbance by humans increased the probability of invasion and the inclusion of land-use history significantly improved model fit (LR Î§
 <sup>2</sup> = 111.4, df = 5, p &lt; 0.001); the probability of occurrence of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> was significantly higher in all land-use categories compared to always forested sites (
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). For example, for a plot that was previously mined the log odds of containing 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> increased by 2.57 (Wald Z = 4.562, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds by 13.16. For forest that had previously been logged, the log odds of containing 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> increased by 1.76 (Wald Z = 3.348, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds by 5.82. Previous agriculture was associated with the highest probability of invasion, with the log odds increasing by 3.03 (Wald Z = 9.214, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds increasing by 20.78.
