 <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> was rarer than 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic>, encountered in 563 plots (13%) and 190 blocks (37%) across the entire reserve (
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Occurrence varied by land-use history within PNR, and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> occurred in 8% of always forested plots, 49% of agriculture to forest plots, 6% of developed to forest plots, 17% of logged plots, 36% of mined plots, and 4% of developed plots (
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). As predicted, disturbance by humans increased the probability of invasion and the inclusion of land-use history significantly improved model fit (LR Î§
 <sup>2</sup> = 56.78, df = 5, p &lt; 0.001); the probability of occurrence of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> was significantly higher in all but two (developed to forest and always developed) land-use categories compared to always forested sites (
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). For example, for a plot that was previously mined the log odds of containing 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> increased by 2.08 (Wald Z = 3.986, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds by 8.08. For forest that had previously been logged, the log odds of containing 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> increased by 1.39 (Wald Z = 2.827, p = 0.0047) and the odds by 4.03. As with 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic>, previous agriculture was associated with the highest probability of invasion, with the log odds increasing by 2.13 (Wald Z = 7.509, p &lt; 0.001) and the odds increasing by 8.38.
