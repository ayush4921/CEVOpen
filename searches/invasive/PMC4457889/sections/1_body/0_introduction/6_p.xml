<p>Multiflora rose (
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic>) and Japanese barberry (
 <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic>) were the only invasive species in our study site that were present in large enough numbers to examine their distribution patterns individually. We predicted that historical land use change would have greater effects on occurrence of invasive species than abundance for both species in accordance with previous research [

We also expected that mining would have equal, or greater effects, than agriculture on the occurrence and abundance of these species, given that the effects of mining on the environment tend to be more long-lasting and severe than the effects of agriculture [

 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>thunbergii</italic> than on 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic>, as was seen in previous research, although that study did not include the effects of land-use change in their model [
