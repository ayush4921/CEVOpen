<p>Certain weed species add to the vegetation diversity and therefore they are considered a positive component in ecological terms, but they are frequently associated with negative effects upon domestic livestock production [

 <italic>Urochloa panicoides</italic> Beauv.) and other unsown broadleaved weed species, such as Paddy’s Lucerne, purslane small-flowered mallow (
 <italic>Malva parviflora</italic> L.) and thorn apple (
 <italic>Datura ferox</italic> L.), which were equally abundant in both mixture two and the control.
