<p>At 60 DAE, the greater production of biomass by pasture mixture one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f002">Figure 2</xref>) suggested that this mixture consists of species that are all capable of rapid growth and probably better suited to the present study environment. For instance, Rhodes grass is an abundant but introduced species in the region (D. Youles personal communication, 2010). The number of established plants from the plant mixtures that contributed to their biomass was also significantly higher in plant mixture two than one. Additionally, mixture one showed less variability on plant heights throughout the period (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01587-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The peak in biomass production achieved by mixture one also indicates that this mixture responded better to the above average rainfall during January (236.6 mm). At 90 DAE, the below average rainfall during February (87 mm) resulted in the control treatments yielding significantly less biomass than was seen at 60 DAE. However, both pasture mixtures were able to maintain a stable biomass production over time and even after simulated grazing had been applied (
