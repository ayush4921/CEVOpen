<p>The significant decline in diversity noted at 90 DAE for pasture mixture one was probably due to the increased dominance of only a few species in that mixture (i.e., green panic and the unsown weed species green crumbweed and bull thistle (
 <italic>Cirsium vulgaris</italic> (Savi) Ten)). The suppressive ability of one species over another may vary significantly across environments [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Other studies, testing these same species in a monoculture, have shown higher biomass production can be achieved and therefore they exhibit better suppressive ability against parthenium weed [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; however, the species were evaluated under higher fertile soils and over longer periods of time. Total yield is not the sole criterion for evaluating the benefits of increased forage species diversity on grazing lands. As demonstrated in this investigation, the ability to suppress the reestablishment of an invasive species and the contribution to plant diversity are valuable characters of sown plant mixtures. This study also demonstrated that managing pastures to increase forage species diversity is a useful component to introduce into an integrated weed management scheme for parthenium weed.
