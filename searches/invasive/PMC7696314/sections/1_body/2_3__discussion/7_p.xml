<p>The calculation of forage species diversity separately from the total community and also excluding the sown species allowed an assessment of the sown species upon the diversity of unsown species with forage significance. The total diversity was ca. five times higher for the mixture communities than for the forage control community, indicating that the contribution of unsown species with grazing value in this trial was not substantial. This observation was also supported by the pre-trial seed bank analysis, which showed a very high proportion of broadleaf and sedge species to be present at the site (

However, when sown species were excluded from the analysis no differences were observed between this and the other treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f004">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the plausible benefits on increasing diversity of species with a grazing value from the sown mixtures has not yet occurred. Positive species interactions, such as an improvement in the abundance of native species with grazing value, were expected to occur. However, three months of field evaluation might have limited these kinds of observations as in sub-tropical Queensland, changes in community composition due to a sown pasture may take 10 or more years [

In the longer term, nitrogen fixation by the legume component, better nutrient recycling and a more balanced usage of the available resources might result in obtaining positive responses in yield, forage quality and community species diversity.
