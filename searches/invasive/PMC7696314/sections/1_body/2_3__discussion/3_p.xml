<p>Perennial grass-based pastures such as the two used here are known to establish more slowly than annual pastures, however after establishment they are usually very resilient to grazing [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed, both plant mixtures (native and introduced) achieved effective ground cover by 60 DAE, even after having initial low stand establishment rates, possibly because of the advantageous larger seed size than their counterpart grass species. Larger seeds can produce stronger seedlings that survive and thus establish better [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Most native species in the plant mixtures (i.e., bull Mitchell grass, Hoop Mitchell grass and red grass) established poorly, which reduced the richness of native species expected in plant mixture two. This result suggests a poor adaptation of the 
 <italic>Astrebla</italic> genus to the microclimate of this region. Improving the germination and establishment rates of these native species should become a research priority in order to gain benefit from their inclusion in plant mixtures.
