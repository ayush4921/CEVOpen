<p>All plant seed lots used in the mixtures were obtained from seed companies, then cleaned, air dried and stored at 15 ± 1 ℃ and 15 ± 2% relative humidity (RH) in a seed store before being used. In order to use an appropriate sowing rate for each species in the field, a laboratory germination test was undertaken on a sub-sample of the seed lot in a germination incubator (day/night temperature regime 25/20 ± 2 ℃ with a 12 h day/12 h night photoperiod and light intensity of 100 µmol m

 <sup>−1</sup>), mimicking the environmental conditions in the field at the peak time for germination of parthenium weed [
