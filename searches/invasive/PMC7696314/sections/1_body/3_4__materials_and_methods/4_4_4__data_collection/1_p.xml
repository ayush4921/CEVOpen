<p>Once the plants had established and were growing rapidly, three simulated grazing times were made at 30, 60 and 90 days after emergence (DAE). The simulated grazing times consisted of cutting (with scissors) both the sown and unsown grass species at a point that was equal to 50% of their average height. The average heights were determined from a permanent quadrat that had been placed in the middle of each the various treatment plots. Those quadrats that had been cut on a previous simulated grazing time were not re-cut at 60 and 90 DAE. Upon cutting, all plant material was divided into either parthenium weed, sown species or all other unsown grass species. These samples were put into separate paper bags and dried in an oven at 70°C for 3 days. Species considered to be “weeds” (for instance, all unsown broadleaved species, such as Paddy’s Lucerne (
 <italic>Sida rhombofolia</italic> L.), purslane (
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> L.) and spiny amaranth (
 <italic>Amaranthus spinosus</italic> L.) were not included in the biomass samples taken, as it was assumed these species would not be grazed. Just prior to each of these simulated grazing interventions, species identification and abundance were also determined.
