<p>Parthenium weed has infested an area of more than 60 million ha in Queensland, Australia [

 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported losses worth $69 million (AUD) per annum in the beef industry due to parthenium weed. Different management approaches have been used to control parthenium weed with varying degrees of success. Several chemical herbicides provide effective control of this species. However, the large scale weed infestations and the environmental concerns rule out the continuous and frequent use of chemicals. Ecologically based approaches have been proposed as more sustainable to manage this species [
