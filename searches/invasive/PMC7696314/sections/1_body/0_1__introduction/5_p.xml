<p>This study evaluated the potential suppressive effect of two selected plant mixtures against parthenium weed growth in grazed and non-grazed situations. The impact of these suppressive plants on plant community diversity was also assessed. The specific objectives were to a) compare the suppressive ability of two selected plant mixtures, one predominantly composed of native species and the other predominantly composed of introduced species, against parthenium weed under field conditions, b) determine the fodder biomass production of these two suppressive plant mixtures, and c) assess the impact that these two suppressive plant mixtures had upon the plant community diversity.</p>
