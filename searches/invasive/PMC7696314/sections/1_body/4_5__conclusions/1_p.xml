<p>Plant mixture one could be characterized as an early biomass producer as it is able to rapidly respond to changes in environmental conditions and is more tolerant to invasion by species considered ”weeds” other than parthenium weed. On the other hand, plant mixture two can be characterized as a later biomass producer, but achieving the same biomass levels as mixture one, and able to suppress parthenium weed re-establishment. We have demonstrated that managing pastures to increase forage species diversity is a useful component to introduce into an integrated weed management scheme for parthenium weed. The mixture to be selected depends on the main objectives of the production system.</p>
