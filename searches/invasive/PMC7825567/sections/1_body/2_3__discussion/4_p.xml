<p>One of the unexpected findings of this study is the inhibitory effect of α-Cyperone on the capsule of 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic>. While the MIC of α-Cyperone against 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> is high, at a lower concentration (16 µg/mL), it inhibited the capsule size significantly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, determination of the capsulated cells in the control and α-Cyperone treated samples showed that while 85% of the cells were capsulated in the former, only 21% were capsulated (all of them were with reduced capsule size) in the treated sample (data not shown). The capsule is a major virulence factor in 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> and capsule-deficient strains were avirulent [

 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A mutant strain (
 <italic>pkr1</italic>) of the cAMP pathway produces larger capsules than the wild type and was virulent in an animal model [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> capsule wall contains two major polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM), in addition to a smaller amount of mannoproteins [

 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is possible that α-Cyperone may interfere with the synthesis of these polysaccharides or via the ROS-mediated signaling pathways. Interestingly, we observed that α-Cyperone treated 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> cells were broken more efficiently than the control cells by glass beads-mediated homogenization (Precellys 24) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00051">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), which may indicate that α-Cyperone can affect the cell envelope probably by causing a defect either in their synthesis or in their cross-linking processes to the cell wall/capsule during maturation steps [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Future experiments including gene expression and biochemical studies will help us to understand the antifungal mechanism of α-Cyperone.
