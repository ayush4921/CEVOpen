 <caption> The membrane integrity of C. krusei fungus was unaffected by α-Cyperone. Positive control (heat-killed cells) and α-Cyperone treated (125 µg/mL) cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI) fluorescent dye solution as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM 6 B) with an appropriate filter. Fluorescent (FLU) images and corresponding differential interference contrast (DIC) images are shown. Scale bar, 10 µm. </caption>
