 <caption> α-Cyperone affects drug-resistant C. auris, but has no effect on bacteria. ( a) Inhibition of C. auris growth as determined by a growth monitoring system (Bioscreen-C). ( b) Absence of antibacterial activity of α-Cyperone against E. coli and S. aureus. Sterile discs containing α-Cyperone (60 µg/disc) was placed immediately after spreading the bacterial cell suspension (100 µL, 10 9/mL) on tryptic soy agar medium. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and photographed. Lack of inhibitory zones around the discs was observed. </caption>
