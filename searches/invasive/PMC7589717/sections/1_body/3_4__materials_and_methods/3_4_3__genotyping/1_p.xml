<p>To verify whether 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> individuals belonged to native or to introduced genotypes, a cpDNA PCR-RFLP analysis that had been developed by Saltonstall [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was used. Briefly, two non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome [
 <italic>trnT</italic> (UGU)-
 <italic>trnL</italic> (UAA) and 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>-
 <italic>psa</italic>I] were amplified using the primers described by Saltonstall [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. PCR products were digested using the restriction enzyme 
 <italic>Rsa</italic>I for the 
 <italic>trnL</italic>b region and 
 <italic>Hha</italic>I for the 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> region following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Restriction fragments were electrophoresed in ethidium bromide-stained 3% TAE agarose gels and visualized using UV light. We also searched for matches with a Blast tool provided by NCBI. To confirm the results, PCR products were sequenced on an ABI 16-capillary genetic analyzer 3130XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were edited and aligned using BioEdit version 7.0.5 [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The BLASTn algorithm [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] was used to query GenBank (NCBI) to determine the closest 
 <italic>P. austalis</italic> haplotype. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA 7 software [
 <xref rid="B92-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], and the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method [
 <xref rid="B93-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].
