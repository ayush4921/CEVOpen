<p>Similarity among different

 <xref rid="B98-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. We characterized haplotypes and plotted the phenotypic distribution for each trait using the R ggpubr program [
 <xref rid="B99-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Principal components analysis (PCA) with phenotypic traits was applied to examine the pattern of phylogeographic groups, and how close they were to each other. PCA was performed using the Facto Mine R package [
