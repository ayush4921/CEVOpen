<p>A total of 20 populations were sampled in this study for genetic study, including nine populations from Kashmir and eleven populations from Quebec (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). We designated only one population out of 20 populations as native, using cpDNA PCR-RFLP analysis. Collection sites in each region were separated by distances of 10–100 km. At each site, we collected one population, and, within each population, 25 individual plants were collected for molecular analysis. Fresh leaf samples (each about 1 cm
 <sup>2</sup> in area) were collected in tubes with desiccant and kept frozen at −20 °C prior to DNA extraction. Genomic DNA from plant species was extracted using the CTAB method [
