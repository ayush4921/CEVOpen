<p>The

 <sub>ST</sub> contrast is useful for evaluating the relative contributions of non-adaptive and adaptive processes in shaping quantitative traits. Local adaptation and evolutionary potential have been advocated as greatly influencing the outcomes of invasion by alien species [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Heritability estimates of the characters that were studied may provide clues on local adaptation. Results of the present study indicate local adaptation of invasive haplotypes for internode length, leaf length, and flower masses, indicating that these traits may influence invasion success in the species. On the other hand, isolation by distance or divergent selection are the main hypotheses that explain phenotypic divergence in nature within species [

 <sub>ST</sub> and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> estimates for six out of the seven traits that were investigated, we tested the correlation between genetic distances and geographical distances. Our results showed no or weak relationships between genetic and geographic distances in the regions that were surveyed. Thus, the hypothesis that could explain the phenotypic divergence observed between populations in traits that were investigated in our study is divergent selection for plant height, plant stem diameter, fresh and dry flower mass, leaf length, and leaf width coupled with local adaptation in internode length, leaf length, and flower masses. We also postulate that internode length variation between populations are explained by genetic drift. However, a large fine-scale study would confirm these findings.
