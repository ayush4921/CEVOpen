<p>Our results suggest that environmental conditions in Quebec and Kashmir are not as much contrasting to induce divergent selection on quantitative traits through strong local population pressures [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This is because there was no major variation in genetic structure between Quebec and Kashmir 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations, and no significant phenotypic variation was recorded between Quebec and Kashmir populations, except for flower and seed dry mass. Such non-spatial geographic differences in phenotypic traits are not common and may be caused by probable multiple introductions [

 <xref rid="B83-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, difference in flower and seed dry mass between the regions indicates that there might be differential effect of selection on quantitative characters.
