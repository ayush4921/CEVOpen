<p>In the present study, plant stem diameter appeared to be linked to invasiveness of 
 <italic>P. australis,</italic> given that the highest mean values were recorded for invasive populations. Yet Muth and Pigliucci [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], in comparing six growth-related traits, found very little variation among introduced invasive and introduced non-invasive plant species within two genera of Asteraceae (
 <italic>Crepis</italic> and 
 <italic>Centaurea</italic>), with respect to stem diameter. As our study included one native population, we suggest that any assumptions need to be confirmed with fine-scale studies over a broader distribution range of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>, taking into account an even larger number of populations.
