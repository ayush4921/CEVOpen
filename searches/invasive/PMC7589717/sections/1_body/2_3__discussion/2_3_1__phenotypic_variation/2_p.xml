<p>Plant height plays an important role in invasiveness, as Crawley et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and Canavan et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] found that tall-statured grasses harbor a useful functional trait for invasion success. In their review, Mozdzer et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] clearly indicated that introduced and native 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineages differ both physiologically and morphologically. Introduced plants are generally taller and occur in greater densities, which results in greater productivity in the introduced lineage in nearly every study.
