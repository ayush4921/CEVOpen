<p>The phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01392-f005">Figure 5</xref>) was congruent with principal coordinate analysis results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01392-f004">Figure 4</xref>), as the populations of native and non-native 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> that were studied were found to be very structured. Clearly, ten populations belonging to Quebec invasive (QE1, QE2, QE4, QE6, QE7, QE8, QE9, QE10, QE11, and QE12) were grouped together, completely distant from the population of Quebec native (QN1; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01392-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Kashmir invasive populations were clustered in the same group, whereas KE9 were close to QN1 population following by a sub-group containing height populations (KE1, KE2, KE3, KE4, KE5, KE6, KE7, and KE8;
