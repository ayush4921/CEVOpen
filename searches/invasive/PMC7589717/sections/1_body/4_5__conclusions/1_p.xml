<p>In conclusion, it appears that invasive populations of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> exhibit better growth-related traits, especially fresh and dry mass of flowers and seeds. PCoA based on Bruvo distances clearly distinguished invasive and native populations from the sample regions. Highest levels of genetic diversity were found in invasive populations of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in Kashmir Himalayan wetlands. The observed among-population phenotypic differences in the surveyed 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> are explained by divergent selection, local adaptation, and genetic drift. Understanding the phylogeographic basis of such a diversity gradient remains an open challenge. Cluster and structure analysis delineated all populations of native and invasive 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> from Quebec and Kashmir into five main groups, shedding some light on their evolutionary relationships. The important level of the genetic diversity reported in the present study should be considered in managing the native and invasive 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations in Quebec and Kashmir. The results provide a first step for further investigations based on sampling from a larger global range, including native European populations of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>.
