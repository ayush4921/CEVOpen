<p>The phenotypic differences within and among populations of invasive species in their native and non-native ranges are widely speculated [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The colonization of new areas by invasive species would be associated theoretically with founder diversity [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], phenotypic plasticity, and environmental conditions at the points of origin [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], various ecological and evolutionary processes associated with geographical zone [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and population bottlenecks that reduce within-population genetic diversity and increase genetic differentiation among populations [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These population genetic differentiations have important effects on species invasiveness, which is apparently linked to increased genetic variation and evolutionary potential [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, population genetic analyses can increase our understanding of the origin and expansion of invasive species and invasive populations [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], or haplotypes (i.e., individuals with a specific group of alleles that are inherited within a species), and the same could have useful management implications as well. Previous research has typically focused on detecting how invasive haplotypes have invaded and replaced native haplotypes [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This replacement is most often due to better performance of invasive haplotypes compared to native haplotypes with respect to morphological traits, such as plant height and size, and to reproductive success. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the variation patterns of such invasive haplotypes in their native regions. Further, the causes of morphological differences between invasive and natural populations of IAS are not well understood. Thus, investigating phenotypic and genotypic differentiation between invasive and native haplotypes in wild populations should contribute to the understanding of mechanisms behind the invasion of alien species.
