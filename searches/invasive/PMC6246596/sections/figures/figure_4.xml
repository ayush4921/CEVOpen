  <p>Path diagram showing: latitude effects on abiotic variables (annual minimum temperature and soil pH); abiotic variable effects on nematode knot abundance and diversity of soil fungal pathogens; nematode and pathogen effects on performance of the native and invasive plants; effects of plants on beetles fed their leaves. Only significant paths are shown. Dashed lines indicate negative effects and solid lines denote positive effects. The width of the lines indicates the magnitude of effects</p>
