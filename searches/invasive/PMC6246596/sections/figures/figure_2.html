 <caption> Relationship between the Euclidean Distance and Jaccard Dissimilarity of fungal OTUs ( a and b), AMF OTUs ( c and d), fungal pathogen OTUs ( e and f), and bacterial OTUs ( g and h) and the latitude difference between paired samples that both were from A. philoxeroides soils (green), A. sessilis soils (red), or from different soil types (black). The F-values and P-values are from ANCOVAs and lines indicate effects of latitude. For fungal pathogens ( f) and bacteria ( e and h), communities were most dissimilar for pairs of A. sessilis soils, intermediate for a pairing of different soils, and least different for pairs of A. philoxeroides soils in post-hoc tests </caption>
