However, the greater dissimilarity of bacterial and fungal pathogen assemblages for pairs of native plant soils and greater similarity for pairs of invasive plant soils suggest that invasive rhizosphere communities are composed of a subset of general, broadly distributed bacterial and fungal pathogens, whereas native assemblages contain rarer and more narrowly distributed taxa. Furthermore, AMF composition differed between the native and invasive plant rhizospheres in this study, which is consistent with other studies [
