<p id="Par37">Furthermore, soil biotic effects on plant invasions or range expansions, indirectly affected by above-ground herbivory, have been largely overlooked. Currently, 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> occurs in a region below 30.8 
 <sup>o</sup>N in continental China, but climate warming could trigger an expansion of the range to higher latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and increase its non-target attacks on 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This study indicates that, during 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic>â€™s northward range expansion, its performance may be improved when consuming 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> due to changes in the soil biota. Although highly significant, the size of the effect of soil collection latitude on the mass of beetles fed native plant foliage was low. More evidence is needed to understand the importance of this pattern. In addition, it remains an open question whether indirect soil biotic effects on herbivores will affect competition between native and invasive plants, which depends on the relative strength of direct and indirect effects. Thus, to explore the role of soil biota in plant invasions and range expansion, it is critical to fully assess direct and indirect (via above-ground herbivores) effects on plants within a biogeographic context.
