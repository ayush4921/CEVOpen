<p id="Par33">In contrast to the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis, we found no latitudinal pattern in plant–soil interactions for the invasive plant. Our path analysis only detected a negative association between soil enemy abundance and plant performance for the native plant, not for the invasive plant, likely reflecting the invasive plant’s more effective defense against fungal pathogens or nematode attacks [

In addition, relative to the long evolutionary history of the native plant with the soil biota, the invasive plant had a short soil association history (less than 100 years), likely lacking sufficient time to evolve the observed gradient. Furthermore, unlike the native plant which can reproduce by seeds that may generate genetic variation during the evolutionary process, the invasive plant only reproduces by vegetative propagation, likely decreasing the latitudinal variation in its interactions with soil biota. Contrasting latitudinal patterns of soil biotic effects on the native vs. invasive plants may create spatial variation in the strengths of enemy release and biotic resistance that the invasive plant will experience during range expansion. At low latitudes, a higher defense might enable the invasive plant to escape more from soil-borne enemies than the native plant, whereas at high latitudes the invasive plant might experience increasing resistance from native competitors due to the decreased impact of soil-borne enemies.
