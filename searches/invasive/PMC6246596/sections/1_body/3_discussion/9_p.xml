<p id="Par38">Currently, most theories and studies on biological invasions assume that biotic interactions are uniform across the geographic distributions of species in their invaded ranges, with few exceptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, we found that latitudinal variation in the interactions among the soil microbes, soil herbivores, plants, and foliar herbivores differed for native and invasive plants, which potentially creates spatial variation in enemy release or biotic resistance and in turn potentially influences invasion dynamics. Moreover, the latitudinal decrease in the diversity of soil-borne pathogens and the abundance of root-knot nematodes, which is partially driven by minimum temperature, suggests that current and future climate change could affect plant–soil biota interactions over latitudes. Thus, considering the variation in these complex interactions across latitudes will help to better understand and predict invasion patterns and their ecological impacts at large scales. Overall, our results highlight the roles of plant defense and latitudinal variation in microbial communities in shaping biotic interactions and the importance of linking above- and below-ground multitrophic interactions while testing the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis.
