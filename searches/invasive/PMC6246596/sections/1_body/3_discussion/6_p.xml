<p id="Par35">Our investigation of soil–plant–herbivore interactions along a latitudinal gradient is limited by the single native-invasive plant pair and future tests will require more native and invasive plant species. Despite this limitation, the differing latitudinal patterns in plant–soil interactions found in this study might also be valid for other species and types of biotic interactions (e.g., plant–insect/pathogen interactions, plant–pollinator interactions). Increasing evidence shows that the abundance or diversity of soil-borne enemies and above-ground herbivores or predators decreases with latitude [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As a result, the strength of biotic interactions, including plant–soil interactions, plant–herbivory interactions, and prey–predator interactions, decreases with latitude for many native species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, a greater defense of invasive plants than native plants against soil-borne enemies has been documented in other systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and biotic interactions involving invasive plants are characterized by evolutionary novelty [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; thus, an absence of latitudinal patterns in these systems is likely but needs further study.
