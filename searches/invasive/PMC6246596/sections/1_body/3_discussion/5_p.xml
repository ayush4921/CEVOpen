<p id="Par34">The impacts of soil biota on plants could cascade to above-ground herbivores through food webs, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied at local scales but has not been tested across biogeographic gradients. Here, we provided the first study of this kind, showing the larval mass of 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> fed native plant leaves increased as a function of soil collection latitude, but the larval mass of beetles fed invasive plant leaves did not. Path analysis indicated soil fungal pathogens and nematodes had a negative impact on 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> via the native plant, but found no impact of soil biota on 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> via the invasive plant, which is consistent with our previous finding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Soil biota could affect above-ground herbivores by altering plant defense and/or nutritional content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In a previous study, we found differing impacts of soil nematode 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> infection on the native beetle 
 <italic>Cassida piperata</italic> via 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, and detected a minor impact of soil nematodes on the foliar C:N of both plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Whether the observed effects of the soil biota on 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> were due to nutritional or defensive changes induced by soil-borne enemies and how the two host plants differ in mediating these effects need to be further studied with experiments involving sterilized soils.
