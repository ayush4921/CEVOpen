<p id="Par36">The differing latitudinal patterns of soil–plant–herbivore interactions for native and invasive plants we observed have important implications for understanding plant range expansions or invasions across latitudes under current and future climates if these patterns apply to other plant species and types of biotic interactions. Release from soil-borne and above-ground enemies has been proposed as an important factor underlying plant invasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and species range expansions to high latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Given a lower dispersal rate of soil biota than plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], our results indicate plants will likely experience decreasing soil-borne enemies during poleward range expansions. According to our findings, soil-borne enemy release at higher latitudes is expected to facilitate range expansion of susceptible species that experience more negative impacts at low latitudes, but this facilitation via enemy release might be weak or nonexistent for plant species that experience weaker negative or perhaps even positive impacts at low latitudes. This might also be the case for above-ground herbivory when herbivores disperse slowly. In addition, our use of a single source population for native plants might have overestimated ecological effects of variation in enemy abundance, but may have underestimated effects of variation in enemy abundance through evolutionary responses (including coevolution of plants and specialist herbivores) if plant defense and growth allocation patterns reflect latitudinal differences in enemy attack [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This opens the possibility that more poorly defended high latitude populations from the native range could establish in and invade the lower latitudes of their introduced ranges.
