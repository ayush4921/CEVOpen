<p id="Par30">Release from soil-borne pathogens and herbivores or enhanced positive soil interactions via mutualists are considered important factors contributing to plant invasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Testing how latitudinal changes in soil biota communities affect native and invasive plants may help to understand latitudinal variation in biotic interactions and predict the strength of enemy release or biotic resistance of invasive plant species. Here, we show that the native plant performance increased with soil collection latitude, consistent with the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis, likely due to the decreasing abundance and diversity of soil-borne enemies. However, as predicted, there was no latitudinal pattern for the invasive plant mass. In addition, we found soil biotic effects cascaded to above-ground beetle performance only when the beetles were fed foliage of the native plant rather than the invasive plant. These novel results highlight the importance of linking above- and below-ground trophic interactions when exploring the role of soil biota in shaping plant performance along latitudinal gradients. They also add to an emerging body of literature [
