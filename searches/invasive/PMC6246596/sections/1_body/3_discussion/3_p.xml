<p id="Par32">Native plant growth, reflecting the net effects of antagonistic and mutualist interactions, increased with increasing latitude of soil collection. This was likely due to decreasing negative impacts of soil-borne enemies with soil collection latitude based on the following evidence. First, our path analysis found a negative association between both soil fungal pathogen diversity and root-knot nematode abundance and native plant performance. Second, soil-borne enemy abundance (root-knot nematodes) and diversity (fungal pathogens) decreased with latitude, which is consistent with the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], whereas no latitudinal pattern was observed for AMF, bacteria, or fungi in general. However, changes in the taxonomic composition of bacteria, pathogenic fungi, and AMF communities with latitude indicate that species differences in the strengths of negative and/or positive interactions might also contribute to the pattern we and others [
