<p id="Par4">Soil biota can have profound effects on non-native plant invasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Studies at the local-scale (e.g., a single community or ecosystem) have found that invasive plants often are less negatively affected than co-occurring native plants by soil microbes and herbivores, indicating the former escapes soil-borne enemies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This may indicate that invasive plants possess more effective defenses against generalist enemies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or novel antimicrobial chemicals (the Novel Weapon Hypothesis) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, some invasive plants benefit from high levels of colonization by local mutualists [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Soil biotic effects on plants can be negative or positive, depending on the community composition of the soil biota, especially the relative abundances of mutualists (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF), herbivores (e.g., root nematodes) and pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] that vary with latitude in response to changes in soil properties and climate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For example, the diversity of soil fungi and fungal pathogens increases towards the equator [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In parallel, studies with native plants have found greater negative impacts of soil biota at low than at high latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In contrast with latitudinal patterns of biotic interactions for native plants that reflect the co-adaptation of interacting species over evolutionary time, invasive plant–soil biota interactions are characterized by evolutionary novelty [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the latitudinal variation in plant–soil interactions that native plants experience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] is expected to be absent for invasive plants, potentially creating large-scale heterogeneity in the strength of enemy release or biotic resistance.
