 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Understanding how biotic interactions respond to environmental changes is critical for the current and future conservation of biodiversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Biogeography is central to synthesizing large-scale patterns of species interactions and their responses to environmental changes, and provides a window to assess the impacts of changing biotic interactions on species distributions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis posits that biotic interactions are more intense at low than at high latitudes because a more benign climate and higher species diversity at low latitudes lead to stronger interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This theory has been tested extensively on antagonistic and mutualistic interactions between native species, with many studies showing higher levels of herbivory, predation, or parasitism at low than at high latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; however, other studies have found no such pattern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most of these studies have emphasized above-ground interactions, largely overlooking plantâ€“soil biota interactions and the indirect, plant-mediated impacts of soil biota on above-ground herbivores [
