<p id="Par5">Increasing evidence has indicated that the effects of soil biota on plants could cascade to above-ground herbivores [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Empirical studies have indicated that soil biota can alter a host plant’s palatability or defenses, which may change host choice behavior and the performance of above-ground herbivores, potentially modifying plant-above-ground herbivore interactions and, in turn, plant invasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, latitudinal variation in soil biota community composition may also indirectly determine the performance of above-ground herbivores by affecting invasive and native plant hosts. However, existing studies on changes in plant–soil biota interactions with latitude have employed a strictly bi-trophic framework [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], potentially overlooking indirect effects of the soil biota on above-ground herbivores.
