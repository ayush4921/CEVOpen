<p id="Par6">Here, we characterized bacterial and fungal communities and root-knot nematodes in soils collected along a latitudinal gradient (from 22 °N to 36.6 °N) in continental China. Then, we experimentally estimated the direct impacts of the soil biota on the invasive plant 
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> (alligator weed) and its native congener 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, as well as the indirect impacts of the soil biota on the biocontrol beetle 
 <italic>Agasicles hygrophila</italic> (alligator weed flea beetle) mediated by these plant species. This system is well suited for this kind of study. First, 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> co-occurs with 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> along its entire latitudinal range and their competition changes with latitude [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Second, 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> and the native root-knot nematode 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> are the main above- and below-ground herbivores attacking these plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Third, interactions with herbivores differ for these plant species, as the invasive plant has more effective defenses against both above- and below-ground herbivores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Here, we characterized soil bacterial and fungal community compositions by high-throughput sequencing, used climate and soil physical properties to investigate the causes of soil biota community variation, and explored links between soil biota community composition and performance of the plant and beetle species in a greenhouse experiment and lab bioassay. Specifically, we asked: (1) Does the soil biota community (bacteria, fungi, root-knot nematodes) associated with the invasive and native plants change with latitude? (2) If so, which climate or soil properties influence latitudinal variation in soil biota communities? (3) How do soil biotic effects on the invasive vs. native plant and beetle change with soil collection latitude? We predicted that soil biota community diversity and effects of the soil biota on native plants and beetles consuming their foliage would decrease with increasing latitude (consistent with the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis). However, the effects of soil biota on the invasive plant, which lacks a long history of association with these soil communities, would not vary with latitude.
