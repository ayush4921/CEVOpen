<p id="Par29">Path analysis (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed that the abundance of root-knot nematode and potential soil-borne fungal pathogens increased with annual minimum temperature that decreased with latitude. The increase in pH with latitude contributed to decreases in root knots. Root-knot nematodes and soil-borne fungal pathogens suppressed the performance of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, which in turn suppressed beetle performance. Neither root-knot nematodes nor soil fungal pathogens had an impact on 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>.
