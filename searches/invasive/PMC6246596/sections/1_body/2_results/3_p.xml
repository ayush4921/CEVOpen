<p id="Par25">Total fungal OTU composition varied with precipitation, AMF OTU composition varied with N:P, pH, Tmax, and soil type, potential fungal pathogen OTU composition varied with TP, AP, precipitation, pH, Tmax, and Tmaxavg, and bacterial OTU composition varied with pH and N:P (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Soils had more dissimilar fungal (Jaccard but not Euclidean index), AMF (Jaccard only), potential fungal pathogen (both), and bacterial (both) assemblages when they were from more distant sites by latitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Soils had more dissimilar fungal pathogen assemblages when both were 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> soils and less dissimilar fungal pathogen assemblages when both were 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> soils or were different soils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Soils had the most dissimilar bacterial assemblages when both were 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> soils, the least dissimilar bacterial assemblages when both were 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> soils, and an intermediate assemblage dissimilarity when they were different soils (Figs.
