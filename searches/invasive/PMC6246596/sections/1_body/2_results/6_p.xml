<p id="Par28">Beetle survival odds were independent of all predictors (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Beetle mass was 5.2% higher on average when they ate 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> than 
 <italic>A.sessilis</italic> leaves; in addition, their mass increased by 20.0% along the latitudinal gradient of soil collection when they ate 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> leaves (effect size
