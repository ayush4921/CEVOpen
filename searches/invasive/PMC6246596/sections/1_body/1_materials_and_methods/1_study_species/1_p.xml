 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> (Amaranthaceae), which is native to South America, is a global invader with an expanding range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In continental China, it propagates only via buds and stems, is distributed from 21 °N to 36.8 °N [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and has low genetic diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. 
 <italic>Alternanthera sessilis</italic>, native to China, can propagate via seeds or stem buds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The latitudinal range of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> fully overlaps with that of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in continental China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Both species can form dense mats on land. 
 <italic>Alternanthera sessilis</italic> mainly has fine roots with thin cuticles and high surface area per biomass, while 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> mainly has coarse roots with thick cuticles and low surface area per biomass [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> is more susceptible than 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> to root infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].
