<p id="Par11">Soil DNA was extracted with the Ezup genomic DNA extraction kit (Sangon Biotech, China). Bacterial 
 <italic>16S rRNA</italic> genes were amplified with the universal primers 515F and 909R, and fungal 
 <italic>ITSF1</italic> genes were amplified with the forward primer ITSF2_KYO2 and reverse primer ITSF3. Two parallel 25 μl PCR reactions were conducted for each DNA sample, and the PCR products were purified and pooled together for each DNA sample. Purified libraries were diluted, denatured, re-diluted, mixed with PhiX (equal to 30% of the final DNA amount) and sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq system [see details in ref.
