<p id="Par12">All sequences were analyzed with QIIME Pipeline—Version 1.7.0, and sorted to each sample based on their unique barcodes. High-quality sequences were used for downstream analysis, and chimera sequences were removed with the UCHIME algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. All sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a 97% identity cutoff. Bacterial 16s rRNA OTUs taxonomy was assigned with the Ribosomal Database Project classifier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Fungal ITS sequences were blasted against the GenBank nucleotide database. DNA sequencing data are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with the accession numbers PRJEB22110 and PRJEB22111. We classified whether the fungal OTUs were likely to be potential plant pathogens with FUNGuild at the “possible” confidence level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. FUNGuild could only assign a fungus as a potential pathogen for some plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, this coarse categorization was necessary because there was little information on soil pathogens for the two studied plant species. All Glomeromycota were classified as AMF.
