To account for spatial heterogeneity, we collected soils at five locations (10 km apart) for each of the 16 sites and 15 soil cores (2.5 cm in diameter, 10 cm in depth) for each plant species at each location. We immediately placed the soil cores in plastic bags and kept them at 4 °C. We finished soil collection within 2 weeks; thus, soil samples were stored for different periods up to 14 days, but this likely had a negligible impact based on the reports of other studies [

This soil mixing approach might overlook soil biota community variation at small spatial scales and can generate falsely precise statistical estimates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Then, we divided the soil sample from each site and rhizosphere species combination into four parts that we: (1) used to measure pH values, (2) air dried for chemical analysis, (3) stored at −20 °C for DNA extraction and sequencing, or (4) used for the greenhouse experiment. We cleaned and sterilized all equipment used in these lab procedures and experiments by bleach immersion (24 h) between soil types (i.e., between each site and rhizosphere species combination).
