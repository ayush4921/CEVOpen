<p id="Par18">For soil bacterial and fungal communities, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to examine taxonomic composition variation within groups (all fungal OTUs, AMF OTUs, potential fungal pathogen OTUs, bacteria OTUs; three axes in every case). We chose PCA to represent community variation with a small number of summary variables that vary linearly with latitude. We conducted ANCOVAs to determine which site characteristics predicted variation in PCA axes for each group. Starting models included continuous soil chemistry (TC, TN, TP, C:N, C:P, N:P, AN, AP, OC, pH) and climate variables (Tmin, Tmax, precipitation) and the categorical variable soil type. Stepwise, forward, and backward models selected the same final model for each PCA axis.</p>
