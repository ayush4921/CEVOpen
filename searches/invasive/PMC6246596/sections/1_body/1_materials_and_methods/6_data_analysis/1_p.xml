<p id="Par17">We used ANCOVAs (i.e., ANOCOVAs) to examine the effects of soil type (categorical variable: rhizosphere of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> vs. rhizosphere of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>), latitude (continuous variable), and their interaction on soil chemistry variables. We used Cohen’s 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> to estimate local effect sizes. We considered effects to be significant when the 
 <italic>P</italic>-values were &lt;0.05 and classified the effect magnitudes as small (0.10 &lt; 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.25), medium (0.25 &lt; 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.40), or large (0.40 &lt; 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) following previously published guidelines [
