<p id="Par21">To explore mechanisms for latitudinal effects on plant and beetle performance, we conducted a path analysis. First, we examined covariance among environmental variables. Because several temperature and precipitation variables were strongly correlated (
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.95), we only included Tmin and Tmax, which were independent of other climate variables. Second, we used regression with standardized coefficients to quantify the effect of latitude on Tmin and Tmax plus soil pH. Third, we conducted additional regressions to examine the effects of these climate and soil variables on microbial variables (numbers of total fungal, AMF, fungal pathogen, and bacterial OTUs) and below-ground herbivory (number of nematode root knots). Fourth, we performed a regression to test the dependence of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> seed production on soil microbial variables, below-ground herbivory, and soil abiotic variables. Because 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> only reproduces vegetatively in China, we used plant mass to examine its responses to these variables. Finally, we examined the dependence of beetles on plant variables. In every regression, we only included significant paths. We only show results for variables that varied with latitude or impacted plant performance.
