<p id="Par20">We used ANCOVAs to examine the effects of soil collection latitude, plant species (categorical variable), soil type, and their interactions on plant mass. We conducted similar analyses that examined effects on number of root knots and beetle mass. We fit models for numbers of seeds produced by 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>. We performed an ANCOVA (response variable was the number of surviving beetles out of ten initial larvae with a binomial error distribution and a logit link function) to test whether beetle survival odds varied with the same set of predictors used in the beetle mass analysis.
