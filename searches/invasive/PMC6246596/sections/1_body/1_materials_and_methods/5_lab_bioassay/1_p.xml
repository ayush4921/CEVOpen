<p id="Par16">To test the indirect impacts of soil bacteria, fungi, and nematodes on beetles via the native vs. invasive plants, we conducted a lab bioassay. Lab bioassays that feed leaves to insects under controlled temperature and photoperiod conditions are a powerful way to test how variations in plant palatability or defense impact insect performance [

 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> beetles from a local field, reared them on 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in mesh cages for one generation, and used their offspring for bioassays. We transferred newly hatched larvae into petri dishes (9 cm diameter) lined with moist filter paper and placed a single intact leaf into each dish. The leaves of 5 of the 60 treatment combinations were destroyed by a refrigerator malfunction (Supplementary Table

We maintained dishes at 28 °C with a natural light/dark photoperiod (14:10) and kept the filter papers moist. Every other day, we replaced each leaf with an intact leaf from a plant from the same treatment. One week later, we weighed the fresh mass of surviving beetles after 24 h of starvation.
