<p id="Par13">To test the direct impacts of soil bacteria, fungi, and nematodes on 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> vs. 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, we conducted a greenhouse experiment in Wuhan from June to December 2015. We collected 0–10 cm top-soil from a local field and sterilized it with gamma rays. Then, for 15 of the sites across latitudes, we mixed the rhizosphere soil samples of either the native or invasive plants with sterilized top-soil at the ratio of 1:4 (v/v) to reduce potential impacts of soil abiotic properties on plant performance. One site did not have sufficient soil after screening (Table
