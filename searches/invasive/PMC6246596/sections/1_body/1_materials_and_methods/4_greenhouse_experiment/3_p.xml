<p id="Par15">At the end of the experiment, we counted the flowers and the seeds in ten randomly selected flowers on each 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> plant to estimate total seed number for each individual. We also collected 20 fully-opened, similar-sized leaves from the top of each plant (each plant had hundreds of leaves). We mixed leaves from the same treatment and stored them at 4 °C for the beetle bioassay. Then, we harvested plants, rinsed roots to remove soil, and counted 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> root knots. We dried plants at 80 °C for 48 h and weighed them.
