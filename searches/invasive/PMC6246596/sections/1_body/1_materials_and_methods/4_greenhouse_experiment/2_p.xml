<p id="Par14">One week later, we transplanted individually into pots similar-sized 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> plants that we had cultivated by putting cut stems into sterilized soil in a greenhouse. We only used 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> collected from local populations (near Wuhan Botanical Garden, middle latitude, 30.5 °N) to minimize potential impacts of plant genetic and/or maternally inherited variation on experimental results. The experiment had 240 pots: 15 soil collection sites × 2 soil types (rhizosphere of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> vs. rhizosphere of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>) × 2 plant species (
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> vs. 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>) × 4 replicates. Throughout the experiment, we watered plants weekly with filtered water (particles with diameter &gt; 0.1 µm were removed).
