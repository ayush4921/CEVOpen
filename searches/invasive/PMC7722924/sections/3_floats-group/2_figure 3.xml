  <p>Asymptotic growth rates of full models increase with increases in the spatial factor, while other rates are invariant of the factor. Gray triangles, red squares, and blue circles indicate asymptotic growth rates estimated from realizations with source-mediated-dispersal, destination-mediated-dispersal, and source–destination-mediated-dispersal models, respectively. The open circle at a unit spatial factor represents a model without any spatial heterogeneities. Solid lines indicate theoretical growth rates with (blue) and without (gray) influence of spatial factors.</p>
