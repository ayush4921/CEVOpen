<p id="Par6">Simultaneously (particularly in cases of accidental transfers), we can expect human-mediated dispersal sources in areas of high human activity. Therefore, urban areas with higher frequencies of dispersal vectors may be associated with increased dispersal of invasive species, both incoming and outgoing. Such twofold effects of vector density have been integrated into models that explicitly consider the flow of dispersers

 </sup>, while other models consider only one side of these effects. By comparing models with and without both effects in the same framework, we can identify qualitative differences between these two types of modeling strategies.
