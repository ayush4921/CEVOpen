<p id="Par3">Dispersal is an important factor in determining a species’ spatial distribution. The dispersal is often characterized by a dispersal kernel, which is a probability distribution of dispersal success by distance. Dispersal with exponentially bounded tail of the dispersal kernel implies finite range expansion velocities
