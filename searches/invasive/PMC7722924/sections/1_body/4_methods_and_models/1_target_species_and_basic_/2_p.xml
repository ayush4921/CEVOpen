<p id="Par21">We estimated the population size of the invader species as the area covered by any of these sub-populations in the study area. This simple measure of the population size was based on our assumption that the inside of a sub-population is homogeneous and these sub-populations vary only in their positions, sizes, and shapes. This assumption may oversimplify spatial architectures of the sub-populations, because even clonal colonies of perennial plants often have concentric structures that can influence reproductive output
