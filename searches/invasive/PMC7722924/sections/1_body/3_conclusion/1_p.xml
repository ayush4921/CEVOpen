<p id="Par19">Our modeling emphasizes the importance of the basic assumptions regarding how propagules of invader species interact with vectors mediating long-distance dispersal. Different types of interactions can lead to qualitatively different conclusions when considering population dynamics produced by spatially heterogeneous distributions of vectors. These models and results bridge the gap between discrepancies between strategies, helping to drive decisions to focus on edge 
 <italic>versus</italic> core populations (a result of using two different stems of modeling frameworks). From the present result, we conclude that clamped spatial distribution of a human population can accelerate invasive species’ range expansion after establishment, if the human-population density influences both starting and ending locations of the invader species’ dispersal (e.g., accidental transfer by vehicles). This outcome will facilitate a better mechanistic understanding of how different types of vectors influence invasive species’ spread, and support the development of robust models to predict their future expansions.
