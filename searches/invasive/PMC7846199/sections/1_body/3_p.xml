<p>As the non-recombining region spreads, further degeneration is accompanied with an accumulation of transposable elements (TEs), duplications, and other mutations, leading to an increase in DNA content of the Y chromosome (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Ming, Bendahmane, and Renner 2011</xref>). In plant species with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the Y chromosome is therefore usually bigger than their X counterpart (

 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al. 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sousa, Fuchs, and Renner 2013</xref>). Progressing degeneration can finally lead to massive gene loss in the Y chromosome and eventually a shrinkage of the sex chromosome. This last step is common in mammals (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Graves 2006</xref>) and has been observed in plants (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abraham and Mathew 1962</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Segawa, Kishi, and Tatuno 1971</xref>), but appears to be less frequent (
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bachtrog 2013</xref>). The above-described signature of progressive sex chromosome evolution allows the identification of the evolutionary stage of sex determination from genomic data.
