<p>Few weedy 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> species are receiving increasing attention for their rapid evolution and spread of herbicide resistance (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kreiner et al. 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Molin et al. 2020</xref>). The dioecious 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> L. is native to North America (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Sauer 1957</xref>) and is one of the most devastating weeds in US agriculture (

 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Riar et al. 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> has evolved resistance to 8 different classes of herbicides (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.weedscience.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.weedscience.com</ext-link>) and is capable of producing copious amounts of seeds (up to 600 000 per plant) (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Ward, Webster, and Steckel 2013</xref>). Understanding the reproductive system and the sex determination of the species could help to develop agronomic strategies to decrease weed populations and mitigate herbicide resistances. Cytological analysis has shown that the chromosomes of male and female 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> plants do not show heteromorphism (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Grant 1959</xref>), suggesting an early stage of the evolution of dioecy in the species. Recent work using molecular markers suggested a genetic basis for sex determination in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic>. However, due to low data quality and non-reproducible analyses, no inference of the evolutionary state of sex determination could be made (
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery et al. 2019</xref>).
