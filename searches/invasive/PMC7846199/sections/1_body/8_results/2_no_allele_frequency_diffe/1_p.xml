<p>Given the lack of cytological evidence for heteromorphic sex chromosomes in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Grant 1959</xref>), we tested whether sex determination in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> could be controlled by a specific small and still recombining region, located on an autosome. To assess this possibility, we called biallelic SNPs and compared allele frequencies between the male and female pools of the 2 populations and tested for frequency differences. We aligned raw reads to the high-quality chromosome level assembly of the hermaphrodite 
 <italic>A. hypochondiracus</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Lightfoot et al. 2017</xref>). Overall, reads mapped to the reference genome with 90.54% to 92.55% uniquely mapped reads, indicating a high similarity between the genomes of the 2 species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Yet, a large number of read pairs showed non-proper paring, indicating structural differences between the genomes.
