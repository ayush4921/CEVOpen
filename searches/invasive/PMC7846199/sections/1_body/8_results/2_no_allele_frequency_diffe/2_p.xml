<p>Sex determining loci in the genome are expected to lead to significant allele frequency differences between male and female pools. We used the Gâ€™ method implemented in QTLseqR to scan the first 16 Scaffolds of the reference genome, representing the 16 chromosomes of 
 <italic>A. hypochondriacus</italic>, for significant differences in allele frequencies. Using over 12 million biallelic sites (3.2 million after filtering), distributed across the genome, we found no significant allele frequency differences between male and female pools in either of the 2 populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Allele frequency differences between sexes were very low across the whole aligned genome sequence.
