<p>The availability of a recent draft sequence of a male 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> individual (
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery et al. 2020</xref>) allowed us place our male-specific region and extract a potential Y chromosome. We first aligned the assembled male-specific contigs to the draft sequence. Of the 5774 contigs 55% properly aligned to the draft genome and covered a total of 617,820 bp on the draft sequence. Of all mapped male-specific base pairs that aligned, 89% mapped to a single scaffold, scaffold 20. The male-specific sequence covered 26% (510,926 bp) of bp on that scaffold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and localized to a region between 0.5 Mbp and 1.9 Mbp. The first quarter of that scaffold was not covered by male-specific contigs. Other sequences mapped across 41 of the 303 scaffolds and covered less than 10% of other scaffolds.
