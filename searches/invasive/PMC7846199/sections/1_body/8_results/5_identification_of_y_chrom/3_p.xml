<p>In addition to the assembled contigs, we directly mapped sex-specific reads extracted after k-mer filtering. Again, the great majority (91%) of male-specific reads, mapped to scaffold 20, covering 22% (428,904) of this scaffold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The reads covered a similar area of scaffold 20 as the mapping of the assembled contigs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Female-specific reads only covered 501 bp on the draft sequence and 63% mapped to scaffold 20 and covered 308 bp (0.2%) and 24 % to scaffold 4 covering 125 bp of the 22 Mb scaffold.
