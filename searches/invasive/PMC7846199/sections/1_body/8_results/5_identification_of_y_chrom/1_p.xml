<p>We extracted all reads with identified male-specific k-mers from the original read data to assemble the male-specific genome region. Only k-mers that were classified as male-specific in both populations were used for the extraction of reads. The assembly process resulted in 5774 contigs, which together consisted of 2,002,103 bp. The shortest contig was 151 bp long and the longest scaffold was 11,654 bp long (
