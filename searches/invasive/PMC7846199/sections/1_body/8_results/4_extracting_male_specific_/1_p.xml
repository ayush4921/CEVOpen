<p>To evaluate the age of male-specific regions and the parallelism between dioecious 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> species, we extracted reads with our set of male-specific k-mers from whole-genome sequencing data of 
 <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic> individuals (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kreiner et al. 2019</xref>), another dioecious 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> species, and compared the number of extracted reads (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We found no significant difference between male and female individuals, suggesting that different genomic regions control dioecy in 
 <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic>.
