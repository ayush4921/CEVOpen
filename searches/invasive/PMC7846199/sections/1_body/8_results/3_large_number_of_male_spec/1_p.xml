<p>Comparing allele frequency differences requires the successful alignment of reads to the reference genome. However, sequencing reads from diverged sex-specific sequences are unlikely to align to the hermaphrodite reference genome as they accumulate large numbers of mutations (

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 2013</xref>). To test whether a larger, non-recombining, region could be responsible for sex determination in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic>, we compared alignment-free k-mer counts of male and female pools. We recovered all 35-mers (in the following referred to as k-mers) from the sequencing reads and counted the occurrences of these k-mers for each pool. Low frequency (≤15) and high frequency (≥2000) were discarded from the analysis as they potentially represent sequencing errors and repeat regions. We identified over 1.3 billion (1,329,452,869) male and over 1.2 billion (1,235,093,537) female k-mers that passed out filters and were used for further analysis. We compared k-mer counts of the male and female pools from the California population to find k-mers that strongly deviated from the expected equal frequency in male and female pools (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, most k-mers were present in comparable numbers within males and females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We found 1,634,859 k-mers that were not present in females (15≥ 
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 2000), but had a count between 50 and 500 in the male pool. We used the Kansas population to obtain the most robust set of specific k-mers. That is, we counted and identified sex specific k-mers for the California population in the Kansas population. We further filtered male (or female) specific k-mers for a minimum count of 50 and a maximum of 500 in the Kansas pool (or female). To be considered sex-specific, we further required a count below 20 k-mers in the female (or male) Kansas pool. After these stringent filters, we found 158,693 robust male-specific k-mers, which represent 9.7 % of all male-specific k-mers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We also found a low number of female-specific k-mers (269,157) in the Californian population. After correction with the Kansas population, we find 2,572 female-specific k-mers (1.0%, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These include few k-mers, that are present over 2000 times in the male pools and therefore not counted in males.
