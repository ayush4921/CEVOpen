<p>We applied high depth whole genome sequencing to 4 pools of 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> from 2 independent wild populations, separated by sex (i.e., 2 populations Ã— 2 sexes). The pools consisted of combined leaf samples of 35 male and 32 female individuals from a single population collected from California, as well as 25 male and 35 female individuals from another population collected from Kansas. The per pool sequence coverage ranged from 228X to 331X (322,106,487 to 467,707,106 reads per pool), corresponding to a mean coverage of 7.5X to 9.5X per sample (
