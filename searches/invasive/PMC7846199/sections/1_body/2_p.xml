<p>Functionally, the evolution of dioecy from a cosexual ancestral state requires at least 2 mutations, 1 creating males, and 1 creating females (
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Westergaard 1958</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1978</xref>). The simultaneous emergence of both mutations is highly unlikely. Hence, full dioecy has probably evolved via intermediate states, in which some individuals are female, while the others are still cosexual (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 2016</xref>). The second mutation, which transforms the cosexual state into males by dominantly suppressing female functions, likely occurs in close linkage to the first mutation. This reduces recombination in the genomic region, as recombinant individuals would be sterile (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 2016</xref>). In the most common case, where males are the heterozygous sex, lack of recombination between X and Y chromosomes creates a male-specific region of the Y chromosome, which can further result in gene degeneration (
