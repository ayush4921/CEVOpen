<p>Within the genus 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> and its dioecious sister species 
 <italic>A. arenicola</italic> are placed in a monophyletic group (
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Stetter and Schmid 2017</xref>), in which all other species show monoecy (
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Wulff 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Costea, Sanders, and Waines 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Asha, Rekha, and Sadiq 2016</xref>). This suggests that dioecy has evolved independently within this group and is unlikely to be linked to the dioecious systems present in other 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> species. To confirm this, we compared 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> male-specific k-mers to 
 <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic> male and female individuals and found no association with sex in this species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), suggesting an independent evolution of dioecy in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic>. This result agrees with the phylogentic distance between 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic>, which both cluster with several hermaphrodite species in genome-wide phylogenetic analyses (
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Stetter and Schmid 2017</xref>), but is in contrast to the earlier taxonomic classification of the subgenus 
 <italic>acnida</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mosyakin and Robertson 1996</xref>). Based on the phylogenetic relationship the sexual dimorphism in 
 <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic> (and 
 <italic>A. australis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. floridanus</italic>) is older than dioecy in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic>.
