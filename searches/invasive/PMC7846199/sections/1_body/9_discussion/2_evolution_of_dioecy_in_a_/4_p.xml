<p>Our work constitutes the first step in understanding the underlying processes of sex determination in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic>, but the exact mechanisms and a potential interaction with environmental factors that has recently been suggested (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Mesgaran, Matzrafi, and Ohadi 2019</xref>) remain to be discovered. The male-specific k-mers and male-specific scaffolds of the draft genome identified here, allow to diagnose the sex of individuals in early developmental stages. This permits future studies of environmental dependent sex alteration, as it will allow to distinguish between “genetic” sex and expressed sex of an individual plant. Furthermore, the assembled 2 Mb male-specific region in combination with the identified candidate Y chromosome can be used to fully assemble the 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> Y chromosome. The different age and independence of dioecy evolution within the 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> genus, make them a compelling system to understand the emergence of sexual dimorphism in plants. Further understanding of the sex determination in this invasive weed, can help develop novel ecological methods (e.g., shifting sex) to disrupt seed production in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> and hence reduce the impact of this invasive weed in cropping system.
