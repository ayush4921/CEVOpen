<p>The different stages of sex chromosome evolution may give us insight into the question as to when dioecy has evolved in a species. For example, in the wild strawberry, 
 <italic>Fragaria virginiana</italic> male individuals coexist with females and hermaphrodites. Full dioecy is not yet evolved and the sex-determining regions recombine to create unisexuals, hermaphrodites, and even neuters (
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Spigler et al. 2008</xref>). This early stage of sex chromosome evolution indicates that the separation of sexes is rather young, whereas, the sex chromosomes in mammals and birds are very old (

 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. 2014</xref>). The Y (mammals) and W (birds) chromosomes of the heterogametic individuals of these taxa have undergone gene loss processes and finally became smaller than their X and Z chromosomes, respectively. Most heteromorphic sex chromosomes in flowering plants are increased in size as they accumulated TEs and other repetitive sequences. It is assumed, that this stage precedes gene loss (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Ming, Bendahmane, and Renner 2011</xref>). Our results show that the male-specific region in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> is strongly diverged from the X region and spans around two-thirds of scaffold 20, whilst cytological studies have not found a dimorphism between X and Y (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Grant 1959</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> is at an early or intermediate stage of sex chromosome evolution.
