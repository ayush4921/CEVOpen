<p>The emergence of sex chromosomes is an evolutionary process that starts with the occurrence of single mutations leading to unisexual individuals and ultimately giving rise to highly heteromorphic chromosomes. Our results show that the genome of 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> harbors a male-specific region, genetically controlling the sex determination. The allocation of over 90% of male-specific reads to one part of a single scaffold (scaffold 20) suggests that the male-specific region does not recombine anymore with the analogous region on the X chromosome and has diverged sufficiently to not align to the hermaphrodite relative. The lack of alignment to the 
 <italic>A. hypochondriacus</italic> reference sequence consequently did not allow to detect allele frequency differences between pools. Although the male sequence is strongly diverged leading to recombination suppression between male and female chromosomes in the male-specific region, an accumulation of large amounts of repetitive sequences seems to not have occurred, as it would have led to an increase in chromosome size that could be cytologically identified. Such a cytological difference has not been observed in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> (
