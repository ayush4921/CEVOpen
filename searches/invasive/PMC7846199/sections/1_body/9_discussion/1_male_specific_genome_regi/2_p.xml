<p>To further characterize the evolutionary state of sex determination in the species, we estimated the size of the male-specific region. Our assembly of the region suggests approximately 2 Mb. This size likely underestimates the true size of the male-specific region. Our filtering removes highly redundant k-mers, as created by TEs (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Michael 2014</xref>). Repetitive sequence is also present in other parts of the genome and would therefore not be classified as males specific. The high number of contigs potentially results from gaps due to non-specificity of the sequence, however, the stringent filtering across 2 independent populations revealed high confidence sequence specific to male individuals. The alignment of our assembly to the recent draft genome sequence even allowed us to identify a single scaffold as the potential Y chromosome. The aligned male-specific regions span approximately 1.5 Mb, although not all sequence is in the region is covered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The gaps between male-specific regions are likely regions that are not strongly diverged from the X chromosome and therefore not male-specific.
