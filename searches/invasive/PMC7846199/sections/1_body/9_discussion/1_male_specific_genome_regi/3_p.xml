<p>In contrast to the male-specific k-mers, almost all female-specific k-mers found in the California sample were removed after filtering for overlaps with the Kansas population and female-specifc reads only covered very small regions of the draft sequence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). This confirms an XY system for 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> as found by male-specific k-mers. However, a very low number of apparently female-specific k-mers persisted after filtering and map to a small number of scaffolds in the 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> genome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Their low number and the fact that only a total of 501 bp are covered by such regions (mostly within the Y region) suggest them to be technical artifacts. Otherwise, they might be involved in female reproductive functions and could be further analyzed in molecular studies.
