<p>The separation of sexes is observed in many animal and plant species, but while it is the norm in animals it is very rare in plants (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bachtrog et al. 2014</xref>). In most angiosperms, individuals have both functional sex organs and are therefore either hermaphrodite, that is, having flowers comprising the reproductive organs of both sexes, or they are monoecious, where each plant carries distinct male and female flowers. However, in a small number of plant species (â‰ˆ6% of known angiosperms; 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Renner 2014</xref>) the female and male functions are harbored on separate individuals, that is, they are dioecious (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 2016</xref>). Although rare, this breeding system has evolved independently in numerous taxonomic groups with 50% of plant families having at least 1 dioecious species (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Renner 2014</xref>). A potential evolutionary advantage of dioecy over cosexuality is the avoidance of inbreeding and its resulting inbreeding depression. In addition, it allows the efficient allocation of resources to specialized functions of the respective sex (
