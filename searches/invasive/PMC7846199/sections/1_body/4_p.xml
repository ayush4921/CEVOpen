<p>The genus 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> comprises over 40 species (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Sauer 1957</xref>), including crops grown for grains and vegetables (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al. 2018</xref>), as well as many invasive weeds of agricultural and natural systems (e.g., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Rowland, Murray, and Verhalen 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bensch, Horak, and Peterson 2003</xref>). Most 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> species are monoecious, while a few species exhibit a dioecious breeding system. In early classifications, dioecious 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> species were grouped into a single subgenus (
 <italic>Acnida</italic>) based on their reproductive system (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mosyakin and Robertson 1996</xref>). Genome-wide phylogenetic work, however, indicated that these species cluster with monoecious species in distinct clades (
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Stetter and Schmid 2017</xref>). Hence, dioecy probably evolved multiple times independently within the 
 <italic>Amaranthus</italic> genus.
