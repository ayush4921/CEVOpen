<p>Sex determination in dioecious plants can be environmentally or genetically controlled (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Korpelainen 1998</xref>). The genetic control of sex determination in plants ranges from few individual genes (

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sousa, Fuchs, and Renner 2013</xref>). Most heteromorphic systems are XY male and XX female, but female-specific sex chromosomes (ZW) also exist, for example, in

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Pucholt, Rönnberg-Wästljung, and Berlin 2015</xref>). Although the genetic control of dioecy has been studied in several species, the determination of sex and the evolutionary forces driving sexual dimorphism are not well understood.
