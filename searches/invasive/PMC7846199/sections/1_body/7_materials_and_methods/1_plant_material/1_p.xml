 <italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> seeds of 2 independent populations from California and Kansas were used. Seeds of 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> from California (CA) and Kansas (KS) were cordially provided by Dr. Anil Shrestha (California State University, Fresno, California) and Dr. Dallas E. Peterson (Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas), respectively. We grew seeds from the 2 populations under controlled conditions in the greenhouse in Davis, Caliofonia, United States, in the summer of 2018. About 10 seeds were germinated in each plastic pot (2.37 L), filled with a soil mix (1:1 sand/peat) plus a controlled-release fertilizer (15–9–12, 150 g 75 L
 <sup>–1</sup>; Scotts Osmocote® PLUS). Plants were grown in a greenhouse with a temperature of 32/22ºC (day/night) and a day length of 16 h provided through supplementary lighting. Seedling were thinned randomly several times to obtain one plant per pot by their 4-leaf stage. Plants were irrigated through 4 emitters inserted into the potting medium to deliver 65 mL of water min-1 for 2 min and twice per day (7:00 am and 2:00 pm). We collected equal amounts of leaf tissue (3 disks of 5 mm diameter) of each plant once the plants were flowering and the sex could be visually determined. We pooled the leaf samples of 35 male and 32 female plants from California and 25 male and 35 female plants from Kansas for DNA extraction, creating a total of 4 pools (2 male and 2 female).
