<p>We extracted DNA from lyophilized and homogenized tissue using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences Inc, United States) and quantified DNA concentration on Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). Whole-genome sequencing libraries were prepared by the UC Davis Genome Center for DNA Technologies &amp; Expression Analysis core facility using the TruSeq DNA library kit (Illumina, United States). After quality control, the samples were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq. We assessed the data quality using fastqc (
