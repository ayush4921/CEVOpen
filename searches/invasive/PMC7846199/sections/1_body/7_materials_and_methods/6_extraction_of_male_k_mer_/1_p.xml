<p>We extracted the filtered set of male-specific k-mers from published 
 <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic> samples with known sex expression (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kreiner et al. 2019</xref>), proceeding as described above in “male-specific read recovery.” To normalize the numbers we devided the number of extracted reads by the total number of sequenced reads.
