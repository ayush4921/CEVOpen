<p>For the reference-free comparison between male and female individuals we counted unique k-mers in the male and female pool from California. We first trimmed the reads based on their quality using trimmomatic (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Bolger, Lohse, and Usadel 2014</xref>) with the parameters: SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:35 LEADING:5 TRAILING:5, before counting the occurrences 35-mers in the quality trimmed sequencing reads from female and male pools separately, keeping only k-mers with a frequency between 15 and 2000 using Jellyfish v 2.3.0 (
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Marçais and Kingsford 2011</xref>). We combined the male and female counts to identify sex specific k-mers using custom scripts (

We further, counted sex specific k-mers identified in the Californian population in the pools of the Kansas population using jellyfish query. To further generate the most robust set of k-mers, we filtered sex specific k-mers requiring a k-mer to have a count ≥ 50 but ≤ 500 within the focal Kansas (e.g., female pool for female-specific) and ≤ 20 in the Kansas opposite pool (e.g., male pool for female-specific)
