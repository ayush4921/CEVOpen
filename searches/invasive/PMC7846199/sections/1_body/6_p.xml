<p>In this study, we evaluated the evolutionary state of dioecy in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> to understand the genetic control and evolution of the separation of reproductive organs in plants. We show that dioecy in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> is controlled by a male-specific genome region suggesting an XY system. We use high depth whole genome sequencing to distinguish between a sex gene system and male-specific regions. Our high depth whole genome sequencing data allowed us to assemble a 2 Mb sex-specific region that could not be identified through allele frequency differences when aligned to a hermaphrodite relative. Alignment of our sex-specific region to a fragmented draft genome of the species identified parts of a 2 Mb scaffold as sex-specific suggesting the ongoing evolution of a non-recombining male-specific Y chromosome in 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic>.
