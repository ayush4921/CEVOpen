  <p>Differences in allele frequencies between male and female pools of the California population along the genome, relative to the 
   <italic>A. hypochondiracus</italic> reference. Positive values would represent an increased frequency of the male allele, while negative an increased frequency of the female frequency. Red and blue lines represent 95% and 99% confidence intervals for frequency outliers.
