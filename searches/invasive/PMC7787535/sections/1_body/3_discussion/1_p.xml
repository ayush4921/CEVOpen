<p>These 80 questions constitute a robust research agenda in response to the 
 <italic>UK Biological Security Strategy</italic> (2018). The questions in each topic can be clustered into understanding the nature of the threats—including their spread and impacts, assessing existing actions, and exploring the most effective management and mitigation options. They largely focus on better comprehending the problems and mapping out the most effective solutions. The categories covers the spectrum of biological threats identified by the 
 <italic>Strategy</italic>—natural, accidental, and deliberate—and cut across its four pillars. This makes both these focal areas, and the important, neglected research questions under each, a effective guide for implementing the 
 <italic>Strategy</italic>.
