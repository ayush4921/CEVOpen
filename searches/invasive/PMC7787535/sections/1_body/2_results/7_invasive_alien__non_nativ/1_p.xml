<p>Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are widely considered to be one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and are estimated to cost the UK economy at least £1.7 billion annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, invasive parasites and pathogens, which may be introduced with alien host species, are known to threaten human health, native wildlife, fisheries, forestry and food security [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We use IAS to encompass non-native animals, plants and parasites/pathogens. The number of alien species establishing in the UK and globally is increasing [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], in tandem with increasing globalization and associated trade [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Expansion of transport networks, advances in technology, global environmental change, and geopolitical factors are introducing new risks, vectors and pathways [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Successful management of IAS in the UK and Overseas Territories requires effective horizon-scanning programmes [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], risk analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], well-directed surveillance and monitoring schemes, and evidence-based response plans [

 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241190.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The questions range from investigating the transport, introduction, establishment and spread of IAS (questions 53–57), to analysing and predicting potential impacts (questions 58–60), assessing existing and past actions (questions 61–63), and developing effective management practices (questions 64–67).
