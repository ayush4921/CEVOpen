<p>Instead of using many individual variables that are standard proxies for the effects of human activities, we used a single comprehensive index, the human footprint index, as the effect of human activities on nature. The index is compiled from several human activity layers such as human population density, land use, and human access, and then normalized by biome (Sanderson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The index ranges from 0 (natural areas) to 100% (completely transformed areas). The detailed information on the human footprint index can be found in Ref. (Guo et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The human footprint index for each sample was derived from the Global Human Footprint Dataset (v. 2, 1995–2004) (Wildlife Conservation Society—WCS, and Center for International Earth Science Information Network—CIESIN—Columbia University,
