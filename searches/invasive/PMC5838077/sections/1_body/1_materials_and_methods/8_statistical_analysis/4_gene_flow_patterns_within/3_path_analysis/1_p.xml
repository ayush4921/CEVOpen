<p>Path analyses were used to quantify the relative contributions of geographical distance (IBD), bioclimatic environmental dissimilarity (IBE), and human influence distance (IBH) to the genetic structure within each range and between ranges (NA invasive vs. EU native) (Wang et al.,

As a statistical framework for evaluating complex relationships between multiple variables, path analysis uses a series of regression and model‐fitting analyses to calculate the correspondence of a priori defined relationships among variables simultaneously, and can provide the standardized coefficients indicating the magnitudes of the relationships between variables (Grace,
