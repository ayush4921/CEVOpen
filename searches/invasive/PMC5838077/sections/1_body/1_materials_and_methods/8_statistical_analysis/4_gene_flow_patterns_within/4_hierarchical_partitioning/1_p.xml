<p>We also analyzed the independent effect of geography, bioclimatic environment, and human influence on genetic distances via independent effect analysis (hierarchical partitioning) for between and within the European and North American ranges. As a method of multiple regression, independent effect analysis estimates the average contribution of each explanatory variable to the variance of the response variable by testing all possible models that represent a subset of the explanatory variables (Chu et al.,
