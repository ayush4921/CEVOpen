 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Sequences were aligned manually with BioEdit v. 7.1.3.0 (Hall,

 <italic>rbc</italic>L‐
 <italic>psa</italic>I region) of which 92 are NA invasive and 74 are EU native, and 20 samples are native North American haplotypes (haplotypes A, AB, AC, E, H) (NA native) (Saltonstall,

 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). For consistency, we removed the EU samples with sequences different from those of the invasive population in North America, that is, from haplotype M. In total, we included 186 samples in the study. (Detailed information about coordinate and haplotype of each sample is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="ece33869-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>.) The samples of NA native lineages were used as an outgroup to evaluate the extent of differentiation between EU native and NA invasive and rule out hybridization as a factor that could have a strong spatial, as well as evolutionary, impact on the genetic structure in North America. Although hybridization between NA native and NA invasive occurs, very few hybrids have been detected in wild populations so far (e.g., Meyerson, Lambertini, McCormick, &amp; Whigham,
