<p>The resulting two presence/absence matrices (one for AFLPs and one for microsatellites) consisted of 244 polymorphic AFLP loci from the two primer pairs and 50 binary loci from the six microsatellites markers. We analyzed the genetic structure resulting from the two datasets both separately and by pooling the data together. As the outputs of the three analyses were similar, we combined the two molecular matrices in one single matrix of 294 markers to increase the resolution of our dataset following Kettenring and Mock (
