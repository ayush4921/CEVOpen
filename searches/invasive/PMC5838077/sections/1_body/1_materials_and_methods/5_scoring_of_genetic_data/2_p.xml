<p>Genotyping of the AFLP markers was performed in three steps. The aligned peaks were analyzed semiautomatically with GeneMarker v. 2.6.3 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA), with the criteria of peak smooth, peak saturation, baseline subtraction, Local Southern sizing method, in the size range of 50–500 base pairs (bp). The fragments with peak height lower than 50 relative fluorescence units (rfu) were not scored due to the possibility of instrument error (Arrigo, Tuszynski, Ehrich, Gerdes, &amp; Alvarez,

 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The un‐normalized peak height data were then imported into 
 <italic>RawGeno</italic> v. 2.0.1 (Arrigo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), an R package (R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) for binning and scoring AFLP fragments. The maximum bin size was set to 2 bp, the minimum bin size to 1.5 bp, the scoring range was set from 50 to 500 bp, and the minimum peak height threshold was 100 rfu to eliminate low‐intensity peaks. The raw peak heights and loci size tables from 
 <italic>RawGeno</italic> were combined into one table to produce the input matrix of the marker selection algorithm 
 <italic>scanAFLP</italic> v. 1.3 (Herrmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The genotyping analysis in 
 <italic>scanAFLP</italic> estimated an error rate of 4.47% for primer pair E‐ACT + M‐CTT and of 1.75% for primer pair E‐CAG + M‐ATG. Both errors are within the typical error range of AFLP data (Bonin et al.,
