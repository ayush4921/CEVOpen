<p>The allele sizes of the microsatellite loci were aligned automatically with GeneMarker v. 2.6.3 (SoftGenetics), using GeneScan 500 size standard as a size reference. The obtained alignment was checked manually with Geneious R6 v. 6.0.6 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). As 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> is a polyploid species (2n ranges from 4× to 12×) (Clevering &amp; Lissner, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>), and each locus can have a variable number of alleles, it is difficult to resolve allele dosage. We therefore scored the presence/absence of the microsatellite alleles in a binary matrix (a matrix of ones and zeros, treating each allele as a locus) (Lambertini, Mendelssohn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). There were two alleles of two samples that were uncertain so we conservatively scored both of them as absent (0 s).
