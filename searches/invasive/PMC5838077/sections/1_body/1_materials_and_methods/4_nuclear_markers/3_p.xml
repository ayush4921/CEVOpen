<p>The AFLP protocol was adapted from Vos et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). Restriction digestion and adapter ligation were performed simultaneously on 100 ng of genomic DNA, with 2.5 units of restriction enzymes EcoRI and of MseI for each, and 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase to ligate 5 pmol EcoRI and 50 pmol MseI double‐stranded nucleotide adapters. Digestion and ligation were performed in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC‐200, programmed for 4 hr at 37°C followed by a 0.1°C/s decrease to 16°C in 2 hr, then 70°C for 10 min. The ligated DNA was used for preamplification after four‐time dilution. Preamplification and selective amplification were performed in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC‐200. Preamplification was programmed for 20 cycles, each with 30 s DNA denaturation at 94°C, 1 min primer annealing at 56°C, and 1 min DNA extension at 72°C. Selective amplification was programmed at 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s decreased by 0.7°C/cycle for the subsequent 12 cycles, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 23 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min.
