 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Twenty ng of DNA was added to 18 μl mastermix consisting of 10 μl 2xMasermix (VWR International, Arlington Heights, IL, USA), 10 pmol forward and reverse primers, and sterile water to reach the final volume of 20 μl. Amplification was run in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC‐200 under the following conditions: 94°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, annealing temperature for 40 s, 72°C for 40 s, followed by 72°C for 7 min. Annealing temperatures were as follows: 54°C for 
 <italic>paGT</italic> 4; 50°C for primers 
 <italic>paGT</italic> 8, 
 <italic>paGT</italic> 9, 
 <italic>paGT</italic> 13, 56°C for Phra 93, and 60°C for Phra 125.
