 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All samples were obtained from apical leaves (second leaf or third leaf from the top) and stored separately in bags with silica gel. About 0.5 square centimeters of dry leaf tissue was ground in a mortar with liquid nitrogen, and DNA was extracted with the E.Z.N.A.
