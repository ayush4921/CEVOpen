<p>Novel environmental conditions in the introduced range may act as strong selection forces on some introduced species and lead to rapid evolution within the time frame of centuries or even decades (Colautti &amp; Lau, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The lack of frequent gene flow between the native and introduced ranges of the introduced population due to isolation also tends to cause genetic differentiation between ranges, and may eventually lead to allopatric speciation (Bouton, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Endler, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>; Taylor &amp; McPhail, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Using samples of the 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> haplotype M lineage from its introduced and native ranges, we found that the invasive North American and native European populations genetically diverged, although they still share the majority of their alleles. This result was confirmed by all analyses performed, that is, DAPC and STRUCTURE, with both IBD and IBE (represented by climate in our study) playing a role. The loss of genetic diversity due to founder effect is comparable to that calculated by Dlugosch and Parker (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) in 20 invasive plant species. As shown by these authors, the diversity loss changed over time, depending on gene flow opportunities and the occurrence of multiple introductions, and tended to decrease over a timescale comparable to the introduction of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in North America. The founder effect did not have a direct effect on quantitative trait diversity and the ability of evolving adaptive potential, at least for the modest genetic diversity losses as measured by Dlugosch and Parker (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>).
