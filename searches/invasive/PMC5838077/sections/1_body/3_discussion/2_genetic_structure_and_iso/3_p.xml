<p>Sexton et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) showed that non‐native plant populations predominantly exhibit IBD and IBE patterns of gene flow due to limited dispersal ability following introduction to the new range, and local adaptation. We found significant effects of IBD on populations of the European lineage between ranges, indicating that the genetic difference between the North American and European populations resulted in part from the long‐distance transport between the two continents and from the natural barrier (the Atlantic Ocean) between them. However, we found that IBE, in our case represented by climate, was a more important mechanism than IBD in terms of contributing to the differentiation between ranges. This indicates that nonanalogous climates in the two ranges contributed more than allopatry and founder effect to the genetic differentiation of the populations in the two ranges. This is in agreement with Guo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) who found that the climatic niche had shifted between the native and introduced populations of the invasive European lineage. Niche shifts can be a potent selection force and cause rapid evolution in the new range. Guo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) found that photosynthesis‐ and growth‐related traits of the invasive North American populations became different from the ancestral European populations, possibly as a response to the new niche (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). We cannot, however, discount the possibility that the differences that we observed could also be due to introductions of different populations from Europe originating from a variety of environmental conditions. We did not find any significant relationship between the differences in human activity between the two ranges and genetic distance, which suggests that the effects of human influence on native and introduced haplotype M populations analyzed in our study did not fundamentally differ. The similarity between genotypes on the East Coast of North America and Denmark samples removed from the data analysis could erroneously be taken as an evidence of multiple introductions from Europe to North America. Because the source population of these samples is unknown, their origin must be investigated further before any conclusions can be drawn.
