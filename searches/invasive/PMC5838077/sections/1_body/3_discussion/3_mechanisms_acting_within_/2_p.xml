<p>The European lineage of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> showed different genetic structure patterns within its native and introduced ranges. In the native European range, gene structure of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations reflected a positive IBD and IBE, a classic isolation pattern shaped by dispersal distance and environmental variations common to most wild species (Sexton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Shafer &amp; Wolf, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect a significant effect of IBD in the introduced range in North America, indicating that there is no significant geographic barrier to the dispersal of the introduced genotypes. Nevertheless, the introduced populations showed a weak, yet significant negative IBE and a strong positive IBH. The negative IBE implies that gene flow among dissimilar environments, that is, areas with contrasting climates, was greater than would be expected due to random gene flow. This gene flow scenario has previously been defined as a counter‐gradient gene flow and can be caused by directional gene flow, usually due to human infrastructure, which can interconnect populations that would otherwise be isolated because of distance or ecology (Kirkpatrick &amp; Barton, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Sexton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Considering the strong positive IBH in the introduced populations, the counter‐gradient gene flow could either be the result of human‐mediated dispersal along coastlines, roads, railroads, and navigable rivers, which are an important part of the human footprint index calculated in our study (Sanderson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>), or result from unintentional preselection in Europe, as the European populations from areas with high human activities can have a high chance to be selected and introduced to other ranges. Introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> can reproduce both sexually (Haslam, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>) and vegetatively and can be dispersed (via either seeds or propagules) over long distances through waterways (Kirk et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and highways (e.g., Bart et al.,
