<p>The invasive populations of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in North America have evolved from their ancestral populations in Europe. A different climate in the two ranges contributes the most to the genetic differentiation of the two populations, followed by geographic isolation. Within the two ranges, geographic distances, climatic variation, and human impact have shaped the genetic patterns differently. In the native range in Europe, the population structure has been shaped since postglacial colonization (e.g., Ingrouille, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>), mainly by geographic barriers and climatic variation, whereas in the introduced range in North America, human‐made habitats have prevented IBD from having an effect on structuring the populations, and facilitated counter‐gradient gene flow. Because of the strong IBE between the native and introduced range, despite counter‐gradient gene flow within the introduced range, the evolutionary scenario that better explains the invasion in North America is that of rapid post‐introduction evolution of founding populations, possibly by genetic drift, founder effects, Allee effect and local adaptation to climate and human‐made habitats, and dispersal of adapted genotypes throughout the continent. More in‐depth sampling and research are needed to investigate the roles of preadaptation, multiple introductions, and interactions with the existing communities, factors which can also contribute to the observed spatial patterns.
