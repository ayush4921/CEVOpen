<p>The IBD revealed a significant positive relationship between geographic and genetic distances (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>.001) for the EU native but not for the NA invasive (
 <italic>p </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>.23) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results were corroborated also by path analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b–d). Path analysis found significantly positive IBD and IBE for EU native (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), and a negative IBE and a positive IBH for NA invasive (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). When we considered NA invasive versus EU native, the path analysis showed positively significant effects of both IBD and IBE, and the coefficient of IBE was 2.6 times higher than that of IBD (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Hierarchical partitioning analysis also showed that bioclimatic distances (
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>Bio</sub>) contributed most (86% of the total variation) to the genetic distances between native and introduced ranges, while within EU native and NA invasive populations, geographic distances (
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>Geo</sub>) and human footprint distances (
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>HFP</sub>) were the primary contributors to the genetic distance within population, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d).
