 <xref rid="ece33869-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>a). In addition to the original three groups of NA native, NA invasive, and EU native, DAPC resolved a fourth common ancestral group for eight individuals collected in Denmark and the East Coast of North America (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). After removing the native North American samples, DAPC constantly found three ancestral groups for the haplotype M samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b; Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33869-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="ece33869-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>b), while STRUCTURE revealed a structure (
 <italic>K </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>2) corresponding to NA invasive and EU native and a substructure (
 <italic>K </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>3) in agreement with DAPC (Figure

 <xref rid="ece33869-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>d). Both STRUCTURE and DAPC analyses certified that the native North American samples had a distinct origin compared to haplotype M samples, and EU native and NA invasive had a common ancestor. Both analyses identified also a new third group within haplotype M consisting of the eight samples from Denmark and the East Coast of North America (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33869-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Given the small number of samples and the new discovery of this group, these eight genotypes were removed for further analysis to decrease the bias in the isolation patterns investigated in our study. After removing the divergent genotypes, NA invasive shared 68% for SSR alleles and 86% of AFLP alleles with EU native and had lower, although comparable, genetic diversity to EU native (Table
