<p>Using a representative set of samples from the North American and European ranges, we investigated the spatial genetic structure variation patterns within and between the introduced North American (haplotype M, hereafter “NA invasive”) and native European (haplotype M, hereafter “EU native”) populations using microsatellite (SSR) and AFLP markers. Specifically, we asked the following questions: (1) How are populations genetically structured in the native and introduced ranges and do their patterns differ? and (2) How are spatial genetic patterns influenced by geographical distance, climatic variation, and different intensities of human activities within and between ranges?</p>
