<p>Landscape factors, such as geographic corridors and barriers, and other environmental conditions, have a strong influence on gene flow as they create, or constrain, dispersal and establishment opportunities, and shape the spatial genetic variation accordingly. Two mechanisms, isolation by distance (IBD, Jenkins et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Wright, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">1943</xref>) and isolation by environment (IBE, Wang &amp; Bradburd, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) have been proposed to explain the spatial variation patterns of plants (Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Because of IBD, the differentiation among populations is predicted to increase with increasing geographic distance due to limited gene exchange and different selection forces (Sexton, Hangartner, &amp; Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Wright, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">1943</xref>). Based on IBE prediction, populations exchange genes more frequently with populations from the similar conditions than with those from different environments, and experience the same selection pressures and evolve concurrently by local adaptation (Sexton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). IBD and IBE are not two mutually exclusive mechanisms, as the geographic distance and environmental distance are often correlated (Shafer &amp; Wolf, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and play an important role both in native (e.g., the review by Sexton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and introduced species (Alexander, Poll, Dietz, &amp; Edwards, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Cao, Wei, Hoffmann, Wen, &amp; Chen, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Henry et al.,
