<p>In this study, we used the common reed, 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin. ex. Steud., to identify the relative contributions of geographic, environmental, and anthropogenic factors to the formation of the patterns of spatial genetic variation. 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> is a wetland perennial grass with a worldwide distribution (Clevering &amp; Lissner, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Guo, Lambertini, Li, Meyerson, &amp; Brix, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In the last several decades, 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> dramatically expanded its distribution in North America (Chambers, Meyerson, &amp; Saltonstall, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Meyerson, Viola, &amp; Brown, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Saltonstall, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The genetic work of Saltonstall (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) showed that the expansion is due to the introduction of a European lineage, haplotype M, which first appeared in the North America herbarium record ~150 years ago, and has outcompeted the native 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineage throughout the continent. Lambertini, Mendelssohn et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and Lambertini, Sorrell, Riis, Olesen, and Brix (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) documented genetic differentiation between the introduced North American and native European populations, and with common garden experiments, Guo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) revealed that post‐introduction evolution occurred with the invasion, and Pyšek et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) identified the differences in genome size as a key trait associated with invasiveness of the common reed populations. In addition, many studies have shown that the establishment of the introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> European lineage in North America is associated with physically disturbed habitats (Bart, Burdick, Chambers, &amp; Hartman, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Meyerson, Saltonstall, &amp; Chambers, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Saltonstall, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) and human activities, in particular the occurrence of highways (Jodoin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Lelong, Lavoie, Jodoin, &amp; Belzile, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Guo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) detected that human activities have a stronger effect than climate on the distribution of the invasive lineage in North America. Geographic isolation due to the Atlantic Ocean separating the native and introduced ranges could cause strong IBD, and different climates (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) could also produce significant IBE between the two ranges. Meanwhile, the strong signal of human activities on 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> distribution and dispersal can mediate these two patterns via IBH. 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> thus provides an ideal model to study the evolutionary mechanisms involved in plant invasions (Eller et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Meyerson, Cronin, &amp; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ece33869-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
