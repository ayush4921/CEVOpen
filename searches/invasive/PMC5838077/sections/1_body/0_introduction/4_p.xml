<p>Another factor that contributes to the spatial distribution of genetic diversity is anthropogenic activities. Human‐made habitats can provide windows of opportunity for the establishment of introduced species that may not find other suitable or available habitats in the introduced range (the disturbance hypothesis, Hierro et al.,

Increased globalization and worldwide trade can in fact facilitate gene exchange within the introduced range, or even between the native and introduced ranges (e.g., by multiple introductions) and can thus mitigate the effects of IBD and IBE. Similar to IBE, gene exchange/dispersal rates are higher among populations occurring in habitats shaped by similar levels of human impact because of isolation‐by‐human activities (IBH). To our knowledge, few studies have investigated the role of anthropogenic factors in gene flow patterns and the relative influence of geographic and climatic variations and human activities on the spatial genetic patterns underpinning the expansion and distribution of invasive species (Wang, Glor, &amp; Losos,
