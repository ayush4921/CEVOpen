 <caption> (a) Three‐group DAPC and STRUCTURE analyses of the molecular data for individuals of Phragmites australis; (b) two‐group (without NA native) DAPC and STRUCTURE analyses of the molecular data for individuals of P. australis; (c) substructure (STRUCTURE analyses) of the two‐group P. australis. Individuals are sorted from west to east within each population. Different colors indicate different ancestral groups. Phylogeographic groups are separated by dashed lines. Inferences of the best number of ancestral groups are shown in Figure S2 </caption>
