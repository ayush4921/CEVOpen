 <caption> Path analyses to determine the relative contributions of geography, climate, and human effects to differentiation of NA invasive from EU native (a), within EU native (b), and within NA invasive (c). D Bio, bioclimatic distance; D Geo, geographic distance; D gen, genetic distance; and D HFP, human footprint index distance. The one‐way arrow in the model indicates causal relationships, and the two‐way arrow indicates correlation. The solid red arrow represents negative path ( p &lt;  .05), solid green arrows represent positive paths ( p &lt;  .05), and dashed arrows represent nonsignificant paths ( p &gt;  .05). The numbers on the arrows are the standardized path coefficients, and the numbers in brackets are the 97.5% CIs of the coefficients. The width of the arrows is proportional to the value of the path coefficient. N, number of samples; CFI, comparative fit index; RMSEA, root mean square error of approximation (90% CI); SRMA, standardized root mean square residual. For (c) NA invasive, the model showed did not reach any evaluation criteria; however, the model did not differ from the saturated model of the data. (d) Results of the randomization tests of the independent contributions of separate predictor variables (hierarchical partitioning) explaining variation in genetic distances between ranges (NA invasive vs. EU native), within Europe (EU native), and within North America (NA invasive) </caption>
