 <caption> Map of sampling locations of Phragmites australis. Different sizes of the green circles are proportional to the human footprint index of the sampling location. Green dots on each continent represent North American (NA invasive, n = 92) and European (EU native, n = 74) samples, respectively, and black dots are the native North American samples (NA native, n = 20). The inset maps highlight the areas of the East Coast of North America (left) and Middle and South Europe (right). The background map of bioclimatic PC1, primarily a temperature‐dominated variable, was derived from Kriticos et al. ( 2014) </caption>
