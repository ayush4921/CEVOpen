However, many plants with sporophytic self-incompatibility systems exhibit dominance interactions at the <italic>S</italic>-locus that allow biparental inbreeding, thereby facilitating mating between individuals that share alleles at the <italic>S</italic>-locus. We investigated this trade-off by estimating mate availability and biparental inbreeding depression in wild radish from five different populations across Australia. We found dominance interactions among <italic>S</italic>-alleles increased mate availability relative to estimates based on individuals that did not share <italic>S</italic>-alleles. Twelve of the sixteen fitness variables were significantly reduced by inbreeding. For all the three life-history phases evaluated, self-fertilized offspring suffered a greater than 50% reduction in fitness, while full-sib and half-sib offspring suffered a less than 50% reduction in fitness. Theory indicates that fitness costs greater than 50% can result in an evolutionary trajectory toward a stable state of self-incompatibility (SI). This study suggests that dominance interactions at the <italic>S</italic>-locus provide a possible third stable state between SI and SC where biparental inbreeding increases mate availability with relatively minor fitness costs. This strategy allows weeds to establish in new environments while maintaining a functional SI system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Baker's rule</kwd><kwd>biparental inbreeding depression</kwd><kwd>genetic load</kwd><kwd>mate availability</kwd><kwd><italic>Raphanus raphanistrum</italic></kwd><kwd>reproductive assurance</kwd><kwd>sporophytic self-incompatibility</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Theory predicts that self-incompatible (SI) species will be reproductively and demographically challenged when colonizing new habitats. This is because mate availability, or the number of individuals with compatible mating genotypes, can be severely limited in small founding populations (Baker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">1974</xref>; Pannell and Barrett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">1998</xref>; Dornier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2008</xref>). Several studies of mating systems in weeds support the theory that self-compatible (SC) species may be more successful invaders (Price and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">1981</xref>; Barrett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">1992</xref>; Rambuda and Johnson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2004</xref>; Van Kleunen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2008</xref>). For example, Hao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>) found a higher than expected proportion of self-compatible invasive Asteraceae species in China. Paradoxically, several highly successful invasive species have SI mating systems (Elam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>; Abbott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2008</xref>). This raises the question of how SI plants can successfully overcome the mate limitation faced when long-distance dispersal is combined with very small founding population sizes.</p><p>One hypothesis is that SI plants in these circumstances evolve toward SC due to intense selection for reproductive assurance during the colonization and establishment phase (Busch and Schoen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2008</xref>; Busch and Delph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2011</xref>; Petanidou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). Mating systems are an area of rapid evolution during the invasion process (Barrett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2008</xref>) as selective pressure for reproductive assurance is high in small founding populations. Some of this rapid evolution may be adaptive (Billiard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2006</xref>; Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2010</xref>), and some may be due to drift associated with founder effects. Most SI species experience some levels of SC, often termed pseudo-self-compatibility (PSC) due to a leaky response in the SI system (Levin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">1996</xref>) and therefore have the opportunity to evolve toward SC. The conversion of a plant's mating system from SI to SC can be an adaptive advantage in the short term if the fitness cost due to inbreeding (inbreeding depression) does not negate the advantages of reproductive assurance. Generally, if the fitness cost of being SC is &#x0003c;50% that of being outcrossed, then selection will drive the population toward SC (Busch and Delph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2011</xref>). In the long term, plants may benefit from maintaining SI as outcrossed populations generally enjoy higher fitness than inbred populations, even after purging (Petanidou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). It is uncommon to evolve from SC to SI (Igic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2008</xref>) and therefore appears to be very difficult for plants to &#x0201c;regain&#x0201d; SI once lost. Many plants have a mixed mating system (between 20 and 80% outcrossing; Lande and Schemske <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">1985</xref>) which was thought to represent the transition between SI and SC (Lande and Schemske <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">1985</xref>; Goodwillie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>). However, the frequency of mixed mating in plants has led to the hypothesis that mixed mating is an evolutionary stable strategy (Goodwillie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>; Winn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>).</p><p>An alternative hypothesis for how SI plants overcome mate limitation during colonization is that biparental inbreeding may increase mate availability, relative to incompatibility among all related individuals, enough to overcome Allee effects. Biparental inbreeding is mating among related individuals. Self-incompatibility is controlled by a group of tightly linked genes, the <italic>S</italic>-locus, and fertilization is prevented by an SI response that is activated when individuals with shared alleles interact. There are two major types of SI, gametophytic (GSI), and sporophytic (SSI) (Busch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2012</xref>). In GSI, alleles are codominant, whereas alleles can be dominant, codominant, or recessive in the SSI system. Male gametophytes from SSI plants express the parental diploid phenotype and often exhibit dominance that allows some mating among individuals with a single shared allele (Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2010</xref>) which may increase mate availability relative to an SI system without dominance (Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>). Matings permitted among relatives due to dominance among <italic>S</italic>-alleles may represent an intermediate option between self-incompatibility and self-compatibility. This is fundamentally different from a mixed mating strategy in which both self-fertilization and outcrossing occur regularly (Winn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>). Dominance interactions that allow biparental inbreeding may be a viable strategy to increase mate availability in the short term to allow successful colonization of sites after long-distance dispersal events such as invasions (Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2010</xref>; Lafuma and Maurice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2007</xref>) without forfeiting the long-term fitness benefits of maintaining a SI mating system.</p><p>However, biparental inbreeding typically incurs a fitness cost in the form of reduced viability or fecundity (biparental inbreeding depression; Nason and Ellstrand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>; Wagenius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2010</xref>). For SC to be an evolutionarily stable strategy, this cost typically needs to be less than half the fitness of outcrossed individuals (Lande and Schemske <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">1985</xref>). In many highly outcrossing species, the fitness cost may be such that inbreeding is not a viable option, as the population cannot persist long enough to sufficiently purge deleterious alleles.</p><p>We set out to empirically test the hypothesis that biparental inbreeding due to mating between individuals sharing intermediate dominance alleles may represent a strategy to increase mate availability in a highly successful globally invasive plant, wild radish (<italic>Raphanus raphanistrum</italic>). Specifically, we explored the trade-off between increased mate availability and fitness cost by asking the following questions: (1) Is there evidence that dominance among <italic>S</italic>-alleles facilitates mating among related individuals? (2) Does biparental inbreeding result in a significant increase in mate availability? and (3) What is the fitness cost of biparental inbreeding?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study system</title><p>Wild radish is a globally invasive plant that is a good model system in which to investigate these questions. It is an annual Brassicaceae that has a SSI mating system with complex dominance interactions at the <italic>S</italic>-locus and is highly outcrossing (Sampson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">1964</xref>). In the close relative, <italic>R. sativus</italic>, biparental inbreeding and biparental inbreeding depression occur, and the latter has been shown to reduce reproductive output when population sizes are small (Allee effect; Elam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>). Both species have been well studied, so there is considerable information known about their life history and invasive success.</p><p><italic>Raphanus raphanistrum</italic> is native to the Mediterranean area and has successfully invaded most regions of the world (Holm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1997</xref>). It is a common agricultural weed and is increasingly becoming an environmental weed and hybrid with <italic>R. sativus</italic> (Ridley and Ellstrand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>). A likely reason this annual herb has been so successful is that it can produce hundreds of flowers and &#x0003e;15,000 seeds/m<sup>2</sup> and established populations are characterized by a dense seed bank that can persist for five to ten years (Reeves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">1981</xref>).</p><p>We estimated rates of mate availability, due to outcrossing and dominance interactions, and biparental inbreeding depression in plants from five populations across Australia. As rates of mate availability and biparental inbreeding depression may vary in natural populations, seeds sourced from five wild populations across Australia were included to capture some of this variation. Two populations were in Western Australia: one approximately 100 km NE of Perth: PG4 (31&#x000b0;24&#x02032;S, 116&#x000b0;19&#x02032;E) and one in Albany: AL (34&#x000ba;49&#x02032;S, 117&#x000b0;58&#x02032;E). Two populations were in South Australia: one in Auburn: SA1 (34&#x000b0;05&#x02032;S, 138&#x000b0;41&#x02032;E) and one in Mallala: SA4 (34&#x000b0;45&#x02032;S, 138&#x000b0;50&#x02032;E). The fifth population was located in Tylden, Victoria: VIC3 (37&#x000b0;20&#x02032;S, 144&#x000b0;23&#x02032;E).</p></sec><sec><title>Mate availability</title><p>Complete diallel crosses were conducted among 15 individuals per population to estimate mate availability and determine the sharing frequency of intermediate dominance <italic>S</italic>-alleles. Intermediate dominance alleles result in one-way compatibility that is readily detected using diallel crosses. Seeds from each population were grown in a glasshouse and hand-pollinations were conducted to cross each individual with each other as both the female and the male parent to test for compatibility in both directions. Each plant was also self-pollinated. All crosses were conducted on freshly opened flowers that were bagged following pollination. Open-pollinated controls were left on each plant in the glasshouse to check that pollinators were being effectively controlled in the glasshouse.</p><p>Dominance interactions at the <italic>S</italic>-locus will result in crosses that are successful in one direction. Pollen expresses the diploid phenotype of the parent and the stigma only expresses the dominant haploid phenotype which allows unidirectional compatibility among plants. Mate availability among individuals without shared alleles was estimated by counting the proportion of matings that were cross-compatible in both directions (male/female). The proportion of mate availability due to matings among individuals with shared alleles was estimated by counting the proportion of matings that were cross-compatible in only one direction.</p></sec><sec><title>Biparental inbreeding</title><p>We used the results from the intrapopulation diallel crosses to identify two sets of four individuals from each population that were fully cross-compatible, indicating they shared no <italic>S</italic>-alleles and could be considered unrelated. The seeds from these crosses were used to create a range of cross-types including unrelated individuals (UR), half-siblings (HS), full-siblings (FS), and selfs (SC) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). This was performed using a two-generation controlled cross-experiment. Specifically, four seeds each from each maternal line of compatible cross were randomly selected, and seeds were nicked and germinated in petri dishes and then transferred to pots in a greenhouse that was essentially free of pollinators. For example, if plant A and plant B were compatible (AB), then four seeds that resulted from this cross were selected for germination (e.g., AB1, AB2, AB3, and AB4). Each maternal line was then used to pollinate three replicates of a particular cross-type. For instance, if AB was used to create full-siblings, AB1 would be pollinated by AB2, AB3, and AB4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). A selected newly opened flower was visually checked for pollen, hand-pollinated, and covered with a small envelope. Controls were set up in the same way but without pollination. Each plant was also self-pollinated. Each parental combination/control was replicated three times resulting in 1,563 hand-pollinations and 328 controls (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The number of maternal lines, hand-pollination crosses (pollinations), seeds germinated (seed), and seedlings transplanted to the outdoor enclosure per cross-type (UR = unrelated <italic>f</italic> = 0, HS = half-sibling, <italic>f</italic> = 0.125; FS = full-sibling, <italic>f</italic> = 0.250; SC = selfed individual, <italic>f</italic> = 0.500).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cross-type</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maternal lines</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pollinations</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Seed</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outdoor enclosure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UR</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">419</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">260</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">177</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">469</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">207</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">151</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">469</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">198</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">121</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">206</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Four levels of inbreeding were created from wild collected seeds and the inbred progeny were germinated and grown in an outdoor enclosure protected from birds but open to natural pollinators.

Because not all the crosses produced seed, there was an uneven number of seeds/cross-type (treatment; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Seeds were individually weighed and then planted in jiffy pots on 27 May 2011 and kept in outdoor cold frames that were covered at night. This precaution was taken because Canberra, Australia, experiences freezing temperatures at night more often than many of locations from which the seeds were sourced. The jiffy pots were watered daily for 30 days and germinated seedlings were transferred to the outdoor enclosure. On 6 July 2011, 473 seeds had germinated and were planted in 20-cm-diameter pots containing one-third potting mix, one-third sand, and one-third peat moss. A randomized design was used to place plants in a 20&#x02013;24 grid within the enclosure. Plants were exposed to natural conditions and watered for 2 min every 2 days by an overhead sprinkler system.</p><p>We recorded a variety of phenological, growth, and reproductive variables to represent critical life-history stages (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Plants were checked every other day to record the first day of bolting, first day of flowering, and death. Plant growth characteristics, rosette width and number of leaves, were measured on the same day for all plants. Plant width was measured as the diameter at the widest point of the rosette, and the number of leaves in the rosette was counted. All surviving plants were harvested between 31 October and 4 November 2011. Plant height was measured from the base of the plant (soil surface) to the top of the tallest stem, and roots were washed and dried to be weighed.

Ten seedpods were randomly selected and the number of seeds per pod was recorded. The number of flowers was estimated by multiplying the mean number of flowers per stem by the number of stems, and the number of fattened pods was estimated by multiplying the mean number of fattened pedicles per stem by the number of stems.

Therefore, we examined individual plant responses for each variable of interest using heat maps where values are represented by different colors which allows visual analysis of spatial patterns in the data (created in R version 3.0.1; R core team. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2013</xref>). As none of the variables appeared to have spatial patterns, we did not include spatial location in the subsequent analysis.</p><p>Seed set was a binary variable that represented a positive (at least one seed set) or negative (no seeds) response to pollination per each mom/dad combination. A binomial generalized linear model with a logit link was used to estimate seed-set rate per cross-type. For all other variables considered, we used linear mixed models that were fitted using the restricted maximum-likelihood approach (REML) to account for unbalanced data (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In all models, mother was included as a random factor, while cross-type, population, and the interaction between cross-type and population were included as fixed factors. Diagnostic plots of the residuals were checked for normality, and data were transformed when necessary to meet normality assumptions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Standard errors were calculated on back-transformed variables, and standard error of the differences (SED) was used to test for significance between means.

A functional SI system is beneficial for progeny fitness in the long term and maintaining this system while overcoming short-term Allee effects could be a strong advantage to invasive plants. We found a large increase in MA relative to MA estimates based on individuals that were fully compatible and therefore not likely to share <italic>S</italic>-alleles. This increase was attributable to dominance interactions among <italic>S</italic>-alleles allowing individuals with one shared allele to successfully mate. The fitness costs associated with inbreeding were highly linear across all life-history stages, with extremely high fitness costs or inbreeding depression incurred from selfing. To assess the trade-off between the increase in MA and inbreeding depression, we assessed the correlation between the proportion of MA due to dominance interactions among <italic>S</italic>-alleles and inbreeding depression estimated separately for each of the five populations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). At the same time, we examined the relationship between inbreeding depression and the rate of self-compatibility in each population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). These comparisons suggest that as inbreeding depression from selfing increases, the contribution to MA from dominance interactions that allow mating among relatives increases. Not surprisingly, as the cost of selfing increased, the rate of self-compatibility decreased.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>The relationship between the proportion of mate availability (MA; left axis) due to dominance interactions at the <italic>S</italic>-locus and estimates of inbreeding depression based on selfed individuals (<italic>f</italic> = 0.500; seed-set rate) in five populations of <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.62; diamonds).

Radish experiences severe inbreeding depression for selfed individuals yet mate availability is likely to be extremely limited for colonizing seeds. The seedpod contains several seeds that are often half- or full-siblings (Karron and Marshall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">1990</xref>; Elam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>), and the multiple individuals contained in one pod may establish a population if ID from biparental inbreeding is not too severe.</p><p>We estimated inbreeding depression for four levels of relatedness within wild radish (<italic>f</italic> = 0, 0.125, 0.250. 0.500) and found a strongly linear and consistent relationship between genetic relatedness and fitness costs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). Although this is to be expected in the absence of epistasis (Crow and Kimura <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">1970</xref>), it is rarely empirically estimated (Stift et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2013</xref>). Our estimates of cumulative biparental ID are remarkably close to the estimates of biparental inbreeding in the closely related domestic radish, <italic>R. sativus</italic> that is likely derived from <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic>. Nason and Ellstrand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>) found a cumulative ID of 0.58 for FS and 0.37 for HS which is similar to our respective estimates of 0.61 and 0.36, although the individual life stage estimates of ID in this study vary considerably from theirs. They did not estimate ID for selfed (<italic>f</italic> = 0.5) individuals but predicted ID of 0.9 to 0.99 based on a expected linear relationship between genetic relatedness and ID, which is similar to our estimates. Interestingly, Nason and Ellstrand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>) found reductions in maternal fecundity drove 94% of the cumulative ID, whereas we found higher rates of ID for seed-set (pregermination) than seedpod production (fecundity), with both life stages contributing significantly to cumulative ID. Notably, for half-siblings, seedpod weight ID was only 0.09 and therefore did not contribute much to cumulative ID.</p><p>How does radish successfully invade if mate availability is limited and ID for selfing is so high? Most SI plants have some rate of SC (or PSC) and often the invasion process is a time for evolution from SI to SC (Busch and Schoen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2008</xref>). Annual SI plants have been found to exhibit this pattern of higher SI in native ranges and higher SC in invaded ranges (Petanidou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). Annual plants do not have multiple years to wait for mates to arrive and populations should suffer from Allee effects or a negative relationship between population density and fitness (Petanidou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). However, in wild radish, the cumulative estimates of ID for selfed individuals are likely too severe (ID = 0.95) for purging to occur. In general, ID greater than 50% will prevent the evolution of SC.</p><p>Mixed mating (20&#x02013;80% outcrossing) is common in many taxa and may be an evolutionary stable strategy (Goodwillie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>; Winn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>), not just a mid-point on an evolutionary trajectory between SI and SC. The costs of inbreeding depression in mixed mating taxa are similar to that of SI taxa, indicating that purging is not effectively reducing inbreeding depression as the rates of SC increase (Winn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>). Biparental inbreeding can reduce the cost of selfing by reducing relative inbreeding depression between selfed and outcrossed progeny (Uyenoyama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">1986</xref>). Biparental inbreeding often occurs in taxa with mixed mating systems (Uyenoyama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">1986</xref>) and may contribute to the evolution of mixed mating (Griffin and Eckert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b100">2003</xref>).</p><p>Pollination biology may play a central role in biparental inbreeding (Uyenoyama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">1986</xref>) as well as in the maintenance of mixed mating systems (Porcher and Lande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). Pollen limitation, or the amount of pollen available per ovule (Larson and Barrett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2000</xref>), can increase the advantage of selfing as it becomes more efficient to self-pollinate (Porcher and Lande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). However, theoretical models predict that the interacting effects of pollen limitation and pollen discounting (the loss of pollen available for outcrossing due to self-pollination) will maintain high rates of selfing while maintaining a selfing rate less than one (Porcher and Lande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). Yet, the maintenance of low rates of selfing, as observed in <italic>R. raphanistrum,</italic> cannot be explained by the interactions of pollination biology and inbreeding depression (Porcher and Lande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the invasion success of <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> is due to a different strategy.</p><p>Elam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>) investigated Allee effects on maternal fitness for <italic>R. sativus</italic> and found that fitness increased with population size from 2 to 20 individuals, with the smallest populations (n = 2) producing &#x02248; 25% seed per flower compared with that in the largest populations (n = 20). These results, combined with high cumulative ID of selfed individuals, suggest that <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> must utilize some mechanism to overcome this Allee effect in establishing populations. Elam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>) hypothesized that &#x0201c;radishes multiseeded fruits are an apparent adaptation to overcome the challenge of the Allee effect&#x0201d; given each fruit has an average of 3&#x02013;5 seeds and are often &#x0201c;sired by more than one father&#x0201d;. These authors suggest that seeds from three to four fruits would then be enough to overcome the Allee effect given the effects are strongest with &#x0003c; 10 individuals.</p><p>Our results suggest that the dominance system that permits biparental inbreeding is a contributing mechanism that facilitates population establishment in this SSI plant. Individual seedpods contain multiple seeds, but at minimum, the seeds are half-siblings. If seeds from only one or very few seedpods establish a new site, then mating among related individuals is necessary to overcome the Allee effect. We found that mating among related individuals increased mate availability substantially, with the proportion of MA due to dominance interactions ranging from 19 to 46% across five populations (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). Interestingly, it appears that the contribution of dominance interactions to MA increases as the cost of selfing increases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). We compared the proportion of matings due to dominance interactions in each population with ID (<italic>f</italic> = 0.500; seed-set) and found a strong positive correlation between the contribution of dominance interactions to MA and the cost of selfing (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.62). Additionally, as ID increases, the rate of SC in each population decreases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.94), as is expected when populations carry a high genetic load, the cost of being SC is often too high to persist (Husband and Schemske <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">1996</xref>).</p><p>Dominance interactions among <italic>S</italic>-alleles in SSI systems have been suggested as a mechanism that may increase mate availability when the number of <italic>S</italic>-alleles are low, such as during the colonization phase of the invasion process (Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2010</xref>; Lafuma and Maurice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2007</xref>; Abbott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2008</xref>). Brennan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>) examined the role of dominance interactions at the <italic>S</italic>-locus in <italic>Senecio squalidus</italic>. They speculated that selection pressure for reproductive assurance increases dominance relationships based on the relative proportion of dominance relationships within populations compared with among populations. The relationship between the proportion of MA due to dominance and ID suggests there is selection pressure for increased MA due to mechanisms other than PSC or SC when the cost of SC is high, and therefore, SC rates are low. As a result, dominance interactions become an important mechanism to increase MA.</p><p>While GSI is the more common genetic mechanism preventing self-fertilization, SSI is known to occur in at least 10 phylogenetically diverse families of plants, and an additional 47 families have an undetermined genetic mechanism controlling SI, indicating SSI likely occurs in additional plant families (Igic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2008</xref>). The widespread nature of SSI suggests <italic>S</italic>-allele dominance interactions could provide reproductive assurance to a range of angiosperms when population size is small and diversity in <italic>S</italic>-alleles is low.</p><p>This study empirically documented the increase in MA due to <italic>S</italic>-allele dominance interactions while showing the resulting fitness cost of biparental inbreeding. We found a consistent increase in MA due to dominance interactions as the cost of selfing increased. <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> is a classic species to document these patterns as it is a highly outcrossing species with an SSI mating system that incurs a very high cost of selfing. Yet, it has been an incredibly successful at invading habitats globally while retaining a functional SI system. The results from this study support the hypothesis that dominance interactions increase MA in SSI plants and demonstrate that biparental inbreeding depression is likely low enough to allow plants to overcome the short-term Allee effects encountered during the colonization process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Carole Elliott, Emma Clifton, and Raffaele Tammaro for technical assistance with the experiment, and Alec Zwart for statistical advice.
