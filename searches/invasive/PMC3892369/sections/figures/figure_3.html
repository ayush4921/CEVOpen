 <caption> The relationship between genetic relatedness (inbreeding coefficient f) and predicted means of fitness variables for three different life-history stages: (A) pregermination (seed-set rate), (B) growth (aboveground biomass back-transformed), and (C) reproductive output (seedpod weight back-transformed). Correlation estimates (adjusted R 2) were obtained from linear regression in the statistical software R, version 3.0.1 (R core team. 2013). </caption>
