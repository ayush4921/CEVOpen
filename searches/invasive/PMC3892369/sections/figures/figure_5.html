 <caption> The relationship between the proportion of mate availability (MA; left axis) due to dominance interactions at the S-locus and estimates of inbreeding depression based on selfed individuals ( f = 0.500; seed-set rate) in five populations of R. raphanistrum ( R 2 = 0.62; diamonds). The right axis represents the relationship between the rates of self-compatibility and inbreeding depression in the same five populations ( R 2 = 0.94; squares). Correlation estimates (adjusted R 2) were obtained from linear regression in the statistical software R, version 3.0.1 (R core team. 2013). </caption>
