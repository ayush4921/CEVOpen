  <p>The relationship between the proportion of mate availability (MA; left axis) due to dominance interactions at the 
   <italic>S</italic>-locus and estimates of inbreeding depression based on selfed individuals (
   <italic>f</italic> = 0.500; seed-set rate) in five populations of 
   <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.62; diamonds). The right axis represents the relationship between the rates of self-compatibility and inbreeding depression in the same five populations (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.94; squares). Correlation estimates (adjusted 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup>) were obtained from linear regression in the statistical software R, version 3.0.1 (R core team.
