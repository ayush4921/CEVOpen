 <caption> Four levels of inbreeding were created from wild collected seeds and the inbred progeny were germinated and grown in an outdoor enclosure protected from birds but open to natural pollinators. In each population, 2 sets of four fully compatible individuals were identified using full diallel crosses (top left) and the progeny of these crosses was used to create full-siblings ( f = 0.250), half-siblings ( f = 0.125), and unrelated progeny. For each crossing type, a maternal plant was pollinated by three replicates of a pollen donor and each cross was made three times. Each maternal plant was also selfed ( f = 0.500). The seeds from each maternal line cross-type (e.g., AB1 full-siblings) were pooled, and five seeds were randomly chosen to be germinated in the outdoor experiment. </caption>
