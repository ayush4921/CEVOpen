<p>While GSI is the more common genetic mechanism preventing self-fertilization, SSI is known to occur in at least 10 phylogenetically diverse families of plants, and an additional 47 families have an undetermined genetic mechanism controlling SI, indicating SSI likely occurs in additional plant families (Igic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2008</xref>). The widespread nature of SSI suggests 
 <italic>S</italic>-allele dominance interactions could provide reproductive assurance to a range of angiosperms when population size is small and diversity in 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles is low.
