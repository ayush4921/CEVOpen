<p>This study empirically documented the increase in MA due to 
 <italic>S</italic>-allele dominance interactions while showing the resulting fitness cost of biparental inbreeding. We found a consistent increase in MA due to dominance interactions as the cost of selfing increased. 
 <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> is a classic species to document these patterns as it is a highly outcrossing species with an SSI mating system that incurs a very high cost of selfing. Yet, it has been an incredibly successful at invading habitats globally while retaining a functional SI system. The results from this study support the hypothesis that dominance interactions increase MA in SSI plants and demonstrate that biparental inbreeding depression is likely low enough to allow plants to overcome the short-term Allee effects encountered during the colonization process.
