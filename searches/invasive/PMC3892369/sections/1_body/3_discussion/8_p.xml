<p>Our results suggest that the dominance system that permits biparental inbreeding is a contributing mechanism that facilitates population establishment in this SSI plant. Individual seedpods contain multiple seeds, but at minimum, the seeds are half-siblings. If seeds from only one or very few seedpods establish a new site, then mating among related individuals is necessary to overcome the Allee effect. We found that mating among related individuals increased mate availability substantially, with the proportion of MA due to dominance interactions ranging from 19 to 46% across five populations (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). Interestingly, it appears that the contribution of dominance interactions to MA increases as the cost of selfing increases (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). We compared the proportion of matings due to dominance interactions in each population with ID (
 <italic>f</italic> = 0.500; seed-set) and found a strong positive correlation between the contribution of dominance interactions to MA and the cost of selfing (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.62). Additionally, as ID increases, the rate of SC in each population decreases (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.94), as is expected when populations carry a high genetic load, the cost of being SC is often too high to persist (Husband and Schemske
