<p>How does radish successfully invade if mate availability is limited and ID for selfing is so high? Most SI plants have some rate of SC (or PSC) and often the invasion process is a time for evolution from SI to SC (Busch and Schoen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2008</xref>). Annual SI plants have been found to exhibit this pattern of higher SI in native ranges and higher SC in invaded ranges (Petanidou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). Annual plants do not have multiple years to wait for mates to arrive and populations should suffer from Allee effects or a negative relationship between population density and fitness (Petanidou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). However, in wild radish, the cumulative estimates of ID for selfed individuals are likely too severe (ID = 0.95) for purging to occur. In general, ID greater than 50% will prevent the evolution of SC.
