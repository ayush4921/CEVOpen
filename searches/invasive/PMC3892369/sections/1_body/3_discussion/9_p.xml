<p>Dominance interactions among 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles in SSI systems have been suggested as a mechanism that may increase mate availability when the number of 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles are low, such as during the colonization phase of the invasion process (Brennan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2010</xref>; Lafuma and Maurice 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2007</xref>; Abbott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2008</xref>). Brennan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>) examined the role of dominance interactions at the 
 <italic>S</italic>-locus in 
 <italic>Senecio squalidus</italic>. They speculated that selection pressure for reproductive assurance increases dominance relationships based on the relative proportion of dominance relationships within populations compared with among populations. The relationship between the proportion of MA due to dominance and ID suggests there is selection pressure for increased MA due to mechanisms other than PSC or SC when the cost of SC is high, and therefore, SC rates are low. As a result, dominance interactions become an important mechanism to increase MA.
