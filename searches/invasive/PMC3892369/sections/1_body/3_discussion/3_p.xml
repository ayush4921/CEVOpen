<p>We estimated inbreeding depression for four levels of relatedness within wild radish (
 <italic>f</italic> = 0, 0.125, 0.250. 0.500) and found a strongly linear and consistent relationship between genetic relatedness and fitness costs (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). Although this is to be expected in the absence of epistasis (Crow and Kimura 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">1970</xref>), it is rarely empirically estimated (Stift et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2013</xref>). Our estimates of cumulative biparental ID are remarkably close to the estimates of biparental inbreeding in the closely related domestic radish, 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> that is likely derived from 
 <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic>. Nason and Ellstrand (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>) found a cumulative ID of 0.58 for FS and 0.37 for HS which is similar to our respective estimates of 0.61 and 0.36, although the individual life stage estimates of ID in this study vary considerably from theirs. They did not estimate ID for selfed (
 <italic>f</italic> = 0.5) individuals but predicted ID of 0.9 to 0.99 based on a expected linear relationship between genetic relatedness and ID, which is similar to our estimates. Interestingly, Nason and Ellstrand (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>) found reductions in maternal fecundity drove 94% of the cumulative ID, whereas we found higher rates of ID for seed-set (pregermination) than seedpod production (fecundity), with both life stages contributing significantly to cumulative ID. Notably, for half-siblings, seedpod weight ID was only 0.09 and therefore did not contribute much to cumulative ID.
