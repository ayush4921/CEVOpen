<p>Dominance interactions among 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles that facilitate biparental inbreeding may be a good strategy that allows SI plants to colonize novel habitats without losing SI functionality. A functional SI system is beneficial for progeny fitness in the long term and maintaining this system while overcoming short-term Allee effects could be a strong advantage to invasive plants. We found a large increase in MA relative to MA estimates based on individuals that were fully compatible and therefore not likely to share 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles. This increase was attributable to dominance interactions among 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles allowing individuals with one shared allele to successfully mate. The fitness costs associated with inbreeding were highly linear across all life-history stages, with extremely high fitness costs or inbreeding depression incurred from selfing. To assess the trade-off between the increase in MA and inbreeding depression, we assessed the correlation between the proportion of MA due to dominance interactions among 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles and inbreeding depression estimated separately for each of the five populations (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). At the same time, we examined the relationship between inbreeding depression and the rate of self-compatibility in each population (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). These comparisons suggest that as inbreeding depression from selfing increases, the contribution to MA from dominance interactions that allow mating among relatives increases. Not surprisingly, as the cost of selfing increased, the rate of self-compatibility decreased.
