<p>Elam et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>) investigated Allee effects on maternal fitness for 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> and found that fitness increased with population size from 2 to 20 individuals, with the smallest populations (n = 2) producing ≈ 25% seed per flower compared with that in the largest populations (n = 20). These results, combined with high cumulative ID of selfed individuals, suggest that 
 <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> must utilize some mechanism to overcome this Allee effect in establishing populations. Elam et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>) hypothesized that “radishes multiseeded fruits are an apparent adaptation to overcome the challenge of the Allee effect” given each fruit has an average of 3–5 seeds and are often “sired by more than one father”. These authors suggest that seeds from three to four fruits would then be enough to overcome the Allee effect given the effects are strongest with &lt; 10 individuals.
