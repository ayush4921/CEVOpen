<p>Pollination biology may play a central role in biparental inbreeding (Uyenoyama 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">1986</xref>) as well as in the maintenance of mixed mating systems (Porcher and Lande 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). Pollen limitation, or the amount of pollen available per ovule (Larson and Barrett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2000</xref>), can increase the advantage of selfing as it becomes more efficient to self-pollinate (Porcher and Lande 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). However, theoretical models predict that the interacting effects of pollen limitation and pollen discounting (the loss of pollen available for outcrossing due to self-pollination) will maintain high rates of selfing while maintaining a selfing rate less than one (Porcher and Lande 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). Yet, the maintenance of low rates of selfing, as observed in 
 <italic>R. raphanistrum,</italic> cannot be explained by the interactions of pollination biology and inbreeding depression (Porcher and Lande 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the invasion success of 
 <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> is due to a different strategy.
