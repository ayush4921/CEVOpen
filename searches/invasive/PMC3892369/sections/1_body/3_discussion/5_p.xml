<p>Mixed mating (20â€“80% outcrossing) is common in many taxa and may be an evolutionary stable strategy (Goodwillie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>; Winn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>), not just a mid-point on an evolutionary trajectory between SI and SC. The costs of inbreeding depression in mixed mating taxa are similar to that of SI taxa, indicating that purging is not effectively reducing inbreeding depression as the rates of SC increase (Winn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>). Biparental inbreeding can reduce the cost of selfing by reducing relative inbreeding depression between selfed and outcrossed progeny (Uyenoyama 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">1986</xref>). Biparental inbreeding often occurs in taxa with mixed mating systems (Uyenoyama 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">1986</xref>) and may contribute to the evolution of mixed mating (Griffin and Eckert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b100">2003</xref>).
