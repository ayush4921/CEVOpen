<p>Four of the five reproductive output variables varied significantly by cross-type (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), again displaying a consistent negative relationship between reproductive output and inbreeding. Seedpod weight is a good estimate of maternal fecundity as it encompasses both seed-set and seed size and was measured directly (number of flowers, seedpods, and seeds were estimated by subsampling). Therefore, we present specific results for this reproductive output variable only. Seedpod weight had a strong negative linear relationship with the level of genetic relatedness (
