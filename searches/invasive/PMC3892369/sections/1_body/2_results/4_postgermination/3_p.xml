<p>Cumulative inbreeding depression was considered as the product of pregermination and postgermination fitness and was calculated as the product of seed-set rate * seedpod weight. Cumulative ID estimates were 0.95, 0.61, and 0.36 for selfed individuals, full-siblings, and half-siblings, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>) and LE ranged from 11.98 to 7.11 for selfed plants to half-siblings (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>).
