<p>Three phenological variables were evaluated, none of which varied significantly by cross-type or for the interaction between cross-type and population. All six growth variables significantly varied by cross-type (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), with level of inbreeding showing a consistently negative effect on 
 <italic>R. raphanistrum</italic> growth. Aboveground biomass is a good indicator of overall growth as it tends to reflect plant height, number of stems, and rosette size all of which result in higher biomass; therefore, we present specific results for this growth variable only. Biomass had a strong negative linear relationship with the level of genetic relatedness (
