<p>Seed-set and seed weight varied significantly by cross-type (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), but the interaction between cross-type and population was not significant at α = 0.05 level. However, variation in seed-set among populations did appear to exist and was significant at α = 0.10 level (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.09). Seed-set rate is a good representative of pregermination responses as it encompasses both fertilization and seed abortion rate to give a metric of successful seed production. Therefore, we present specific results for this variable only. Seed set had a strong negative linear relationship (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.97) with the level of genetic relatedness (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>a) with estimates of inbreeding depression (ID) ranging from 0.76 for selfed individuals (
 <italic>f</italic> = 0.500) to 0.30 for half-siblings (
 <italic>f</italic> = 0.125; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). The genetic load or number of lethal equivalents (LE) estimated to be associated with seed-set rate was 5.71 for selfed individuals, 4.57 for full-siblings, and 5.68 for half-siblings (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>).
