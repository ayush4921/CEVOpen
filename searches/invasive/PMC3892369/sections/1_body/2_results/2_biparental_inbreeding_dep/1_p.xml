<p>We tested 16 variables in four life-history categories, pregermination, growth, phenology, and reproductive output, for significant effects of cross-type, and the interaction between cross-type and population (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Twelve of the 16 variables showed a significant effect of cross-type; however, none of the variables showed a significant effect for the interaction between cross-type and population (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Consequently, source population was eliminated from further analyses, as was survival due to high overall values (&gt;97%).
