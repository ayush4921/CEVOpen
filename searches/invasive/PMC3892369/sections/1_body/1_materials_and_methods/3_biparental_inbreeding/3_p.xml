<p>We recorded a variety of phenological, growth, and reproductive variables to represent critical life-history stages (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Plants were checked every other day to record the first day of bolting, first day of flowering, and death. Plant growth characteristics, rosette width and number of leaves, were measured on the same day for all plants. Plant width was measured as the diameter at the widest point of the rosette, and the number of leaves in the rosette was counted. All surviving plants were harvested between 31 October and 4 November 2011. Plant height was measured from the base of the plant (soil surface) to the top of the tallest stem, and roots were washed and dried to be weighed. Aboveground plant material was dried at room temperature prior to estimating reproductive output, and measuring aboveground plant weight and seedpod weight.
