<p>Reproductive output was estimated by counting the number of apical stems on each plant, and subsampling 20 stems on which the number of total pedicles (representing flowers) and fattened pedicles (representing pods that contained seeds) were counted. Ten seedpods were randomly selected and the number of seeds per pod was recorded. The number of flowers was estimated by multiplying the mean number of flowers per stem by the number of stems, and the number of fattened pods was estimated by multiplying the mean number of fattened pedicles per stem by the number of stems. Finally, all the seedpods were removed from the plant and weighed to measure total seedpod weight.</p>
