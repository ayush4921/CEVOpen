<p>We used the results from the intrapopulation diallel crosses to identify two sets of four individuals from each population that were fully cross-compatible, indicating they shared no 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles and could be considered unrelated. The seeds from these crosses were used to create a range of cross-types including unrelated individuals (UR), half-siblings (HS), full-siblings (FS), and selfs (SC) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). This was performed using a two-generation controlled cross-experiment. Specifically, four seeds each from each maternal line of compatible cross were randomly selected, and seeds were nicked and germinated in petri dishes and then transferred to pots in a greenhouse that was essentially free of pollinators. For example, if plant A and plant B were compatible (AB), then four seeds that resulted from this cross were selected for germination (e.g., AB1, AB2, AB3, and AB4). Each maternal line was then used to pollinate three replicates of a particular cross-type. For instance, if AB was used to create full-siblings, AB1 would be pollinated by AB2, AB3, and AB4 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). A selected newly opened flower was visually checked for pollen, hand-pollinated, and covered with a small envelope. Controls were set up in the same way but without pollination. Each plant was also self-pollinated. Each parental combination/control was replicated three times resulting in 1,563 hand-pollinations and 328 controls (Table
