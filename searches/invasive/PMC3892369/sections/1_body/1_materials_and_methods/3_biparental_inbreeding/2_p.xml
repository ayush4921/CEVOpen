<p>Crosses were considered successful if seed set occurred after hand-pollinations. Seeds were collected from successful crosses to be grown outdoors in pots in an enclosure that excluded birds but allowed open-pollination. We randomly chose five seeds/cross-type from each maternal line (i.e., AB1 x AB2, AB3, AB4) to germinate for a total 727 seeds from 141 maternal lines (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Because not all the crosses produced seed, there was an uneven number of seeds/cross-type (treatment; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Seeds were individually weighed and then planted in jiffy pots on 27 May 2011 and kept in outdoor cold frames that were covered at night. This precaution was taken because Canberra, Australia, experiences freezing temperatures at night more often than many of locations from which the seeds were sourced. The jiffy pots were watered daily for 30 days and germinated seedlings were transferred to the outdoor enclosure. On 6 July 2011, 473 seeds had germinated and were planted in 20-cm-diameter pots containing one-third potting mix, one-third sand, and one-third peat moss. A randomized design was used to place plants in a 20â€“24 grid within the enclosure. Plants were exposed to natural conditions and watered for 2 min every 2 days by an overhead sprinkler system.
