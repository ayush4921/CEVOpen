<p>Although a randomized design was used to place plants in the enclosure, it is possible that natural variation in the microclimate of the enclosure could have influenced plant growth, survival, or reproductive output. Therefore, we examined individual plant responses for each variable of interest using heat maps where values are represented by different colors which allows visual analysis of spatial patterns in the data (created in R version 3.0.1; R core team. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2013</xref>). As none of the variables appeared to have spatial patterns, we did not include spatial location in the subsequent analysis.
