<p>Wild radish is a globally invasive plant that is a good model system in which to investigate these questions. It is an annual Brassicaceae that has a SSI mating system with complex dominance interactions at the 
 <italic>S</italic>-locus and is highly outcrossing (Sampson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">1964</xref>). In the close relative, 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic>, biparental inbreeding and biparental inbreeding depression occur, and the latter has been shown to reduce reproductive output when population sizes are small (Allee effect; Elam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>). Both species have been well studied, so there is considerable information known about their life history and invasive success.
