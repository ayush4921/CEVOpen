<p>We estimated rates of mate availability, due to outcrossing and dominance interactions, and biparental inbreeding depression in plants from five populations across Australia. As rates of mate availability and biparental inbreeding depression may vary in natural populations, seeds sourced from five wild populations across Australia were included to capture some of this variation. Two populations were in Western Australia: one approximately 100 km NE of Perth: PG4 (31°24′S, 116°19′E) and one in Albany: AL (34º49′S, 117°58′E). Two populations were in South Australia: one in Auburn: SA1 (34°05′S, 138°41′E) and one in Mallala: SA4 (34°45′S, 138°50′E). The fifth population was located in Tylden, Victoria: VIC3 (37°20′S, 144°23′E).</p>
