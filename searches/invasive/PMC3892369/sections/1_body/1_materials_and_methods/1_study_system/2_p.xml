 <italic>Raphanus raphanistrum</italic> is native to the Mediterranean area and has successfully invaded most regions of the world (Holm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1997</xref>). It is a common agricultural weed and is increasingly becoming an environmental weed and hybrid with 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> (Ridley and Ellstrand 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>). A likely reason this annual herb has been so successful is that it can produce hundreds of flowers and &gt;15,000 seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup> and established populations are characterized by a dense seed bank that can persist for five to ten years (Reeves et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">1981</xref>).
