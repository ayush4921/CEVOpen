<p>Complete diallel crosses were conducted among 15 individuals per population to estimate mate availability and determine the sharing frequency of intermediate dominance 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles. Intermediate dominance alleles result in one-way compatibility that is readily detected using diallel crosses. Seeds from each population were grown in a glasshouse and hand-pollinations were conducted to cross each individual with each other as both the female and the male parent to test for compatibility in both directions. Each plant was also self-pollinated. All crosses were conducted on freshly opened flowers that were bagged following pollination. Open-pollinated controls were left on each plant in the glasshouse to check that pollinators were being effectively controlled in the glasshouse.
