<p>Dominance interactions at the 
 <italic>S</italic>-locus will result in crosses that are successful in one direction. Pollen expresses the diploid phenotype of the parent and the stigma only expresses the dominant haploid phenotype which allows unidirectional compatibility among plants. Mate availability among individuals without shared alleles was estimated by counting the proportion of matings that were cross-compatible in both directions (male/female). The proportion of mate availability due to matings among individuals with shared alleles was estimated by counting the proportion of matings that were cross-compatible in only one direction.
