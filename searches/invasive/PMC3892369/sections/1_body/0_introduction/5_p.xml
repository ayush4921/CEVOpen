<p>We set out to empirically test the hypothesis that biparental inbreeding due to mating between individuals sharing intermediate dominance alleles may represent a strategy to increase mate availability in a highly successful globally invasive plant, wild radish (
 <italic>Raphanus raphanistrum</italic>). Specifically, we explored the trade-off between increased mate availability and fitness cost by asking the following questions: (1) Is there evidence that dominance among 
 <italic>S</italic>-alleles facilitates mating among related individuals? (2) Does biparental inbreeding result in a significant increase in mate availability? and (3) What is the fitness cost of biparental inbreeding?
