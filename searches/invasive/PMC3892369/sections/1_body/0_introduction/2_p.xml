<p>One hypothesis is that SI plants in these circumstances evolve toward SC due to intense selection for reproductive assurance during the colonization and establishment phase (Busch and Schoen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2008</xref>; Busch and Delph 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2011</xref>; Petanidou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). Mating systems are an area of rapid evolution during the invasion process (Barrett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2008</xref>) as selective pressure for reproductive assurance is high in small founding populations. Some of this rapid evolution may be adaptive (Billiard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2006</xref>; Brennan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2010</xref>), and some may be due to drift associated with founder effects. Most SI species experience some levels of SC, often termed pseudo-self-compatibility (PSC) due to a leaky response in the SI system (Levin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">1996</xref>) and therefore have the opportunity to evolve toward SC. The conversion of a plant's mating system from SI to SC can be an adaptive advantage in the short term if the fitness cost due to inbreeding (inbreeding depression) does not negate the advantages of reproductive assurance. Generally, if the fitness cost of being SC is &lt;50% that of being outcrossed, then selection will drive the population toward SC (Busch and Delph 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2011</xref>). In the long term, plants may benefit from maintaining SI as outcrossed populations generally enjoy higher fitness than inbred populations, even after purging (Petanidou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). It is uncommon to evolve from SC to SI (Igic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2008</xref>) and therefore appears to be very difficult for plants to “regain” SI once lost. Many plants have a mixed mating system (between 20 and 80% outcrossing; Lande and Schemske 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">1985</xref>) which was thought to represent the transition between SI and SC (Lande and Schemske 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">1985</xref>; Goodwillie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>). However, the frequency of mixed mating in plants has led to the hypothesis that mixed mating is an evolutionary stable strategy (Goodwillie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>; Winn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2011</xref>).
