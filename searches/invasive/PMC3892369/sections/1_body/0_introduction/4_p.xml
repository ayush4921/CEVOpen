<p>However, biparental inbreeding typically incurs a fitness cost in the form of reduced viability or fecundity (biparental inbreeding depression; Nason and Ellstrand 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>; Wagenius et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2010</xref>). For SC to be an evolutionarily stable strategy, this cost typically needs to be less than half the fitness of outcrossed individuals (Lande and Schemske 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">1985</xref>). In many highly outcrossing species, the fitness cost may be such that inbreeding is not a viable option, as the population cannot persist long enough to sufficiently purge deleterious alleles.
