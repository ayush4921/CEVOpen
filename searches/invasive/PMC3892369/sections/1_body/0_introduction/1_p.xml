<p>Theory predicts that self-incompatible (SI) species will be reproductively and demographically challenged when colonizing new habitats. This is because mate availability, or the number of individuals with compatible mating genotypes, can be severely limited in small founding populations (Baker

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2008</xref>). For example, Hao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>) found a higher than expected proportion of self-compatible invasive Asteraceae species in China. Paradoxically, several highly successful invasive species have SI mating systems (Elam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>; Abbott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2008</xref>). This raises the question of how SI plants can successfully overcome the mate limitation faced when long-distance dispersal is combined with very small founding population sizes.
