 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees were, among others, introduced in Eastern Africa to increase the availability of wood and to stabilize soil in degraded ecosystems, their invasion has been identified as a serious challenge to biodiversity, environment and the rural livelihoods

 </sup>. In the context of climate change and an increasing frequency of drought events in dry regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, there is increasing evidence that invasive trees can increase transpiration and ET losses and thus reduce surface water or groundwater recharge

 </sup>. The results of this study provide evidence that in the Afar Region the evergreen 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> not only consumes water throughout the year, but even consumes more water during the dry than during the rainy season. Thus, unless the spread of 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> is contained and the density reduced in areas where it has become established, this invasive tree is likely to have serious consequences for sustainable livelihoods in the region. The estimated net benefit alone would strongly justify the implementation of a coordinated control program.
