<p id="Par22">The energy transferred into and out of the ground was measured using clusters of soil heat flux plates (Model: HFP01SC-L, Delft, The Netherlands), while soil temperature was recorded using soil averaging thermocouples (Model: TCAV-L: Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA). The soil heat flux plates were installed at 8 cm depth and the soil averaging and soil moisture data measured with the soil water content reflectometers (Model: CS616-L: Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA) were used to correct the soil heat flux for the energy stored by the soil layer above them. At all sites, the sensors were connected to a data logger (Model CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA) programmed with a scan interval of 90 s, and data were stored at hourly intervals over the 11 months study period. All data were downloaded every 21 days from data loggers.</p>
