<p id="Par20">To measure solar irradiance, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity and air pressure, an automatic weather station was set up at Site 4, which was located within 7 km from the other three sites. The solar radiation sensor was installed on a horizontal leveling fixture mounted on a south facing cross bar to avoid self-shading errors. A wind sentry was used to measure the wind speed and direction (Model 03,001, R.M. Young; Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA). Rainfall was monitored using a tipping bucket rain gauge (Model TE525-L, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA). The weather station comprised an Em50 (a 5-channel data logger) and ECH
 <sub>2</sub>O utility software from Decagon, USA.
