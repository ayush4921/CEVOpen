<p id="Par16">The thermocouples were installed in the sapwood at depths ranging from 0.8 to 1.1 cm under the bark to capture the radial changes in sap velocity. Wounding corrections were applied according to the method described by Swanson and Whitfield

 </sup>. The depth of the sapwood was determined visually as it was possible to distinguish between the sap wood and heartwood boundaries from the changes in the color of the wood. The individual tree sap flow volume in liters per hour were converted to stand level transpiration (in mm per hour) using the approach described by Dzikiti et al

 </sup> in which the instrumented trees were assigned to a particular stem size class. The stand level transpiration was then calculated as a weighted sum of the transpiration rates by the trees in each stem size class with the proportion of trees in each size class as the weights. The volumetric soil water content in the root-zone of the trees were measured at each site using a single soil water content reflectometer probe (Model CS616: Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan UT, USA) installed horizontally at a depth of 50 cm. Sap flow and soil moisture data were measured for 15 months (from November 2016 to January 2018) while evapotranspiration was measured for 11 months (from January to November 2017).
