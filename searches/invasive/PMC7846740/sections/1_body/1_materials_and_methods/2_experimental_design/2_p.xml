<p id="Par9">Site 1 was located near Worer Agricultural Research Center some 200 m away from Awash River and about 30 m from a nearby irrigation canal, and was considered a floodplain site. The area was used for crop production until 2012 after which it was abandoned due to shallow water inducing soil salinity problems. Soon after abandonment, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded the area and established dense stands with 100% canopy cover in most places comprising trees up to 6.5 m height. Soil moisture was relatively high at Site 1 due to proximity to the river. The area invaded by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was about 6 ha and the soils were temporarily flooded loam and clay soils. Except for annual grasses in some open spaces, there was no undergrowth vegetation, probably due to the dense 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover.
