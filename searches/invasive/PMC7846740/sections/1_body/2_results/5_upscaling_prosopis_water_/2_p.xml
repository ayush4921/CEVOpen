<p id="Par36">Based on current regional water tariffs, the economic impact of water loss due to 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion in the Afar Region was estimated at US$ 465,000—500,000 per year. Considering that cotton production requires some 7,000 m
 <sup>3</sup>/ha/year (consultation with experts), the water consumed by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> corresponds to the amount of water needed to grow approximately 460,000 ha of cotton with an average crop yield of 2.1 ton/ha
 <sup>

 </sup> and an average market price of US$ 500–600/ton (derived from Alebel et al
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>), depending on the market prices for different cotton grades. Thus, the water used by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> can produce approximately 674,500 tons of cotton with a market value of US$ 0.95 to 1.0 billion per growing season. With a benefit to cost ratio of 1.49 reported for cotton production in Afar region

 </sup>, this results in a net benefit of approx. US$ 310–330 million per a growing season. Similarly, considering a water use for sugar cane of some 15,000 m
 <sup>3</sup>/ha/year and an average yield of approx. 37 tons sugar/ha
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>, the water used by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> would allow irrigation of some 210,000 ha of sugar cane, which would yield approx. 7,8 million tons of sugar. With a market price of an average of US$ 536/ton sugar and a net benefit to cost ratio of 1.12 was obtained from sugar cane production with optimal fertilizer application
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>, this results in a market value of approximately 4,2 billion US$ and a net benefit of approx. US$ 470 million per growing season.
