<p id="Par35">Depending on 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover, sap flow and ETa were estimated to range between 3 and 826 mm/day at a pixel size of 15 × 15 m (or the maximum value of 826 mm/day/pixel, is approximately equivalent to 3.67 mm) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Upscaling the results from sap flow of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees and ETa of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> stand from pixels to the regional scale revealed that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> consumed about 3.1 and 3.3 billion m
 <sup>3</sup> per year, respectively, over the invaded areas of 1.18 million ha in Afar Region, which approximates to 279 mm per year of water use and it is about 50% of the annual precipitation of the region.
