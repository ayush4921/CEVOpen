<p id="Par43">Various studies indicate that, although individual native and invasive tree species may have similar sap flow rates, but that invasive-dominated ecosystems were more likely to have higher sap flow rates per unit area than native-dominated ecosystems because invasive species grow in denser stands than natives and dense stands consume more water than sparsely stocked stands

 </sup> and this study were based on a shared methodology and should therefore be comparable. Nevertheless, there may be several other factors affecting the significantly higher transpiration revealed by the current study. First, the invasive species in Ethiopia and other parts of the tropical region in Eastern Africa, 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, is the evergreen plant which uses water throughout the year for its photosynthesis activities, whereas the 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa in South Africa shed leaves during the cold seasons and are thus likely to have periods with low transpiration and evapotranspiration. Secondly, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in Afar builds very dense thickets, due to past and partly ongoing utilization for charcoal production, which created multi-stemmed trees that use more water. Also, the deep-rooted 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> may benefit from the alluvial nature of the soil in Afar region which allows easy penetrations of the soil layers so as to abstract more water than native species do, although sandy soils drain more water to the groundwater table. This type of soil, in turn, forces the tree to grow deep tap-root systems in search for more water.
