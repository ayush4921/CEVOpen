<p id="Par45">Understanding the effect of vegetation change on transpiration and ET across habitat types (in our case drylands and floodplains) is important for scaling up since ET plays an important role in the water balance of hydrological catchments or landscapes

 </sup>. Similar to our approach, previous studies assessing forest canopy transpiration or evapotranspiration at the water catchment level used average species sap flux values and/or ET estimates per unit ground area across habitat types to scale-up to the landscape level

 </sup> reflect not only the current distribution but also the different levels of invasion across the region and are thus more accurate in upscaling impact at the water catchment or ecosystem level than presence/absence maps

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was developed using different driving factors (environmental, climatic, remote sensing and other important factors for its distribution) implemented on machine learning algorithms as species spatial patterns are important for understanding spatial estimates of transpiration. This is consistent with Loranty et al

 </sup> that incorporated atmospheric and edaphic drivers to upscale sap flow from trees and ET from stands level to an aspen-dominated forest across a upland-to-wetland gradient, and doing so in a spatial context, that achieved a more accurate estimate.
