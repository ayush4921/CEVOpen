<p id="Par47">Up-scaling of the water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> to the regional scale has immense implications to decision makers and land use planners. The Awash River is known to be a losing river system as the water abstracted by vegetation, mainly crop plants and IAPS, can be regarded as an abstraction from the river recharging system to the groundwater resource. Extensive abstraction of groundwater has serious consequences on the water availability to downstream, as well. Moreover, this study revealed that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> uses the groundwater throughout the year as the annual rainfall is by far less than the water consumed by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>, which affects water availability to other services by influencing ecosystem water budget that could be used for the provision of other ecosystem services and thus for supporting rural livelihoods, including crop production or fodder for livestock. Dzikiti et al

 </sup> showed that the decline in groundwater level under 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> stands can be attributed to the active water uptake by the trees to meet their transpirational demand. In addition, dense thickets of thorny 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees create physical barriers for domestic and wild animals to access surface water

 </sup>. Moreover, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> affects water availability for indigenous trees and herbaceous species, which also contributes to a degradation of ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services

 </sup>. For example, indigenous palatable grasses species such as 
 <italic>Chrysopogon plumulosus</italic> (Durfu)
 <italic>, Cenchrus ciliaris</italic> (Serdoitas) 
 <italic>and Seataria acromelaena</italic> (Mussa) and multipurpose trees species such as 
 <italic>Acacia tortilis</italic> (Eebto), 
 <italic>A. senegal</italic> (Adebo), 
 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> (Keselto) 
 <italic>and Dobera gelabera</italic> (Gersaito) are threatened by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, there is a need for sustainable management of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion in order to secure benefits from groundwater resources and other services provided by the ecosystems in this semi-arid and arid region.
