<p id="Par48">We acknowledge that the up-scaling of the water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> to the regional scale is based on a limited number of experimental sites and some assumptions that entail a certain level of uncertainty. All the four experimental sites were situated in the southern part of Afar Region and may therefore not be representative of the total area invaded by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, climatic conditions are similar across the lowlands of Afar Region, i.e. the area invaded by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>, with the same rainy seasons and comparable average temperatures across the year. Another caveat of our study is that the upscaling of ETa was based on measurements taken at one experimental site only. As it was not feasible to measure ETa at all four experimental sites, we triangulated it with sap flow values at site 1 and found that our ETa values were reasonable. Nevertheless, investigations on the variation in water use of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> across the invaded range in Afar Region as well as in neighboring countries would further improve our understanding of the impact of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> on the water balance of semi-arid and arid ecosystems in the tropical regions of Eastern Africa.
