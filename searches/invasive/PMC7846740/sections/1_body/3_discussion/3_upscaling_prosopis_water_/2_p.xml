<p id="Par46">The findings of this study indicate that between 8.3–9.1 billion liters of water per day are consumed by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in the invaded areas of the arid and semi-arid Afar Region. Hence, this fast-growing exotic tree is likely to exacerbate the effects of climate change on the provisioning of ecosystem services through its impact on ecosystem water budget. Based on the extremely low current water tariff for water by the Awash Basin Authority, which can be considered as a payment for ecosystems service by investors, the economic value of water used by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> potentially amounts to US$ 465,000 – 500,000 per year across the invaded range, which is equivalent to approximately 15—16 million Eth Birr per year. When assessing the net benefits of water use by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> in Afar in terms of market prices of cotton and sugar cane production capacity, the value of the water consumed by 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is much higher than that estimated from the water tariffs. As noted by Le Maitre et al
