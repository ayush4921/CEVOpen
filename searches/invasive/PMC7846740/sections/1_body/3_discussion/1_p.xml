<p id="Par37">The results of this study indicate that the invasive evergreen 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> uses a significant amount of water (3.1 to 3.3 billion m
 <sup>3</sup> per year over invaded areas) in the Afar Region. Considering that the annual precipitation in the study region is approximately 560 mm
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, our findings indicate that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> consumes about half of the amount of water received from precipitation in the invaded area in the Afar Region (Appendix 1).
