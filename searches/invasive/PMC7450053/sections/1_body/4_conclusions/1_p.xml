<p id="Par19">In recent years control of invasive species receives a special attention in order to protect natural habitats. The current research surveyed the effect of a single herbicide treatment on one isolated 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> stand located in open sand grassland of a protected area. Results of the very fine and temporal replicated sampling method demonstrated that single herbicide treatment modified not just the reproductive output of these invasive species but also their vegetative growth. The clones altered the resource allocation between reproduction and clonal growth in order to survive the herbicide application. The stand became fragmented after the herbicide application generating new hotspots for further clonal spread. Our mid-term case study showed that a large milkweed stand not only can survive a single herbicide treatment but regain its vitality in function of time. Therefore, the first and the second year after herbicide treatment could be optimal period for successful application of further herbicide treatment. The findings of the present study confirm that monitoring of invasive plant control is recommended to be continued for several years after herbicide treatment, especially in the case of clonal plants. Furthermore, long-term examination of the natural vegetation can also broaden our knowledge to clarify how herbicide applications modify natural community. Due to herbicide treatment diminished number of invasive plants might influence the recovery of native species. These results can be useful for plant management of invasive clonal plants or other type of herbicides in the future.
