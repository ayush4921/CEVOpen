<p id="Par16">In order to reveal the alterations density and regrowth, Kernel density was used. The Kernel density of the milkweed stand strongly decreased and the stand became fragmented forming three hotspots with shoot clusters due to the single herbicide treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Clonal plants show two main growth forms: phalanx growth form associated with space-occupancy strategy while the guerrilla is a foraging strategy

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>
 </sup>. However, the combined use of these two growth forms has already been shown in many species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>,

 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> has a flexible clonal structure, the plant is able to use denser shoot structure (phalanx type) in favourable habitats and sparser once (guerrilla type) in less suitable habitats
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. But in this study, the stand did not show any growth in the year of treatment (2014). The guerrilla growth type was typical in 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), showing that this type may serve survival after disturbance. In the next years (in 2016 and 2017), fragments of the stand began to use both growth types again. Our results show that 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> used both growth forms (phalanx and guerrilla) for the recovery. The plant is able to use a denser shoot structure for maintaining the formerly occupied area and sparser shoot structure for the colonization of new areas. It seems that the three fragments created new hotspots showing the high spreading potential of the species. It can be concluded that repeated herbicide treatment can be a strategy to prevent milkweed spread.
