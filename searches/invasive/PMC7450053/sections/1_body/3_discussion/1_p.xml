<p id="Par14">Our aims were to demonstrate the effects of a single herbicide treatment on the invasive clonal common milkweed. The herbicide treatment influenced the further spread and the trade-off between sexual reproduction and clonal propagation of the invasive common milkweed. There were huge shoot number differences between before and after the herbicide treatment period. Herbicide treatment caused a strong decrease in shoot numbers in the year of the treatment and in the first year after treatment. There are some studies that mechanical control causes a stronger resprouting in 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> stands in contrast to our results. One study has reported that one-time cultivation (as a mechanical control) has no effects on milkweed abundance in arable lands

 </sup>. A two years-long study reported that common milkweed shoots resprouted strongly after mechanical control

 <italic>Ailanthus altissima,</italic> Badalamenti et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup> found that more shoots were sprouted after cutting than with combined treatment (herbicide application and cutting). The most likely explanation for this is that dormant bud banks become active in the absence of apical dominance. In accordance with our study, herbicide treatment (even one-time application) is undoubtedly more effective than cultivation or cutting, as reported by Zalai et al.

 <italic>C. arvense</italic> were weaker and less dense in the year following herbicide treatment or mechanical control

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>

 <italic>Euphorbia esula</italic> and altered hormone synthesis in crown buds. Saunders and Pezeshki

 </sup> suggested that changes in leaf and shoot production in 
 <italic>Ludwigia peploides</italic> after herbicide treatment can be a result of translocation-induced hormesis effect. As it was observed in 
 <italic>C. arvense</italic>, glyphosate can translocate across the root toward root buds

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>

 <italic>A. syriaca</italic>, because of the similar root system architecture

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup> applied glyphosate to 
 <italic>Fragaria chiloensis</italic> shoots, they found that it was translocated from treated to untreated shoots in the same clone, causing death in both of them. This type of translocation was observed in our study in the year and after the first year of herbicide treatment (2014 and 2015). Therefore, the reduced number of milkweed shoots in this period could be a result of translocated herbicide by rhizomatic roots which could damage dormant bud banks.
