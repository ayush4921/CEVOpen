<p id="Par17">Based on these results we could determine that one single herbicide treatment of 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> stand resulted in severe shoot loss but many shoots could survive indicating that the single treatment was a successful control measure in short but not in the longer-term. Successful survival can be attributed to vegetative propagation, which produces adventitious shoot buds on rhizomatic roots

 </sup> creating a large dormant bud bank. Based on the study of Schmid

 </sup>, the activation of the bud bank in the case of other species depends on clone conditions. This dependence was observed in the case of 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic>, as several buds appeared on their rhizomatic roots. However, only one or a few of them are activated, whereas the others remain dormant in a given year

 </sup>. The drastically reduced pod numbers indicate that the pod number as a reproductive output can be a useful indicator for predicting or monitoring the vitality of clonal plants. Successful regrowth of 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> benefits greatly from its clonal characteristics and growth after treatment. An extensive dormant bud bank may be activated by disturbance

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>
 </sup> found that buds of 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> in the proximal part of the rhizomatic root system accumulated less radioactively labeled glyphosate than distal root buds. Therefore, proximal rhizomatic root buds are more dormant than distal ones and thus accumulate less glyphosate. The surviving and newly propagated buds on rhizomatic roots adjusted the numbers of emerging shoots in the years after treatment, and reconstruction of dormant bud banks in 2015 explains the spatial position of the shoots during that period. Our mid-term study demonstrated that a single application of herbicide is successful in the short but not enough on the longer term. The shoot number showed an increase over the longer-term but, the recovery of original shoot numbers in a milkweed stand takes a longer time. The complete destruction of a clone can only be accomplished by methods that affect the entire system of the bud bank and shoots because the mortality risk is distributed among the interconnected bud bank and shoots in a clone

 </sup>. This indicates that rhizomatous roots and bud banks can create a successful and persistent colonization system, thus making periodic control more effective than a one-time treatment. Thus, in spite of that single herbicide treatment is really suitable for density control in short-term
