<p id="Par15">The effects of herbicide treatment on reproductive characters (pod and pod-bearing shoots) have been rarely monitored in clonal plants. These reproductive characters play an important role in the spread as well as informs about viability. As a result of herbicide treatment, the pods disappeared in the year of the treatment and the first year after treatment and then they began to recover (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). From this data, it can be concluded that sexual reproduction was delayed in the two years after herbicide treatment and only began to increase thereafter, indicating that the stand allocated its resources in favor of clonal growth for survival. This is consistent with numerous observations that sexual reproduction is of secondary importance in clonal plant

 </sup>. However, herbicide treatment did not alter the proportions of shoot clusters compared to those before treatment (Fig.
