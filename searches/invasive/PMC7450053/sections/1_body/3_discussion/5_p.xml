<p id="Par18">Furthermore, herbicide treatment raises further questions concerning the native vegetation, especially in nature reserves. We did not observe any visible changes in the vegetation in the year of the treatment and the years after treatment. In contrast to this study, some short-term studies showed that the non-target vegetation was degraded by herbicide application. For example, Gibbson et al.

 </sup> also showed that the single herbicide spraying of common milkweed disturbed the vegetation, and it modified the succession to an earlier initial state. One possible explanation for the absence of non-target side effect is that manual lubrication was applied in the present study, which resulted in a more selective and efficient control method than spraying. These multiple goals require complex and long-term investigations (e.g. pre-invasion conditions are also taken into account).
