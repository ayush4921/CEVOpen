<p id="Par13">The density of the shoots changed after the treatment; the former dense milkweed stand almost disappeared by glyphosate treatment in 2014, whereas the size of the occupied area by the stand remained almost unchanged, as all the parts remained occupied after treatment (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It is important to note that before and in the year of herbicide application, all the solitary shoots and shoot clusters were recognized forming an extensive and strongly connected, dense stand with one focus point. Compared to the center, the density was lower at the edges of the stand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After the herbicide treatment, the stand had a lower density of shoots, the shoot clusters vanished, and the stand was fragmented into three smaller isolated foci. The density of these three parts increased after herbicide treatment with sparser edges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
