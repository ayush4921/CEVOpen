<p id="Par12">After herbicide treatment, we examined the stand composition from 2015 till 2017. While the number of shoots and pods temporarily decreased in the first year after treatment, an increase was observed over the longer-term. A further decrease was observed in the number of shoots in 2015, with almost half of the shoots that have survived from the previous year dying (from 102 survived shoots to 65; Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). An increase in the number of new shoots and pods was observed from the second year after treatment, although it did not reach its original densities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The number of solitary shoots increased moderately, whereas the number of those with two or three shoots/cluster decreased after treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The proportion of solitary shoots never decreased below 60%. The solitary shoots represented a higher proportion than in the first period: in 2015, the proportion of the solitary shoots was 90.76%. In 2016, it was 82.53% and in 2017, it was 93.22%. The number of pod-bearing shoots was low: in 2015, there were not pod-bearing shoots, while there were three in 2016 and 2017.
