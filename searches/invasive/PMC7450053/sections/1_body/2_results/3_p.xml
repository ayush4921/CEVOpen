<p id="Par11">In the year of herbicide treatment (2014), 388 shoots developed, but only 102 of them survived the treatment, but the pod production completely ceased. Due to the effects of the herbicide, 74% of the shoots died, although intact shoots were still observed in almost all areas of the stand (Figs.
