<p id="Par10">Before herbicide treatment, we examined the stand composition from 2011 till 2013 (Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This period had the highest shoot number (about 500 shoots) with small fluctuations. In 2012, there was a smaller decrease in the shoot number (22) compared to that in 2011. In the next year (2013), the shoot number increased to 536. The number of solitary shoots increased, whereas that of the more common shoot clusters (2 and 3 shoots/cluster) decreased in the stand. The pod number showed some annual fluctuations in this period with the highest pod numbers (305 pods) in 2012. The annual difference in the number of pod-bearing shoots was small, it increased slightly over the years. The largest increase in the pod-bearing shoot number was in 2012 compared to 2011, but the most pod-bearing shoots (56) emerged in 2013. And it increased by 4 pieces in 2013.
