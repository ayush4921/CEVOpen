<p id="Par7">The investigation extended to the whole stand, and the entire occupied area of the stand was covered with 2 m × 2 m quadrats, in which the localization of the shoots, the number of solitary shoots and clusters (maximum distance between shoots of 15 cm), and pod production of shoots were recorded. The positions of the shoots (to an accuracy of 5 cm) were necessary to depict the pattern of the stand; this allowed the monitoring of individual shoots. The precise location of the shoots was used to calculate a heat map (or Kernel density) to determine the shoot density interpolated over the whole stand. Pod production served as a measure of vitality. The sampling was repeated for 7 years (from 2011 to 2017) in every July. The investigation period was divided as follows: before (the first 3 years), during (hereafter year of treatment, 2014), and after (the last 3 years) treatment.</p>
