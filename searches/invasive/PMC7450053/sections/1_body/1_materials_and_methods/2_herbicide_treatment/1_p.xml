<p id="Par6">Herbicide treatment of common milkweed was conducted in the framework of a KEOP tender (KEOP-7.3.1.2-09-2010-0024). The Environment and Energy Operational Program (KEOP) was carried out by the Kiskunság National Park Directorate with the support of the European Union and co-financing from the European Regional Development Fund. This program aimed to suppress the invasive alien plants in the most valuable sand areas of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve. Based on the existing Hungarian practical experiences two methods were applied for the treatment of the target vegetation in the study site: machine broadcast or motor sprayer was applied in buffer areas (formerly arable areas where the target vegetation was very dense), while lubrication (manually) was applied in the more valuable areas (natural vegetations). In the latter case, it can be minimalized the active ingredient to reach the non-target vegetation. The optimal application time was when the target vegetation reached the height of 20–40 cm, until it bloomed (from May to June 2014)

 </sup>. Moreover, the study site is rather big and there are some hard-accessible parts. Whereas the examined stand embedded in natural vegetation the lubrication was the applied technology. In this case, the used herbicide was Medallon, within a 50% aqueous solution (2 l ha
 <sup>−1</sup>). Glyphosate was the active ingredient in Medallon (it is an EPSG synthase inhibitor). Glyphosate belongs to category G of the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee and category 9 of the Weed Science Society of America. The examined stand was treated by herbicide only once (in May 2014) over the 7-year study period (the treatment was not repeated at all). The time of the treatment (phenology) and the used chemical was suitable for a recent study of a basic model for the control of invasive clonal plants
