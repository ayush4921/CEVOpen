<p id="Par5">The study site is in the UNESCO biosphere reserve, Fülöpháza Sand Dunes in the Kiskunság National Park, Central Hungary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). According to the European Union Habitat Directive (92/43/CEE), Pannonic or open sand steppes (Natura 2000 code: 6,260) represent prominent biomes

 </sup>. Although these dry, nutrient-poor, calcareous sand habitats support only a few communities, many rare, endangered, and endemic species can be found in this area. The site has the following abiotic characteristics: groundwater level is at a high depth
