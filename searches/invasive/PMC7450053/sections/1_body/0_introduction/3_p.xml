<p id="Par4">Common milkweed 
 <italic>Asclepias syriaca</italic> is one of the most dangerous invasive transformer species currently widespread in Hungary and is spreading in Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Serbia, and several other countries

 </sup>. It primarily endangers psammophilous habitats where its structure differs from that of natural vegetation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>. It prefers mostly less heavy soils (well-drained sandy or sandy-loess soils). The colonization of 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> can be facilitated by some anthropogenic disturbance of the soils
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. The problems arising from the invasion of milkweed were primarily attributed to the assumption that it can inhibit the regeneration of natural vegetation

 <italic>A. syriaca</italic>, it was only recently added to the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>. Milkweed originated in North America but is reportedly established in Continental, Mediterranean, and Pannonian Europe
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>

 </sup>, and even though its shoots die back every autumn, it can resprout in the same place for extended periods
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. The clonal structure of 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> comprises solitary or few (2–5) groups of shoots that develop vegetatively by buds of plagiotropic rhizomatic roots
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. To adequately control common milkweed, the bud banks of its roots and lateral roots must be eliminated. Control or eradication is an increasingly important action from both agricultural and conservation perspectives

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>
 </sup>. Complicating matters is the fact that extermination itself can create suitable conditions for colonization (e.g., soil disturbance), and large areas can become permanently milkweed-free only with coordinated efforts and at enormous costs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. Nevertheless, herbicide treatment may be a cost-effective method to control extended stands of milkweed in strictly protected areas

 </sup>. The most frequently used herbicides for 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic> management are glyphosate and triclopyr, whereas fluroxypyr or dicamba are rarely used. These are often used individually or in combination with each other or with some level of mechanical control

 </sup>. Relatively little information is available on the mid-term or long-term effects of post-emergent herbicides on 
 <italic>A. syriaca</italic>. Here we report one of the first and longest monitoring periods of one-time herbicide treatment on a common milkweed stand and analyzed the before, after and during treatment effects. The basic hypothesis of the study is that clonality is an important factor for resistance to herbicide treatment. However, we assumed that a single herbicide treatment influences not only the further spread but also the vegetative and generative propagation of the invasive clonal plant. Therefore, we surveyed the complete shoot network of an isolated common milkweed stand in a long term period. We proposed the following questions: (a) How does the single treatment modify the number of shoots, shoot clusters, and reproductive characters (such as pods and pod-bearing) of common milkweed in the mid-term (three years after application)? (b) How does the stand density change after the single herbicide treatment? Which strategies are used by this invasive species to recover as the stand creates a denser or sparser shoot-network due to re-establish the original area? Based on these results it could be determined how the stand is able to survive the herbicide application. Furthermore, could be determined whether a single herbicide treatment is a successful control measure in the short and mid-term.
