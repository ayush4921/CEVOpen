  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>

 </sup>. Nevertheless, herbicide application of invasive species are rather arguable as their application negatively influence the growth of native species, composition of the species and abiotic factors (quality of the above and below ground water supply, soil and air) in protected areas

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>

 </sup>. Therefore, the herbicide application must be well planned and localized, the applied chemicals should be safe and effective. However, the use of these products in non-agricultural areas are very rarely accessible
