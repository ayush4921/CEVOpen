 <caption> Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations of unigenes by Blast2GO and KOBAS, respectively. The GO classifications of S. calendulacea ( A) and S. trilobata ( B) , included three major classification categories: Biological processes (Red), cellular components (Green) and molecular functions (Blue) . The x-axis represents different GO terms, and the number of genes is shown on the y-axis. The unigenes for S. calendulacea ( C) and S. trilobata ( D) were assigned to KEGG pathways. The x-axis represents the percentages of genes numbers in the pathways, while the y-axis represents the different pathways. Different bar colors represent different pathways. </caption>
