 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> not only has high net photosynthetic capacity per unit, but also has a larger leaf surface, which is mainly due to the regulation of two major hormones in the leaves, including CTK and auxin (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B,C). Studies have found that phytohormones play important roles in leaf development

 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>. A large leaf surface could ensure that plants obtain more light energy for photosynthesis
