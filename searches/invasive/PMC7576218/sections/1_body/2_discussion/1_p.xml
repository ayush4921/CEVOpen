 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> is one of the fast-growing invasive plants in South China. In the invaded area, 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> has a large leaf area, leaf biomass and total biomass per plant were much higher than those of native species, 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,D,E). This may be attributed to the fact that the photosynthetic capacity of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> is stronger than that of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>. Thus, we analyzed the difference in the photosynthetic capacity of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> and its native plants by combined analysis of the physiological ecology and transcriptome. This could better explain the molecular mechanism underlying invasion by this species.
