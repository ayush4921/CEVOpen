<p id="Par14">In this study, we found that the gas exchange parameters per unit leaf area of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were higher than those of the native plant, including P
 <sub>n</sub>, G
 <sub>s</sub>, T
 <sub>r</sub> and C
 <sub>i</sub>, which ensures that 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> has higher photosynthetic capacity in the invasion area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A–D). At the same time, the changes in WUE also showed that 
 <italic>S. trilobat</italic>a had higher light energy and water utilization efficiency than 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). This result was consistent with the results of the field investigation of Wu et al. Studies have shown that Chl fluorescence is a probe of photosynthesis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Compared with 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, the ETR and Φ
 <sub>PSII</sub> were higher in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F,G), which indicated that the high photosynthetic capacity was related to its strong electron transfer ability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. It has been well acknowledged that Chl and Rubisco have often been considered indices of the light-harvesting and Calvin cycle capacities of leaves, respectively, which play an important role in photosynthesis capacity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. The leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> had higher Chl and Rubisco contents than those of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, which was consistent with the trend observed for P
 <sub>n</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C,G). Rubisco/Chl had a higher ratio in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>, indicating that Rubisco accumulation was faster than Chl content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>H). This could effectively prevent excess light energy from damaging the light system
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, the Chl 
 <italic>a/b</italic> and Car/Chl ratio in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were lower than those in the native species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E,F). The main reason may be that the synthesis of Chl 
 <italic>b</italic>, the main photopigment, was faster than that of Chl 
 <italic>a</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A,B). This could ensure that 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> leaves captured more light energy for photosynthesis and had higher photosynthetic efficiency. In contrast, the light system of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> was more prone to oxidative stress than that of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> under the same conditions
 <italic>.</italic> It was found that the ROS (including O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>-</sup> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) accumulation in 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> were much more severe than that in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (Supplement Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). ROS accumulation can directly or indirectly initiate membrane lipid peroxidation, resulting in membrane damage and electrolyte leakage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The MDA content and relative conductivity in 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> were higher than those of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (Supplement Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>B,C), indicating that the activities of SOD, POD and CAT in 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> were also higher (Supplement Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>D–F). Studies have shown that high antioxidant enzyme activity is an important defense mechanism for ROS scavenging
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, we found that compared with 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>, these was higher carotenoids content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D) and NPQ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H) in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, which implied that the dissipation of excess light energy was also one of the protective mechanisms of photosynthetic organs in leaves
