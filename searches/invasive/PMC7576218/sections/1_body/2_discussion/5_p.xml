<p id="Par17">In conclusion, strong photosynthetic capacity is one of the inherent advantages of 
 <italic>S. trilobata.</italic> The key enzyme genes in the light system of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were highly expressed and could regulate its high photosystem activity and ETR. This could ensure its strong light harvesting ability, and carbon assimilation ability, and high photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area. In addition, the leaf area was also large under the action of CTK and Auxin. These factors ensured that 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> had higher plant biomass than the native plant, allowing successful invasion by 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> in South China.
