<p id="Par15">These physiological findings were further corroborated by RNA-Seq and real-time qRT-PCR assisted gene expression analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The expression levels of genes in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were different from those in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). By further comparing the differences of expression in the the photosynthetic pathway genes, we found that the genes encoding key proteases were highly expressed in the photosystem of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). There are two photosystems, namely, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), on the plant thylakoid membrane, which are responsible for capturing and converting light energy, respectively

 </sup>. The D1 protein, a key protein subunit of PSII, is encoded by the 
 <italic>PsbA</italic> gene. We found that 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> had higher expression levels of the 
 <italic>PsbA</italic> gene than the native plant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). This may be due to the high efficiency of the D1 protein synthesis and turnover process, which ensures a high photosynthetic rate in chloroplasts

 </sup>. Moreover, the gene encoding protein II (
 <italic>PsbP</italic>) of OEC was composed of three peptide chains and a manganese polymer with molecular weights of 16, 23 and 33 kDa, respectively. The expression level of the 
 <italic>PsbP</italic> gene in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D), which indicated that PSII had strong stability with the manganese polymer and ensured its strong photosynthetic ability. This was consistent with the results showing that OEC expression in 
 <italic>Spiraea tomentosa</italic> was decreased and adapted to a low-light environment with low photosynthetic capacity

 </sup>. PSI, a multiprotein pigment complex, is involved in the coordination of the synthesis of Chl and carotene

 </sup>. It was also found that the protease genes including 
 <italic>PsaE, PsaD</italic> and 
 <italic>PsaO</italic> were highly expressed in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>, which was consistent with the high content of Chl in the leaves. In addition, the protease complexes related to photosynthetic electron transfer, including 
 <italic>PetE</italic>, 
 <italic>PetF</italic> and 
 <italic>PetH</italic>, were encoded by the 
 <italic>PC</italic>, 
 <italic>FD</italic> and 
 <italic>FNR</italic> genes respectively, which indicated that the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> had higher photosynthetic electron transfer capacity. In our study, we also found that Rubisco, the cornerstone of photosynthesis, had high gene expression levels in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). This ensured that the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> have high carbon assimilation capacity. Thus, the high expression of the key protein-encoding genes in the photosynthetic system was one of the important reasons for the high photosynthetic capacity of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>.
