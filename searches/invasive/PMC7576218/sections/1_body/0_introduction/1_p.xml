<p id="Par2">When a species is introduced into a new environment, it may not adapt to the new environment, it may die out quickly, or it may resist the external environment to survive and reproduce. The species that survive may become competitive and settle in new areas and niches at high speed, eventually becoming successful invaders. In the twenty-first century, the biological invasion is one of the main environmental threats to biodiversity worldwide. It not only destroys the biodiversity, structure and function of the ecosystem, but also causes substantial economic losses to the invaded areas
