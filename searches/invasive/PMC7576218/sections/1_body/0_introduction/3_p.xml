<p id="Par4">The comprehensive expression profiles of genes involved in photosynthesis in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> are important for understanding the molecular basis and the differences in gene expression compared to that in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>. Development of the Illumina next-generation sequencing technique has provides a convenient and effective means to obtain genome resources from non-model species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. The technique also allows the effective determination of the genetic basis and mechanism of successful invasion based on a comparative study of invasive and noninvasive species, including

 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>. Our study provides a material basis for comprehensively elucidating the invasion mechanism of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> at the transcriptome level in the future.
