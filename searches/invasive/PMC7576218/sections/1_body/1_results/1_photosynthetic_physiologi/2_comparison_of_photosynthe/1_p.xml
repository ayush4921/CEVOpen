 </sup>. In this study, we compared the differences in photosynthetic capacity between two species. The results showed that the net photosynthetic rate (P
 <sub>n</sub>) of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was significantly higher than that of its native congener 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The intercellular CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (C
 <sub>i</sub>) and transpiration (T
 <sub>r</sub>) had the same trend as P
 <sub>n</sub> while the stomatal conductance (G
 <sub>s</sub>) and water use efficiency (WUE) were slightly higher than those of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B–E). The photosynthetic rate of a plant is closely related to the electron transfer in chloroplasts. Compared with 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, the chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence parameters showed that the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> had higher electron transfer ability, for which the electron transport rate (ETR) value was close to 130 and the actual photochemical efficiency (Φ
 <sub>PSII</sub>) had the same trend as ETR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F,G). However, the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was significantly higher in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> than 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H)
 <italic>.</italic> These results indicated that PSII of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> had high activity and strong photosynthetic capacity. Besides, the contents of photosynthetic pigment and Rubisco protein in leaves were also important indicators of photosynthetic capacity. The contents of Chl
 <italic>a</italic>, Chl
 <italic>b</italic> and Chl were also high in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> while Carotenoid (Car) content in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> was slightly higher than that in invasive plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D). In contrast, the Chl
 <italic>a</italic>/
 <italic>b</italic> and Car/Chl ratios in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were lower than those in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E,F). Moreover, 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> also had higher (by nearly three-fold) Rubisco content in the leaves than 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G). The Rubisco/Chl ratio had the same trend as Rubisco (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>H).
