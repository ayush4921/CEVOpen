<p id="Par5">With regard to the phenotypes of the two species, the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were wide and large, nearly twice as large as those of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The results showed that the plant hormone content including the auxin and cytokinin (CTK) content, in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was nearly twice as high as that in the native species, which may be one of the reasons for ensuring the larger leaf area of an invasive plant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B,C). The leaf and total biomass of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were higher than those of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D,E). These phenomena indicated that the growth of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was better than that of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> in the invaded area.
