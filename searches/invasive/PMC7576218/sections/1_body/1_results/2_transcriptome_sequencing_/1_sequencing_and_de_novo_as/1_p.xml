<p id="Par7">Total RNA from the leaves of the two species was extracted and sent to the Novogene for construction of a cDNA library, which was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. After de novo assembly and removal of low-quality reads, 470,401 contigs with an average length of 762.06 bp were obtained for 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, compared with 429,536 contigs with a length of 762.92 bp for 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>. Sequence clustering was performed by CD-HIT, and the total numbers of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> unigenes were 177,069 and 159,366, with average lengths of 645.96 bp and 660.05 bp, respectively. The quality evaluation of the unigenes showed that the GC content and N50 values of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were 39.18%/1025 bp and 38.76%/1037 bp, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
