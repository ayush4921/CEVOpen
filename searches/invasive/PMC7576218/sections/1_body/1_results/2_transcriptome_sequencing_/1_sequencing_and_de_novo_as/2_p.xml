 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, the number of contigs with sequence lengths was less than 300 bp was 86,091 (18%). A total of 161,137 (34%) contigs ranged in length from 300–600 bp with a high number of genes. The number of contigs ranging in length from 600–1200 bp and the number of contigs ranging in length from 1200–3000 bp was similar (106,811 (23%) and 112,378 (24%), respectively), and the remaining contigs were longer than 3000 bp (Fig.

 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>, the length of approximately 80,854 (19%) contigs was less than 300 bp. A total of 146,284 (34%) contigs ranged in length from 300–600 bp. The number of contigs ranging in length from 600–1200 bp and 1200–3000 bp was similar (95,103 (22%) and 103,523 (24%), respectively), and the remaining contig lengths were longer than 3000 bp (Fig.
