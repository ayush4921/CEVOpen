<p id="Par12">The photosynthetic pathway was further analyzed based on the previous results of photosynthetic physiology analysis and unigene functional annotation. In this study, we found that many photosynthetic genes, including 
 <italic>CP43, CP47</italic> and 
 <italic>PsbA</italic> in photosystem II, 
 <italic>PsaD</italic> in photosystem I, 
 <italic>PetC</italic> in cytochrome b6/f, the ferredoxin (Fd) gene (
 <italic>PetF</italic>) and ferredoxin-NADP
 <sup>+</sup> reductase (FNR) gene (
 <italic>PetH</italic>) in photosynthethic electron transport, were higher expressed in leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata,</italic> while lower in 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). The key protease genes of photosynthesis were also confirmed by qPCR. The results showed that the expression of the photosystem II D1 protein gene (
 <italic>PsbA</italic>) in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was nearly 10 times higher than that in 
 <italic>S. chinensis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). In addition, the Rubisco large subunit (
 <italic>RubiscoL</italic>) and oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) genes (
 <italic>PsbP</italic>) were also highly expressed in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>, which were at 7 and 4.5 times higher than that of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, respectively. The qPCR results were consistent with those of RNA-Seq (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C,D).
