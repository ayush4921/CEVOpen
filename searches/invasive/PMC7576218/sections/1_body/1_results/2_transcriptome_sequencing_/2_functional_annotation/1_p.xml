<p id="Par9">Unigenes obtained from the assemblies of two species were compared to four major databases (Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, GO) for annotation purposes. Of the 289,093 unigenes of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea,</italic> 150,846 (NR, 52.18%), 115,711 (Swiss-Prot, 40.03%), 60,116 (KEGG, 20.79%), and 97,957 (GO, 33.88%) were functionally annotated. By contrast, 119,350 (NR, 46.08%), 96,637 (Swiss-Prot, 37.31%), 49,159 (KEGG, 18.98%), and 83,712 (GO, 32.32%) of the 259,020 unigenes of
