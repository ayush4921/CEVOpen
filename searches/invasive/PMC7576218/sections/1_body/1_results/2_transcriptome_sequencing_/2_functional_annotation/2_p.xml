<p id="Par10">Gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned to the annotated sequences from 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> and were categorized into the three GO categories, namely, biological processes, molecular functions and cell components. The results showed that the distribution and percentages of the assigned gene functions were similar in both species (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B). With regard to biological processes, 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were prominent in metabolic processes (50.95%/51.26%), cell processes (53.98%/54.23%) and single-organism processes (37.70%/38.14%), with more gene numbers. There were high proportions of gene numbers in the two species were involved in cell components, including cells (27.22%/26.93%) and cell parts (27.22%/26.93%). Similarly, genes with had high percentages of binding (53.99%/53.51%) and catalytic activity (43.06%/ 44.02%) were represented in the molecular function category.
