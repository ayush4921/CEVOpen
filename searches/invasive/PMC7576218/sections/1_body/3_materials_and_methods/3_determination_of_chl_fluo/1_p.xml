<p id="Par20">Chl fluorescence parameters of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> were measured using a Chl fluorescence imaging system (CF Imager, Technological Ltd. Colchester, UK). Five 8 mm leaf discs were placed in 12-well plates (each hole was filled with water). The leaf discs were adapted to the dark for 20 min before measurement. The determination procedure was set as follows: the saturated light pulse was 6162 mol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> (pulse time 1 s), the F
 <sub>m</sub> was induced, and the photochemical light intensity was 800 mol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The photosynthetic electron transfer efficiency (ETR), actual photochemical efficiency (Φ
 <sub>PSII</sub>) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were measured as described by Li et al.
