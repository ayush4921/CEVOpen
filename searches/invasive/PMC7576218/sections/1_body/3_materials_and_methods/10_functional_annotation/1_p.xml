<p id="Par27">To obtain the direction, function, and pathway annotations of unigenes, the unigenes of two species were searched against the nonredundant protein (Nr) database, Swiss-Prot protein database, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database using BLASTx with an 
 <italic>E</italic>-value cut-off of &lt; 10
 <sup>−5</sup>. Gene ontology (GO) annotation of unigenes for describing biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components was performed using Blast2GO software.
