<p id="Par22">Gas exchange parameters of leaves were measured by a LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) on a sunny morning (8:30–11:30). The humidity was 55 ± 5%, and the leaf temperature was 30 °C. Photosynthesis in leaves was stabilized by light adaptation. The photon flux density (PPFD) was as the growth of light intensity of the plant, which was 800 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The net photosynthetic rate (P
 <sub>n</sub>), intercellular CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (C
 <sub>i</sub>), stomatal conductance (G
 <sub>s</sub>), and transpiration rate (T
 <sub>r</sub>) of the leaves were recorded when the parameters of photosynthesis were stable.
