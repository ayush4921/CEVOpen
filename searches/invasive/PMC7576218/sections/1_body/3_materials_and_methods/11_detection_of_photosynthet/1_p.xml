<p id="Par28">RNA was extracted from leaves with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized by TopScript RT DryMIX (dT18) (Enzynomic, Daejeon, Korea) and the M-MLV reverse transcriptase kit (Takara). The relative expression of genes was determined by a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (CFX96, Bio-Rad, USA). The SYBR Premix Ex Taq II Kit (Takara) was used to analyze the relative expression of the oxygen-evolving complex-coding gene (
 <italic>OEC</italic>), D
 <sub>1</sub> protein-coding gene (
 <italic>PsbA</italic>) and Ribose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase gene (
 <italic>RubiscoL</italic>) in PSII. Each 10 μL aliquot of reaction solution contained: 5 μL of SYBR Premix Ex Tap II, 0.2 μL of each primer, template cDNA (&lt; 100 ng) and added ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O in a total volume of 10 μL. The reaction cycle was as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 39 cycles (95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 34 s), and 1 cycle for recording a melt curve at 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 5 s. The expression of related genes was calculated by 2
 <sup>−△△CT</sup>. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal reference. The forward and reverse primers corresponding to the internal reference gene and the target gene are shown in Table
