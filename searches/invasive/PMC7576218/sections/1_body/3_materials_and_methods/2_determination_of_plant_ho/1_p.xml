<p id="Par19">Leaf samples of 0.05 g were weighed and add 1 mL of precooled PBS buffer to fully grind the samples. The grinding solution was poured into a 2 mL centrifuge tube, which was subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm, 10 min. Its supernatant was used for the determination of two plant hormones, including auxin and CTK. The determination method was referred to the instructions of the kit (Shenzhen Ziker Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China). The kits were all tested by double antibody one-step sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The absorbance (OD value) was measured at 450 nm wavelength with a multimode plate reader (EnSpire, PerkinElmer, USA), and the sample concentration was calculated.</p>
