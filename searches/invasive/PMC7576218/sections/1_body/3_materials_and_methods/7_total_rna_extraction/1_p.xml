<p id="Par24">The total RNA from 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Promega). The RNA quality of the samples was determined by UV spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis; the OD
 <sub>260/280</sub> and OD
 <sub>260/230</sub> absorbance ratio were used to evaluate RNA purity, and RNA integrit was confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples with poor quality were re-extracted.
