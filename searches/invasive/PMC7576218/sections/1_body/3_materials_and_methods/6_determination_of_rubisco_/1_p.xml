<p id="Par23">Leaf samples weighing 0.05 g were placed into a mortar with a small amount of quartz sand and ground with 2 mL of plant extraction buffer (pH 7.8, including 50 mM Tris–HCl, 20 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA-Na
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM PMSF). The fluid obtained after grinding was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2 × protein loading buffer in a boiling water bath for 5 min and then stored at 4 °C. Rubisco protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), including 4% concentrated gel and 12.5% separated gel

 </sup>. The amount of protein sample was 20 μL, the concentration voltage was 75 V for 30 min and the separation voltage was 110 V for 60 min. The large and small subunits (55 and 15 kDa, respectively) of the Rubisco protein were identified according to molecular mass, and the included marker was stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. ImageJ software was used to analyze the gray value of the Rubisco protein band.
