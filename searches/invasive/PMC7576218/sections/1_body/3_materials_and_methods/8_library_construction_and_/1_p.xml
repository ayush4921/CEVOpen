<p id="Par25">The Novogene NGS RNA Library Prep Kit was used to construct the libraries from the total RNA samples of the two species. The constructed libraries were tested for quality by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and ABI Step One Plus Real-time PCR System, and the libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform after passing the quality test. Sequence data were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession numbers SRR8755022\SRR8755023\SRR8755024 (
