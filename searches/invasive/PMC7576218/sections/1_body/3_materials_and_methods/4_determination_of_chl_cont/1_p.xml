<p id="Par21">Fresh leaf samples of 0.05 g were weighed and placed in 10 mL centrifugal tubes. They were quickly crushed with metal rods, and then 4 mL of an 80% acetone solution was added and extracted overnight at 4 °C. The absorbance of the extract was determined at 663 nm and 645 nm using a UV–Vis 2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), and 80% acetone was used as a blank control. The contents of Chl
