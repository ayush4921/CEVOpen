 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> were collected from the South China Botanical Garden, Guangzhou, China. The stems were cut into 8–10 cm lengths with two internodes for cultivation via cuttings in an incubator. The incubation conditions included a light intensity of 100 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>, a photoperiod of 14 h (10 h of darkness) and a temperature of 25 °C. After cultivation for half a month, the cutting seedlings were transplanted into pots containing Hoagland’s nutrient solution. After 30 days of cultivation, leaves of the two species with similar growth were collected for imaging with a digital camera (D7000, Nikon, Japan), and the leaf biomass and total biomass of individual plants were measured. The experiment was repeated five times.
