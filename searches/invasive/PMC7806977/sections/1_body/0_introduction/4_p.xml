<p id="Par5">The high diversity and extensive geographic distribution of solanaceous plants may have played an important role in the rapid and continuous spread of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> into new regions. Thus, in this study we seeked to answer the following fundamental question: how is the biological performance of the tomato pinworm influenced by host plant species? To answer this question the oviposition preference of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> on a range of solanaceous species was investigated and biological life tables for the tomato pinworm on each of these plant species were constructed.
