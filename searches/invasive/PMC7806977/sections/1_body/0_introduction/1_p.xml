<p id="Par2">The introduction of non-indigenous species into new regions can be directly related to natural dispersion or to anthropic actions. Humans have caused accidental and deliberate dispersal of pests for millennia. Ancient human migrations and trade led to the early spread of animals and domesticated plants, along with associated parasites

 </sup>. However, the introduction of non-indigenous species has intensified due to increasing global trade, with pest species rapidly spreading around the world, markedly as events post-Columbus

 </sup>. The establishment of nonindigenous species in new regions depends on biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors include the presence or absence of natural enemies and the presence of suitable host plants. Abiotic factors are related to suitable environmental conditions and the effectiveness of protective measures adopted by man
