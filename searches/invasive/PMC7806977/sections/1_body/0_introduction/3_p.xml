 </sup>. The Solanaceae are one of the most diverse plant families among the angiosperms, with approximately 9000–10,000 species and approximately 2000 of those species belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Solanum</italic>. Members of this family occur in all the continents, except Antactica. The highest numbers of species are found in tropical and temperate climes, with a significant predominance in the Neotropics. Plants within this family vary from ephemeral herbs to large forest trees and many species are found colonizing areas modified by agricultural practices
