<p id="Par6">The tomato pinworms used in the bioassays were obtained from a colony which was established from insects originally collected from commercial tomato crops in Viçosa, Minas Gerias State, Brazil in 1994. The colony was initiated with approximately 200 field-collected individuals. The laboratory colony was maintained following the methodology of Silva et al.

 </sup>, and kept under controlled conditions: temperature (25 ± 0.5 °C), photoperiod (12 h L: 12 h D) and relative humidity (75 ± 1%). The insects were reared in wooden cages (40 × 40 × 40 cm) covered with fine mesh netting. One cage was used for oviposition; one for maintaining the leaves with eggs and first instar larvae; one containing second, third and fourth instar larvae and one cage for pupae and adult emergence. The larvae were fed on tomato leaves of the “Santa Clara” variety, cultivated in a greenhouse without application of insecticides. The tomato pinworm population used in the bioassays was approximately the hundredth generation of this insect.
