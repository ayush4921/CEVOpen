<p id="Par7">For bioassays, the Solanaceae used here included six cultivated species and four non-cultivated plant species, which occur naturally in tomato growing regions in Brazil. The cultivated solanaceous species were tomato 
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L. (variety: Santa Clara), potato 
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L. (variety Ágata), green pepper 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> L. (variety All Big), pepper 
 <italic>Capsicum chinense</italic> Jacquin (variety Cumari do Pará), gilo 
 <italic>Solanum gilo</italic> Raddi (variety Verde Claro), and eggplant 
 <italic>Solanum melongena</italic> L. (variety Comprida Roxa). The seeds were obtained from a local market. The non-cultivated species were wild tomato 
 <italic>Solanum habrochaites</italic>, American black nightshade 
 <italic>Solanum americanum</italic> Mill., “jurubeba” 
 <italic>Solanum paniculatum</italic> L. and “jua” 
 <italic>Solanum aculeatissimum</italic> Jacq. (1787). The seeds of the above listed species were obtained from a germplasm bank (Vegetable Gene Bank of the Federal University of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil) or from collecting in vegetable cultivation areas. The plant seedlings were grown in styrofoam cell trays (68 × 34 × 5 cm) with 125 plugs (filled with vermiculite). After 30 days, the seedlings were transplanted to 6 L plastic pots containing substrate composed of 1/3 cattle manure and 2/3 soil. The soil fertility was corrected in accordance with agronomical recommendations. Plants were watered according to the daily necessity of each species. The temperature of the greenhouse was maintained at approximately 27 °C.
