<p id="Par10">As the adults emerged from the pupae, one male and one female of the same age were transferred to a plastic oviposition cage (11.3 cm in diameter and 23.4 cm in depth). The oviposition cage was closed at the top with fine mesh netting to aid ventilation. In each cage one leaf disc from each host plant (6.2 cm in diameter) was offered for oviposition. The discs were placed in Petri dishes containing a layer of cottonwool moistened with distilled water. The number of eggs laid by the females was recorded daily and the leaf discs were replaced at that time. The adults were fed with a honey solution (10%).</p>
