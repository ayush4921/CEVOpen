<p id="Par9">This experiment was performed by constructing biological life tables for the tomato pinworm. In the greenhouse, under the same conditions as described above, thirty 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> neonate larvae were transferred individually to leaves of each plant species. Prior to starting the experiments all plants were inspected and leaves with any visible symptoms of fungal disease were removed. The larval instars were determined from the width of the head capsule or exuvia from molted larvae. At the end of the fourth instar (prepupae), the larvae were removed and placed in test tubes and fed with pieces of plant leaves from each species until they pupated. The pupae were then sexed and weighed. Mortality of the larvae and pupae were recorded on a daily basis, as was the duration of the larval and pupal stages.
