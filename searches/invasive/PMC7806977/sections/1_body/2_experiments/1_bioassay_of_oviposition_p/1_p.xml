<p id="Par8">Oviposition preference experiments were performed in the greenhouse (27 ± 3 °C; 60 ± 5% RH and 14L:10D) using 12 wooden cages (100 × 100 × 80 cm) covered in netting. One plant of each species was randomly placed in a circle within each cage. Fifty pairs of adult 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> (50 two-day-old males and 50 females) were released into each cage and provided with a honey solution (10%) as a food source. Twenty-four hours later the adults were removed and the number of eggs laid on each plant species was counted. Each cage was considered as one replicate. In this experiment 1200 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> adults (600 females and 600 males) and 12 plants of each species were used.
