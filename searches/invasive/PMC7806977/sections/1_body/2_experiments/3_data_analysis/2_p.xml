 </sup> for SAS (SAS Institute 2000). The Maia method allows for the use of the log-rank test to analyse the different survival curves. The parameters calculated were; net reproductive rate (R
 <sub>0</sub>), intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), and finite rate of increase (λ, individuals/females/day), mean generation interval (T), generation doubling time (Dt, day).
