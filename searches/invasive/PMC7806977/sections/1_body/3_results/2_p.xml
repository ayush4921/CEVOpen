<p id="Par21">The mortality rates of the immature stages of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> were significantly affected by the plant species on which they developed (F = 67.80; df = 9, 50; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Mortality rates of the larval and pupal stages, when neonate insects were placed on the leaves of different plant species, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The Scott Knott test separated the plant species into five groups when considering mortality rates (larvae and pupae). The first group consisted of 
 <italic>C. annuum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. chinense</italic> and 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic> (100% mortality). The second group consisted of 
 <italic>S. aculeatissimum</italic> (83.33% mortality) and 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> (72.65% mortality). The third group was 
 <italic>S. gilo</italic> (59.2% mortality) and 
 <italic>S. melogena</italic> (60.1% mortality). The fourth group consisted of 
 <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> (37.55% mortality) and 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (35.48% mortality). The lowest rates of larval and pupal mortality occurred on potato plants 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> (16.35%), which was significantly different to the other four groupings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For 
 <italic>C. annuum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. chinense</italic> and 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic>, larvae were observed to continue crawling on the leaf surfaces for long periods without creating mines.
