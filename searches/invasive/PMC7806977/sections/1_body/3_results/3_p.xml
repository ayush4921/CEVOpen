<p id="Par22">In the analysis to determine the effect of the host plant on the biology and fecundity of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic>, data for 
 <italic>S. aculeatissimum</italic> was not included due to the low number of adults developing from the immature stages. For 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> developmental factors on different host plants, the larval period (F = 50.99; df = 5, 533; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), pupal period (F = 2.44; df = 5, 533; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.034), adult longevity (F = 32.08; df = 5, 152; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and lifespan (F = 5.23; df = 5, 152; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were all affected by the host plant species. The longest larval period was observed on 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> (20.47 days) and the shortest on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (13.86 and 14.52 days respectively; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> was unique in that development of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> on this plant resulted in an increase in the pupal period (11.58 days). The pupal period was 1.43 days longer than that of insects developing on 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>. Adult longevity was highest on 
 <italic>S. melogena</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> (35.77 and 31.97 days respectively) and lowest on 
 <italic>S. lycopersum</italic> (26.6 days). The shortest lifespan (larval, pupal and adult longevity) was observed on 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (53.62 days) but this result did not differ from the lifespan on 
 <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> (51.27 days) and 
 <italic>S. gilo</italic> (54.08 days). On the other hand, the lifespan was highest on 
 <italic>S. melogena</italic> (63.34 days) and 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> (61.70 days) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
