 <italic>Tuta absoluta</italic> oviposition preference was significantly influenced by the plant species offered to this insect (F = 144.91; df = 9, 110; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The highest percentage of eggs was laid on tomato 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> leaves (51.15%), followed by potato 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> (17.64%) and wild tomato 
 <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> (10.40%) (Fig.

 <italic>S. gilo</italic> (2.32%), 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic> (1.27%), 
 <italic>C. chinense</italic> (0.97%) and 
 <italic>C. annuum</italic> (0.79%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). There was a significant difference between the percentage of eggs laid on tomato plants when comparing plants grouped into cultivated and non-cultivated solanaceous varieties (F = 48.35; df = 2, 33; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Tomato plants were preferred when compared to all other cultivated or non-cultivated plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) and the total number of eggs laid on cultivated plant species was similar to the number laid on non-cultivated plants.
