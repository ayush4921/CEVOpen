<p id="Par25">The cluster analysis (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) assembled the plant species into three groups (A, B and C). Cluster A (99% similarity) included 
 <italic>C. annum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. chinense</italic> and 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic>, which were classified as unsuitable for 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic>. Cluster B denominated as the intermediate group, was divided into two subclusters (B1 and B2). Subcluster B1 (92% similarity) grouped 
 <italic>S. aculeatissimum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> together. Subcluster B2 (80.76% similarity) consisted of 
 <italic>S. gilo</italic>, 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic> and 
 <italic>S. habrochaites</italic>. Cluster C, considered as the most susceptible host plants group (78.40% similarity), consisting of 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>.
