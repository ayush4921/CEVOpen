<p id="Par23">Pupal weight was significantly affected by plant species (F = 32.08; df = 5, 533; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The highest weight was observed on 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tuberrosum</italic> (3.63 mg and 3.89 mg respectively). The lowest pupal weight was observed on 
 <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> and 
 <italic>S. melogena</italic> (2.71 mg and 2.56 mg respectively). The pre-oviposition period was also significantly affected by plant species (F = 2.64; df = 5, 72; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), the longest pre-oviposition period occurred on 
 <italic>S. gilo</italic> (3.50 days), whilst insects offered other plant species had similar pre-oviposition periods. The oviposition periods of adult 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> were not affected by host plant species (F = 1.68; df = 5, 71; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.15). However, the daily (F = 13.52; df = 5, 72; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and total fecundity (F = 12.50; df = 5, 72; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were highest when the larvae were reared on 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, with a daily mean fecundity of 13.41 eggs/female and a total mean fecundity of 211.88 eggs/female. For potato 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>, daily mean fecundity was 10 eggs/female and total mean fecundity was 188 eggs/female (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The lowest daily and total fecundities were observed for adults reared from larvae that had fed on 
 <italic>S. americanum</italic> (3.33 eggs/female and 51 eggs/female respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
