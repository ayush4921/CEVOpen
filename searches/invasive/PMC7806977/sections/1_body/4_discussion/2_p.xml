<p id="Par27">The high levels of mortality that occurred on 
 <italic>C. annuum, C. chinense</italic> and 
 <italic>S. paniculatum</italic> could be due to the presence of deterrent compounds or physical barriers that prevented larval feeding, causing abandonment of the plants and subsequent mortality due to starvation. Interestingly, the survival rate of the immature stages was higher on potato than on tomato plants. Tomato plants are rich in trichomes, anti-feedant proteins, toxins and protease inhibitors that protect them against pest attack

 </sup>. The movement of early larval instar 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> on the surface of tomato plants is made more difficult because of their small size and the presence of protective barriers (trichomes and hairs) on the leaf surface

 </sup>. To overcome these defences, 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> larvae bore into the leaves, constructing mines close to the oviposition sites and they remain within the mine, feeding until the third or fourth instar, at which time they have developed morphological and physiological adaptations which enable them to tolerate the tomato defences
