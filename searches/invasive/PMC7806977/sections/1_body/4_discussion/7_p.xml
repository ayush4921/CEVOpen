<p id="Par32">The dendrogram clusters clearly demonstrated the performance of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> on the host plants tested here. Cluster A plants were considered as unsuitable for oviposition and inhibitory for larval development. Cluster B (both subclusters B1 and B2) was formed of plants that showed moderate resistance to this pest and cluster C was formed of plants that were highly susceptible to 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic>. Subcluster B2 brought together cultivated plants (gilo and eggplant) and a non-cultivated plant (wild tomato). This cluster received around 18% of the eggs in the oviposition preference test. The immature survival rate was 40–60% and adult fecundity was 89–127 eggs, whilst R
 <sub>0</sub> was 18–38, r
 <sub>m</sub> 0.08–0.11, giving a biological performance similar or higher than that seen on tomato

 </sup> in others studies. This finding indicates that these plants may be used as alternative hosts by 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic>. Cluster C contained only tomato and potato, with a similarity of around 78%. This high similarity was due to the moderate rate of adult oviposition on potato (18% of the eggs during the oviposition preference test), lower larval mortality (20%) and high adult fecundity (188 eggs/female) of insects reared on potato plants. Although potato plants were suitable for 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> larval development, there appears to be a barrier that reduces oviposition rates on potato leaves. In wild potato the presence of glandular trichomes (type A and B) are responsible for resistance to oviposition of potato tuber moth 
 <italic>Phthorimaea operculella</italic> (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), and this has been related to larval mortality

 </sup>. We hypothesize that the presence of trichomes could also be a barrier against 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> oviposition on potato, however more studies are necessary to clarify this possibility.
