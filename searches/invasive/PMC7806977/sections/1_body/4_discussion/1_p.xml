<p id="Par26">This is the first study describing oviposition preference and biological performance of the tomato pinworm on cultivated and non-cultivated solanaceous plant species. It was not surprising that adult 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> preferred to lay their eggs on domesticated tomato plants (
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>), with more than fifty percent of the eggs being laid on this species when insects were offered a range of solenaceous plant species at the same time (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This preference for tomato is a result of evolutionary adaptation of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> to tomato toxins and the capacity of females to select sites that are most favourable for the survival of their offspring

 </sup>. Interestingly, the other 50% of the eggs were laid on plants for which the tomato pinworm would not have had any previous contact, especially potato, wild tomato, jua, American black nightshade and eggplant. This demonstrates that 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> females can recognize these plants as potential alternative hosts for the development of their offspring. Volatile compounds released by plants play an essential role in the location of suitable host species. These compounds can serve as airborne semiochemicals, promoting or deterring interactions between host plants and insect herbivores
