<p id="Par29">The fecundity of 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> was substantially influenced by the solaneceous host plant species. The daily fecundity rate was highest on tomato and lowest on jua, however the total fecundity rate on tomato was similar to that of potato. Fecundity is a good parameter to measure the effect of the host plant on lepidopteran herbivores as the reproductive potential is defined during the larval stage

 </sup>. Nutritional quality of the host plant may influence the nutritional reserves and the allocation of resources in larvae, resulting in changes in fecundity, morphology and life history of the insect

 </sup>. Previous studies with lepidopterans found a high correlation between body size and fertility, thus a higher immature body mass can result in larger adults, providing greater reproductive success

 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> adults. Some insect species may compensate for poor nutritional status of the host plant by increasing the consumption rate and protracting larval development. However, these strategies result in a higher risk of juvenile mortality and environmental asynchrony, which may have strong effects on insect population dynamics
