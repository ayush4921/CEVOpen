<p id="Par33">In this study we used a 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> population that has been maintained in the laboratory for more than one hundred generations without introducing new individuals. This extended time in the laboratory induces genetic drift due to consanguineous mating, resulting in the production of homozygotic progeny, with a loss of fitness or production of ecotypes unsuitable for field conditions

 </sup>. However, when 
 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> adults and larvae were confronted with a range of solanaceous species, they maintained a high capacity to colonize these plants. We believe that field populations of this pest species also possess a very high capacity to colonize a range of solanaceous plants, because of greater genetic diversity resulting from gene flow between populations and highly selective environment pressure
