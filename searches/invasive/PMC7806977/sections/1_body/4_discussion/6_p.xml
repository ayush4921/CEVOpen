 <italic>T. absoluta</italic> were influenced by larval mortality, development time and adult fecundity of insects reared on the range of solanaceous species used here. The highest r
 <sub>m</sub> value was recorded for tomato due to higher fecundity and shorter development times (30.6 days) during the immature stages. However, the low r
 <sub>m</sub> value recorded on American black nightshade (
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>americanum</italic>) was a result of lower fecundity (50.7 eggs/female) and lower immature stage survival rates (72.65%), as well as longer development times (37.85 days).
