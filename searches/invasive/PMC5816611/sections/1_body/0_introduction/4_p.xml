 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> is generally considered to be a relatively weak invader or weed due to its lack of high competitive and colonizing ability in natural communities. This species was first recorded in the “Flora of China” in 1979. However, its actual invasion history should be no less than 100 years according to local farmers’ descriptions. After such a long-term expansion, it has already reached almost all suitable climatic areas in China (unpublished material), and the habitat it invades is commonly restricted to farmland. Since China is one of ten mega-biodiversity countries in the world that play important roles in ensuring agriculture and food safety
 <sup>
