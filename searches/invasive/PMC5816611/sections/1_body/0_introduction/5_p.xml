<p id="Par6">With the abovementioned shortfalls in mind, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the effect of elevated nitrogen on the competitive relationship between the weak invasive species 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> and two confamilial competitors (
 <italic>Heteropappus hispidus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sonchus oleraceus</italic>). Meanwhile, to mimic different light conditions in farmland and abandoned land, light source was also taken into consideration. We hypothesized that elevated nitrogen would allow the weak invader to become more vigorous and would change the relationship with its competitors. The present study addressed the two following questions: (1) How would the weak invasive plant and its competitors respond to elevated nitrogen? (2) Can elevated nitrogen or the synergistic effect of nitrogen and light change the competition outcome?
