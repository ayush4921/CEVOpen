<p id="Par3">The high competitive ability of alien species has been suggested as a key factor associated with successful invasive potential, and competitive exclusion by native plant species seems to be a major force resisting exotic invasions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. It is commonly believed that the advantages of competitive ability account for the prevalence of vigorous invasive plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. However, increasing evidence suggests that the competitive relationship between invasive and native plants varies with the invasion process
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. For example, the dominance and negative effect of an initial aggressive invasive plant 
 <italic>Heracleum mantegazzianum</italic> decreased with time
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Such a change is presumably attributed to adaptation and coevolution. Additionally, limited evidence suggests that the competitive relationship between invasive and native plants can also be changed by environmental variation, such as global change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. The magnitude of invasive speciesâ€™ impacts on native plants may be modified by global changes that increase the availability of resources (e.g., nitrogen) and hence potentially alter the competitive dynamics between invasive and native species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, elevated nitrogen increased the predominance of invasive 
 <italic>Duchesnea indica</italic> in contrast to native 
 <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic>, hence environments with increased N deposition (i.e. from anthropogenic sources) could promote the invasive potential of 
 <italic>D. indica</italic>
