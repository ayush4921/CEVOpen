<p id="Par4">Nitrogen has been suggested as an important limiting factor to fast-growing plants, especially invasive species, including weak invaders (low competitive ability)

 </sup>. Such changes in nitrogen will certainly affect the competition between invasive and native plants. It has been suggested that vigorous invasive plants are usually more aggressive with respect to resource competition and are more effective at resource use compared to native plants

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, vigorous invasive plants will be promoted by elevated nitrogen deposition in the context of global change. Indeed, a growing body of evidence shows that elevated N deposition leads to a relative decline in native species biomass and a simultaneous increase in the biomass of vigorous invaders
