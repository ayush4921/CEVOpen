<p id="Par9">The relative interaction index (RII) values were generally negative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). RII was significantly affected by Light (

 <sub>(1,188)</sub> = 25.86,

 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>(1, 188)</sub> = 35.00, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). RII value was decreased under Shade treatment (Full sunlight, RII = −0.1187 ± 0.02392; Shade, RII = −0.2907 ± 0.02392). The intra-specific RII (monoculture) value of the invader was significantly lower than that of the inter-specific RII (mixed culture) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There were significant interactive effects between Light and Nitrogen (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>(1,188)</sub> = 23.65, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Shade treatment strengthened while elevated nitrogen alleviated inter- and intra-specific competition. Elevated nitrogen decreased the negative effect of the non-invasive plants on 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> in mixed culture pots under light shaded conditions (mixed culture: Shade+N, RII = −0.07221 ± 0.04398; Shade, RII = −0.2696 ± 0.04248).
