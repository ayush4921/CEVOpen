<p id="Par10">The specific leaf area (SLA) of the plant was significantly influenced by N, Light, Tsp and Culture, the root shoot ratio (R:S) of the plant was significantly influenced by Light and Tsp, and the leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chl) by N, Light, Tsp and Culture (Table

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In general, 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> exhibited lower R:S (
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic>, 0.087 ± 0.020; 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic>, 0.673 ± 0.023;

 <sub>(2,31)</sub> = 47.5,

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Elevated nitrogen significantly decreased the SLA of the invader but did not significantly affect those of the native species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Elevated nitrogen did not change the R:S of the invader, but increased and decreased those of 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Elevated nitrogen significantly increased Chl of all species. The Chl of the invader was significantly lower than those of the other two species in the pots without nitrogen addition. However, in pots with elevated nitrogen, the Chl of the invader was not lower than that of 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).
