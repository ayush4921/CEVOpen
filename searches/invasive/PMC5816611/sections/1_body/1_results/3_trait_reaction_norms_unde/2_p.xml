<p id="Par11">The leaf carbon concentration (LCC) of the plant was significantly influenced by N and Tsp, the leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) by N, Light, Tsp and Culture, and the leaf carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N) by N, Light and Tsp (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and see Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). In general, nitrogen addition increased the LCC and LNC but decreased the C:N of the plants. There were significant interactive effects between N and Tsp on LNC and C:N (except for LCC). The LNCs of both the invader and the native species were significantly increased by nitrogen treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The C:N of the invasive plant was not significantly changed by nitrogen treatment, while those of the non-invasive plants were decreased by nitrogen treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The invasive plant had higher LNC but lower C:N than the other two species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b and c</xref>).
