<p id="Par7">The result of the mixed model analysis revealed that Nitrogen (N), Light, Target species (Tsp) and Culture had significant effects on plant mass (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In general, the growth of the plants increased as a result of nitrogen addition but decreased with shade; the mass of the plants in the one-plant pots was generally higher than that in the monoculture and mixed culture. Moreover, interactive effects between or among some factors were also significant. For example, the interactions among Tsp, Culture, and N were significant. Compared with the mass of the individuals in the one-plant pots, the mass of the invader was not decreased by the mixed culture but was decreased in monoculture under elevated nitrogen (N+Shade and N) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, under elevated nitrogen, the mass of the native species 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic> in monoculture was not significantly different from that in the one-plant pots but was significantly higher than that in mixed culture; the mass of the exotic non-invasive species 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic> in the one-plant pots was significantly higher than that in mono- and mixed-culture pots with elevated nitrogen. In pots without nitrogen addition (Shade and Control), the masses of both the invasive and non-invasive plants were generally not significantly affected by culture. In other words, the growth of the invader was not significantly inhibited by inter- or intra-specific competitors under the conditions without elevated nitrogen. The presence of invasive 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> significantly inhibited the growth of the two non-invasive plants, especially when nitrogen was elevated. However, the presence of the two non-invasive species did not inhibit the growth of the invader regardless of whether nitrogen was added (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
