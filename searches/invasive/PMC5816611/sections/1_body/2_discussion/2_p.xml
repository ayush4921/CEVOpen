<p id="Par13">In fact, elevated nitrogen significantly promoted the growth of both the weak invader and the non-invasive plants in the one-plant pots; however, such a promotional effect was not observed for the non-invasive species in the mixed culture pots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, a decreased negative species interaction was detected as a result of elevated nitrogen, especially in Shade treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The interactions between the invader and the two competitors were generally negative, and the intra-specific RIIs of the invader were significantly lower than the inter-specific RIIs in most of the treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest that, the negative competitive effect of 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> counteracts the positive effect of nitrogen elevation on the growth of the non-invasive plants, and that elevated nitrogen alleviated the negative effects of the non-invasive plants on 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic>. However, the high intra-specific RII value suggested intense intra-specific competition in the invader’s population. Previous studies suggested that increased nitrogen deposition alleviated, enhanced or even had no effect on the competitive effects of invasive plants on their competitors
