<p id="Par14">Changes in the availability of resources associated with plant invasions may thus create conditions that may either increase or decrease the competitive ability of invasive species in contrast to those of native or other alien species

 </sup>. Global change is believed to alter the competitive relationship between invasive and native species in many ways, such as through land cover change, elevated CO

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. All these factors can enhance environmental resource availability, and nitrogen is especially important for invasive plants. This is probably because nitrogen is crucial for fast-growing plants and is usually difficult to obtain under natural conditions (except for nitrogen-fixing species)

 </sup>. However, as a result of global change, nitrogen may be captured more easily by plants than before. In fact, elevated nitrogen can occur as a result of atmospheric nitrogen deposition as well as anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural fertilization of farmland

 </sup>. The nitrogen resource of wild field can directly or indirectly be enhanced by such agricultural activities. In China, the large area of farmland and frequent agricultural fertilization
