  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The R:S of the invader was significantly lower than that of the non-invasive competitor, and it was not changed by nitrogen, light or culture type (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This indicates that the weak competitive ability of 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> in the Control treatment may be attributed to its lower root allocation, which has been suggested as a main cause for failure in soil nutrient competition
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. However, under the scenario of elevated nitrogen, a low R:S may help plants to increase biomass accumulation of aboveground, hence resulting in a competitive advantage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Other species with a low R:S have also been reported to successfully invade into nutrient-rich habitats
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. Although nitrogen addition decreased the SLA of all species, that of 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> was still higher than those of the native competitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Elevated nitrogen increased the Chl of the invader as well as those of the non-invasive plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). It should be noted that the invader obtained highest rate of increase compared to the two native species (
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic> increased by 53.96%, 30.76% and 28.76% respectively). Higher SLA species invest less dry matter per leaf, and have shorter leaf life spans
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. These are associated with lower leaf construction cost, higher nitrogen allocation to photosynthesis, and higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. The advantages associated with SLA and photosynthetic traits (e.g., chlorophyll concentration) subsequently account for the vigorous invasiveness of exotics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. In the present case, 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> maintained its R:S at lower level and SLA at higher level, and increased chlorophyll concentration in response to elevated nitrogen. Moreover, the invasive plant had higher LNC but lower C:N than the other two species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Higher leaf nitrogen content is usually related to higher assimilation rate, and is subsequently associated with higher growth rate of plant shoot and higher competitive ability on aboveground resource
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. The C:N balance, is also important for regulation of plant growth and development
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. For example, C:N plays an important role in regulating leaf senescence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. Plants with lower C:N ratio are usually characterized by higher growth rate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>, and subsequently successful invasive plants are commonly characterized by lower C:N compared to non-invasive plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. In sum, these attributes may help 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> successfully outcompete the two competitors. However, it should be acknowledged that the present one-year experiment can not definitely uncover the invasion process of 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> in the future. Further studies involving multiple generation under field conditions are necessary to reach a solid conclusion about this issue.
