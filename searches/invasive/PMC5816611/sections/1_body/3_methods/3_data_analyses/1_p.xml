<p id="Par20">R:S was calculated as the ratio between root dry mass and aboveground dry mass. Specific leaf area (SLA) is defined as the ratio of leaf area to dry mass. C:N was calculated as the ratio between LCC and LNC. A mixed model was used to evaluate the effects of the independent variables of Nitrogen (ambient or elevated N), Light (Shade or Full sunlight) Culture (one-plant, mixed or monoculture), and Target species (
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic> or 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic>) on the dependent variables mass, R:S, SLA, Chl, LCC, LNC and C:N respectively. Pot number was used as the random factor of the model. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
