<p id="Par17">In early May 2015, the seeds of the three species were sown in nursery pots. Two weeks later, when the seedlings were approximately 3 cm in height, they were transplanted into plastic pots (diameter 12 cm; height 10 cm). The pots were filled with sand and soil in a 1:1 proportion by volume. Two types of culture (Mixed and Monoculture) were conducted. For the mixed-culture, one invasive plant and one of the two non-invasive species were planted in the same pot. For the monoculture, two 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic>, two 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic>, or two 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic> seedlings were planted together. Additionally, to compare the inter- and intra-specific competition intensity, we established a one-plant-culture treatment for each species, i.e., one seedling of each species was transplanted into one pot. After transplanting, all pots were subjected to two environmental treatments based on a factorial design: nitrogen (ambient or elevated) and light (shade or full sunlight) with 10 replicates. For the nitrogen treatments, each pot was watered with 5 ml deionized water (ambient) or 3.783 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> NH
 <sub>4</sub>NO
 <sub>3</sub> solution (elevated). The nitrogen addition simulated the current nitrogen deposition rate of 2 g m
