<p id="Par16">Three species of the Asteraceae family, i.e., the invasive species 
 <italic>G. quadriradiata</italic> and the native species 
 <italic>H. hispidus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic> (which is native to Eurasia, although some researchers take it as a naturalized species in China), were chosen for comparison. All seeds we used in this study were collected from the Qinling-Bashan Mountains in 2014, and were stored in a 4 °C refrigerator.
