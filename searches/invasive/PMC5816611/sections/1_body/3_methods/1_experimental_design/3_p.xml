<p id="Par18">Two months later, when the invasive plants were almost mature, the leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chl) of the invasive species was measured using a portable chlorophyll meter SPAD-502 (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, IL, U.S.). The mean of three readings from the chlorophyll meter was calculated from 3 fully expanded leaves. In mid-September 2015, all parts of the plants were harvested and leaf areas were measured immediately. The dry weight of the root, leaf, and stem of each individual was separately measured after the samples had been dried to a constant weight in an oven at 60 °C. Elemental analysis for leaf carbon concentration (LCC, %) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, %) was performed on Vario EL cube CHNOS elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysen Systeme, Hanau, Germany). Five individuals’ leaf sample of each species under each treatment were randomly chosen, and thus a total of 200 sample were measured.</p>
