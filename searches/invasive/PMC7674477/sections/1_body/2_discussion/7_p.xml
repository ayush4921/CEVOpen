<p id="Par18">In conclusion, this work constitutes a background on the invasion history of 
 <italic>S. madagascariensis</italic> in Argentina. The results have shown the importance of the environment and the dispersion processes in the phenotypic variability of the sampled areas. In this context, determining this variability and the processes that affect them could be useful in order to establish priority areas of control in invasive species.
