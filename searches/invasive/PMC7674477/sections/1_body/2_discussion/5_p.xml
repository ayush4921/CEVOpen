<p id="Par16">Further, phenotypic diversity of invasive species can be affected by the number of introduction events to the new region, which increases the genetic novelties

 <italic>Phalaris arundinaceae</italic> L. to the invasive range in North America have been found to increase phenotypic and genetic diversity. Those events stimulated the rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity, facilitating range expansion

 <italic>S. madagascariensis</italic> in Brazil are a gene source that might ensure a higher variability in dispersal traits of the invasive populations
