<p id="Par12">The degree of morphological variation of invasive populations across a wide environmental range can be important to determine their performance and shaping forces. The morphometric analyses performed in the invasive populations of 
 <italic>S. madagascariensis</italic> evidenced differences in all the measured plant traits. However, only leaf area was statistically significant among areas. This non-significant differentiation among areas can be explained mainly by gene flow, which acts by homogenizing the allelic frequencies and constraining the adaptation to a heterogeneous environment
