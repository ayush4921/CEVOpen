<p id="Par7">Mean values of the analyzed morphological traits are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. The NWA populations had the highest values of leaf area, and length of internode and inflorescences, whereas the lowest values were reported in the source populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–c). Only leaf area presents statistically significant differences among areas (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Regarding number of heads, the CBA populations had the highest values, whereas the source populations had the lowest ones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d), but without statistically significant differences (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
