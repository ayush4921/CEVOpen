<p id="Par21">We performed a clustering analysis using Euclidean distances to assess the relationship among the studied populations and areas. In addition, we analyzed the morphological traits to establish the presence of significant differences through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey’s test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Finally, in order to define which morphological traits are responsible for population structuring, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA). The clustering analysis and PCA were performed using the INFOSTAT statistical software
