<p id="Par19">We analyzed traits of 49 specimens collected in specific field trips and 50 specimens from vouchers of several herbaria (BA, CORD, CTES, LIL, LP, SF, SI) of 
 <italic>Senecio madagascariensis</italic>; specimens span 54 years of collection efforts. The individuals are grouped in 42 populations distributed across the invasive range in Argentina (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In order to ensure independence among populations, we considered a group of individuals separated by at least 10 km between them as a population. The sampled areas follow the delimitations previously proposed for this invasive species in Argentina
