<p id="Par6">The studies about the rapid evolutionary changes in non-native species are of great interest because they may prove if post-introduction success is due to a genetically based change

 </sup>. The aim of our study was to explore the evolutionary forces that have acted to shape the invasive populations of 
 <italic>Senecio madagascariensis</italic> in Argentina. We quantified life history traits in individuals obtained during field collections as well as in herbarium specimens, spanning 54 years (from the first record to the present). In addition, we analyzed how natural selection may have acted during the invasions process. Since 
 <italic>S. madagascariensis</italic> has a wide distribution range, we hypothesize that natural selection may have favored individuals that invested more energy in rapid growth, increasing size and reproduction (Fig.
