<p id="Par4">Natural selection is recognized by Darwinism as the main mechanism driving evolutionary changes, and can take three forms, depending on the favored trait: (1) directional selection, which favors one of the extreme phenotypes; (2) stabilizing selection, which favors phenotypes with mean values; and (3) disruptive selection, which favors both phenotype extremes

 </sup>. However, Darwin also gives importance to what is currently known as genetic drift and gene flow as forces that can counteract natural selection

 </sup>. This phenomenon tends to adapt a population to local conditions (deme), but immigrants from other populations will introduce genes adapted to different conditions, which tends to homogenize allelic frequencies. In the absence of gene flow, divergent selection could favor traits that provide advantageous results in patterns of local adaptation

 </sup>. The evolution of locally adapted genotypes requires consistent geographical variation in selective regimes that cause directional trait changes, as well as limited gene flow
