  <italic>Ailanthus altissima</italic> is an invasive alien species (IAS) present throughout Europe and included in the list of alien species of Union concern. In sub-Mediterranean areas of central Italy, there is a lack of knowledge about this invasive species and its interactions with the native forest ecosystems. We aim to find what are the main differences in vegetation structure and floristic diversity between 
  <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests and native forests through the assessment of the principal ecological parameters that differ between the forest types. We performed 38 phytosociological relev√©s and sampling of ecological parameters in 
  <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest communities and neighboring native forests. We analyzed how species richness, diversity, life forms, life strategies, structural characteristics, and ecological parameters changed in 
  <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests compared with native ones. We found that in 
  <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests, there is a shift in herbaceous layer richness, with a higher presence of annual ruderal herbs and the absence of herbaceous species linked to the forest environment. The ecological parameters that diverge from the native forests were total nitrogen, total carbon, and C/N ratio. 
  <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest communities could threaten the biodiversity of the native forest ecosystems in the sub-Mediterranean landscape, favoring ruderal species and inhibiting the presence of typical forest species.
