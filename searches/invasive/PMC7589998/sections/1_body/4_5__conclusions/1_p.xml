<p>The alien forest communities were located between 10 and 500 m above the sea level, with an average age &gt; 20 years, an area ranging from 300 m
 <sup>2</sup> up to 3000 m
 <sup>2</sup>, and an average canopy height of 12 m. The comparison of the floristic composition, diversity, and environmental factors between 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> coenoses and native forest coenoses, highlighted that the main differences were present at the level of the herbaceous layer. Interestingly, 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests are characterized by higher species richness in the herbaceous layer, constituted by annual and perennial herbaceous species (therophytes and hemicryptophytes), with ruderal strategy and linked to disturbed conditions. Moreover, there is a total absence of a pool of nemoral species found in the native forests that are an indicator of habitat quality. The difference detected in species richness could be linked to changes in environmental variables, in fact, 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> coenoses showed lower total nitrogen and carbon and C/N ratio values due to an accelerated nutrient cycling process. Our findings highlight that immediate management plans are needed to protect the native plant communities. Further analysis is needed to better understand the below-ground processes and the effect of the litter layer and allelopathy related to this invasive species on the resident plant community.
