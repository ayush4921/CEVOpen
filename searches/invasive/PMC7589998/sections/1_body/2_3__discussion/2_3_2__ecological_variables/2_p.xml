<p>Regarding the other environmental variables, we found that canopy height significantly contributes to explaining part of the species compositions of the two forests coenoses, in fact, this variable is linked to forest permanence. Moreover, we can assume that there are altered light conditions under 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests canopy. We found higher Î” PAR under 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest canopy than in native forests, mainly due to the presence of a dense layer of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> renovation. 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> is known to be a species adapted to full light conditions [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but on the contrary to what is assumed for invasive alien species, it has been demonstrated that even in low light conditions, 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> is able to reproduce with good survival rates [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These factors lead to the alteration of the herbaceous layer species composition and diversity under the alien species canopy. In the present study, we highlighted the principal floristic and environmental differences between 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests coenoses and native forests typical of the hilly landscape of sub-Mediterranean bioclimate in southern Europe. This work is the first contribution to a specific characterization of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest coenoses in Italy and, from a broader point of view, for southern Europe. In the light of the recent introduction of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> in the list of invasive alien species of European Union concern [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a better understanding of the ecological behavior of this species is essential.
