<p>The strongest difference between the two forests communities was found for the topsoil parameters. Specifically, the results of the edaphic characteristics consistently indicated the capability of this invasive species to alter some soil properties. Our results are inconsistent with other studies relating to the effects of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> on the soil in the Mediterranean environment [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we found lower total nitrogen and carbon and C/N ratio in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> plots. Castro-Dìez et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] observed that the lower presence of total nitrogen and C/N ratio in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests is in correspondence to the maximum nitrogen mineralization activity in the same period of the year in which our survey was carried out. It was demonstrated that in invaded ecosystems, the net N mineralization and nitrification rates were almost 50% higher than in the native ones. This modification is due to the quality of the alien species litter that can alter the decomposition rates, accelerating the ecosystem nutrient cycling processes [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], a lower C/N ratio in invaded ecosystems could be linked to the quality of organic matter under 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> canopy and a consequent shift in soil bacterial community. A high C/N ratio means high litter quality with topsoil rich in organic matter. The main driver in C/N ratio levels is tree species, and Mediterranean oak forests have higher C/N values with respect to other invasive species forests [

 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests showed no significant impact on soil pH, in accordance with Vilà et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Castro-Díez et al. [
