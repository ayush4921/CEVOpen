<p>The results show that 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests host a pool of species that diverge from the target species of the compared native forests. In opposition to a recent study on other alien forest species [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we found a lack of species linked to nutrient-rich conditions. The species richness of the tree and shrub layers seems to not determine a significant differentiation of the two coenoses. In accordance with several other studies in invasion ecology, the main effect is found in the herbaceous layer, e.g., [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Floristic diversity (Richness) was higher in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests in comparison to the native forest coenoses. Even if Constan Nava et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], Motard et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Vil√† et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported a reduced species richness in plant communities dominated by this alien species, our result is consistent with the findings of Fotidias et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The latter research reports a reduced species diversity in the herb layer in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> coenoses in comparison with 
 <italic>Q. pubescens</italic> dominated forest vegetation in a Mediterranean environment. Our result indicates that this alien species invades different environments with a human-mediated process, from seminatural and ruderal habitats to abandoned arable land. Its wide tolerance in different habitat types favored the presence of perennial and annual grass species (hemicryptophytes and therophytes) in the invaded forests. Ruderal species are those species that thrive on high disturbance levels and do not tolerate a high level of stress [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This ecological strategy group comprehends mainly hemicryptophytes (perennial) and therophytes (annual) life forms. The significant higher presence of annual and perennial herbaceous species, along with ruderal species in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> plots, can be explained by the presence of altered vegetative conditions. Both of those elements are reliable indicators of disturbed conditions [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests coenoses, there is the total absence of the herbaceous nemoral species characteristics of the native forest ecosystems of the study area. We found that 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> could change the species composition of the herb layer, through direct competition for resources and modification in local environmental conditions. The presence of the herbaceous nemoral component is known to be an important element for habitat identification and quality assessment compared to invaded ecosystems, e.g., [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Its total absence, even if in suitable environmental and landscape conditions, could be due to the presence of phytotoxic substances (ailanthone) contained in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> leaves and bark, which can accumulate in the soil [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the spontaneous herbaceous species, more specifically nemoral species that are frequent under the native forest canopy, are susceptible to the presence of allelopathic compounds [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The presence of these phytotoxic substances leads to a reduction of germination success of the spontaneous nemoral species [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and if this toxic compound accumulates for a long period, it could have a strong impact on the resident plant community.
