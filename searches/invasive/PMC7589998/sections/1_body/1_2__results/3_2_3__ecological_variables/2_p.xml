<p>The results of the RDA reveal, among the set of environmental variables, that canopy height, ΔT soil, C tot, and N tot are significant variables (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01404-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This proves that those factors are the main environmental variables shaping the plant community. The total model shows a significance level of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, the constrained variation represents 24% of the total variation. The cumulative amount of variance expressed as proportions of the total explained variance (24%) by RDA1 axes is 39.7% and RDA2 axes 19.02% (total of 59.02%) To better observe the variation of environmental variables in relation to the two groups and test their statistical significance, box plots were generated. The difference between the averages of measured environmental values such as Canopy height, canopy cover, ΔPAR, and ΔT were all non-significant in the comparison between the two forest types. A slight trend between a narrow range of values can be observed in the ΔPAR as well as the canopy-cover, that shows higher average values in the 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01404">Table S2</xref>). In the first case, this means the presence of a greater difference between the radiation recorded outside (full light) and the one recorded below the forest canopy. The comparison of the measured edaphic characteristics is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01404-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The pH values were not different between the groups. Total nitrogen, total carbon and C/N ratio were significantly different between the two groups (pH 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1; N tot 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.025 *; C tot 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007 **; C/N 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0033 **) with 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests having lower values for all three variables considered.
