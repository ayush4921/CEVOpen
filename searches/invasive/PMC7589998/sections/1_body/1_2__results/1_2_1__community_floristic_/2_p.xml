<p>There are two groups, corresponding to the two forest types under study: plots dominated by 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> (group 1) and plots dominated by 
 <italic>Quercus pubescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic>, or 
 <italic>Ulmus minor</italic>, representing the native forests (group 2). Indicator species analysis (IndVal) revealed the species associated with each of the two groups. The indicator species of group 1 are 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> (Mill.), 
 <italic>Chaerophyllum temulum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> L., and those of group 2 are 
 <italic>Q. pubescens</italic> Willd, 
 <italic>Ostrya carpinifolia</italic> Scop, 
 <italic>U. minor</italic> Miller. So, the groups correspond to the different forest coenoses types under study: native forests dominated by the typical forestâ€™s species of the study area and the alien 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest communities. Shannon diversity indices of the vegetation layers were compared between the two forest types and resulted in not being significant. Species diversity in terms of the number of species (richness) shows a significant difference only for the herbaceous layer (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01404-f002">Figure 2</xref>
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests have higher species richness in the herbaceous layer than native forests.
