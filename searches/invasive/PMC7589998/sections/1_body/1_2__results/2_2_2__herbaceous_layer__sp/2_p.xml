<p>Specifically, in 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> herbaceous layer, the hemicryptophytes species represent almost 43% of the 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests herbaceous layer. Those species are biennial or perennial, frequently linked to open environment or nemoral/forest edge species, linked to forest environments (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01404">Table S1</xref>). Therophytes are heliophilous annual species that represent almost 35% of the 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forestsâ€™ herbaceous layer (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01404">Table S1</xref>). From the total herbaceous species, we analyzed the nemoral component (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01404-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In terms of weighted percentage cover, the nemoral component is linked to the native forest and is statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01404-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01404">Table S1</xref>). Regarding the Grime life strategies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01404-f003">Figure 3</xref>) in the herbaceous layer, the 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> community shows a greater presence of species with a competitive-ruderal strategy (CR, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) that are species adapted to disturbances as well as species having a competitive strategy (C, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1). In the native forests, it was found a greater presence of species having a competitive-stress tolerant strategy (CS, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).
