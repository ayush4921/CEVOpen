<p>Specifically, we want to (i) identify and investigate floristic-vegetational and ecological parameters of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest communities in sub-Mediterranean areas of central Italy (ii) investigate light, temperature, and soil parameters that mainly characterize those communities; (iii) investigate differences in species diversity and composition of vegetation layers and differences in habitat conditions through a paired comparison with native forests.
