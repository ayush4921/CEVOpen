<p>The aims of this study were to compare floristic-vegetational and measured ecological data in mature 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forest coenoses and neighbor native forests as reference. Thanks to this comparison, we want to highlight the effects of the alien forests canopy on the herbaceous layer, in terms of diversity and ecological conditions with respect to the native forests.
