<p>The data were processed using the “vegan” package [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] of the R software [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. To highlight the pattern of species composition of the two forest coenoses types we merged the vascular plant taxa occurring in more than one layer. In the resulting data set, each species was present once. Before calculations, the ecological variables matrix was undergone at a normalization process using the “decostand” function on the vegan package. To determine if the plot types had different community compositions, we conducted a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis with Bray-Curtis distance measure. Indicator species analysis (ISA) [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] was performed to identify the indicator species for each group. These species were identified for each group using the indicator value (IndVal) method, which combines the specificity of a species (uniqueness to a particular sampling unit) and its fidelity (frequency within that sampling unit). For each species, the IndVal ranges from 0 (no indication) to 1 (maximum indication). The statistical significance of the IndVal was tested using a Monte Carlo test, based on 999 randomizations. To highlight differences between vegetation layers of the two forests coenoses we calculated species Richness and Shannon diversity index for the tree, shrub and herb layers of each plot. Then we performed the analysis of variance and tested the significance among the averages of the two groups. The ecological determinants of the species composition and richness of the two forest types were investigated by redundancy analysis (RDA). The RDA allowed the comparison of the forests and the identification of the gradient trajectories for the environmental variables. Only variables that showed a significant difference among 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> and native forests were used for the model. The redundancy analysis was performed on the Hellinger transformed vegetation matrix. The Monte Carlo permutation test (based on 999 iterations) was performed in order to assess both the significance of the environmental variables and the ordination axes. Box plot diagrams were used to illustrate data distribution of ecological variable and species characteristics. To analyze the variance of the groups and tests for significance we used ANOVA (“aov” function of “stats” package). The Shapiro test was used to test the normality of the analyzed data and the Bartlett test for homoscedasticity.
