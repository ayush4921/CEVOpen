<p>One method of investigating the effects of alien compared to native stands is to use nearby paired sampling units, invaded and non-invaded. As proven by Bazalova et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], “the twin plots method proved to be a suitable tool for analyzing the impact of alien trees on understory vegetation”. The target forest communities were identified following complementary techniques: the consultation of the Italian National Forest Inventory [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] data on forests type distribution (following the distribution of the category “Robinio-Ailanteti”), photo-interpretation of 2012 geo-referenced images available on the “Geo-portale Nazionale” (

 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests growing along roads [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and reconnaissance days in the study area (in early spring of 2019). The identification was first applied to 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> forests communities, then, using the same method, we detected native forest communities setting a circular buffer area within a 500 m radius from the detected alien forest community [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The native forests communities are 
 <italic>Q. pubescens</italic>, 
 <italic>P. nigra,</italic> and 
 <italic>U. minor</italic> dominated forests and represent the typical spontaneous forest vegetation for the study area. This method assures homogeneity in terms of land-use context and disturbance regime for both alien and native stands. This is important to make comparisons that allow us to understand if and how the presence of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> influences the ecological variables under the canopy and the vegetation composition and diversity.
