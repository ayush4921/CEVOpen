 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we selected those variables that show high explanatory capability. Canopy cover (percentage of the sky covered by leaves) was measured by the mobile application GLAMA [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01404" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Data on canopy cover were measured in the field for all 19 twin vegetation plots. In each plot, one measurement was taken at the center of the plot of 100 m
 <sup>2</sup> as a representative, at 1.30 m from the soil surface with a hemispherical lens. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured in each plot between September and October of 2019 with a photo-radiometer (Delta OHM, HD 2302.0, Milan, Italy). We took four randomly PAR measures per plot, in the Native and 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> plots, respectively, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at 1.30 m (PAR30) and 20 cm above the soil surface (PARsoil). We also performed four measurements outside the forest canopy (PARout) in conditions of full light to calculate the ΔPAR (difference from outside full-light conditions and inside forest canopy conditions ΔPAR30 = PARout-PAR30; ΔPARsoil = PARout-PARsoil). The difference between the inside forest and outside were made to minimize the effects of the different light conditions due to the sun height in the sky at different hours on a day. The height of the forest canopy was taken by means of 1 measurement of the dominant tree using an optical height meter (PM-5/360 PC model; Suunto Instrument Co., Helsinki, Finland). The soil was randomly collected from three different subplots and subsequently pooled for each plot. For each sample, surface litter (if present) was removed and the top 20 cm of soil was sampled (from 0 to 20 cm depth). Samples were analyzed for nitrogen (N tot), total extractable carbon (C tot), and pH in H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The ratio of total extractable carbon to total nitrogen (C/N) was also calculated as an estimate of soil quality. Soil samples were analyzed by the Marches Region agrochemical analysis and research laboratories according to the methodological standards established by Italian ministerial decree 13/09/99. Total nitrogen was extracted through Kjeldahl mineralization with hydrogen peroxide and determination of total nitrogen by distillation according to Kjeldahl; for the total extractable carbon is followed the extraction, fractionation (by means of solid-phase adsorption chromatography) and determination of organic carbon procedure reported in the ministerial decree; pH in H
 <sub>2</sub>0 was determined by potentiometric method, after calibration of the measurement system, on suspensions of soil-water.” The topsoil temperature was detected using a specific soil thermometer (HANNA Digital thermometer, HI 98501). Three random measurements were performed inside and outside the forest canopy. The measured values were subsequently averaged and used for the calculation of the ∆T, that is, the difference between the average temperatures of the topsoil outside the forest canopy and of the topsoil under the forest canopy.
