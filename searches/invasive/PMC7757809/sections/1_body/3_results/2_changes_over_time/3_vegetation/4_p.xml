<p>Plant characteristics based on the USDA plant database (drought resistance, fire tolerance, and invasive species) at the two sample sites were examined. Drought resistance significantly varied among years, and increased 35.8% over our study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Incidence of invasive species (average = 29.8%) increased by 108% over our study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243496.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The increase in invasives was largely due to non-native annual brome grasses, which comprised on average 50% of invasives. Number of invasive grass species increased from 1 to 3, and invasive dicots increased from 3 to 10 species.
