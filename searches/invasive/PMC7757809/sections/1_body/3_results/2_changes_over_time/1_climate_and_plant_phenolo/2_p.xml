<p>Seasonal values for precipitation and temperature trends during our study were also examined (
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Like the annual trends, Water Year (Oct–Sep) precipitation tended to decrease and temperature to increase. Seasonally, precipitation tended to decrease in spring, summer and recharge period (winter + spring), increase in fall and remain unchanged in winter. Seasonally, temperature tended to increase primarily in summer, and remain unchanged in other seasons. Because the majority (&gt; 88%) of plant growth (peak “green” biomass) occurs at NBR from late-May–June (
