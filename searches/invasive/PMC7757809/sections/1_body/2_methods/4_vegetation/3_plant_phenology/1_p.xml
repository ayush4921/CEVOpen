<p>Two phenology measures were made using biweekly ANPP measurements (above): time when peak “green” biomass is attained and degree of summer senescence. Time of peak “green” biomass was determined for each site and year as the Julian day when the greatest “green” biomass was observed. Plant senescence (%) occurs over the summer (July–Aug) as “green” biomass dies or becomes dormant (“brown”) after peak “green” biomass occurs. Senescence was measured as 100 X (1 –lowest observed “green” biomass/peak observed “green” biomass).</p>
