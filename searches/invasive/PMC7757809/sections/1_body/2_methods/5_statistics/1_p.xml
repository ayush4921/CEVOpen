<p>Statistics were conducted with SYSTAT 13. Climate changes over time were analyzed using nonparametric trend analysis (Mann-Kendall rank correlation). General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were employed to examine whether nitrogen and vegetation measures varied among years (year as categorical independent variable) and over time during the study (year as continuous variable). Sample sites were treated as a random variable, because they were not replicated within a year. All proportions were arcsine square root transformed. Climate and elevation effects (continuous independent variables) on nitrogen and vegetation were examined using backward stepwise mixed-model regression, where independent variables were only included if P &lt; 0.15 and the Akaike Information Criteria value (AIC) decreased.</p>
