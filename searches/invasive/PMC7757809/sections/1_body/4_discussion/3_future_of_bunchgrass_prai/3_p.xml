<p>Historically, intermountain bunchgrass had low fire incidence compared to Great Plains grassland due to less frequent lightning [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], and summer temperature is increasing in the bunchgrass. Therefore, greater ANPP and summer senescence in NBR bunchgrass provides more fuel for increased lightning to spawn fires than in the past. Furthermore, we found that plant species that are more resistant to fire are not increasing in abundance, further enhancing the potential for fire disturbance.
