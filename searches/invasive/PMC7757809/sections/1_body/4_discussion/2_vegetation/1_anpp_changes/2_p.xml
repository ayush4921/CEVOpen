<p>First, late-May–June (main period of growth: &gt; 88% of ANPP) ratio of precipitation to temperature reflects moisture available for plant growth as evaporation increases at higher temperatures, so more precipitation is needed to achieve a given level of plant growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This ratio was experimentally demonstrated to correlate with evapotranspiration and ANPP [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and anthropogenic deposition [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] has been shown to increase with precipitation in grasslands. We did not observe this as warm season total nitrogen was not correlated with precipitation, but increased with summer temperature, which reflects rapid mineralization [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Finally, previous year’s ANPP was positively correlated with current ANPP, which indicates that moisture and nitrogen (elevation) have greater impact when plants already are abundant after a year of good growth probably due to a greater plant stem density after a year of higher growth [
