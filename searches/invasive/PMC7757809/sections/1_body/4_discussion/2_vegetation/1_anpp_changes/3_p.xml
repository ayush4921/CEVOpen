<p>Most striking, NBR ANPP increased by 110% over our 40-year study as the ratio of late-May–June (main period of plant growth: &gt; 88% of ANPP) precipitation to temperature increased due to wetter and cooler conditions. Grass ANPP over our study increased by 251%, while dicot ANPP declined by 65%, leading to a 54% increase in grass relative abundance. The driving factor again was specific seasonal, not annual, climate change (wetter and cooler late-May–June) favoring the “cool-season” (C
 <sub>3</sub>) grasses that are most abundant (&gt; 99%). Furthermore, the increase in these grasses appeared to reduce forb abundance through competition, as the grasses form clumps (cespitose) that are spaced apart to avoid competition for water, as denoted by the prairie being called “bunchgrass”. Finally, ANPP changes were stronger at low elevations over our study, which may be expected as higher elevations are generally moister and cooler to begin with than low elevations.
