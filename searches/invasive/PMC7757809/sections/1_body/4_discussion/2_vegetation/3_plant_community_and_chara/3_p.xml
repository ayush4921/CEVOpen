<p>Richness and diversity may in part have increased as the incidence of invasive species increased by 108%, as summer senescence intensified, which is consistent with observations that grassland invasives increase with drying conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Increasing invasives had no effect on NBR ANPP (P &lt; 0.28), and thereby, would have little effect on summer senescence measures, as &gt; 50% of invasives were annual brome grasses, which provide very little biomass (cheatgrass, 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic>, accounted for less than 3% of the invasive bromes). Average plant drought resistance increased by 35.8% over our study, which is largely due to the increase in wheatgrasses and decrease in bluegrasses. Fire tolerance was unchanged over our study.
