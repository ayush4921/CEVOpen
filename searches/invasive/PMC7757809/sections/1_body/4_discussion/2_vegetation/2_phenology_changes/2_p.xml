<p>Summer senescence (% decline in “green” plant biomass from the peak) increased by 119% over our study, which correlated with increasing summer temperature and grass ANPP. Again, specific seasonal, not annual, climate change was more important as summer (July–Aug) temperature increased more than the average annual value (2.3°C vs. 0.7°C). Furthermore, senescence is expected to be more intense for the most abundant “cool season” grasses. Finally, increased senescence had no apparent effect on ANPP, as ANPP is largely determined by the ratio of late-May–June precipitation to temperature supporting “cool season” grass growth.</p>
