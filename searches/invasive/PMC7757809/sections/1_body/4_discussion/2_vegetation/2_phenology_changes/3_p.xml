<p>Fall re-initiation of plant growth declined by 67.8% over our study, which correlated with increasing summer temperature, i.e., greater summer senescence. Fall plant production now is very low in most years, as it may be more difficult for plants to overcome severe summer senescence. This differs from the historic pattern of fall “greening” in this ecosystem [

 <sup>th</sup> and early 20
