 <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], a potential vector of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and West Nile virus (WNV) [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In addition, the roots of the invasive water lettuce 
 <italic>P. stratiotes</italic> are a favourable breeding site for 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> spp., a secondary RVFV vector [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], indicating the potential indirect impact that the control of these IAPs could have on arboviral diseases in humans and livestock. Besides aquatic plants, the presence of debris (from leaves, fruits, seeds, flowers, pollen) from terrestrial plants growing in the neighbourhood of temporal water bodies has the potential to alter the chemistry of such environments. This may influence their attractiveness as breeding sites for gravid female mosquitoes, with inherent consequences for the resulting larval development and adult emergence rates [
