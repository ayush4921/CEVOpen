<p>Vector density and distribution are important determinants for the distribution pattern of arboviral diseases. This can be driven, among other factors, by the availability of water and suitable resting sites or shelters (

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Though the specific plant species in the vegetation driving the observed patterns in these studies remain unknown, it is obvious that vegetation plays an essential part in ensuring vector survival or longevity, thus the need to critically evaluate the potential contributory role of individual plant species in the environment. Many IAPs flower longer and are thus more readily available sources for vector plant-sugar feeding. Furthermore, arthropod vectors appeared to preferentially obtain sugar from invasive plants compared to native plants in a cage experiment [
