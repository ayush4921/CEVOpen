<p>Similarly ambiguous are the effects of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> on arboviral mosquito vectors. Though there are some indications that 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaf litter can favour development of larvae of arboviral mosquito vectors [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> has relatively long corollas [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and despite the high sugar content in the flowers, its floral architecture makes plant feeding rather difficult. In a detailed study involving 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and several plant species 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> ranked among the least preferred nectar sources and mosquitoes that had fed on it subsequently demonstrated lower fecundity and a shorter life span [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Moreover, survival rates on 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> were no better than on water, most likely because of the low sugar content of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves (where the vector turns to feed) [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. However, as in the case of Prosopis, thickets formed by clusters of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> might provide a favourable microhabitat for adult arboviral mosquito vectors as reported for tsetse flies [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Trying to resolve this ambiguity around 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> should be another focus of future research.
