 <caption> Guam’s population of Cycas micronesica trees were universally healthy prior to the 2003–2005 invasion of non-native insect herbivores. Very few of the remaining trees that persist in 2020 are healthy. ( a) Collecting allometric data in December 1998 on a tree with no observable herbivory (T. Marler); ( b) Gestalt appearance of many trees in September 2020. The white bases of the petioles are Aulacaspis yasumatsui infestations. </caption>
