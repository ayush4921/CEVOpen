  <title>Simple Summary</title>
  <p>Effective conservation of endangered plant species requires identifying their greatest threats to formulate management protocols. Invasive species are a result of global change and are a major threat to biodiversity. We used the island cycad 
   <italic>Cycas micronesica</italic> K.D. Hill as a model that represents the global issues of conservation science and invasion biology. In Guam, several non-native insect invasions began in 2003 and have combined to threaten the island population of this cycad species. In this article, we summarize the history of reported invasions and the reported non-native insect herbivores that have recently increased the threat status. We also discuss the interactions among herbivores that threaten the sustainability of 
   <italic>C. micronesica</italic> on the island of Guam.

  <p>Invasions of non-native species can threaten native biodiversity, and island ecosystems are ideal for studying these phenomena. In this article, first, we report on the invasive species that combine to threaten the island cycad 
   <italic>Cycas micronesica</italic> by reviewing the history of previously reported invasions and providing an update of recent invasions. Then, we prioritize the threat status of each herbivore and the interactions among them. Plant damage was initiated in 2003â”€2005 by the non-native 
   <italic>Aulacaspis yasumatsui</italic> Takagi armored scale, 
   <italic>Erechthias</italic> sp. Meyrick leaf miner, and 
   <italic>Luthrodes pandava</italic> Horsfield butterfly, which elicited unprecedented irruptions of the native 
   <italic>Acalolepta marianarum</italic> Aurivillius stem borer and increased herbivory by feral pigs (
   <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> L.). The combined impact of these five consumers represents the greatest sustained threat to the cycad tree species. Mitigation of the damage caused by phytophagous non-native species is urgently needed to conserve this unique gymnosperm tree.
