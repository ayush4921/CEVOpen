<p>The recent history of the island cycad known as 
 <italic>Cycas micronesica</italic> provides a model case study that fully integrates conservation science with invasion biology. Improvements in the conservation of biodiversity require the support of adaptive management, both regionally and internationally. This can only be achieved if new knowledge from local research is shared to inform global conservation issues [

Our results update the heavily researched case study of a culturally and ecologically important insular tree species that transitioned from being the most abundant tree on the island of Guam in 2002 [
