<p>The loss of biodiversity through extinction events has occurred since the beginning of life itself. The extinction of some organisms creates a crucial opportunity for the proliferation of other organisms that can exploit the changing environment. Biologists study this phenomenon and are particularly interested in the consequences of a relatively new extinction driver, that is, human activity during what is described as the Anthropocene epoch [
