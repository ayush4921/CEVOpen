<p>The unprecedented volume of movement of species from their native range into new geographic locations is one of the main extinction drivers in the Anthropocene. Although this would appear to increase biodiversity, the negative impact of the new invasions on native organisms may actually decrease biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; therefore, due to the global influence of non-native organisms on native biodiversity, invasion biology has emerged as a bona fide discipline [

 <xref rid="B11-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As this discipline continues to develop, the need to include multiple stakeholder groups such as humanities and social sciences has been recognized as a means of enabling successful outcomes [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Eradication of non-native species is most successful if organized efforts are initiated early in the invasion process. For this reason, employing non-professionals to monitor and report outbreaks of non-native species is a recent addition to the toolbox of invasion biology, a field that has been dubbed “citizen science” [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More recently, new frameworks have been created to organize the massive amount of data that has evolved from invasion biology research, which enables a more organized approach to compare case studies among global databases [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These developments allow biologists to study invasive species within their socio-economic or environmental impacts using globally relevant criteria.
