<p>The discovery of a probable Lepidoptera pollinator initiated an organized effort to understand the pollination system of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> fully. This led to identifying three nitidulid beetles that feed on 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> microstrobili tissues (

 <xref rid="B33-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These studies also confirmed that the 
 <italic>Anatrachyntis</italic> and the three 
 <italic>Carpophilus</italic> species were collected from sticky traps attached to megastrobili. Moreover, 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> pollen was collected from the bodies of 
 <italic>Anatrachyntis</italic> adults, further confirming their probable role as a native pollinator.
