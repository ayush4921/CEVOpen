<p>We used a summation of the previously reported threats to the cycad known as 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic>. We reported an update on more threats that have not been previously reported to illuminate how single threats may interact to form a coalition of synergistic threats. As conservation decision-makers need multi-threat assessments such as ours to develop the most effective conservation actions [
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], we use this well-researched case study as a model for informing conservation decisions of other threatened plant taxa [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our report is useful for discussing the Anthropocene consequences and how the global disciplines of conservation science and invasion biology can be studied at the local level [

 <xref rid="B16-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the short term, mitigation of the phytophagous non-native speciesâ€™ damage remains the only acute need to conserve this unique gymnosperm tree. For this purpose, the immediate focus should be on reversing the 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>, 
 <italic>Erechthias</italic>, 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. scrofa</italic> damage. We have estimated more than 70 years of demographic depth have been lost from Guam due to selective mortality of the smallest individuals [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. If these threats are not mitigated, ongoing publicly funded projects designed to use seeds and cuttings to rescue the genetic diversity from construction sites are not advisable in the absence of a 70-year budget to protect the transplants from the ubiquitous non-native herbivores. Although much is known from a strong history of research, much of the available knowledge is not being used in conservation decisions, and much remains to be studied about the interactions among the threats.
