<p>This gymnosperm tree serves as an example of a native species with resistance and resilience to a recurring native abiotic stress, tropical cyclones [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The recent insect invasions have removed much of this inherent resistance and resilience. Historically, catastrophic damage such as stem breakage or uprooting was minimal. When this did occur, the basal portion of a broken tree developed adventitious buds to resume stem growth. The stem sections that dislodged developed adventitious roots where the prostrate stem tissue was in contact with the soil surface [

 <xref rid="B49-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This response to the tropical cyclone damage created two clones of the broken tree. Winching techniques were used to study the biomechanical strength of unhealthy 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems [
 <xref rid="B58-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The results verified that the stems of unhealthy trees were less able to resist horizontal displacement and predicted greater damage in future tropical cyclones due to the non-native herbivore damage. The prediction was confirmed by the incidence of Typhoon Dolphin in May 2015 [
 <xref rid="B59-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Four international experts developed a management plan for in situ conservation of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> in northern Guam, which included the installation of guy wire anchoring on trees within management plots [
 <xref rid="B60-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The efficacy of this engineered approach for anchoring was confirmed during Typhoon Dolphin as a conservation method to reverse the negative influence of the non-native insects on the treeâ€™s resistance to wind damage [
