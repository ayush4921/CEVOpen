<p>In the absence of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> infestations, the seeds of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> are retained on the female trees for more than two years before they disperse individually [

 <xref rid="B69-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The megasporophylls from which the seeds were dispersed usually remain intact on female trees after seed dispersal. Direct infestations of the armored scale on megastrobilus structures cause the base of the megasporophylls to break, with immature seeds being dispersed during the breakage. Old seeds that disperse individually are generally not consumed by pigs, but pigs consume the young seeds after dispersal. Our case study provides an example of how a non-native species (pigs) did not directly damage regeneration potential of a native tree species (
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic>) for hundreds of years until the invasion of a second non-native organism (
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>) caused a change in the treeâ€™s seed dispersal behavior.
