 <xref rid="insects-11-00888-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> is the unique tree 
 <italic>Cycas micronesica</italic>. This gymnosperm tree survived for eons prior to human arrival to Guam and Rota. Still, now an ensemble of non-native herbivores and omnivores competes and abets each other to create a relentless assault on the host tree. One of the greatest challenges of developing a plan to control these threats is the extreme phylogenetic and guild differences among the consumers. Despite this difficulty, a focus on mitigating threats to plant species must embrace the complicated issues of covariation among threats and non-additivity among threats [
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. One threat may magnify the consequences of a second threat such that the imposition of two or more threats simultaneously may increase the overall damage to the growth and survival of a plant species. We described some of the consequential interactions of abiotic and biotic stressors to the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> population.
