<p>These behavioral phenomena of the host and this butterfly herbivore cause highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal herbivory levels within areas of occupancy where 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> co-exist. In a common garden setting, 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> is among the most damaged of 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species by this butterfly [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The speed of leaf expansion and maturation among 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species is one plant trait that determines resistance to 
 <italic>L. pandava</italic> herbivory [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Leaf maturation of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> is slow compared to 
 <italic>Cycas</italic> species that are resistant to this specialist herbivore. Damage to 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> in Guam and Rota is primarily due to the host treeâ€™s lack of resistance [
