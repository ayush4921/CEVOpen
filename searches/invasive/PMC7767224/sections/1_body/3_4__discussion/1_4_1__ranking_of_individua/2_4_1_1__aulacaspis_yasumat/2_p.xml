<p>In the absence of adequate biological control, 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> is by far the greatest ongoing threat to these insular 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> populations for numerous reasons. It is the only 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> herbivore on Guam and Rota that is lethal when acting alone. This sap-feeder is also the only herbivore that feeds on every plant organ (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00888-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). More importantly, there is no temporal constraint on initial infestation success. The original crawlers that find a new plant can begin feeding and regenerating on any soft organ surface. A leafâ€™s risk is the same regardless of an age span of days or years. The base of the permanent stem of a tree that is centuries in age is at risk on par with a microstrobilus that emerges from the stem apex and completes its function in two months. Many Hemiptera insects pose a threat to the host plant by vectoring pathogens, but 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> kills its host by the relentless depletion of non-structural resources and killing of newly emerging leaves before they can become a net carbon source organ [
