<p>Two consequential changes in the relationship between 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> have occurred in 2020. First, the stratum that 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> larvae damage 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems has historically been restricted to 0.5â€“1.0 m [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For unknown reasons, this long-established stem borer behavior has changed in 2020, as we have observed 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> stem damage as high as 3 m. Second, breakage of 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> stems during the forces of tropical cyclone winds is increased by antecedent 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> larval damage [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-11-00888" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The breakage of stems during tropical cyclones was historically a combination of the compromised biomechanical strength caused by the stem herbivory and the lateral forces caused by the winds. This has changed in 2020, with numerous 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees exhibiting breakage at the stratum of 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> damage as a direct result of the herbivory alone and in the absence of tropical cyclone force winds (
