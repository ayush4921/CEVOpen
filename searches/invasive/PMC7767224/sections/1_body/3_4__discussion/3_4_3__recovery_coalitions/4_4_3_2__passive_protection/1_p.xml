<p>The 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> population in Guam is just as important for conservation as the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> population; therefore, attempts to implement the biological control of the stem borer to protect the tree population are unjustified. This native beetle poses no threat to the tree population in the absence of stressors such as the list of non-native herbivores in 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00888-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00888-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Conservation projects should aim to minimize the other threats that compromise the trees’ health, which would remove 
 <italic>A. marianarum</italic> as an acute threat to the tree. Inadvertent conservation of the stem borer in the coming years is ensured because the population of Guam’s unhealthy 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> trees will sustain the beetle’s population until recovery of the plant population ensues.
