<p>The development of efforts to de-list 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> from the ESA should be tailored for Guam and Rota separately, as the approach for species recovery may not be similar for the tree populations on the two islands. Due to lack of funding, we have not been able to observe the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> status on Rota in recent years. A 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> species expert should be funded to assess Rotaâ€™s threat status, as many of the Guam threats were never identified on Rota during the ten years that we were actively studying the 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> population on Rota prior to the loss of funding. A parasitoid survey should be conducted on Rota, and the parasitoids from Guam should be released on Rota if needed. More research on the frequent Rota 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> seed gnawing by 
 <italic>R. rattus</italic> may be useful for informing global island conservation efforts [
