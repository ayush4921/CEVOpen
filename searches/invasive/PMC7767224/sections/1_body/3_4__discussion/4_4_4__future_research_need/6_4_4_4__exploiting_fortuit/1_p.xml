<p>Guam’s 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> infestations have become less widespread and less severe in the past two years (B. Deloso &amp; T. Marler, unpublished). Many of Guam’s infestations have taken on the gestalt appearance of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> outbreaks within the native range of the scale, indicating newly efficacious biological control may have become established. The most recent parasitoid survey throughout Guam’s 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> habitats was conducted in late 2017 and early 2018 and revealed 
 <italic>A. chionaspidis</italic> remained the only parasitoid reared from 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> leaves infested with 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic>. Studies to determine what appears to be fortuitously controlling 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> on Guam in the past two years are urgently needed. We propose three possibilities. First, a new and unidentified parasitoid may have invaded Guam in recent years. Second, either 
 <italic>C. fulvus</italic> or 
 <italic>A. lingnanensis</italic> may have established following our many releases of these two parasitoids, but only recently irrupted to a population density such that effective biological control of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> was initiated. Third, the 
 <italic>A. chionaspidis</italic> population known to be widespread in Guam may have become more efficacious in controlling the scale. Indeed, the combination of 
 <italic>A. yasumatsui</italic> on 
 <italic>C. micronesica</italic> in the Mariana Islands’ climate has never been available to this parasitoid, and perhaps these interacting factors combine to improve the parasitoid’s biological control abilities.
