  <title>Phylogenetic tree of JY1, JY2 and JY3 as well as reference isolates.</title>
  <p>JY1, JY2 and JY3 were representative isolates used for identifying 
   <italic>F. fujikuroi, F. oxysporum</italic> and 
   <italic>C. gloeosporioides.</italic> The analysis involved 16 internal transcribed spacer sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA. 
   <italic>Penicillium oxalicum</italic> (

The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.57566860 is shown.
