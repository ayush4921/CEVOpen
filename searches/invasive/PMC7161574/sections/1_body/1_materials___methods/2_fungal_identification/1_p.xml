<p>The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) have been successfully used in resolving phylogenetic relationships of the fungi in the genera 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2014</xref>) and 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Weir, Johnston &amp; Damm, 2012</xref>). Combining with morphological characteristics, these fungi can be identified well to species level (

 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> along with a natural pathogen of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>, 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> was performed with a combined method of molecular and morphological analyses. 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> was isolated directly from leaves of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> infected with 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> in the field
 <italic>.</italic> Briefly, a leaf spot was excised from infected leaf and transferred on sterile PDA contained in a sterile Petri dish, and then incubated in dark at 26 °C. Subsequent process of fungal purification was performed using the above method
 <italic>.</italic> According to the differentiation of colony morphology, the cultures of these three fungi were divided into three morphotypes.
