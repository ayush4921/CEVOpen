<p>Real-time PCR reactions were conducted with 10 ng of cDNA, 200 nM of each primer, 10 µl of the SYBR green master mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and double distilled water (ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O) in a final volume of 20 µl. In the negative control, cDNA was replaced by ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. Reactions were performed on an ABI PRISM 7500HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The program used for real-time PCR was as follow: 10 s at 95 °C, 45 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 53 °C and 34 s at 72 °C. Two replicates of real-time PCR reactions were performed for each sample.
