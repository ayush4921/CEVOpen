<p>The melting curve analysis was performed to verify the sensitivity and specificity of primers. After the real-time PCR finished, Ct number was extracted for both actin gene and 
 <italic>NPR1</italic> gene with auto baseline and manual threshold. The relative expression of 
 <italic>NPR1</italic> gene and actin gene were calculated according to the 2
 <sup>−ΔCt</sup> method provided by 
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Schmittgen &amp; Livak (2008)</xref>. Δ Ct = Ct
