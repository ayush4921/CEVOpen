<p>One hundred and twenty cuttings of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> were divided evenly into four groups including three treatments and one control. The leaf surface was sterilized as above. One hour later, three treatments were pre-inoculated with the conidial suspension of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> alone or a mixture of both fungi, respectively. The conidial suspension of the fungal mixture of the two species was prepared with an equal volume of conidial suspension of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. Pre-inoculation volume of conidial suspension on each leaf was 2.5 ml. The leaves in the control group were sprayed with an equal volume of sterile potato dextrose broth. All cuttings were then cultivated with sterile Hoagland nutrient solution in sterile illuminating incubator at 28 ± 1 °C with a 14/10 h photoperiod (cool- white neon tube (200 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>). The relative humidity in the illuminating incubator was maintained at 75%–80%. After 3 days, these cuttings were removed and inoculated with 2.5 ml of conidial suspension of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> per leaf, then returned to illuminating incubator. After 15 days, these cuttings were harvested.
