<p>Thirty two cuttings of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> were selected for assessing pathogenicities of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>. The leaf surface was sterilized by cleaning twice with the degreased cotton immersed by 75% (v/v) ethanol. These cuttings were divided evenly into four groups including three treatments and one control. Thus, each treatment was repeated eight times. One hour later, the three treatments were inoculated with conidial suspension of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, respectively. Inoculation volume of conidial suspension on each leaf was 2.5 ml. Leaves in the control group were sprayed with an equal volume of sterile potato dextrose broth. All inoculated cuttings were then cultivated with sterile Hoagland nutrient solution in sterile illuminating incubator at 28 ± 1 °C with a 14/10 h photoperiod (cool- white neon tube (200 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>). The relative humidity in the illuminating incubator was maintained at 75%–80%. After 7 days, all cuttings were harvested, and then the inoculated leaves of each cutting were photographed with a digital camera. Total number of pixel of lesions and pixels of the whole leaf were measured with Adobe Photoshop CS6 software (Adobe System Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The lesion area ratio was calculated as the % of the whole leaf area.
