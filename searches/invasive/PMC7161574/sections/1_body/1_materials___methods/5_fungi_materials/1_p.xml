<p>Fungal isolates identified as 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> in the previous experiments were subcultivated on fresh PDA and used as experiment materials. Twenty days old cultures of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> were used for preparation of their respective conidial suspensions. Briefly, the mycelia were transferred to 200 ml of sterile potato dextrose broth contained in a 250 ml sterile conical flask, which was then sealed with parafilm, shaken repeatedly and incubated in dark at 26 °C. After 24 h, the fungal suspension was filtered with three layers of sterile gauze to obtain the conidial suspension. Conidial concentration of each fungal species was determined using hemocytometer (Shanghai Medical Optical Instrument Plant, Shanghai, China) and photonic microscope, then adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> ml
 <sup>−1</sup> with sterile potato dextrose liquid broth according to the methods of
