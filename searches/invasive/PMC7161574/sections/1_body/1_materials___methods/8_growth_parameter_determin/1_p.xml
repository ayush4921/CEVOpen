<p>The stem length of five random replicates was measured from the harvested cuttings of each treatment and the control group. Each cutting was then clipped into small pieces and dried at 75 °C in a drying oven for 10 h to weigh the biomass. Five random replicates of harvested cuttings from each treatment and the control were sampled to determine the lesion area ratio according to the method described above.</p>
