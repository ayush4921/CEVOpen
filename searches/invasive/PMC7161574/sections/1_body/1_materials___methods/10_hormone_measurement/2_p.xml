<p>SA and JA were extracted following the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Engelberth et al. (2003)</xref>, with some modification. Frozen leaves (1.0 g) in each sample were weighed and ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder. Extraction was done by adding 10 ml of methanol and transferring the mixture to a 50 ml centrifuge tube, then set on a shaker at 300 rpm for 2 h. After centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to another centrifuge tube and concentrated under a flow of nitrogen gas. The residue was reconstituted with 1 ml of methanol, then was filtered through a 0.2- Âµm-Teflon filter into an autosampler vials.
