<p>According to the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Ratzinger et al. (2009)</xref>, with some modification, an AB Sciex Qtrap
 <sup>®</sup> 5500 LC/MS/MS system (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) with multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to quantify SA and JA. The sample was injected onto a reverse-phase column PAK C18-ARC (150 × 2.0 mm, 3 µm, Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) kept at 25 °C and eluted isocratically with the mobile phase consisting of 5 mM ammonium acetate (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The injection volume was 0.2 µl. The eluate was subjected to positive electrospray ionization, and the ions were detected using the following mass transitions: SA m/z 137.0 → m/z 93; JA m/z 209.0 → m/z 59.0.
