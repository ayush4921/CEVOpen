<p>Fungal epiphytes were isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> following the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Cerezo et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, each sample was dipped into 75 ml of sterile distilled water contained in a 250 ml sterile conical flask. The conical flask was set on a shaker (IKA, Staufen, Germany) at 170 rpm for 60 min. The resulting suspension (200 µl) was plated onto sterile potato dextrose agar (PDA) contained in a sterile Petri dish. The plating was performed in triplicate. Control treatments only contained sterile water and PDA. All plates were incubated in dark at 26 °C for 15 days. Plates were checked daily and each emerging fungal colony was transferred onto a fresh PDA until axenic cultures were obtained. These cultures were classified into diverse morphotypes according to color, texture and colony morphology, and were used for species identification. The value 1 and 0 indicated the presence or absence of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, respectively on each sample. These values were used to assess the occurrence of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>.
