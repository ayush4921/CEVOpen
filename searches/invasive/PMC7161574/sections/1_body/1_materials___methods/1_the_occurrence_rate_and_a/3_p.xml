<p>In addition, the abundance of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> on 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> in the field was compared between healthy leaves and leaves infected with 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>. In Huitong village, Zhuhai city, three sample plots covering more than 100 m
 <sup>2</sup> were selected for leaf sampling. Six healthy leaves and equal number of infected leaves of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> were collected from each sample plot and separately stored in a sterile plastic Ziploc
 <sup>®</sup> bag as a healthy and infected sample, then returned to the laboratory for further analyses. After weighing of each sample, fungal isolation, purification and morphotype classification were performed using the above methods. The colony-forming units (CFU) of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> were recorded. The abundance of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> was expressed as CFU per gram fresh weight (FW).
