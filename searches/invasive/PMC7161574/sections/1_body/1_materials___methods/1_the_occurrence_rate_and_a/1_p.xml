<p>To investigate the occurrence of epiphytic 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, sunny saline, sunny non-saline and shady non-saline habitats with 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> were selected for leaf sampling. The saline habitat was located in intertidal zones of Yakou village, Zhongshan city (22°28′1.03″N, 113°32′42.56″E). The non-saline habitat was located in Huitong village, Zhuhai city (22°21′26.60″N, 113°30′46.18″E). The linear distance between the saline and non-saline habitats is about 20 km. In each habitat, five 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> populations covering more than 50 m
 <sup>2</sup> were selected as sample plots. Distances between sample plots are more than 500 m. In each sample plot, three sample sites covering about 4 m
 <sup>2</sup> were selected randomly. In each sample site, three healthy leaves of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> were excised and pooled together as a sample, then stored in a sterile plastic Ziploc
 <sup>®</sup> (Racine, WI) bag and returned to the laboratory. A total of 45 samples (3 habitats ×5 sample plots ×3 sample sites) were used for analyzing the occurrence rate of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>.
