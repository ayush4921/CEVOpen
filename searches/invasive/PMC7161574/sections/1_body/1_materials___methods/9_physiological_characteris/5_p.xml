<p>Chitinase activity was measured according to the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Chen &amp; Lee (1994)</xref>. The mixture containing 400 µl of the supernatant and 400 µl of colloidal chitin (10 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 1.5 ml of DNS reagent, then boiled for 5 min. Enzyme and substrate blank were also included. The absorbance of the obtained solution was recorded at 530 nm. A standard curve was established with 0–1 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). A unit of chitinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the release of 0.5 µmol of NAG equivalent per hour.
