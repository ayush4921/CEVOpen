<p>β-1,3-glucanase activity was measured according to the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">De la Cruz et al. (1995)</xref>. The reaction was started by mixing 200 µl of the supernatant and 200 µl of laminarin (1 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 2 ml of dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), then boiled for 5 min. Enzyme and substrate blank were also included. The absorbance of the obtained solution was recorded at 600 nm. A standard curve was established with 0 to 80 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> glucose. A unit of β-1,3-glucanase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the release of 1 µmol of glucose equivalent per minute.
