<p>H

 <sub>2</sub> was extracted according to the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson, Watkins &amp; Harman (1983)</xref>. The deveined leaf (0.2 g FW) was homogenized in 5 ml cold acetone in a mortal. The extract and washings were centrifuged (4,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used to measure H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration by modification of the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Brennan &amp; Frenkel (1977)</xref>. One milliliter of the supernatant was added to 250 µl of 50 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> Ti(SO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> in concentrated H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The solution was shaken, followed by the addition of 2 ml concentrated NH
 <sub>4</sub>OH and thoroughly mixed. After centrifugation (20 min at 4,000 rpm), the supernatant was discarded and the precipitate washed repeatedly with 4 ml acetone until the supernatant was colorless. The precipitate was solubilized in 4 ml 2 NH
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The absorbance of the obtained solutions was recorded at 415 nm against a water blank. The concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the extracts was determined by comparing the absorbance against a standard curve representing 0–80 µmol ml
