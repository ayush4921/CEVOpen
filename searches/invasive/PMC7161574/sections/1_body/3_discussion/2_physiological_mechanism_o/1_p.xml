<p>H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was used to measure ROS. When plants are attacked by pathogens, hypersensitive responses will be elicited and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> will be accumulated in plants (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Lin &amp; Ishii, 2009</xref>). As H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> may directly kill pathogens at infection sites (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Lin &amp; Ishii, 2009</xref>), we inferred that significant increase of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration in leaves of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> induced by 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> alone and a mixture of both fungi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6A</xref>) might have strengthened inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> at infection sites and prevented further expansion of leaf lesion, resulting in significantly less lesion area ratio relative to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> also can be employed as a signal molecule to mediate the levels of downstream signal of SA and JA (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Ren &amp; Dai, 2012</xref>) and induces pathogen resistance of plants (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Keshavarz-Tohid et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, significantly increased SA and JA content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Figs. 7A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">7B</xref>) in leaves of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> pre-inoculated with 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> alone and mixture should be relevant to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> accumulation in leaves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6A</xref>).
