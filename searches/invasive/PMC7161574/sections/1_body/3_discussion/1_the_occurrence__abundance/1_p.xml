<p>Symbiosis between plants and microbes is a very common ecological relationship. Host plants obtain diverse benefits from the symbiosis involving the improvement of nutrition availability (

 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Bertolazi et al., 2019</xref>), yields (
 <xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2016</xref>) and tolerance against abiotic as well as biotic stresses (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Daneshkhah, Grundler &amp; Wieczorek, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, the occurrence rates of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> on leaf surface of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> reached up to 100% regardless of habitat. The results indicated that the symbiosis between 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> was established naturally in habitats and was considerably stable
 <italic>.</italic> Moreover, with artificial inoculation, we found that 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> were not pathogenic to 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>, conversely, they enhanced pathogen resistance of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> and significantly reduced lesion area ratio of leaves (

 <italic>.</italic> Previous studies have shown that pathogen resistance of plants can be induced by 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Patil et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">Veloso &amp; Díaz, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, under natural conditions, the abundance of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> on healthy leaves was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> infected leaves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> The results further suggested that the health of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> plants was relevant to high abundance of symbiotic 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>. Since 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> first invaded Hong Kong as an exotic species in 1912 (
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>), it has experienced an invasive history spanning 100 years in China. 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Saikkonen et al. (2016)</xref> reported that symbiosis was the outcome of long-term co-evolution between microbes and host plants. To our knowledge, the symbiosis between microbes and 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> was first reported in the present study. Thus, it is not clear whether the symbiosis between 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> is inherent in its native location or established afterwards 
 <italic>via</italic> co-evolution in the invasive regions. We believe that, by investigating the presence or absence of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> on 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> in its native locations, the origin of their symbiosis can be better understood. If 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> in its native locations harbors 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, we can conclude that their symbiosis is inherent. If not, then it is likely that their symbiosis is established in invasive regions of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that the symbiosis had important ecological significance in alleviating the pathogen pressure of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> imposed on 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> in nature.
