 <italic>Ipomoea cairica</italic> (L.) Sweet is native to tropical Africa and is causing a serious invasive ecological problem in South China (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). This weed usually occurs in non-arable lands, wastelands, forests edges and farmlands where it invades the original diverse community which is always reduced to a monoculture (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Owing to its strong salt tolerance, 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> has been found to have successfully invaded into mangrove wetland in the coastal areas (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and seriously threatened local eco-systematic functions. In addition, 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>cairica</italic> has strong pathogen resistance and is scarcely infected with pathogens in nature. Only a disease symptom caused by 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> was observed sporadically on 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> plants in previous field investigations (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Lin &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>). Although several herbicides have shown significant efficacies in controlling 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>cairica</italic>, their application may lead to environmental pollution (
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the use of biological control is an attractive option. To help with the biological control of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>, it is important to understand its mechanisms of pathogen resistance which to date remain relatively unknown.
