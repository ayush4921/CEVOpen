<p>The interactions between plants and symbiotic microbes have been well studied in plant invasion ecology (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Soares et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Shearin et al., 2018</xref>). Some microbial symbionts have been identified as drivers in successful plant invasions owing to their plant growth promoting effects (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>). The results obtained in the present study provide new evidence that epiphytic 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> act as pathogen resistance inducers of the invasive plant 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>. However, in this study, we only targeted the selected epiphytic 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> to explore their contributions of pathogen resistance to 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>, which might have overlooked other microbial symbionts associated with pathogen resistance against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>. Therefore, future works should systematically investigate the overall symbiotic microbial community (endophytes and epiphytes) of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>, screen microbial species functioning as plant pathogen resistance inducers, and thereby extend the study of ecological and physiological mechanisms inducing pathogen resistance. In addition, in relation to the management and control of 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic>, the disruption of the symbiosis between 
 <italic>I. cairica</italic> and mutualistic microbes might provide a potentially effective strategy.
