<p>The total size of ITS regions of JY1, JY2 and JY3 were 561, 557 and 588 bp, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the ITS sequences of JY1 and 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> were clustered into the same group with 98% of bootstraps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). The ITS sequences of JY2 and JY3 were respectively clustered together with that of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> into the same groups with 100% of bootstraps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Morphologically, JY1 produced abundant orange sporodochia, the colony color was white to orange on PDA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The macroconidia were sparse, hyaline, sickle-shaped, with two to three septations, and measured 22.7 to 40.8 × 3.1 to 4.1 µm (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). Microconidia were formed in chains or scattered, hyaline, aseptate or one septate. They were generally slender, clavate with a flattened base, and measured 5.2 to 15.0 × 1.5 to 3.8 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). Colony color of JY2 was white to purple on PDA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The macroconidia were sparse, hyaline, slightly sickle-shaped, with two septations, and measured 30.2 to 42.5 × 3.4 to 4.5 µm (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). Microconidia were abundant, hyaline, aseptate, and formed abundantly in false heads. They were generally oval-ellipsoid to kidney-shaped and measured 5.2 to 15.0 × 1.5 to 3.8 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). Based on the morphological criteria presented in the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> Laboratory Manual (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Leslie &amp; Summerell, 2006</xref>) and phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), JY1 and JY2 were identified as 
 <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, respectively. Colony color of JY3 was white to pale grey with orange conidial masses near the inoculums point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The conidia were abundant and cylinder-shaped, and measured 9.0 to 14.7 × 3.1 to 4.1 µm (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). These morphological characteristics were highly in agreement with a previous description of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Rabha et al., 2016</xref>). Combining the morphological with phylogenetic analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), JY3 was identified as 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>.
