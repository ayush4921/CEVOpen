<p id="Par24">Model projections suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on the amount of suitable habitat within Minnesota for each of the four invasive plant species studied (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). General trends (i.e., increasing or decreasing) are similar across both HadGEM and CCSM projections. Both buckthorn species are projected to lose large amounts of suitable habitat in the warmest climate scenarios (e.g., RCP 8.5, and 2050s RCP 6.0). While there is relatively little research regarding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> physiology, growth, and recruitment, there is a growing body of such literature for 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic>. Experimental work from Reich et al. (2018)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>
 </sup> suggest warming of + 3.4 °C above current temperatures may increase net photosynthesis when soil moisture levels are high. Other work has found that both flooding and drought have significant negative impacts on 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic> photosynthesis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. The importance of moisture indicated by these studies tracks with our constructed models: we found precipitation variables to be consistently among the most important predictors in each 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic> model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), particularly annual precipitation and precipitation of the driest month. Additional work suggests that warming temperatures will have varying impacts on 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic>; Wright et al. (2018)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup> found a negative relationship between seedling emergence rate and warming temperatures, while Fisichelli et al. (2014)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
 </sup> found a positive or nonexistent relationship, depending on whether leaf litter was present. Overall, the potential impacts of a changing climate on 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic> seem complex. Based on current climate conditions and the distribution of this species in the upper Midwest region, our models suggest that habitat suitability will likely decline by the late twenty-first century in the two climate change RCPs considered here.
