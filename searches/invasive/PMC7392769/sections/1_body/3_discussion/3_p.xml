<p id="Par25">In contrast to the buckthorn species, our results suggest that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> and 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> are predicted to gain suitable habitat within Minnesota (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Both of these species are distributed much more abundantly in the southern region of the model training area (i.e., Iowa, southern Wisconsin, southern Minnesota) and beyond; 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is common in southern Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and is found as far south as Georgia, while 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> is widely distributed across the eastern United States, from the southeastern corner of Minnesota to the Gulf shore of Texas
