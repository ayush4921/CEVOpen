<p id="Par23">The current and future distribution estimates produced for each of the four invasive plant species in this study provide a synoptic view of potential areas of concern for these species over time, while also highlighting the utility of large, semi-open databases such as EDDMapS. The distribution models produced here are, to our knowledge, the first detailed spatially-continuous estimates of both current and (climate-mediated) future habitat suitability for these four species in the Minnesota region. Previous spatially-explicit analyses for these species have focused on contemporary climate conditions and have either been broad in scope or focused on other regions. Broad-scale distributional and habitat analyses have previously been conducted for
