<p id="Par30">Similar to 
 <italic>A. petiolata, R. multiflora</italic> is rare among invasive plants in that it can be found in intact understories within closed-canopy forests
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, though it is more frequently found in forested areas with relatively low basal area, forest gaps, and edges
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>

 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> under different climate change scenarios (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) is concerning because the species frequently forms dense thickets along forest edges and in forest gaps, inhibiting the growth of other species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. Outside of forest-related concerns, recent research by Adalsteinsson et al. (2018)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>
 </sup> suggests that areas invaded by 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> are associated with an increased prevalence of 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the bacterial source of Lyme disease, in black-legged ticks (
 <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>); though, the dense vegetation structure of 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic>-invaded stands does not necessarily make human disease risk more likely, as nymphs in dense invaded stands are hypothesized to feed primarily on smaller-bodied hosts such as mice. The predicted growth of suitable habitat for 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> in northern Minnesota as time and climate progress, particularly along the shore of Lake Superior, is likely to be of concern in the future, as there is an abundance of forestland fragmented by recreational trails, roads, and harvest gaps in the region.
