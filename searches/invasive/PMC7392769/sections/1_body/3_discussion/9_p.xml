<p id="Par31">Here, we present a series of predictions outlining the potential current and future distributions of four forest plant invaders in Minnesota, as well as an assessment regarding the impact of two climate change scenarios across two different climate models and the importance of input data source. Results suggest a potential loss of suitable habitat in Minnesota for both buckthorn species under the climate change scenarios considered here, and a gain for 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>. Indeed, our results suggest that climate change affects the area and spatial distribution of predictions, and that differences between models constructed with different input data become more pronounced over time and in warmer scenarios. The predictions produced as part of this work are a function of the availability of data for each species, and an increase in reporting effort would likely improve the accuracy and utility of such models; the continued use of tools such as EDDMapS and of citizen scientist data collection in general

 </sup> are promising in this respect. The continued development and interconnectivity of databases and data-driven tools is an important factor in tackling the ongoing challenge of invasive species in forest management and conservation. Indeed, the future of forest management and conservation is faced with an abundance of uncertainty, whether from climate change, invasive plants, anthropogenic activity, or otherwise
