 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. This approach allows for parsimonious model and variable selection without sacrificing model performance. We used a row standardization approach to model selection with a parsimony factor (allowable error for competing models) of 0.05. This process allowed us to eliminate 11 variables from our analyses, as they either had consistently low importance or demonstrated high multicollinearity with more important variables. Variables used for model training therefore included: elevation, soil particle size, soil drainage, soil taxonomic group, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, mean precipitation of the driest quarter, mean precipitation of the wettest quarter, precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation of precipitation), and temperature seasonality (standard deviation * 100).
