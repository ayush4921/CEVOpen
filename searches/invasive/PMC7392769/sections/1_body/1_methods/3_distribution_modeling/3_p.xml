<p id="Par16">To assess the impact of modeling invasive plant distributions using data from different sources, we created separate sets of models for each species using: (1) only data from public (i.e., government) sources, i.e., the FIA database, and federal, state, local, and tribal government sources entered into EDDMapS, (2) data from both public and private sources, i.e., the previous plus data from non-governmental organizations, the general public, volunteer groups, and other private sources entered into EDDMapS, and (3) all available data, i.e., data from the previous plus all data without an explicitly-defined source entered into EDDMapS.</p>
