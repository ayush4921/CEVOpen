<p id="Par15">While our primary area of interest was Minnesota, models were trained on a broad five-state region consisting of data from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota to avoid niche truncation and provide additional training data. Model performance was evaluated using the internal RF performance metrics produced using out-of-bag sampling, as well as a 70:30 training:testing data split to minimize data leakage. Performance was assessed using threshold-dependent metrics, including Cohen’s kappa (κ), balanced accuracy, and positive predictive value, and threshold-independent metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the correlation coefficient. Variable importance was assessed using the mean decrease in node impurity, which is a relative measure of how well trees in the random forest split the data. Continuous and binary distribution estimate maps were produced for Minnesota for each species; binary maps were created using a threshold based on the maximization of model specificity and sensitivity. Climate change projections using the HadGEM and CCSM climate projections were created for each distribution model under both the RCP 6.0 and 8.5 pathways for the 2050s and 2070s.</p>
