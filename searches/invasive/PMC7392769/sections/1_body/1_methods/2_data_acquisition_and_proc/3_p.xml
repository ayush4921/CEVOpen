<p id="Par12">We acquired environmental data for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota that spanned a number of attributes, including climate, soils, and topography. Climate data describing contemporary conditions were obtained from WorldClim (v 1.4) in the form of 30-year climate normals

 </sup>. Future climate data were obtained from WorldClim for multi-decadal means centered on 2050 and 2070 for two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working group: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 6.0 and 8.5. RCP 6.0 represents a ‘stabilization’ emissions pathway in which the radiative forcing as a result of greenhouse gas emissions stabilizes after 2,100, while RCP8.5 represents a ‘rising radiative forcing’ pathway where radiative forcing as a result of greenhouse gas emissions continues to increase
