<p id="Par11">Location data were processed to remove incomplete records, unverified records (EDDMapS), and duplicate points. To mitigate the impact of spatial bias as a result of non-systematic sampling in the EDDMapS data, we subsampled the location data using a 900 m
 <sup>2</sup> grid; subsampling was completed using the gridSample() function in the

 </sup>, allowing for one sample per grid cell. Ameliorating the effects of spatial bias in sample locations is desirable because it can result in a bias in predictor space, which can affect model accuracy and transferability
