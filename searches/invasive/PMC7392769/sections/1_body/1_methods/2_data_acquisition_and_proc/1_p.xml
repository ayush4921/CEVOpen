 </sup>. Because EDDMapS is a database open to submissions via the web, it contains data from a broad range of sources including reports of invasive plant presence from federal, state, and local agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private organizations and individuals. This array of contributions from different sources results in a relatively large number of reported locations, but the nature of the data means that the locations are not systematic or free of spatial bias. Plant location data obtained from the FIA database, in contrast, are known to have been collected in a systematic fashion
