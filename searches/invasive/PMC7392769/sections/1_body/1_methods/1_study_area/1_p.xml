<p id="Par8">This study was focused on invasive plant distributions and changes in distribution across the U.S. state of Minnesota. Ecosystems and land cover types vary across the state, ranging from boreal forests in the northeast, mixed hardwood and agricultural land in a region running from the north-central part of the state to the southeast corner, to ubiquitous cropland and heavily fragmented prairie in the west and south-west regions of the state. Forests in the north and northeast regions of the state consist of species such as pine (
 <italic>Pinus</italic> spp.), quaking aspen (
 <italic>Populus tremuloides</italic>), spruce (
 <italic>Picea</italic> spp.), balsam fir (
 <italic>Abies balsamea</italic>), and paper birch (
 <italic>Betula papyrifera</italic>). In the central and southeastern part of the state, species such as oak (
 <italic>Quercus</italic> spp.), maple (
 <italic>Acer</italic> spp.), quaking aspen, and basswood (
 <italic>Tilia americana</italic>) are common
