<p id="Par6">The invasive plant management strategies outlined here frequently depend on data-driven tools such as treatment prescription databases (e.g., Midwest Invasive Plant Network’s invasive plant control database

 </sup>, and this can become a concern when species location data are collected in an unsystematic way and are reported by different sources or pulled from different databases. In addition, SDMs are typically trained based on contemporary environmental conditions whereas invasive plant management is an ongoing and decades-long process. It is therefore important from a long-term planning perspective to consider not only the contemporary distributions as predicted by SDMs, but also future projections which take varying climate change scenarios into account.
