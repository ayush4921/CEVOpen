 </sup> preventing dispersal can be difficult. Government regulations are one of the primary tools used in prevention efforts. Early detection and eradication efforts typically focus on finding and destroying the invasive plants as they spread into new areas along the invasion front

 </sup>, with a major challenge being detection over large or remote areas. Mitigation efforts for these four species in Minnesota may come in the form of forest restoration and/or forest management treatments including site-preparation, mechanical treatments and prescribed burning.
