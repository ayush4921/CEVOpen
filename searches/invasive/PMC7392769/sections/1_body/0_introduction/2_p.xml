 <italic>Rhamnus cathartica</italic> and 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> are two morphologically similar woody invaders increasingly common in forests across the upper Midwest of the U.S. The more widespread of these, 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic>, invades a variety of habitat types including forests and forest edges
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup> and can tolerate drier upland conditions as well as some partially flooded conditions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic> may affect native forests in several ways
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, including reducing overall forest biomass relative to non-invaded stands
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, reducing native understory plant germination, survival, and growth
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup> and altering leaf litter cover and forest floor communities
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> occupies a niche similar to 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic> but has been reported to invade more mesic and wet sites rather than upland sites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Research examining the impacts of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> on native forests suggests a variety of impacts, including reduced growth and survival of native plants, particularly tree seedlings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, reduced native tree seedling density
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> and plant species abundance
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Taken together, these two woody invaders represent a challenge for conservation professionals, foresters, and land managers seeking to maintain healthy forests across the upper Midwest.
