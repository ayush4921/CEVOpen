<p id="Par2">Invasive plants have been a topic of concern in forest ecosystems for several decades, owing to their impacts on biodiversity, community composition, forest structure, and ecosystem services
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. These impacts come as a result of altered regeneration and recruitment patterns, fire regimes, hydrology, and trophic interactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. In the U.S., forests are affected by a number of different invaders, ranging from herbaceous plants like Japanese stiltgrass (
 <italic>Microstegium vimineum</italic>) to woody plants such as Japanese barberry (
 <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic>), privet (
 <italic>Ligustrum</italic> spp.), tree-of-heaven (
 <italic>Ailanthus altissima</italic>), and honeysuckle (
 <italic>Lonicera</italic> spp.). These invaders have varying effects on U.S. forests. Japanese stiltgrass, for example, can form dense patches of homogenous growth under a wide range of light and moisture conditions, ultimately interfering with forest regeneration

 <italic>Lonicera</italic> spp.) are similar in that they can frequently form patches of dense homogenous growth, crowd out native vegetation

 </sup>. Species-specific impacts on forest ecosystems vary

 </sup>, and the species of concern can vary regionally. In the eastern and central U.S. in particular, common and glossy buckthorn (
 <italic>Rhamnus cathartica</italic>, 
 <italic>Frangula alnus</italic>), garlic mustard (
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>), and multiflora rose (
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic>) are plants of concern and are the focus of this study.
