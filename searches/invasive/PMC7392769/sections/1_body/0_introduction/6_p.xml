<p id="Par7">In this study, we aimed to estimate the distribution of the four forest-invaders described above: 
 <italic>R. cathartica</italic>, 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> across the state of Minnesota. All four species are invasive in Minnesota forests, and spur ongoing management and control efforts in the state. We sought to compare current distribution estimates with future estimates under two different climate change emissions scenarios as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (RCP 6.0 and 8.5)

 </sup>, and to determine whether input data source and composition (i.e., observations from public, private and unattributed sources had an impact on current and future predictions as well as model accuracy. Specifically, our objectives were to: (1) model and estimate the current potential distribution of all four species across Minnesota, (2) analyze the potential impacts of climate change on the potential distribution of each species, and (3) determine the relative importance and contribution of plant reporting source to current and future estimates of potential distribution for each species.
