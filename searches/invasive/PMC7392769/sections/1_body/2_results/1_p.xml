 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with values of κ &gt; 0.75 and AUC &gt; 0.90. Model data set source had no significant impact on performance in general (χ

 <italic>Frangula alnus</italic>, which had 140 privately-reported plant locations (out of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 445, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) demonstrated the lowest overall κ and correlation coefficients in the public and public + private data source models, but a similar pattern was not found in the performance results for 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, which also demonstrated a fairly large proportion of privately-reported plant locations (342 out of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,082, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
