<p id="Par19">Climatic variables were consistently among the most important predictors for each species across models (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Precipitation variables in particular were consistently important for each species, especially annual precipitation and precipitation of the driest month. Temperature variables were consistently important for 
 <italic>R. cathartica, F. alnus,</italic> and 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic>, but not for 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>. Non-climate variables, particularly soil particle size and elevation, were more important for 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> relative to the other species.
