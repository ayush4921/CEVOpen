 <p>We explored whether microbial communities differed in rhizosphere of native and non‚Äênative 
  <italic>Phragmites autralis</italic>. We found that rhizosphere communities were not different in most locations, but subtle differences could emerge in bacterial communities of dense patches. We concluded that rhizosphere microbial communities do not likely drive invasiveness of 
  <italic>Phragmites</italic>, but may change as a consequence of ongoing invasions.
