 <caption> Comparison of bulk, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane soil bacterial communities paired at each plot along the Ohio transects. When sample location is set as a conditioning variable in a constrained ordination (db‐RDA), communities clearly separate depending on their proximity to the root surface. Soil fraction is a significant predictor of variation at the plot level ( F = 8.8593, p = .001) but lineage is not ( F = 1.0239, p = .338) </caption>
