<p>Plants may select for particular belowground microbial communities through release of specific root exudates or by altering the rhizosphere soil environment. For instance, in waterlogged soils, oxygen diffusion into the soil could select for more aerobic organisms in the root zone. Importantly, native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> differ vastly in their ability to aerate soils in the root zone, with the differences driven mostly by higher live stem density and a large number of senesced stems from previous years in invasive populations (Tulbure et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Therefore, microbial community differences between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages may result from differences in soil oxygen concentrations and the strength of differences may depend on the stand age, density, and dominance of the patch.
