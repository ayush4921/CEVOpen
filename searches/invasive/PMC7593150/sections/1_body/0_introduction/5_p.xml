<p>The microorganisms associated with 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations have been implicated in its performance in a variety of settings worldwide. For instance, in native European populations, bacterial and oomycete communities in the rhizosphere correlated with stages of decline in populations affected by reed die‐back syndrome (Bacci et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Cerri et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Likewise, several authors have suggested the key to understanding the invasive nature of non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> in North America may lie in microbial associations (Clay et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Kowalski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Shearin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, the sum of evidence for widespread differences in microbial assemblages between native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages is mixed. For instance, Nelson and Karp (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) found different rhizosphere pathogen communities (mainly 
 <italic>Pythium</italic> spp.) associated with each lineage, although the total abundance of rhizosphere pathogens did not differ. They speculated that those differences may increase invasiveness of non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> due to enemy release (Keane &amp; Crawley, 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Additional evidence indicates that differential virulence of pathogens might favor non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> over native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and especially over other native species (Crocker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
