<p>Several studies have found less support for differential microbial community cultivation between native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages. For example, in tidal wetlands of the Chesapeake Bay region (Mid‐Atlantic coast of USA), 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages cultivated dissimilar rhizosphere archaeal communities, but contrary to the findings of Bowen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), rhizosphere bacterial communities did not differ between lineages (Yarwood et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Likewise, our recent study examining root endophytes residing in native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> roots in the state of Michigan, USA, revealed that root bacterial, fungal, and oomycetes communities did not differ between native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages (Bickford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Instead, root microbial communities were strongly influenced by environmental characteristics, such as soil saturation and nutrient status. Because microbial communities residing in native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> roots did not differ in either composition or function, there was no evidence to suggest that root endophytes contributed to the invasiveness of the non‐native lineage.
