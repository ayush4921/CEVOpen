<p>Here, we expand upon our previous study on microbes internal to the roots of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> (Bickford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) to examine broad components of the rhizosphere soil microbiome (i.e., bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes) in native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations. Given the mixed evidence for distinction in rhizosphere microbial communities between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages, we sought to examine whether soil communities surrounding each lineage differed or, as with the root communities of the Great Lakes, were similar. Despite no differences found in roots (Bickford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), rhizosphere communities may be driven by a separate set of factors such as differences in oxygen diffusion sensu Tulbure et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Accordingly, stand density and dominance may play an important role in the strength of differentiation in microbial communities between lineages. This is the first study to explore rhizosphere soil microbes of multiple groups surrounding lineages of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> in the Great Lakes region and is also the first to qualitatively address the impact of stand age, density, and dominance in rhizosphere community development.
