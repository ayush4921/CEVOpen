<p>We assessed the rhizosphere microbiome of each lineage to investigate the potential role of the rhizosphere microbiome in fostering the invasion of non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. If performance differences between native and non‐native plant lineages are driven by their rhizosphere microbial communities, we would expect (a) the rhizosphere community of native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> to harbor compositionally dissimilar bacteria, fungi, and oomycete communities and (b) the non‐native lineage to associate with more mutualistic and/or fewer pathogenic microbes in rhizosphere soil.
