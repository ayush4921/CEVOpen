<p>We tested these hypotheses over a range of sites across Michigan, USA that varied in environmental conditions, thereby allowing us to explore additional drivers of microbial community composition, such as soil nutrient content and saturation. We further tested our hypotheses at two sites in the state of Ohio, USA, in which dense and extensive populations of native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> intergrade from nearly pure stands to mixtures of each. Intensive sampling along 20‐m transects at these two sites allowed us to explore (a) whether the degree of differentiation differed between dense monoculture stands and mixed plant community zones within the same environment and (b) whether differential rhizosphere cultivation between lineages was detectable at across spatial scales. We included multiple levels of soil proximity to host plant roots in paired samples (rhizoplane, rhizosphere, and bulk soil), allowing us to determine if either lineage cultivates a microbial community that is detectably different from the bulk soil community, and whether the strength or direction of cultivation differs by plant lineage.
