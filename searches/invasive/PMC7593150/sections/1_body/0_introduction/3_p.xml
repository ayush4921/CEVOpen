<p>Soil dwelling microorganisms may play a prominent role in a plant's invasiveness. For example, a recent meta‐analysis found that plant invasions can alter rhizosphere microbial communities, specifically increasing nitrogen mineralization, extracellular enzyme activity, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) abundance, while decreasing soil pathogen and herbivore abundance (Zhang et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Consequently, a better understanding of plant‐microbial interactions and how they differ between native and invasive plant species will improve our collective understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant invasiveness and may ultimately improve invasive species management outcomes.
