<p>Importantly, Bowen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) showed that bacterial communities in the rhizosphere differed dramatically among the dominant 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages broadly distributed across the east and west coasts of North America. In fact, geographically distant 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations of the same lineage had more similar bacterial communities than neighboring populations of different lineages, suggesting that lineage‐specific cultivation drives rhizosphere community composition (Bowen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Despite this compelling evidence of lineage‐specific bacterial selection in the rhizosphere, the authors could not elucidate any functional link between bacterial communities and plant performance.
