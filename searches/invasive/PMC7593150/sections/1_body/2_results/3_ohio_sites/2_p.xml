<p>The intensive sampling arrangement at the Ohio sites allowed us to explore bacterial cultivation at a finer scale than we were able at the Michigan sites and illuminated some subtle, but important bacterial community differences between lineages. First, we compared the rhizosphere bacterial communities between lineages in both the monoculture and mixed zones. This analysis illustrated that lineage effects on rhizosphere bacterial communities depend on the relative density of natives and nonnatives (lineage by stand type interaction; PERMANOVA
