<p>Next, to determine the extent to which 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages were cultivating microbes near the root surface, we took advantage of the paired soil sampling design and compared the bacterial composition and diversity in the rhizoplane to both rhizosphere and bulk soil. There was evidence of some spatial structure in soil fractions as communities of bacteria differed significantly between bulk, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane soils paired at the plot level (partial db‐RDA, sum of squares = 1.7973, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 8.8593, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .001, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In addition, rhizosphere soils were more diverse then the adjacent paired bulk soil and more diverse than paired rhizoplane. Rhizoplane was not different in diversity from bulk soil (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). This suggests that more microbial species are present in the more “biologically active” zone of the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil, but only a subset of those are present in the still more narrowly defined zone of the rhizoplane.
