<p>We also explored the rhizoplane soils for evidence of differential cultivation between lineages. Lineage was a marginally significant predictor of variation across all plots (PERMANOVA 
 <italic>p = </italic>.075); however, it only accounted for ~2% of the variation in community composition and the differences may be caused by differential dispersion between the groups (PERMDISP 
 <italic>p = </italic>.023). Rhizoplane communities of different lineages, therefore, show little separation graphically (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). Thus, across mixed and monoculture zones, we found no evidence of differentiation in microbial communities between lineages, even at a tight proximity to root. Interestingly, differences in rhizoplane soils by lineage did not seem to depend on stand dominance or density as pairwise comparisons showed no differences in community between lineages in monoculture stands (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.000, Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>), and however, this result may have been influenced by the small sample sizes of rhizoplane soils in monocultures (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 in non‐native, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 in native, Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Table
