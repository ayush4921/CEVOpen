<p>We examined the differences in community composition and diversity between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples across the Michigan sites to provide additional context to the lack of community differences seen in rhizosphere communities between the lineages. On average, microbial community composition did not differ between bulk and rhizosphere soils for all three microbial groups (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>), and these results hold for both lineages. Results were similar when spatial structure was accounted for by pairing at the patch level: communities of bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes still did not differ in composition between the bulk and rhizosphere soils (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Diversity of bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes also did not differ between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples, when compared between pairs of co‐collected samples (Table
