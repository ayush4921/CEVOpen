<p>Relative abundance of particular microbial phyla found in the rhizosphere also did not strongly differ by plant lineage, providing further evidence that native and non‐native plant lineages do not cultivate distinct microbial communities. Many of the most abundant bacterial phyla were differentiated among sites (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), mainly driven by saturation (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Figure

 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Soil saturation was a major factor in these differences among sites as it significantly affected abundance of most bacterial phyla (Appendix
