<p>We found little evidence that native and non‐native plant lineages cultivated compositionally different microbial communities at the Michigan sites; communities of bacterial, fungi, and oomycetes did not significantly differ between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1a</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In contrast, sampling site was a significant predictor of variation in rhizosphere community composition for all three microbial groups (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1a</xref>). However, a significant test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions (PERMDISP) suggested that the site differences in bacterial and oomycete communities were likely due to differences in dispersion around the centroids, rather than in mean composition (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1b</xref>). Soil phosphorus was important in structuring bacterial communities (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
