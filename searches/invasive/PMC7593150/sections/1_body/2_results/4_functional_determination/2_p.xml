<p>Putative functional determinations of the microbial taxa in the rhizosphere revealed little to explain mechanisms of invasion. Only 0.5% of the bacterial sequences recovered belonged to known bacterial plant pathogens in the Michigan sites, and of that small portion, potential bacterial pathogens were not differentially abundant between native and non‐native lineages (ANOVA 
 <italic>F</italic> = 1.575, 
 <italic>p = </italic>.215). Potential pathogens made up 1% of the bacterial sequences in the Ohio sites and also did not differ in abundance between lineages (ANOVA 
 <italic>F</italic> = 0.119, 
 <italic>p = </italic>.731). Fungal functional determinations produced a similar result. First, 32.5% of all fungal sequences could not be classified at even the phylum level, leaving their functional potential also unknown. Of the classified sequences that matched the FUNGuild database, the majority were likely soil or litter saprotrophs. While small portion (~3%) were known plant pathogens, the proportion recovered from native rhizospheres was not different from non‐native (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Likewise, none of the other functional groups, including the group that makes up the most common fungal mutualists, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, differed in relative abundance among sites or between plant lineages. We assume that all oomycete groups are pathogenic and although the relative abundance of one dominant family of pathogens, Pythiaceae, was marginally greater in the native lineage, the relative abundance of unclassified oomycetes (likely matching uncultured oomycetes) differed in the opposite direction (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Given the lack of consistency in lineage differences between oomycete families, we do not have compelling evidence that native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> receives higher oomycete pathogen pressure than non‐native.
