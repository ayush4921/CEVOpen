<p>Rhizosphere and the remainder of each bulk soil sample were passed through a sterilized 2‐mm sieve and stored at −80°C until DNA extraction. To obtain rhizoplane soils (Ohio sites), we collected ~10 coarse roots randomly from the root ball of each plant using sterile forceps. Sampled roots were placed into a sterile 50‐ml centrifuge tube with 30 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Tubes were vigorously shaken for 5 min, after which the roots were removed. Tubes were centrifuged at 8,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 5–10 ml of supernatant in a 15‐ml tube and centrifuged again at 8,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. After decanting supernatant, each tube containing pelletized rhizoplane soil was stored at −80°C until DNA extraction.
