<p>DNA was extracted from 50 mg (wet weight) of soils using Qiagen PowerSoil PowerLyzer DNA extraction kits. We used manufacturer protocols, with the exception of improvements to reduce ethanol contamination (e.g., extra spins, more frequent transfers to sterile tubes). DNA was eluted with molecular grade water. All genomic DNA extracts were verified by electrophoresis. Extracts were checked for quality on a NanoDrop UV/Vis spectrophotometer and concentration using a Quant‐iT PicoGreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen).</p>
