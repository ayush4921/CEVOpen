<p>Samples collected from both sampling regions were prepared identically, except for the rhizoplane soils sampled from only the Ohio sites. For soil nutrient analysis, a subset of the bulk soil from each sample was passed through a 2‐mm sieve and oven dried at 60°C for 48 hr. Dried samples were ground with a mortar and pestle, and subsamples from each (0.5 g) were processed in duplicate in a Leco CNS2000 Analyzer (LECO®) to measure total carbon and nitrogen. Extractable soil phosphorus was determined colorimetrically following the Bray P1 extraction method (Bray &amp; Kurtz,
