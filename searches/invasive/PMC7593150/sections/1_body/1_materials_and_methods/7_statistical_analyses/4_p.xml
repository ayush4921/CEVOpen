<p>For both regions, we calculated relative abundance of trophic modes determined by FUNGuild to assess the putative function of microbes and compare between lineages and used ANOVA to explore differences among sites and lineages and ANCOVA to determine impacts of soil nutrients and saturation on trophic mode relative abundance. All analyses used a threshold of

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1 as marginally significant. All R code, notes, and associated data can be accessed at
