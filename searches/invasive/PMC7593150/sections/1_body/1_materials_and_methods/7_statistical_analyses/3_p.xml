<p>In addition to the analyses mentioned above, we performed a few additional tests at the Ohio sites to take advantage of the unique sampling regime of the transects. To compare communities of bacteria between lineages in monoculture zones and in mixture zones, we used a pairwise PERMANOVA using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Martinez Arbizu, 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). We again used a partial db‐RDA to explore community differences between soil fractions and host lineages using sample plot as a conditioning variable to explore evidence of spatial structure in microbial communities.
