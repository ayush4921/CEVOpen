<p>In August 2016, we sampled rhizosphere and bulk soils from native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> at 6 sites distributed across Michigan, USA (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). We selected sites that had at least 3 distinct patches of native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> in close proximity to one another, growing under similar environmental conditions (e.g., soil type, hydrology) with no recent history of invasive plant management (e.g., herbicide, burning). Due to the rarity of co‐occurring native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations that met these criteria (non‐native is rare and well‐managed in northern Michigan; native is rare in southern Michigan), patch size and density varied considerably among sites (1 m
 <sup>2</sup> to 100 m
 <sup>2</sup>) and many patches were of low density. Exact stand age is unknown, but based on Great Lakes water level trends and historical aerial imagery, we can estimate that the stands in northern Michigan were &lt;5 years old when sampled. The stands in southern Michigan appear &lt;10 years old based on aerial imagery. We use the Ohio sites (described below) to assess whether patch size and density changes the extent of microbial community cultivation.
