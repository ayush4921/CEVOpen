<p>At each site, we morphologically identified all 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> patches as native or non‐native and leaf material from each was collected for later genetic confirmation of lineage using the methods of Saltonstall (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). We classified the degree of soil saturation as either unsaturated, saturated, or saturated with standing water, and recorded depth of water (if over the surface) and the nature of surrounding vegetation. At each site, we collected rhizosphere and bulk soil samples in each of three native and three non‐native patches (one site did not have three distinct non‐native patches, see Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="ece36811-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). One ramet near the center of each patch was randomly selected for collection of paired rhizosphere and bulk soils. Using a serrated knife, we cut a 10‐cm diameter circle around the chosen ramet, exhuming subtending roots with adhering soil. The root ball was shaken to remove loosely associated soil. To sample rhizosphere soils, we then vigorously shook the root ball in a bag, saving the soil that fell off. Bulk soils were sampled outside of each 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> patch and paired with rhizosphere soils at the patch level. Leaf samples from the same stem were collected for tissue nutrient analysis. All samples were kept on ice until returned from the field.
