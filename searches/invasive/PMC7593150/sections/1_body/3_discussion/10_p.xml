<p>Although we saw no consistent evidence that 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages cultivate different soil microbiomes, except for at high densities, it is possible that the response to soil microbes differs between lineages to a similar community of microbes. To investigate whether each lineage has a unique response to soil microbes, we would need to take an experimental approach and keep soil communities constant to see how the growth of each lineage is affected by soil microbes. In fact, experimental results indicate that native and non‐native lineages are capable of differential response to similar microbial communities (Bickford,
