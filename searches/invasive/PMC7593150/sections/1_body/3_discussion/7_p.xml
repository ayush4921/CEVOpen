<p>The cumulative evidence from our studies of roots, rhizosphere, and bulk soil suggest that at low densities, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages do not affect microbial communities differently, but as high‐density monocultures establish, dissimilarity in bacterial communities emerges. The functional implication of this dissimilarity is unresolved in regard to invasive capacity. In low density patches, environmental characteristics such as water saturation and soil nutrient content, but not lineage were strong determinants of community composition both in the roots (Bickford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and in the rhizosphere (this study). We speculate that the differences at high density are a consequence of a successful invasion, rather than driving differential success at the initial stages of invasion. We cannot separate the effects of stand age from stand density and dominance as 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> patches become denser and more dominant with time. Therefore, it is possible that as stands mature, becoming denser and more monotypic, dissimilarities in the belowground microenvironments of dense patches of different lineages may drive differences in belowground microbial communities. Subtle microbial community differences could potentially enhance invasiveness if they increased the interaction with mutualistic microbes or conditioned soils to the detriment of other native plants. However, direct comparisons of changes in microbial community function with stand age were outside of the scope of this study.
