<p>Our results contrast with two previous studies. Nelson and Karp (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) explored rhizosphere pathogens and found that oomycete communities differed between native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations in New York, USA. Although our study did find marginal site × lineage interactions in relative abundance of Pythiaceae and unclassified Oomycetes, we did not find overall differences in community composition. It is possible this disparity arises due to sequencing depth in these respective studies. Nelson and Karp (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) used a different sequencing platform that allowed much longer reads than our study (~475 bp vs. ~275 bp). The shorter reads and lower phylogenetic resolution in our study may have contributed to the smaller breadth of oomycete families we observed, thereby affecting community composition. However, in a study of endophytic root communities in the same Michigan sites as studied here, Bickford et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) found no difference in oomycete communities between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages using the same phylogenetic resolution as the rhizosphere data from Nelson and Karp (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Therefore, our results may accurately reflect the oomycete communities, but the lack of differences observed between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages in these two Great Lakes studies could plausibly be a reflection of the small, low density Michigan patches sampled.
