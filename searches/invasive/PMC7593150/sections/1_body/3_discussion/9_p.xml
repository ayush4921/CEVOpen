<p>We gleaned little evidence from putative functional descriptors of our microbial communities that suggests invasiveness of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is explained by differential cultivation of microbes in rhizosphere soils. In addition to the similarity in composition between native and non‐native lineages, both lineages harbored functionally similar microbial communities, consisting mostly of saprotrophic fungi, few known fungal or bacterial pathogens, and a small subset of mutualists (mainly AMF). AMF abundance in the rhizosphere also did not differ among sites. Non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> roots have been found to be more heavily colonized by fungi than native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> with the differences being greatest in drier sites (Bickford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Therefore, while sites do not differ in AMF abundance in soils, recruitment into roots may differ between lineages. Still, given the low abundance of AMF in both studies, especially in wet sites in which the non‐native lineage is often highly successful, it is not likely a major driver of invasiveness in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Lacking evidence to support the role of root‐associated microorganisms in fostering invasive properties in the non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> compared to the native, we suspect differences in plant performance arise due to other aspects of plant growth.
