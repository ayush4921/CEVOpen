<p>Bowen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) focused primarily on well‐established, large, dense 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands in which density differences between lineages may have been prominent. In contrast, our Michigan sites were comprised of smaller stands of each 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineage, due to the lack of sites with large, dense patches of both lineages. One potential consequence of differences in density is soil oxygen concentration. Non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> has a much higher ventilation efficiency than native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, thereby leading to a more oxygenated rhizosphere; this effect is thought to arise from a higher density of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stems in non‐native stands (Tulbure et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In anoxic wetland soils, an increase in the soil oxygen concentration could plausibly change the composition of bacterial communities, such that more aerobic microbes are present. We speculate that the lack of differences observed in our sites could arise from the small, less dense patches sampled and correspondingly small differences in ventilation between native and non‐native lineages at our sites. The fact that the only place where we found differences between lineages was in the dense monoculture zones of the Ohio sites is consistent with this potential mechanism and indicates that dominance may factor into the degree of bacterial community differentiation between lineages, wherein high density, dominant patches may be more likely to host different bacterial communities. Future work should explicitly explore the effects of stand size, density, and soil oxygen concentrations on differential rhizosphere cultivation.
