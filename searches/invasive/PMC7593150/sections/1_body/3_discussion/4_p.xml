<p>Our results also contrast with those found in rhizosphere bacterial communities by Bowen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). These investigators reported that 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages cultivated consistent and distinct bacterial communities in the rhizosphere, regardless of geography, environmental characteristics, or temporal variation. The lack of consistency between our studies is surprising, and there are no clear ecological explanations that resolve the differences. For instance, while their dataset includes samples collected from 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations along the east, west, and Gulf coasts of the United States, their sites span a broad range of tidal influence and salinity regimes. Therefore, differences in salinity, hydrology, or both between our studies are not likely responsible for the different patterns observed. Instead, we argue that stand density and degree of dominance may explain the contrast in results.
