<p>Our evidence also suggests that in small, less dense stands, neither 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineage cultivates a community that is substantially different from the surrounding bulk soil. We could not distinguish the communities of any microbial group between bulk and rhizosphere soils at the Michigan sites. Conversely, when we looked for evidence of cultivation at a fine spatial scale at the Ohio sites, we found clear separation in communities between all three soil fractions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36811-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Rhizoplane soils at the Ohio sites were also less diverse in bacteria than rhizosphere soils, indicating that only a small subset colonize that zone. The biologically active rhizosphere extends to about 4 mm from the root surface, with enzyme activity and oxygen concentration decreasing with increasing distance from the root (Kuzyakov &amp; Razavi, 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), likely creating gradients that drive microbial colonization at different spatial scales. Our inability to detect cultivation in the rhizosphere of the Michigan sites could result from the sampling method not being sensitive enough to pick up differences between soil fractions (i.e., not including rhizoplane samples). Although rhizosphere sampling is common, the methods employed often vary slightly, and small variations can cause difference in the microbes recovered (Barillot et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Nonetheless, our inability to detect differences in the Michigan sites using standard methods is more likely a reflection of the strength of cultivation in the less dense stands.
