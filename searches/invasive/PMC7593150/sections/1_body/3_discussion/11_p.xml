<p>Cumulatively, the results we report here and elsewhere provide little evidence to support the idea that non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> out‐performs native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> by altering the composition and function of root‐associated microbial communities in soil. Alteration of the soil microbiome may occur in dense high‐density patches of native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. However, those differences do not likely drive initial invasiveness and may in fact be consequences of alteration of the soil physical environment as non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> increases dominance and increases surrounding soil oxygen concentration relative to native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, so could potentially be important in later stages of maintaining invasion or expansion. Future research should experimentally examine the role that stand density and dominance play in differential microbial community cultivation, assess the belowground selective forces driving rhizosphere community composition, and evaluate their effects on range expansion and invasiveness.
