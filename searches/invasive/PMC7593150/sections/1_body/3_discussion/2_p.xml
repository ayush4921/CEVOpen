<p>We found negligible evidence that native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cultivated microbial communities that drive the differences in invasiveness that exist between them. Communities cultivated by each plant lineage were not different for any microbial group we examined at the Michigan sites, and we could find no meaningful differences in functional potential across all Michigan sites. The strongest evidence for differential cultivation comes from the Ohio sites in which native and non‐native monocultures, but not mixtures, significantly differed in their rhizosphere bacterial communities. The monoculture zones of the Ohio sites in which much of the difference occurred were more dominant, denser, and likely older than the sampling locations in Michigan. We argue below that the observation of differences only in the more dominant, denser patches suggests that rhizosphere microbial community differences are likely a consequence of invasion rather than a cause.
