<p>Data from our Michigan sites suggest the patterns in the rhizosphere microbiome largely mirror those of the root microbiome, where we also found no differences between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages across three major microbial groups (Bickford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In exploration of the root microbiome, Bickford et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) speculated that roots may select similar microbial inhabitants across lineages, despite the differences that may occur in the rhizosphere. However, the data presented here suggest, at least in low density patches, the rhizosphere microbial communities are driven by the environment, as they seem to be in the roots. Another recently published study of root endophyte communities focused on well‐established, high‐density native and non‐native 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands and found significant community differences between lineages (Gonzalez Mateu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36811-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, root community differences may also be related to stand density and dominance.
