 <caption> The process from collection of plant waste to mature compost. During the cultivation of the crops, azoles are used for crop protection. From July on, after harvesting the bulbs, inappropriately sized bulbs and leftover leaves are collected as waste, which is added to a stockpile serving as storage heap. By April of the next year, the heap is around 6 to 10 m high and around 50 by 50 m wide. Then, formal aerobic composting starts with mixing the accumulated plant-decaying materials with straw to insert oxygen and regularly turning the mixture for six or seven rounds until June, after which composting is completed. </caption>
