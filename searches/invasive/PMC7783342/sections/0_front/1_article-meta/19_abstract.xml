  <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> is consistently present independently on season at a high abundance in plant waste material throughout the sampling period. Our study confirmed that long-term storage sites of azole-containing decaying plant material can indeed be considered hot spots, which can sustain resistance development and maintenance in 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>. Roughly half of individual isolates were azole resistant and carried genetic mutations that are highly similar to those found in patients with azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis. Our work suggests that environmental sources of azole resistance in 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> may be important, underscoring the need for further studies on environment-to-patient transmission routes.
