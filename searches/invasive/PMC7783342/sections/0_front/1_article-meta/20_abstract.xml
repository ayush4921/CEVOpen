 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>The treatment of patients suffering from 
  <italic>Aspergillus</italic> diseases is hampered due to infections with 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> that are already resistant to medical azoles. Previous work has suggested that 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> likely gains resistance through environmental azole exposure in so-called hot spots. Here, we investigated 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> resistance dynamics over time at three sites at which farmers used azole fungicides for crop protection. Over 16â€‰months, 114 samples were taken from stockpiles of decaying plant waste. 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> and azole fungicide residues were ubiquitously present in the plant waste. On average, 10
  <sup>5</sup>
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> CFU/g was recovered, of which roughly half were itraconazole and tebuconazole resistant. Similar tandem repeat-mediated resistance mechanisms were found in colonies cultured from plant waste as reported in clinical azole-resistant isolates. Our results show a consistent high burden of azole-resistant 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> in azole-containing plant waste and underscores the need to further investigate resistance-reducing interventions and transmission routes.

  <bold>IMPORTANCE</bold>
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> is consistently present independently on season at a high abundance in plant waste material throughout the sampling period. Our study confirmed that long-term storage sites of azole-containing decaying plant material can indeed be considered hot spots, which can sustain resistance development and maintenance in 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>. Roughly half of individual isolates were azole resistant and carried genetic mutations that are highly similar to those found in patients with azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis. Our work suggests that environmental sources of azole resistance in 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> may be important, underscoring the need for further studies on environment-to-patient transmission routes.
