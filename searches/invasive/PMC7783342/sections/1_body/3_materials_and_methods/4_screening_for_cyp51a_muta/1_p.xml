<p>We characterized TEB- and/or ITR-resistant isolates for their 
 <italic>cyp51A</italic> gene, focusing on tandem repeat (TR) variation in the promoter region and point mutations in the coding gene commonly found to confer resistance. From representative samples, up to three single resistant colonies recovered from −80°C were subjected to a DNA extraction protocol (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The full coding sequences of the 
 <italic>cyp51A</italic> gene and the promoter region were screened by PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing as previously described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The 
 <italic>cyp51A</italic> sequence (GenBank accession number
