<p>For each sample of organic material, 5 g was added to 10 ml sterile saline (0.8 g/liter NaCl in water) with 0.05% Tween and diluted. Then, 50 μl of the diluted suspension (10
 <sup>0</sup> to approximately 10
 <sup>3</sup> until there are countable colonies on the plates) was plated on malt extract agar (MEA) supplemented with streptomycin (10 μg/ml) and tetracycline (15 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) to suppress growth of bacteria. Cultures were incubated at 48°C, which is selective for 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> growth (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). After 2 days of incubation, colonies were counted to estimate 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> density. Colonies that showed atypical 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> morphology were selected and verified by amplifying (PCR) and sequencing part of the β-tubulin and carboxypeptidase-5 genes (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Further, we plated the same diluted suspension, which gave countable colonies on MEA plates supplemented with one of the following two indicator azoles: the azole fungicide TEB (tebuconazole) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) or the medical azole ITR (itraconazole) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), both at 4 mg/liter (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Resistance was defined as the ability to grow on either of these agar plates. After 4 days of incubation at 48°C, the number of resistant colonies was documented, and the percentage of resistant strains of the total number of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> strains that had been isolated was calculated. Two resistant phenotypically different 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> colonies from each plate were stored in glycerol at −80°C for further analyses.
