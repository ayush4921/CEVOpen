<p>Sampling was performed between July 2016 and December 2017. We sampled from growing stockpiles of plant waste before processing to mature compost since we previously found evidence that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> CFU in mature compost were reduced to below detectable limits and no azole-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> in mature compost was detected (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Between two and five samples were taken at each of the three sampling sites every month at various places in the growing stockpile heap (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Per sample, approximately 10 g of material was collected and stored at 4Â°C for further analysis.
