<p>Sampling was performed at three flower bulb farms (labeled A, B, and C in the same geographical region) that used azole fungicides for crop protection (against, for instance, 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> and 
 <italic>Botrytis</italic>) and that stored plant waste on site in stockpiles. All three farms use common conventional methods for crop protection, which includes antifungal azole application. From July, plant waste is collected from the fields, and a stockpile is built to which material is added over the course of the year. After several months, the stockpile heap can be 6 to 10 m high and around 50 by 50 m wide. Although some decomposition of organic material takes place during stockpiling, its efficiency is limited by lack of oxygen. Therefore, to increase the decomposition rate, active management of the stockpile through turning is required to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and adequate moisture levels. Commonly, in April of the next year, active composting is initiated by the farmer by inserting straw and regular turning of the pile in six to seven rounds. In June, the multistep composting process is completed (
