<p>Both azole-resistant and azole-susceptible 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> colonies were recovered from all 114 samples. For both indicator azoles TEB and ITR, the fraction of resistant isolates fluctuated throughout the sampling period at around 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Full results are shown in Table S1. There were no significant differences in fraction resistant over time or between sampling sites (chi-square test;
