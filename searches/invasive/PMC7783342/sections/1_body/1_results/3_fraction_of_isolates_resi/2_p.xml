<p>The fraction of TEB-resistant isolates showed 90% overlap with ITR-resistant isolates, indicating that cross-resistance is the norm. However, in 10% of samples, cross-resistance between TEB and ITR was not observed. For example, in sample 89, the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> population was ITR resistant while susceptible to TEB. In contrast, the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> population in sample 21 was TEB resistant but ITR susceptible (
