<p>No notable differences were found in distribution of resistance mutations (TR
 <sub>46</sub> and TR
 <sub>46</sub>
 <sup>3</sup>) according to the azole selection medium used for isolation of the strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). For TR
 <sub>46</sub>/Y121F/T289A, 45% of isolates were cultured from ITR selection plates and 54% from TEB plates. For isolates harboring TR

 <sup>3</sup>-derived mutations, 50% were cultured from ITR plates and 50% from TEB selection plates. While for TR
 <sub>34</sub>/L98H, 32% of isolates were recovered from ITR-plates and 68% from TEB plates.
