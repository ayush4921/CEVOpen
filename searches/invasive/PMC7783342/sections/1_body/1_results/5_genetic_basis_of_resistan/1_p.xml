<p>We selected 117 TEB- and/or ITR-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> isolates that were representative for the different time points and sampling sites for genetic analysis. The isolates were taken from samples with abundant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> growth (&gt;10
 <sup>2</sup> CFU/g). 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the summarized results, and full details can be found in Table S3 in the supplemental material. Mutations in the promoter region and coding region of the 
 <italic>cyp51A</italic> gene were found in all 117 azole-resistant isolates. Seven different genetic types were detected among the resistant strains, including the commonly found resistance genotypes TR
 <sub>34</sub>/L98H and TR
 <sub>46</sub>/Y121F/T289A. For strains containing TR
 <sub>46</sub>, point mutations in the coding part of the gene (I364V and S363P) were observed, of which the significance for the azole-resistant phenotype has not been documented.
