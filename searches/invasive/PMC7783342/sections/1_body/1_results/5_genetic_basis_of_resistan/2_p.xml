<p>For the 117 resistant isolates, the TR
 <sub>46</sub>-derived mutations accounted for 79% followed by TR
 <sub>34</sub>-derived mutations (16%). TR
 <sub>46</sub>
 <sup>3</sup>- and TR
 <sub>46</sub>
 <sup>4</sup>-derived mutations were present the least common (âˆ¼5%) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At sampling site B, a larger variety of resistance mechanisms in the samples were found (TR
 <sub>34</sub>, TR
 <sub>46</sub>, TR
 <sub>46</sub>
 <sup>3</sup>, and TR
 <sub>46</sub>
 <sup>4</sup>) compared with the other two sites, where only TR
 <sub>34</sub> and TR
 <sub>46</sub> mutations were recovered (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). TR
 <sub>46</sub>-derived mutations (TR
 <sub>46</sub>/Y121F/T289A) were dominant over the whole sampling period. There were no trends observed in the diversity of resistance mechanisms over time (
