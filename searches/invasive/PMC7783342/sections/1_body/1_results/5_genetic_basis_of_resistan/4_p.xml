<p>We selected a representative sample of 32 isolates, including all resistance mechanisms, by choosing up to 3 isolates per farm per resistance genotype for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility testing using the EUCAST broth microdilution reference assay. The azole phenotypes are consistent with previously reported characteristics, i.e., highly ITR resistant in TR
 <sub>34</sub> variants and highly voriconazole resistant in TR
 <sub>46</sub> variants (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, variations in activity of other azoles was observed in isolates harboring the same resistance mutation.
