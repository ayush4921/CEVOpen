<p>For 37 representative samples selected from the entire sampling period across the three sampling sites, we determined the chemical profile including concentrations and types of azole fungicides. Fungicides were detected in all samples, ranging between 3 and 14 different types of fungicide (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). In our analysis, we focused on the triazoles, which show activity against 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In all samples, prothioconazole-desthio, TEB, and thiabendazole were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 3.7 mg/kg. The azole fungicide concentrations fluctuated over the sampling period (
