<p>Due to the fact that data does not follow a normal distribution, we performed a series nonparametric Spearman correlation tests, testing for correlations among the different environmental parameters. We found mostly weak and nonsignificant pairwise correlations between azole levels, total CFU, resistance frequency (to TEB and ITR), sample collection date, and farm site. Exception was the strong correlation between TEB resistance frequency (TEBf) and ITR resistance frequency (ITRf) (correlation coefficient = 0.904; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.023) (see Table S4 in the supplemental material).
