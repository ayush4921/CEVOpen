<p>The total abundance of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> in CFU per gram varied between the detection limit (10
 <sup>1</sup>) and 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/g in the 114 samples, with an average of around 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/g (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The density of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> fluctuated throughout the sampling period and between sampling sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A total of 74% of the samples that were obtained contained high numbers (above 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/g) of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> CFU; 24% of the samples contained less than 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/g. In 2% of the samples, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> recovery was below the detection limit (which was 10
 <sup>1</sup> CFU/g).
