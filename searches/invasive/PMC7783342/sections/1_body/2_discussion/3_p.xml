<p>Among the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> isolates recovered from the stockpiles, roughly half were resistant to our two indicator azole fungicides TEB and ITR. The fraction of resistance to the two azoles used for testing was highly similar, suggesting that agricultural azoles can induce or at least support cross-resistance to medical triazoles, confirming laboratory studies (

 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> may indicate variations in azole selection pressure in microenvironments within the stockpiles. Indeed, measurements of concentrations of fungicides present in the waste material indicated notable variation both regarding fungicide compound and concentration. Factors such as addition of fresh bulb waste material or wash out of azoles during rainfall will greatly impact these microenvironmental conditions. The absence of significant correlations between environmental parameters, such as azole concentration, total CFU, and resistance mechanism, could be explained by the heterogeneity of the compost.
