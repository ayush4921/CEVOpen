<p>In summary, our findings support the notion that heaps of decaying plant material that contain azoles are important hot spots for the development and maintenance of azole-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> in the environment. Future work should investigate what variations in plant waste materials and its storage affect 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> abundance and resistance. A laboratory study mimicking the field conditions can help elucidate mechanisms that support (resistant) 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> under these conditions. Further, especially various ways of processing plant waste from stockpiles to mature compost (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) should be systematically studied since these processing techniques may greatly reduce the abundance of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>. Finally, while the similarity of genetic mechanisms of resistance exist between the environmental isolates from our study and those isolated from patients, the significance of this finding for human infection remains unclear, as transmission routes are largely unexplored. Future work should also focus on transmission routes, as these insights are critical to design effective interventions.
