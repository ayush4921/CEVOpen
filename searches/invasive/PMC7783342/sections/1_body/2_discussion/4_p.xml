<p>The discovery of large genetic variation regarding the resistance mechanism in our samples suggests that azole-containing plant waste can support a wide range of various resistant strains. Notable variation was also observed for the azole phenotypes. Even isolates harboring identical resistance mutations showed variable resistance phenotypes, which might indicate that isolates with tandem repeat (TR)-mediated resistance may harbor additional resistance mechanisms. Thus, plant waste material is highly heterogeneous and supports a widely diverse population of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>; this heterogeneity and/or other factors allow the different genotypes to coexist in the same heap and new genotypes to appear. How these new genotypes are generated and what the genetic relationship between these different genotypes is needs further research.
