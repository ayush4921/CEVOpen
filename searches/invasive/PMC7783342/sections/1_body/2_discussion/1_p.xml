<p>This study describes the results of longitudinal sampling of stockpiles of azole-containing plant waste, which was previously identified as a hot spot for resistance selection (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In our analysis, we focused on the abundance of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>, the fraction of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> resistant to azole fungicides, the presence of azole fungicides and azole residues, and the genetic basis of resistance. Our results show that the sites we sampled can indeed be considered hot spots. The long-term storage of azole-containing decaying plant material can sustain resistance development and maintenance, supporting previous findings (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
