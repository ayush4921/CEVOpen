<p>Specifically, our results show that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> was consistently present throughout the sampling period at the three sampling sites at levels around 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/g. CFU levels appear to be little affected by the local climate or weather conditions. The average temperature of the Netherlands is about 2°C (35°F) in January and 19°C (66°F) in July, with an annual average temperature of approximately 10°C (50°F). Moreover, similar 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> densities were present at the different sampling sites. In estimation, a single stockpile with dimensions 50 by 50 by 10 m may contain as many as 2.5 × 10
 <sup>15</sup> spores, which underscores the substantial burden that the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> spores may cause. The 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> concentrations that we observed were higher than those reported in a study involving environmental substrates collected in Italy, Spain, Hungary, and Germany (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In these samples, the highest 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> concentrations were found in corn silage samples after 14 days of air exposure, ranging between 7.4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 23.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/g (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In other compost types involving different starting material and undergoing varying processing histories, lower densities were found ranging from 1.0 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> up to 1.1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/g (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In conventional agricultural fields in Germany with fungicide exposure, only 10
 <sup>0</sup> to 10
 <sup>2</sup> CFU/g 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> was found. In our azole-containing compost, we observed in total an average of 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/g resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> throughout the 16-month sampling period in azole-containing decaying plant material. This is in contrast to studies where samples were taken at a location without azole pressure, where 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/g of resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> was found (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In German organic fields without fungicides exposure, 0 to 1 CFU/g displayed resistance to medical azoles (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Thus, in our study, we provide data backing up previous suggestions that azole-containing decaying plant material is a reservoir and selective environment for resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>.
