<p>In previous research, we have gathered evidence that resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> can accumulate and thrive in plant waste that contains environmental azoles (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The concept of a hot spot for azole-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> was postulated and is characterized by an environment that supports the growth and reproduction of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> and where azole fungicides with anti-
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> activity are present (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In an initial survey, the following three hot spots were identified in the Netherlands: decaying plant waste of flower bulbs from farms where azoles are used, industrial wood-chopping waste, and industrial green-waste storage (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The concept of a hot spot may be widely applicable and not limited to these three hot spots, and indeed, recently strawberry production waste was implicated as a hot spot for azole resistance selection in China (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). While taking into account the full cycle of fungicide application, plant waste collection, and composting, the stockpiling of plant waste that contained azole fungicides was found to be the phase associated with the highest burden of azole-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, studies to date have used single time point sampling to investigate 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> resistance rather than studying its dynamics using repeated sampling over time. As stockpiles are kept for many months on farms, variations in weather conditions, i.e., temperature and humidity, might affect the burden of azole-resistant 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> within the stockpiles over the period that they are kept. Furthermore, the impact of other variables, such as the (chemical) persistence of azoles (their presence and activity), are poorly understood.
