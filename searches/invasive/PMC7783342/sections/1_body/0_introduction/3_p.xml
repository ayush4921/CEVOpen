<p>The present study aims to document and understand the dynamics of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> populations within a hot spot in combination with the types and levels of fungicides that are present. Such insight is essential for designing effective measures. We performed a longitudinal study through repeated sampling of stockpiles of decaying plant waste from three farms where azoles were used for crop protection. Over a period of 16â€‰months, a total of 114 samples were taken and analyzed. Specifically, we focused on trends over time regarding (i) the abundance of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>, (ii) the fraction of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> resistant to one representative environmental azole (tebuconazole [TEB]) and one representative medical azole (itraconazole [ITR]), (iii) the presence of azole fungicides and azole residues, and (iv) the genetic basis of resistance. As three independent sites were sampled over time, we further investigated variations between sampling sites.
