    "The treatment of patients suffering from <i>Aspergillus</i> diseases is hampered due to infections with <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> that are already resistant to medical azoles. Previous work has suggested that <i>A. fumigatus</i> likely gains resistance through environmental azole exposure in so-called hot spots. Here, we investigated <i>A. fumigatus</i> resistance dynamics over time at three sites at which farmers used azole fungicides for crop protection. Over 16â€‰months, 114 samples were taken from stockpiles of decaying plant waste. <i>A. fumigatus</i> and azole fungicide residues were ubiquitously present in the plant waste. On average, 10<sup>5</sup> <i>A. fumigatus</i> CFU/g was recovered, of which roughly half were itraconazole and tebuconazole resistant. Similar tandem repeat-mediated resistance mechanisms were found in colonies cultured from plant waste as reported in clinical azole-resistant isolates. Our results show a consistent high burden of azole-resistant <i>A. fumigatus</i> in azole-containing plant waste and underscores the need to further investigate resistance-reducing interventions and transmission routes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is consistently present independently on season at a high abundance in plant waste material throughout the sampling period. Our study confirmed that long-term storage sites of azole-containing decaying plant material can indeed be considered hot spots, which can sustain resistance development and maintenance in <i>A. fumigatus</i> Roughly half of individual isolates were azole resistant and carried genetic mutations that are highly similar to those found in patients with azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis. Our work suggests that environmental sources of azole resistance in <i>A. fumigatus</i> may be important, underscoring the need for further studies on environment-to-patient transmission routes."
