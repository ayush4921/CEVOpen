<p>All plant chemicals were significantly different among the seven tested host plants (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The highest and lowest plant C content was observed on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> (39.8%) and 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> (31.9%), respectively (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The highest N content was observed on 
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic> (4.1%), and the lowest content was observed on 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (2.8%) (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The highest C:N ratio was observed on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>, 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. alkekengi</italic> (12.9, 12.6, and 12.8, respectively), followed by 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> (10.9) and 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic> (10.3), and the lowest was observed on 
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic> (8.3) and 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> (8.7; 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The soluble protein of 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> was highest, while it was lowest on 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the soluble sugar of 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> was highest, while it was lowest on 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The cellulose level was highest on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> and lowest on 
 <italic>P. peruviana</italic> and 
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The highest lignin and total phenolics was observed on 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic>, and the lowest lignin was observed on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> and lowest total phenolics was observed on 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic> (
