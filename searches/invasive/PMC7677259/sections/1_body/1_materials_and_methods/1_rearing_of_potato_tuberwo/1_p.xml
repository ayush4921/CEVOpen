<p>We obtained larvae of potato tuberworms from potato fields in Xuanwei City (Yunnan Province, China). They were brought back to the laboratory and reared on potato tubers in wooden cages (40 × 40 × 40 cm) held at 27 ± 2°C, 70–80% RH and a 12:12 h L:D photoperiod. They pupated in sand in the cages. After adults emerged, we collected 50 pairs of adults and placed them for mating and oviposition in plastic containers (height: 25 cm and diameter: 20 cm) with 10% honey water and provided with filter paper as the oviposition substrate (
