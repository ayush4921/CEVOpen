<p>Seeds of eggplant (
 <italic>S. melongena</italic>) and tomato (
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Seeds of tobacco (
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic>) were obtained from Henan Agricultural University. Seeds of 
 <italic>P. alkekengi</italic>, datura (
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic>) and wolfberry (
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic>) were obtained from Shouguang Seed Center in Shandong, China. Potato seed-tubers were obtained from the Zhangzhou Vegetable Research Institute. All seed plants were planted in growing medium (half field soil and half sphagnum peat moss) for germination and initial growth in an open-sided greenhouse with natural temperature and light. After 2 weeks of growth, similarly sized seedlings were selected from each species to transplant individually into pots (height: 18 cm and diameter: 24 cm) filled with a mixture of half field soil and half sphagnum peat moss. For potato plants, tubers were cut into about 25 g pieces, each with an eye bud, and then planted 8 cm deep into pots of the same size and soil as above. All plants were covered with fabric (nylon netting) in a greenhouse (10 × 5 × 2 m) at Henan University, Kaifeng, China (34°49'N, 114°18'E). Plants were not fertilized but watered as necessary. Plants that had been growing for 40 days were used throughout the experiment.
