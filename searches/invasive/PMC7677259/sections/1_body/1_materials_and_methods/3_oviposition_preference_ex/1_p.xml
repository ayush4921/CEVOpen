<p>To test the ovipositional preference of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> adults, the seven selected solanaceous plants were individually evaluated in no-choice tests. Experiments were performed in nylon cages (20 cm diameter and 80 cm height) containing one single plant. We exposed two pairs of adult moths to each host plant, allowing them to mate and lay eggs freely, and provided them with 10% honey solution. Four days later, we counted the number of eggs laid in plant leaves and nylon cage using a magnifier. For the number of eggs in the soil around the plant, we first collected 1-cm-deep potted soil and put them in Petri dishes (diameter: 15 cm). We then determined the number of eggs under a light microscope using the methodology suggested by
