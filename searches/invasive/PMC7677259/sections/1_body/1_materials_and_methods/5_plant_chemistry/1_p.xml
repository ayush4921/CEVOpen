<p>Ten randomly selected samples from each plant species were collected and analyzed for the levels of primary and secondary metabolites. Leaves of each healthy plant were cut off and carefully cleaned with water. Then all leaves were dried at 45Â°C for 5 days and ground to powder. The samples were then analyzed for total carbon content (C) and total nitrogen content (N) using an elemental auto-analyzer (Vario MAX CN; Elementar, Hanau, Germany). According to 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Elleuch et al. (2007)</xref>, the soluble sugar content was determined by spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific GENESYS 10S, Waltham, MA, USA) at 630 nm wavelength. Plant soluble protein levels were determined following 
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bradford (1976)</xref>. Plant cellulose and lignin levels were analyzed by spectrophotometry at 620 and 280 nm wavelengths, following
