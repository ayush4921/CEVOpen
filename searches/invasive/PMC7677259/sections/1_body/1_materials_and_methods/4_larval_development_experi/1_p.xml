<p>To measure the developmental performance of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> larvae on plants, we placed five newly hatched larvae on the upper surface of five leaves of each solanaceous plant using a soft brush, until larvae were situated on the leaves. Each leaf was covered with a small nylon bag (15 cm long and 10 cm wide) to prevent the larvae from moving or falling. In this experiment, each plant was used as one replicate, with 10 replicates per plant species. One week after infestation of plants, to prevent the larvae from pupating in the soil, each potted plant was covered with a plastic bag that was sealed at the plant stem. Then each pot was placed inside a larger plastic pot (50 cm diameter and 18 cm height) with 2 cm of sterile sand, which was intended as the larval pupation site. Ten days after initial infestation, we removed bags and examined pupae from the sterile sand daily. All pupae recovered were weighed and placed individually in Petri dishes (5 cm diameter and 1 cm height), lined with tissue paper, and held for adult emergence, which were then sexed. Accordingly, we determined the developmental time of each insect in its larval and pupal stages.
