<p>Potato tuberworm, 
 <italic>Phthorimaea operculella</italic> (Zeller; Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is an important invasive insect originating in South America. It attacks many solanaceous crops and wild plants such as potato (
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>), tobacco (
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic>), tomato (
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>), eggplant (
 <italic>S. melongena</italic>), datura (
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic>), wolfberry (
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic>), and the genera 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> in temperate and subtropical regions (

 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>, 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic>, 
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> are native hosts for this insect, while the others are new hosts of the insect in the invaded areas, i.e., 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic>, 
 <italic>P. alkekengi</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> are native to Asia. Adults of potato tuberworm lay eggs in foliage, exposed tubers, or soil surrounding host plants. Larvae mine leaves, petioles, stems, and exposed tubers in the field. With the increase in global warming, the potato tuberworm has invaded more than 90 countries because of its temperature dependence and a high adaptability to diverse conditions (
