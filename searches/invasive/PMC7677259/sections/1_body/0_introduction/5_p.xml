<p>In this study, we ask the following questions: (1) what are the differences in performance and preference of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> among native and novel host plants? and (2) does host chemistry lead to a difference in the larval performance of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic>? To answer these questions, we examined the oviposition preference of adult tuber moth and the larval developmental characteristics on seven solanaceous plants. We then evaluated the relationship between the phytochemistry and insect performance by determining primary and secondary metabolisms in our test plant species.
