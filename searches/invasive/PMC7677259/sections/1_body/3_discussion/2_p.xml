<p>We found that host plant species significantly affected potato tuberworm oviposition, with the most eggs laid on potatoes and the least on wolfberry. These differences may be due to plant odor or physical and chemical characteristics. Previous studies have suggested that female potato tuber moths prefer to lay their eggs on a rough substrate rather than smooth substrate (

 <italic>Tecia solanivora</italic> (Povoln√Ω), tend to lay eggs near mature flowering plants, which may be due to levels of sesquiterpenes compounds, which influence host-finding and oviposition behavior (

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Fenemore (1979)</xref> found that odor of the potato tuber can cause female 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> to produce more eggs. These plant volatiles may be important signaling factors of host plant quality, likely determining the ovipositional capacity of females in various host plants. In addition, compounds found in plant extracts can also influence oviposition host selection, with female 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> tending to lay significantly more eggs on substrates with potato plant extract than on other host plant extracts (
