<p>Phenolic compounds exist in many plants and can act as defensive metabolites involved in plant resistance against insect herbivory (

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hinman et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we found a significant and negative correlation between total phenolics and larval survival, suggesting relatively high level of total phenolics may lead to low larval survival in the alternate hosts (
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic>, 
 <italic>D. stramonium</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>). However, we only used total phenolics as a plant defense index, various alkaloids from solanaceous plants may also affect the performance of insects. For example, several studies have reported that α-tomatine of 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> and glycoalkaloids (α-solanine and α-chaconine) of 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> can significantly affect the growth and development performance of insects (
