<p>Plant anti-herbivore secondary metabolites (i.e., phenolics) and plant structural components (i.e., cellulose and lignin) are important in affecting insect development. For example, lignin, as an important predictor of leaf toughness, can decrease arthropod damage, even at relatively low amounts (

 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> plants with low lignin, but worse in 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> with high lignin. Indeed, our regression results also showed that lignin content significantly and negatively affected larval survival. Thus, our findings of higher lignin content in 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> may explain the lower larval survival and pupal weights on that plant compared with 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>. However, we notice that the R-squared values of the linear regression between lignin and many other chemicals and larval survival were small (
