<p>We clearly showed profound differences in adult oviposition and larval developmental performance of the invasive potato tuberworm among the tested solanaceous plants. Such differences depend on host plant quality, demonstrating that plant nutrition (i.e., C content and soluble protein) positively affects larval development and survival. Compared with potato and tobacco plants, new hosts in the introduced range can produce more hard-to-digest compounds (i.e., lignin and total phenolics), which reduce leaf palatability to potato tuberworm. These findings may also improve our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of the host use of other invasive pest insects.</p>
