 <caption> Phytophthora ramorum positive streams and models of potential range of the pathogen in the USA. Stream positive detections in the eastern USA and Washington state are those known at July 2010 [60]. As modelled using CLIMEX and the composite model parameters of our model under 1961â€“1990 climate normals (a); and as generated using a Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP) based on known Californian occurrences and three ecological datasets by Kluza et al. [24] (b). </caption>
