 <caption> Annual Growth Index (GI; climatic suitability without stress) for Phytophthora ramorum as modelled using CLIMEX with the CliMond dataset of historical climate normals centred on 1975. Climatic conditions are classified as being unfavourable for growth when GI = 0, marginally favourable when GI = 1–5, moderately favourable when GI = 6–25 and highly favourable when GI &gt;25. The GI does not factor in climatic stress and therefore does not represent the potential distribution of P. ramorum, only growth during non-stressful periods of the year. (TIF) </caption>
