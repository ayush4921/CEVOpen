 <caption> Wet Stress (WS) for Phytophthora ramorum as modelled using CLIMEX with the CliMond dataset of historical climate normals centred on 1975. Where WS = 0, soil moisture does not limit the distribution of P. ramorum and where WS &gt;0 wet stress is represented by a factor of 1000, with increasing limitation as WS increases.
