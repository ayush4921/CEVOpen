 <caption> Heat Stress (HS) for Phytophthora ramorum as modelled using CLIMEX with the CliMond dataset of historical climate normals centred on 1975. Where HS = 0, heat does not limit the distribution of P. ramorum and where HS &gt;0 heat stress is represented by a factor of 1000, with increasing limitation as HS increases. (TIF) </caption>
