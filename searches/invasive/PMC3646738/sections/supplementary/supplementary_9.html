 <caption> Dry Stress (DS) for Phytophthora ramorum as modelled using CLIMEX with the CliMond dataset of historical climate normals centred on 1975. Where DS = 0, soil dryness does not limit the distribution of P. ramorum and where DS &gt;0 dry stress is represented by a factor of 1000, with increasing limitation as DS increases. (TIF) </caption>
