   <bold>Annual Growth Index (GI; climatic suitability without stress) for </bold>
   <bold>
    <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic>
   </bold>
   <bold> as modelled using CLIMEX with the CliMond dataset of historical climate normals centred on 1975.</bold> Climatic conditions are classified as being unfavourable for growth when GI = 0, marginally favourable when GI = 1–5, moderately favourable when GI = 6–25 and highly favourable when GI &gt;25. The GI does not factor in climatic stress and therefore does not represent the potential distribution of 
   <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, only growth during non-stressful periods of the year.
