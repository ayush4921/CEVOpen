 <caption> Cold Stress (CS) for Phytophthora ramorum as modelled using CLIMEX with the CliMond dataset of historical climate normals centred on 1975. Where CS = 0, cold does not limit the distribution of P. ramorum and where CS &gt;0 cold stress is represented by a factor of 1000, with increasing limitation as CS increases. (TIF) </caption>
