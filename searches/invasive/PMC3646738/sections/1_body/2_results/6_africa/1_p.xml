<p>Moderate to highly favourable conditions for

Central coastal subtropical areas of Angola, coastal subtropical areas of the East Coast and a small portion of the region of the Cape region of South Africa with a Mediterranean climate were also projected to have marginal to highly favourable climatic conditions for
