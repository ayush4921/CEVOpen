<p>Throughout Asia 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> is projected to be primarily restricted to the humid sub-tropics (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063508-g005">5a</xref>), with some areas classed as having a continental climate with warm summers projected as favourable in China i.e., the central south eastern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, extending west across the Himalayas. Much of northern Asia, including Mongolia, western China and the Russian Federation appear too cold for 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063508.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). The Middle East is too hot and dry (Supplementary

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063508.s004">S4</xref>), and low-lying areas within tropical Asia are projected to be unsuitable for 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> due to heat stress (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063508.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, the majority of southern Japan and all of Taiwan were projected to be climatically moderate to highly favourable for
