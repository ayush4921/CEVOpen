<p>The majority of South America was projected to be unsuitable for

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063508-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), largely due to conditions not being conducive to pathogen growth (Supplementary

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063508.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Moderate to highly favourable conditions occur at high altitudes in the Andes from northern Colombia to northern Argentina, and south of Concepci√≥n in Chile, where conditions are cooler. East of the Andes, the only region projected to be favourable was within a band on the East Coast, from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Bahia Blanca in Argentina.
