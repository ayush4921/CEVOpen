<p>In Europe, it would appear that approximately half of the climatically favourable countries have already been invaded (22/45), predominantly within nurseries, though there is still considerable scope for further international spread and within country range expansion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063508-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). According to our model, all known countries in Europe where the pathogen has been detected have regions of moderate to highly favourable climate suitability for 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> establishment. In Norway, all known places where the pathogen exists in parks and private gardens (59) and the majority (122/137) of locations of infected nursery and garden centres fell into areas with moderate to highly favourable climate (

 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063508-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In Scandinavia, only the most southern coastal regions of Norway and Sweden and a small coastal port area of Finland were considered to be climatically favourable for the establishment and persistence of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> under historical climates. The majority of the Russian Federation and north-eastern regions of Belarus, Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine appear to be climatically unsuitable, due primarily to extreme cold weather conditions and inadequate soil moisture (Supplementary
