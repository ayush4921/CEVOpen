<p>Coastal areas with a Mediterranean climate along the west coast of the USA, extending into coastal areas of British Columbia (Canada), and continental areas of the East Coast, encompassing most of the Appalachians and extending into the Great Lakes region, appear suitable. Stream-associated nursery finds in Georgia and North Carolina fell into areas modelled as having highly favourable climates for pathogen establishment and survival, while those in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi fell into areas modelled as climatically unsuitable for persistence due to excessive heat stress (

This does not preclude the species from epidemics in these areas, but indicates that populations are unlikely to be able to over-summer there. This is apparent in the high GI values throughout the south-eastern USA (Supplementary
