<p>The EI ranges from 0 for locations at which the species is not able to persist to 100 at locations that are optimal for the species year round. To downplay the implied modelling precision of the percentile values of EI provided by CLIMEX, the EI was classified into four arbitrary classes: unsuitable (EI = 0), marginal (EI = 1–5), moderately favourable (EI = 6–25) and highly favourable (EI&gt;25), as described by Kriticos et al.
