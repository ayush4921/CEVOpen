<p>Phenological observations, and relevant laboratory and field-based biological information were used to inform the selection of relevant parameters for growth and stress of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0063508-t001">Table 1</xref>). Data were combined for the three main 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> genotypes, NA1, NA2 and EU1, to produce a composite model of the potential geographic range of the pathogen as insufficient data exists at this point in time to treat each lineage separately. The stress indices were fitted in such a way as to conform to the guidance of Kriticos et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kriticos3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, so that the stresses and growth should not occur at the same time and hence the thresholds for stresses occur outside the limits for growth.
