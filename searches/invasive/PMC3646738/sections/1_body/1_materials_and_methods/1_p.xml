<p>The Compare Locations function in CLIMEX 3.0 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sutherst1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> was used to develop a simulation model to estimate the climate suitability for the establishment of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> populations. The CliMond CM10_1975H_V1 interpolated climate surface 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kriticos1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> was used for all modelling. It is a fine scale (10 arc minute) dataset of long-term monthly climate means centred on 1975 for precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and relative humidity at 9 am and 3 pm. CLIMEX interpolates the monthly means to weekly values prior to calculating growth and stress indices.
