 <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> has been shown to be sensitive to drought, as highlighted by studies showing that free sporangia and chlamydospores were killed by drying at 30% relative humidity at room temperature for 30 minutes 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Davidson2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> and relative humidity below 50% significantly affected growth and germ tube elongation of zoospores 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. However, sporangia have been recorded to survive up to six hours in moisture free conditions 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and studies indicate that the pathogen can survive temperature and moisture stresses much more effectively within infected plant tissue 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Fichtner2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Dry stress parameters were altered to begin accumulating below the lower soil moisture threshold for growth (SM0 = 0.2). The dry stress accumulation rate (HDS = −0.005 week
 <sup>−1</sup>) was selected to reflect the pathogen’s apparent sensitivity to drought.
