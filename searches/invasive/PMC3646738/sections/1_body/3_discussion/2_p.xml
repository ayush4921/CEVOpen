<p>Given that all but one of the confirmed positive locations in California used to validate the model fell into areas that were moderate to highly favourable according to the model presented in this paper, as well as all known locations in Curry County, Oregon, where attempted eradication of the pathogen has been taking place 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kanaskie1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>; our model suggests that surrounding areas identified as being climatically favourable areas are at high risk. Similarly, our model suggests that native vegetation communities in the Appalachian Mountains, for which potentially susceptible species have been identified in laboratory studies 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Tooley3" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, are also at risk. Promisingly, the majority of stream associated nursery finds in the south-eastern USA fell into areas that experience prolonged periods of temperatures that are apparently too hot for
