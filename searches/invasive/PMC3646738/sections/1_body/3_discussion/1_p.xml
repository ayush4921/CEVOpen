<p>The CLIMEX model developed in this paper suggests that 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> is presently occupying a small fraction of its available range in both North America and Europe. With continued global spread 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> could potentially invade and establish in climatically favourable areas of Asia, Australasia, Africa and South America, where it could cause detrimental biodiversity loss and severe economic losses in plant industries and natural ecosystems with suitable hosts. It has been suggested by pathologists and modellers that the absence of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> from climatically favourable areas in North America is likely due to lack of historical opportunity, rather than intrinsic factors preventing its establishment

 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Rizzo3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. This hypothesis is supported by the model presented here, fuelling the debate as to why the pathogen has not established in the eastern USA. Early detection of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> in horticultural shipments to eastern USA, combined with effective quarantine measures on materials in infested areas and increased awareness of the disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kliejunas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, may have resulted in lack of establishment of the pathogen in these areas. Conversely, the pathogen may be in a lag phase of invasion in these areas or may have entered a state of equilibrium with the ecosystem and may not cause disease of epiphytotic proportions 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. It has been suggested that 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> may have been present in California for some years before the disease that it caused was noticed 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, so vigilance should be maintained when surveying in the eastern USA and maintaining and updating quarantine policies. Further research into this lag phase of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> invasion is crucial to understanding the aetiology of the pathogenâ€™s disease cycle and could then be used to inform and formulate better risk models.
