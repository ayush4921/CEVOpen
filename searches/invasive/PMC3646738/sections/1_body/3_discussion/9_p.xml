<p>Presently, CLIMEX is limited in not being able to use moisture parameters based upon relative humidity and leaf wetness, which are likely to be more influential to disease development than soil moisture alone, for aerial plant pathogens such as 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>. Nevertheless, soil moisture is a relatively stable index that is very useful in defining the condition of the host plant and is influential in disease development, especially as it relates to dry stress and the permanent wilting point of the host plant

 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Watt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It is also regarded that soil moisture is a valid proxy for moisture availability when developing CLIMEX models for aerial pathogens 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Watt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Correlations between soil moisture and relative humidity and/or rainfall inform the selection of moisture related parameters when using the Compare Locations function in CLIMEX 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sutherst1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Detail on the interpretation of the relationship between rainfall and evaporation on the one hand and subsequent soil moisture parameter estimation on the other is outlined by Sutherst et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sutherst1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and it is recommended that new CLIMEX users make themselves familiar with the aforementioned relationships when estimating moisture based parameters.
