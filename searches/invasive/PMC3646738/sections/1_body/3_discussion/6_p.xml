<p>Examination of the stress indices used in the models indicated that the distribution of the pathogen is largely restricted by extreme hot and dry conditions in the mid-latitudes, and cold stress in the high northern latitudes (Supplementary

 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>. Our models suggest that warm summer conditions may not be severe enough to reduce the risk of the pathogen establishing and spreading throughout most of the Mediterranean. It should be noted that the experimental data which underpin the selection of the heat stress parameters for

 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Tooley2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> are far from conclusive at this point in time, rarely exploring the conditions to break any potential dormancy of the pathogen. Our methodology and results reflect the best reasonable inference which could be derived at this point in time. Further experiments exploring the survival of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> propagules within smaller temperature increments (such as one degree increments between 30°C and 40°C, coupled with a range of dormancy breaking methods such as post-hydration of leaf discs or propagules

 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> in high risk areas such as the south-eastern USA.
