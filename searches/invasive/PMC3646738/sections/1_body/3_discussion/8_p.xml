<p>While the effects of weather cannot be explored in the CLIMEX Compare Locations function, further work utilising weather data from specific locations within CLIMEX and its sister program DYMEX (which models population dynamics) may be able to shed some light on the nature and influence of extreme weather events on 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> disease incidence and severity. In this case, further questions as to the particular stages of the pathogenâ€™s life cycle and their relationships to climatic variables and behaviour within populations would need to be addressed in much further detail to build such a model. At present, spread and potential establishment modelling utilising host data has been developed for California by Meentemeyer et al.

 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Meentemeyer3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> to address some of the concerns associated with indicating where epidemics are most likely to occur in the near future. Models of this nature are valuable in a different way to our global establishment model, as in these regions the estimation of epidemic outbreaks, rather than simply the potential presence of the pathogen, is more important when making considered management decisions with finite financial resources.
