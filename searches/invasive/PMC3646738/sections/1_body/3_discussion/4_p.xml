<p>The Kluza et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kluza1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> model differed significantly from both the CLIMEX and NAPPFAST 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Magarey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> model projections for the USA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063508-g003">Fig. 3</xref>; data not shown for NAPPFAST model). It is likely that the model of Kluza et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kluza1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> suffers from lack of sufficient input data, particularly given that it is unlikely that 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> has reached its full expansion in the region upon which the model was based, in northern California. Using the Kluza et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kluza1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> model, vegetation surrounding the stream associated nursery finds in the south-eastern USA would be considered at a much greater risk of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> invasion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063508-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).
