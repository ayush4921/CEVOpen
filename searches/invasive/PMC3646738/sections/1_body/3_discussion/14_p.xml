<p>Additional regions highlighted by the models, including temperate regions of China, elevated Andean locations in central South America and central Chile, the highly biodiverse Mediterranean region of the cape of South Africa, coastal Australia and the entirety of New Zealand, should be considered at risk of invasion by 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, or as potential origins of the pathogen, particularly where susceptible hosts naturally occur and/or are planted and traded. It is hoped the projections from this model will provide useful guidance on areas to target for early detection and monitoring of the pathogen, particularly in novel environments.
