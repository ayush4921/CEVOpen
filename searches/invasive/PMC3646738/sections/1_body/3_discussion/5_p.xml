<p>In Europe it would appear that approximately half of the climatically favourable countries (22/45) have recorded positive nursery finds, but few natural ecosystems, parks or private gardens have been invaded, leaving considerable scope for further within-country invasion. In Norway, which contains some of the most frigid conditions in which the pathogen may be able to survive, all natural infections in parks and private gardens and 89% of nurseries and garden centres which have been found to have positively infected stock 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sundheim1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> fell into areas modelled as being climatically suitable. Within-country invasion of areas outside of nurseries has been limited to only 11 European countries 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sansford1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This may be a function of the pathogen not being spread to susceptible hosts in natural environments, lack of detection as a function of lack of surveillance, or may reflect the favourability of the artificial nursery environment, where temperatures may be regulated and plants are regularly watered, providing ideal conditions for the transmission of

Therefore, continued and regular surveys for the pathogen outside the nursery environment may be warranted in these countries. The recent rapid spread of
