<p>Moisture, rainfall and days of consecutive rainfall are considered to play a crucial role in the development and spread of disease caused by 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, especially in years of high tree mortality, which historically follow very wet springs

 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Davidson3" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. This hypothesis has been supported by an experimental irrigation nursery study, which showed that the highest concentrations of infective propagules occurred when stream sampling was preceded by about two months with low minimum daily temperatures and by four days of high rainfall, indicating that cold wet conditions are highly conducive to disease development 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Tjosvold1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, persistence and production of chlamydospores in forest and nursery soils and leaf litter over the summer contribute to the disease cycle by providing an inoculum reserve at the onset of the Autumn disease cycle

 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Fichtner2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Tjosvold2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, allowing the pathogen to survive otherwise non-conducive conditions for growth and survival. In the case of Greece, our model suggests that the pathogen would be able to survive the hot summer in this manner, contributing to the disease cycle at the onset of the rains in the winter, when conditions are ideal for 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> transmission. However, should these moist conditions not occur following these initial dry conditions where the pathogen can survive, the risk of disease outbreaks and pathogen establishment may be negligible.
