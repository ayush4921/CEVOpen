<p>Many opportunities exist in the future to further understand the underlying biology of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> and how this biology is associated with climatic and weather events. Study into changes of the potential range of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> under the effects of climate change would be valuable, especially as to how frequency of severe weather events such as particularly wet spring rains will influence disease spread, incidence and severity in areas where the pathogen is well established, such as California. As the pathogen becomes more widely established it may also be possible to apply methods of attaching severity ratings to the Ecoclimatic Index, as has been demonstrated as an effective modelling tool to plan future management in forestry by Pinkard et al.

 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> forests under the threat of Mycosphaerella leaf disease. This method also has applicability for understanding underlying mechanisms of pathogen behaviour and infective potential seasonally and across years
