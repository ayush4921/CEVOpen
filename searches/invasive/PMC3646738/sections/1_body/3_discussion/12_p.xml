<p>Although our model clearly highlights areas at risk of invasion by 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, it should be noted that optimal climatic conditions for establishment do not necessarily translate into frequent or severe outbreaks. Not only must the pathogen be transported to suitable locations, and an infectious (sporulating) host be present in sufficient numbers to support infection in the long term at that location, but it must also be under the influence of local scale factors that may support severe outbreaks of the disease. Microclimatic factors play a big role in the presence of the disease in Northern California 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Meentemeyer3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and this may explain why one of the known presences used to validate the model in Northern California fell into an unsuitable area. Favourable microclimates for pathogen establishment and survival are unlikely to be apparent on the CliMond 10â€² grid 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kriticos4" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Notably, this positive detection of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> located in an area projected to be unsuitable by the model is located within 10 km of suitable climatic envelopes and associated with the highly favourable host, 
 <italic>U. californica</italic>, lending weight to the idea that a suitable microclimate exists in this area. Nevertheless, climatic suitability is a necessary condition for any outbreak of the disease and the model projections provide a useful indication of potential outbreak severity. Given this, the risk maps provided in this paper could be used to provide guidance on areas to target for the early detection and monitoring of the pathogen globally.
