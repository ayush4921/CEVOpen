<p>While the geographical centre of origin for 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> remains unknown, both molecular and biological evidence suggest that it is exotic to both North America and Europe. 
 <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> populations in Europe and North America are dominated by different mating types 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Werres1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and significant genotypic and phenotypic differences exist between these populations 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Brasier2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Ivors1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Grnwald1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. At present, four distinct clonal lineages (NA1, NA2, EU1 and EU2) have been identified from North America and Europe 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Ivors1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Brasier3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. NA1, NA2 and EU1 are all found in North American nurseries, while NA1 is the only genotype present in Californian and Oregon forests 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Ivors1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In Europe, EU1 is the dominant genotype in nurseries and forests, while EU2 is a newly discovered genotype only known at present from infected 
 <italic>L. kaempferi</italic> in Northern Ireland and Southern Scotland 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Brasier3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although the disease emerged around the same time in nurseries in Europe and woodlands in California (the early to mid-1990s), molecular evidence suggests these lineages diverged at least 150 000 years ago and are most probably independent introductions from its native range 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Goss1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The current geographical range of the pathogen in North American native vegetation ecosystems extends over 850 km from south of Big Sur in California to Curry County in Southwest Oregon 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-University1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The pathogen has also been recorded in streams as far north as King County in Washington state in the Pacific Northwest of the USA and associated with streams with inlet water from nurseries in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and North Carolina 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-COMTF1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In Europe, natural outbreaks have largely been limited to southern England and south Wales in the UK 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Brasier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Forestry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, with smaller outbreaks in public greens and woodlands of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sansford1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Infected nursery stock has been detected in 22 European countries, Canada and in numerous states in the USA where it predominates in the west coast states of Washington, Oregon and California
