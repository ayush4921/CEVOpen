<p>While the various geographical models of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> were developed with the best available information at the time, many have failed to produce robust pest risk maps due to either a lack of suitable information to parameterise the model or the incorrect application or interpretation of a particular modelling method for simulating an emerging infectious disease. Distribution data used to inform models such as Guo et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and Kluza et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kluza1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> remain incomplete, as it is clear that the pathogen has not filled its ecological niche in its invaded range. In basing their projections on the known Californian distribution data at the time, these are best described as tactical models, estimating the invaded environment at that point in time, rather than the potential distribution of the pathogen. As a result, both of these models face challenges to the extrapolation of their outputs beyond that point in time and beyond the locations they are based upon.
