 <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> is an invasive plant pathogen causing considerable and widespread damage in nurseries, gardens, natural woodland and plantation forest ecosystems of the USA and Europe 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Brasier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is internationally recognized as a plant biosecurity threat in many regions. Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan have established specific quarantine policies and protocols to prevent the spread of contaminated plant materials from areas known to have the disease 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Kliejunas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Outbreaks of the pathogen into areas of the west coast of the USA containing remnant native vegetation, particularly in central coastal California, have decimated populations of the keystone species tanoak (
 <italic>Notholithocarpus densiflorus</italic>) and coast live oak (
 <italic>Quercus agrifolia</italic>) 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Rizzo2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Meentemeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Similarly in England, 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> has caused mortality of important ecological and commercial species such as 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> in heathlands 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Webber1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Japanese larch (
 <italic>Larix kaempferi</italic>) in plantations 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Brasier1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. While eradication efforts have been undertaken in natural areas of Oregon, USA 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and parts of Europe 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sansford1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> continues to invade new forest sites in these regions and in coastal California where eradication efforts have not been attempted.
