<p>The objective of this study was to estimate the global climate suitability patterns for the establishment of 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> by developing a climatic niche model using the Compare Locations model in CLIMEX 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sutherst1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Sutherst2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Parameters were defined using revised growth and stress parameters for 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>, based on the best available experimentally-derived ecophysiological responses and site-level phenological factors of transmission and disease persistence associated with climate data from the field. Independent distribution data from the USA (California and Oregon) and Norway were used to validate the model. The results of the model are discussed and related to quarantine and management implications for international plant biosecurity.
