 <xref rid="pone.0063508-Magarey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> are software packages designed to deal with the piecemeal nature of information regarding invasive species. Both are capable of incorporating knowledge of an organism’s response to environmental variables, particularly climatic data, gleaned from direct observations or inferred from phenological observations. Both models can use information regarding the species’ potential to grow as a function of climatic factors to estimate the potential for the species to grow at any site for which suitable climatic data are available. Where NAPPFAST has a more detailed treatment of the potential for infection, CLIMEX is also able to use distribution data or experimental data to assess the potential for the species to survive inclement seasonal conditions. CLIMEX has been used previously to model potential distribution and relative disease risk of important plant pathogens on both continental
