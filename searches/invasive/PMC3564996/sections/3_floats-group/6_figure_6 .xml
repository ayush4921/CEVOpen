  <p>STRUCTURE populations inferred from SNP variation. Vertical bars show the population assignment (color) for each individual by region. (A) Two major genetic groups (blue and orange) are supported for the native range, based upon genotypes from Hungary (HU), Romania (RO), Turkey (TK) and the Republic of Georgia (GA). (B) Admixture of these sources is suggested for both putatively naturalized genotypes in Spain (SP) and invading genotypes from California (CA) and Argentina (AR), when the two native genetic groups are fixed as potential source populations. SNP frequencies were based upon 2568 positions observed in at least five individuals per continent.</p>
