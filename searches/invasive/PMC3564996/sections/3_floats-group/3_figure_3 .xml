  <p>Coverage of SNP positions identified across the dataset. (A) Proportion of SNPs that were sequenced in each individual, and (B) frequency of observed heterozygous loci among sequenced SNPs within native (triangles), naturalized (dashes), and invading (circles) individuals, relative to total sequencing effort after read cleaning. Linear fits are shown to native (gray line) and invading (black line) individuals.</p>
