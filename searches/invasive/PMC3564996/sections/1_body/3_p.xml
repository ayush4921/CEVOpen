<p>For transcriptome sequencing, we generated normalized cDNA libraries from actively growing tissues in an effort to sequence as many of the coding regions of the genome as possible. In contrast to direct sequencing of cDNA for quantification of gene expression (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, ‘RNASeq’), normalization reduces the representation of common transcripts for better sequence coverage of both common and rare transcripts (
