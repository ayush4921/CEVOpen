<p>We address two key issues using our dataset: (1) the accurate identification of allelic variation in these outbred individuals, and (2) the extent of sequence overlap among transcriptome libraries. YST propagates exclusively by seed and is self-incompatible (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Ritland 1998</xref>), and so we expect allelic variation and observed heterozygosity to be relatively high in our populations (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Sun 1997</xref>). Accurate identification of allelic variants of the same locus is not straightforward, however, because allele sequences vary widely in their divergence (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bergelson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2001
 </xref>), overlapping the divergence of closely related but separate loci (paralogs) (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Lynch and Conery 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sebat 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2004

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Hahn 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>). This means that it is impossible to discriminate among alleles and paralogs by sequence divergence alone. We present a conservative strategy to filter for unique loci by using the putative allelic variation across all individuals under study to identify the minimum number of haplotypes within individuals. This strategy relies on phasing of multi-locus SNPs within individual genes, and so we use a long-read 454 pyrosequencing approach to increase our ability to discriminate accurately among haplotypes. We find that approximately one-half of our putative loci are suitable for population genetic analyses, that allele recovery is far more dependent on sequencing depth than is gene recovery, but that modest transcriptome sampling nevertheless generates thousands of informative markers observed across many individuals. In our study system, these markers indicate a history of admixture and the presence of high genetic variation in introduced populations of YST.
