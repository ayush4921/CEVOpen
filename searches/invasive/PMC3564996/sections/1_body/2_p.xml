<p>Here, we explore the potential for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> whole transcriptome sequences from many individuals to generate useful genetic polymorphism data across their genomes. We focus on a species of economic and ecological concern, yellow starthistle (
 <italic>Centaurea solstitialis</italic> L., Asteraceae). Yellow starthistle (hereafter YST) is an annual herb, native to Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, and hypothesized to be naturalized in Mediterranean Western Europe (
