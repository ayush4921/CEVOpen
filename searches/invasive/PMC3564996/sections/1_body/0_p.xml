<p>Almost five decades of molecular genetic research has revealed that an abundance of genetic variation resides in the natural populations of most living organisms (

 </xref>). This variation is necessarily shaped by the history of mating, demography, dispersal, and adaptation playing out within species and as a result allele frequency distributions in wild populations can provide unique insights into evolution and ecology (

Most recently, genome-wide studies of allelic variation in natural populations are proving to be particularly powerful for detecting subtle and/or complex aspects of population structure, selection on specific regions of the genome, and associations between allelic and phenotypic variation (
