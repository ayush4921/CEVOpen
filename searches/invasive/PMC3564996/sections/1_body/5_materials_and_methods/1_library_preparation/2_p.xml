<p>To generate the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for the transcriptome analysis, we used a protocol from the Clontech Creator SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). This requires an oligo-dT primer that anchors the polyA tail of mRNA to primer the cDNA synthesis process. However, mononucleotide runs reduce sequence quality and quantity due to excessive light production and crosstalk between neighboring cells (

The first approach was to use a “broken chain” short oligo-dT primer (primer sequence: 5′- AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTCGCAGTCGGTACTTTTTTCTTTTTTV-3′, V = A, G, or C) to prime the poly(A) tail of mRNA during first-strand cDNA synthesis (

 <sub>4</sub>GTC(T)
 <sub>4</sub>GTTCTG(T)
 <sub>3</sub>C(T)
 <sub>4</sub>VN-3′) to further break down the stretches of poly(A) sequence during second strand cDNA synthesis (
