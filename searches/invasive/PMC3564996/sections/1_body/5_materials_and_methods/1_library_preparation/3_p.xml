<p>Double-stranded (ds) cDNA synthesis was performed using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) with a hot start of 98° for 30 sec, followed by 18 cycles of 98° for 7 sec, 66° for 20 sec, and 72° for 4 min. The ds-cDNA polymerase chain reaction product was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification column (QIAGEN). Normalization was performed using a TRIMMER-DIRECT cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia). Approximately 600−1200 ng of purified ds-cDNA was used as the starting amount for normalization. A mixture of 0.25 µL and 0.5 µL of DSN normalization tubes was used for the first and second amplifications.</p>
