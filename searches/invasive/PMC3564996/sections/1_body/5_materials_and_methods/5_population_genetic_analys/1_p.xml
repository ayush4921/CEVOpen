<p>We examined the impact of both sequencing effort and source region (native 
 <italic>vs.</italic> invading) on assembled contig numbers, observed SNP positions, observed heterozygosity, and SNP overlap. SNP frequencies and overlap among individuals were quantified using custom Perl scripts. Significance of relationships was tested with linear model fits in R, using the lm function (
