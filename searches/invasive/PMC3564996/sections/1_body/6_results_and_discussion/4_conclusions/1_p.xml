<p>By analyzing the realized outcome of a wide range of sequencing efforts, our dataset reveals that allele recovery is far more dependent on sequencing depth than is gene recovery, although both are enhanced by additional sequencing depth. These relationships are of particular concern for diversity comparisons among outbred individuals, which are increasingly taking center stage as genomic sequencing moves outside of its historical focus on inbred lines of traditional model organisms. Modest transcriptome sampling nevertheless generates thousands of informative markers observable across many individuals. This is promising news for further studies of coding variation among individuals, and our ability to combine datasets generated with different methods over time â€“ one of the inherent strengths of sequence-based population genetics. Using our novel bioinformatic pipeline for allele identification, we were able to recover previously hypothesized population features using 40 individuals dispersed across a worldwide distribution, demonstrating the information-rich nature of transcriptome populations datasets.</p>
