<p>To evaluate our ability to resolve highly similar sequences in our assemblies, we examined frequency distributions of the synonymous site divergence at nodes in gene family trees for each of our datasets. Distributions of divergence times showed expected L-shaped patterns of abundant recent ancestry in each case, consistent with successful resolution of closely-related paralogs and alleles in our assemblies (

The distributions also accurately reveal an additional small peak at ~Ks = 0.65, which has been shown previously to correspond to an ancient genome duplication event near the base of the family, based upon Sanger sequence data (
