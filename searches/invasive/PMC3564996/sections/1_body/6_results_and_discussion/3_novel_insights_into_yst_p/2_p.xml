<p>With the use of 2568 SNPs that were genotyped in at least five individuals per continent, STRUCTURE modeling was able to detect coarse genetic structure in the native range. Estimates of support for population number (ln Pr[X|K]) peaked at K = 2, and these two subpopulations were partitioned geographically, with one region including individuals from Hungary and Romania in eastern Europe and the other region including individuals from Turkey and the Republic of Georgia in the Caucasus (

Including invading and naturalized individuals together with natives in a single model obscured all genetic structure and supported no subpopulations, even when geographic groups were provided as prior information in the model, a pattern indicative of a large number of admixed individuals in the dataset (

The evidence for admixture suggested by our coarse population sampling is consistent with a history of multiple introductions, and similar patterns in the Spanish collections provide some of the first support for the hypothesis that western European populations are not native and are themselves naturalized products of past introductions (
