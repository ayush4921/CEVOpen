<p>Inferences regarding introduction scenarios are only as robust as the sampling of the potential source populations (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch and Parker 2008</xref>), however, and our dataset is not extensive enough to rule out that unsampled source populations—rather than admixture of our observed native populations—have produced the current invasions. Thorough geographic sampling of the native range is essential for correctly identifying the most likely source genotypes. Moreover, dozens of individuals should be sampled from within each population to accurately estimate allele frequencies, and recover well-supported patterns of population structure (

Transcriptome studies generally have been considered too expensive to be used for this kind of broad population sampling, but as they becomes increasingly cost effective, investment in deeper sampling of individuals promises to be fruitful for robust population genomic studies.
