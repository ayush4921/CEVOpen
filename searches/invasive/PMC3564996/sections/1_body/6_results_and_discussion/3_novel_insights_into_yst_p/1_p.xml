<p>For introduced and invasive species, identifying the sources of their genetic variation can provide important insights into the circumstances that made these introductions so successful (

 </xref>). Native individuals assembled slightly higher numbers of both unigenes and contigs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) than invading individuals, potentially indicating reduced sequence variation in introduced genotypes, but these differences were not significant in either case (analysis of covariance on Ln-transformed data: unigenes, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06; contigs, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.23). Instead, the identification of allelic variation among our samples suggested different population genetic inferences in our YST transcriptome dataset: Across all inferred SNP positions, invaders had significantly greater heterozygosity than natives (analysis of covariance : F
 <sub>2,33</sub> = 82.21, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and a greater variance around predicted values based on sequencing effort (linear regressions: invader R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.67, native R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.96). These patterns are consistent with a known history of multiple, large introductions of YST (
