<p>After clustering, AllelePipe identified 22,687 polymorphic unigenes that conformed to expectations of no more than two alleles per individual. These loci annotated to 23,896

Interestingly, single loci included a lower representation of transcriptome factors, and a greater representation of intracellular and plastid-associated components. These patterns contrast with patterns of duplicate retention from paleo genome duplication events in the Compositae family, consistent with the hypothesis that certain complete pathways are retained in duplicate from whole genome duplications due to dosage constraints, while other functions are free to vary in copy number [and the latter would generate our multilocus clusters (
