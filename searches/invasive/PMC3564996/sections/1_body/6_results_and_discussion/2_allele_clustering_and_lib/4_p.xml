<p>Sequence overlap among samples also was improved by increased sequencing effort. In pairwise comparisons, the proportion of all polymorphic positions shared between individuals increased from &lt;1% to almost 30% in the largest libraries (which shared nearly 70% of the SNP positions observed in any individual library; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The 10 largest libraries included four native, four invading, and two naturalized individuals with more than 200 Mbp of sequencing effort each. Surveys of SNP sites—as identified from across the dataset—within just these greatest coverage libraries revealed that most SNP sites were sequenced in only a few individuals, though 6883 loci were present in all 10 libraries (

The number of overlapping SNP positions was significantly greater than expected by chance, given the number of positions observed in each library (K-S Goodness of Fit test:

Overlapping positions are almost certainly biased toward the most commonly expressed loci, however our GO categorizations indicate that this does not represent a particularly biased subset of genome function. Functional categorization and distribution of the annotations within the three GO categories (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function), did not vary more than a few percent among the individual assemblies for any classification, though this modest variation was statistically significant (
