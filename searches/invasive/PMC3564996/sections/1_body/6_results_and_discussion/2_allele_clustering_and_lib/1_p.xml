<p>Single-linkage clustering of unigenes across all individuals using AlellePipe generated 43,717 total putative loci with a median consensus length of 811 bp. These aligned to 260 (73%) of the UCOs, and the majority of these UCOs aligned with only one cluster as expected (

Alignment of the remaining UCOs to multiple clusters could reflect sequence divergence (low similarity with UCOs), duplication of the locus, or failure of the reads to cluster together. Divergence or duplication is possible but relatively unlikely in such highly conserved “single-copy” loci (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>) or insufficient overlap for observing similarity among sets of sequences. These latter processes will introduce clusters of sequences that are incomplete and/or redundant but nevertheless accurate variations on a gene region or splice form. Gene annotation of the consensus cluster sequences by similarity to 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> proteins yielded 26,728 matches, 11,268 of which (25.8% of all clusters) were identified as unique, nonredundant annotations. Similar rates of homology to 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> were observed in other transcriptome surveys of asterid plants, using both Sanger and next-generation sequencing platforms (
