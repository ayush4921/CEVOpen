<p>Aligning sequences from the 41 YST datasets against this filtered set of 22,687 pseudo-reference sequences revealed 237,034 polymorphic sites over the total sequence length of 21.2 Mbp, where each SNP variant was observed at least twice across all haplotypes (1 SNP per 89.6 bp across the sample). This low SNP density underscores the need for long-read approaches to accurately recover haplotypes within and among conspecific individuals (

 </xref>). The proportion of these sites sequenced in each individual increased sharply with sequencing effort (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with no indication of saturation; the largest libraries covered less than 60% of SNP positions. The number of observed heterozygous positions also showed a strong and linear increase with sequencing effort in both native and invading samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The accurate observation of heterozygosity is likely to be particularly important both for revealing population genetic information, and for validating the SNPs themselves (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). Thus, despite saturating returns of additional unique sequences in the larger libraries, our ability to observe allelic variation at these loci did not plateau, and analyses of this type of variation must take sequencing effort into account.
