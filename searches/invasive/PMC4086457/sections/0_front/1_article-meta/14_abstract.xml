 <p>Taxa from the genus 
  <italic>Prosopis</italic> are widespread invasive aliens across the globe. Numerous species have contentious issues surrounding them as they provide both benefits and harm. 
  <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are currently naturalised or invasive in 103 countries and are bioclimatically suitable for many more. There are numerous management practices available to control 
  <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions, each with their benefits and costs, however, in most areas management has had only limited success. There is need for more research to improve understanding and management success and for countries to develop strategic plants to guide managed in the future.
