<p>Climate matching was used to assess areas of potential naturalization and invasion (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> where there are currently no records of any taxa (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F5">5</xref>D).This includes countries in Europe (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, etc.), South America (Guyana and Suriname), Asia (China, Japan, Nepal, South Korea, etc.) and numerous island/atoll countries and overseas territories (Comoros, Malta, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, etc.) (Fig.

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species has been introduced and has established have the potential for the naturalization of additional 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. For example, there are currently seven naturalized and invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species recorded in South Africa, but the country is climatically suitable for many more species
