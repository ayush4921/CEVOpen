<p>Seed introductions have come both from native populations and from naturalized and invasive populations in countries where 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was introduced previously. However, the original sources of seed and dates for introductions to many countries are poorly documented. Seed introduced to Hawaii came from a tree in France with a speculated provenance in Brazil (
 <xref rid="PLU027C62" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2001
 </xref>) and 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic> introduced to Australia came from Hawaii (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2001
 </xref>). South Africa had multiple introductions of many species and seed was most likely introduced from native ranges in Chile, Honduras, Mexico and USA (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2001

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> introductions to India is uncertain (likely Mexico or Jamaica); later introductions came from Argentina, Australia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay (
