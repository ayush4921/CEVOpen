<p>The last comprehensive global review of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution listed the presence of taxa in 93 mainland and island/attol countries (
 <xref rid="PLU027C62" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2001
 </xref>). It is unlikely that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> has been introduced into more places in the 13 years since that review was undertaken, but rather that data availability has increased in the intervening period or that there has been unintentional spread e.g. into Tanzania. Of the 129 countries, 26 have only native species, 64 have only introduced 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, and 39 have both native and introduced species. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is weedy in 38 % of countries where it occurs naturally and 38 % of species in the genus are currently categorized as weedy in their native ranges. The distribution and scale of invasions in countries with invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> are not well known, with only 13 % of countries having detailed distribution or percentage cover data and not just records of occurrence.
