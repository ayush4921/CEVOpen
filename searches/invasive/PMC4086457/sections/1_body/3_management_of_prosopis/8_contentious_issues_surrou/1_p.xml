<p>The benefits and impacts and choice of different management approaches of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> have led to contentious issues regarding management. Control through utilization is advocated by some as a management technique that enables benefit of invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> to be utilized while simultaneously reducing the negative impacts of invasions and promoting local development (
 <xref rid="PLU027C14" ref-type="bibr">Choge and Chikamai 2004</xref>). However, many believe that this approach is inefficient at reducing invasions and leads to other problems such as dependencies (Table

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>) and that other approaches such as chemical and mechanical clearing should be prioritized, although they are costly (
 <xref rid="PLU027C96" ref-type="bibr">Witt 2010</xref>). To date, there is no evidence of the success of control through utilization as a management technique (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB2">2</xref>). The control through utilization approach is motivated around local development (which is needed) more so than managing invasions at large spatial and temporal scales.
