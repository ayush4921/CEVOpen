<p>Countries that use only chemical and mechanical control are mainly found in the Middle East and have small isolated invasions and are usually wealthier nations, whereas control through utilization is applied in poorer countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia. Biological control is driven by Australia and South Africa; however, there are also areas where ‘biological control agents’ are present but were not deliberately introduced, for example, Egypt (seed-feeding beetles—Coleoptera and Burchidae), Sudan and Yemen (

 </xref>). Another view is that any effect of such insects could improve the usefulness of less invasive taxa by reducing seed production and therefore potential invasiveness and could lead to less dense stands with larger trees and greater pod production (
