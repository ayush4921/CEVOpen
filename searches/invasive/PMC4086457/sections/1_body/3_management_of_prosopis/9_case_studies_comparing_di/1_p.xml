<p>Despite the growing body of research on management options for weedy and invasive

 <xref rid="PLU027C87" ref-type="bibr">van Klinken

 </xref>), there is an ongoing debate on how to effectively manage large-scale invasions. Different approaches are currently being used to manage 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB2">2</xref>). The following case studies were selected as being representative of different management strategies and also encompass the approaches most commonly employed in countries with different levels of socioeconomic development (developed—Australia; emerging economies—South Africa; developing—Kenya). The case studies are also characteristic of management strategies driven and implemented by different stakeholders, e.g. government driven with mainly private implementation (Australia), mainly government driven and implemented (South Africa) and government driven with some non-government organization (NGO) and international support (Kenya).
