<p>Control of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> first started in 1954 at Mardie Station, Western Australia, and by 1962 a major reduction in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> density had been achieved. Populations increased again when funding diminished, but in the mid-1970s the allocation of government funding led to substantial progress with clearing (

In other areas of Western Australia control was improving, but after funding lapsed many infestations returned in the 1990s with the exception of some areas such as Yeeda Station where control had been successful due to annual monitoring and clearing (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> stands had been removed (
