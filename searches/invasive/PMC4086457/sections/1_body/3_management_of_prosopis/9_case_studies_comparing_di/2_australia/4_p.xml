<p>Experiments have shown that some species are highly fire tolerant (especially the hybrids), which reduces the potential for using fire as a control method in many areas (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> to prevent its spread and accidental introduction elsewhere in Australia (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> management methods to inform landowners on control measures, and the 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> strategic plan places a lot of emphasis on educating and making stakeholders aware of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions and how to manage them (
 <xref rid="PLU027C3" ref-type="bibr">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). There have been rewarding examples of control success (
 <xref rid="PLU027C85" ref-type="bibr">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>); however, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> populations continue to spread in many areas and further management is needed.
