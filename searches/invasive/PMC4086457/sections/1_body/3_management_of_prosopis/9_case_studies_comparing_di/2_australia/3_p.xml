<p>Four biological control agents have been released in Australia: 
 <italic>Algarobius bottimeri</italic> and 
 <italic>A. prosopis</italic> (seed-feeding bruchids), 
 <italic>Evippe</italic> species (a leaf-tying moth) and 
 <italic>Prosopidopsylla flava</italic> (a sap sucker) (

 <italic>A. prosopis</italic>, 
 <italic>Evippe</italic> species), and the latter has had noticeable impacts on 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> populations through reducing long-term growth rates (
