 <italic>Prosopis</italic> has invaded over one million hectares and could potentially spread over 70 % of Australia's land area (
 <xref rid="PLU027C55" ref-type="bibr">Osmond 2003</xref>). 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are considered as one of the 20 worst invasives in Australia, and in accordance with the 
 <italic>Weeds Management Act</italic> 2001, a strategic plan has been developed to guide management (
 <xref rid="PLU027C3" ref-type="bibr">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is a declared weed in all the mainland states and one territory in Australia and has been categorized in accordance with the threats it poses and the corresponding management responses that need to be implemented (
 <xref rid="PLU027C85" ref-type="bibr">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>). This includes preventing introductions, trade, sale or movements of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa and the eradication of small populations and control of large populations (
 <xref rid="PLU027C3" ref-type="bibr">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). In general, most landowners use mechanical and chemical control measures to manage 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>. Although control and eradication programmes are primarily funded by the state, many private landowners also fund management operations. For example, in Queensland $A4 million was allocated for 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> management by the government, which was supplemented further by over $A600 000 by landholders between 1995 and 1999 and over $A2 million was spent on clearing between 2001 and 2005 (
