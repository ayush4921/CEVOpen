 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is estimated to have invaded one million hectares and has the potential to invade nearly half of Kenya's surface (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2009
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLU027C96" ref-type="bibr">Witt 2010</xref>). It was declared a noxious weed in 2008 (
 <xref rid="PLU027C42" ref-type="bibr">Low 2012</xref>). Biological and mechanical control was initially proposed as the management approach to combat 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions, but the government later opted for a control-by-utilization approach (
 <xref rid="PLU027C30" ref-type="bibr">FAO 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLU027C61" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik and Felker 2006</xref>). The FAO, with support from several NGOs, initiated programmes to manage 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> through utilization. These efforts were continued by the government's forestry department and forestry research organization (KEFRI) following the end of these projects. Considerable time and effort was taken to build capacity, formulate good policies and educate communities to utilize the goods and services from 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (
 <xref rid="PLU027C63" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
  <italic>a</italic>
 </xref>). For example, small-scale utilization projects were established and a cookbook using 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> flour was created and supplied to communities to promote its use (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLU027C63" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
  <italic>a</italic>
 </xref>). Although initial costs for training and purchasing appropriate small-scale processing machinery are high, they are considered to be lower than other control approaches (
 <xref rid="PLU027C63" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
  <italic>a</italic>
 </xref>). In 2002, trade in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> goods and services was worth US$2122 per household per year in some villages (
 <xref rid="PLU027C15" ref-type="bibr">Choge 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2002
 </xref>). Ten years later, trade in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> products in four selected areas was estimated to exceed US$1.5 million (
 <xref rid="PLU027C17" ref-type="bibr">Choge 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2012
 </xref>). Each tonne of pods that are collected and milled into flour is estimated to remove approximately two million viable seeds (
 <xref rid="PLU027C63" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
  <italic>a</italic>
 </xref>). Changes in legislation, and the promotion of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> use, helped drive the substantial rise in use and led to 100 % of the locals in one village supporting control through utilization as the most preferred management method to adopt in Kenya (
 <xref rid="PLU027C53" ref-type="bibr">Njoroge 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2012
 </xref>). However, in other villages 85–90 % of people surveyed considered complete eradication of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> to be the best option (
 <xref rid="PLU027C48" ref-type="bibr">Mwangi and Swallow 2005</xref>). There are still, however, contentious issues surrounding the benefits and costs of the species and management approaches in Kenya (
 <xref rid="PLU027C63" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
  <italic>a</italic>
 </xref>). There are many publications on the profits that are being made through utilization, but there is no evidence that these utilization programmes have contained or reduced the extent of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions. There is, therefore, a need for further investigation of the successes and failure of control through utilization programmes (
 <xref rid="PLU027C33" ref-type="bibr">Geesing 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2004
 </xref>). A common problem with trying to promote 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> utilization is that it is seen as an inferior resource in many communities, with people preferring to use native species (
 <xref rid="PLU027C33" ref-type="bibr">Geesing 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2004
 </xref>). Recently, a new utilization approach to increase invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> use has been adopted in Kenya—a power station (based on technology from India) is currently being built in the Kenyan Rift Valley which aims to produce electricity for the local area from burning 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> biomass (S. Choge, pers. comm.).
