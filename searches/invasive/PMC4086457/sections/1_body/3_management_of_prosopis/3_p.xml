<p>Logistic regressions were run to determine which factors underpin whether a country has formal management of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> taking place or not. The degree of understanding of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion impacts and ecology (besides residence time—the time since introduction) is a better determinant of whether or not a country will manage 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> than the socioeconomic conditions of the country (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB1">1</xref>). The stepwise regression revealed that the level of impacts and overall knowledge on 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions are key determinants of the presence of management within a country or not. Having knowledge on invasion potential/risk allows countries either to act timeously or to develop protocols to guide management based on an overall understanding of impacts, ecology, uses and special scales. Having a good understanding surrounding 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions also helps to highlight the need for management, and subsequent management also stimulates the accumulation of further knowledge on invasions. Residence time might not be a significant predictor, because in wetter areas invasions tend to establish much faster than in drier areas (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB1">1</xref>). Also, all countries have had 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> long enough to have naturalized and invasive populations (
