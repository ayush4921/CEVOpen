<p>Organizations involved in addressing land degradation and invasions should promote the dissemination of knowledge and awareness of both the impacts and benefits of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> to prevent unwise introductions and promote management (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F7">7</xref>). Some people still advocate the introduction of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species long after the severe impacts caused by invasions of these species were widely publicized; this has been described as ‘dangerous aid’ (
 <xref rid="PLU027C42" ref-type="bibr">Low 2012</xref>). Having regular multidisciplinary international meetings or workshops on 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions may help to spread knowledge and create dialogue between parties, which could help to reduce contentious issues surrounding many invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. The creation of management strategies using transdisciplinary approaches would also help to provide solutions acceptable to all stakeholders in situations where conflicting goals exist.
