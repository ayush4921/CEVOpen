<p>Introductions of known invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species to climatically suitable countries where it does not already exist should be undertaken such as in China, European countries along the Mediterranean and North East Asia, and spread of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> into new areas within countries where it is invasive should be prevented. Risk assessments for purposeful introductions need to be conducted in the future. Pathways of accidental introductions between neighbouring countries and into new areas in countries with invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> need to be managed. This could include regulations on livestock and fodder transport which is currently implemented in Australia (
 <xref rid="PLU027C3" ref-type="bibr">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). This is done by holding livestock in feed lots for a week before they are transported to ensure that all 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> seeds have excreted.
