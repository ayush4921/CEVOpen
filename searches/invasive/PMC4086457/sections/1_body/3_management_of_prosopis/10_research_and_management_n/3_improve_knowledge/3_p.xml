<p>There is a need to improve the understanding of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution and population sizes in introduced ranges to guide management planning (
 <xref rid="PLU027C94" ref-type="bibr">Wilson 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>). As indicated earlier, only 13 % of countries with naturalized and invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> have maps or detailed records of occurrence and scale of invasion. No information is available on the scale of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions on any of the Pacific (besides Hawaii), Indian Ocean or Caribbean Islands. Only a few African countries have a good understanding of the scale of invasions and, in Asia, information on the distribution of invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is only available for India and Pakistan. Such knowledge is essential for planning and implementing management. Bioclimatic mapping at board local scales is useful for understanding potential spread and occurrence of invasive species. However, bioclimatic models can be of limited value at very local scales as other biotic and abiotic factors come into play (
 <xref rid="PLU027C76" ref-type="bibr">Robinson 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>). On a global scale, bioclimatic modelling is useful for highlighting which countries and species need risk assessments for purposeful introductions, and where introduction pathways need to be monitored to prevent unintentional introductions, e.g. between India and China or Iran and Turkmenistan.
