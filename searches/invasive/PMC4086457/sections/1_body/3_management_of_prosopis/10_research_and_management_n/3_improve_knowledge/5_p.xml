<p>The issue of the lack of knowledge is also present for research on the effectiveness of controlling populations using different methods. Utilization as a control method is becoming popular in many areas such as Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. However, despite many reports showing how much monetary benefit 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> has provided, there is no information on how successful this approach is for controlling 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions. There are also conflicting ideas on the role and success of biological control in Australia and South Africa and further work is needed (

 </xref>). There is scope for identifying and potentially releasing additional biological control agents to improve control success in areas where this has been limited until now, such as in South Africa (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> globally. These include methods that retain the benefits, but reduce the impacts substantially.
