<p>These include correctly identifying 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species present and gaining consensus on the status introduced and weedy species (e.g. following the criteria proposed by 
 <xref rid="PLU027C69" ref-type="bibr">Pyšek 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). There have been numerous misidentifications of introduced 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, especially in Africa. This has caused much taxonomic confusion and contradictions between different sources of information that are only starting to be clarified. There are also hybridized populations in many areas where 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> has been introduced, further hindering identification (
 <xref rid="PLU027C98" ref-type="bibr">Zimmermann 1991</xref>. It was recently recognized that 
 <italic>P. pallida</italic>, which was seen as not being as invasive as other species, is more widespread than originally thought as it was misidentified as 
 <italic>P. juliflora</italic> in Africa (
 <xref rid="PLU027C64" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
  <italic>b</italic>
 </xref>). Most species introduced to Africa were described as 
 <italic>P. chilensis</italic>, but this is not the case, and accurate species lists are not available for many African countries such as Angola. Molecular methods are useful for clarifying taxonomic issues, especially in areas where hybridization has taken place. It is important to know which taxa are present for management, e.g. when looking for biological control agents and understanding ecology and rates of spread (
