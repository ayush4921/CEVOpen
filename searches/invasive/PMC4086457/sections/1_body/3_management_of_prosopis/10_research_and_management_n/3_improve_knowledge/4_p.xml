<p>Further knowledge on the ecology, local perceptions, and the ecological, economic and social benefits and impacts of

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions is essential for management (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB1">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F6">6</xref>). Most of the literature comes from a handful of countries (Australia, India, Kenya, South Africa, USA), and research in other areas is needed since each region has its own set of factors that drive invasions and complicate management. There is also a need for research to better predict trends such as future densities, extent and impacts which is particularly important when it comes down to developing strategic responses. Drivers of weediness in areas where it is native such as Argentina, Mexico, Middle East and the USA require further study to improve understanding of what drives native plants to become invasive and provide insight into how to manage them.
