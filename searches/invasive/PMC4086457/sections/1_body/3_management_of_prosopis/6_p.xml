<p>The classification and regression model highlights the factors that underpin which management approaches counties are likely to adopt (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F6">6</xref>). Similar to the regression output, the overall level of knowledge of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is an important factor when predicting which management approach or technique a country will adopt (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F6">6</xref>). Countries with a good understanding of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> based on the number of publications and the diversity of published materials have a higher chance of having some form of management, and in general this takes the form of integrated management. The level of development of a county, indicated by gross domestic product per capita, also influences the type of management approach a country is likely to adopt. Wealthier countries are more likely to implement mechanical and chemical control methods, which are the most costly but also currently the most effective options. Middle-income countries most commonly implement integrated management, whereas poor countries predominantly adopt control through utilization for managing
