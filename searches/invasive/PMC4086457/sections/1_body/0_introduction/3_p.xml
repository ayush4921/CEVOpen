<p>Taxa of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> (mesquite; Fabaceae) occur in most of the world's hot arid and semi-arid regions as native or introduced species (
 <xref rid="PLU027C62" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2001
 </xref>). The genus 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> as described by 
 <xref rid="PLU027C11" ref-type="bibr">Burkart (1976)</xref> consists of 44 species. They have been introduced globally and have become naturalized or invasive in many places (
 <xref rid="PLU027C71" ref-type="bibr">Rejmánek and Richardson 2013</xref>). Several 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species are also ‘weedy’ in parts of their native ranges (
 <xref rid="PLU027C62" ref-type="bibr">Pasiecznik 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2001
 </xref>). In this paper we define native species as those whose presence in an area is not attributable to introduction by humans (this includes species that have spread into areas without assistance from humans by overcoming biogeographic barriers). Alien taxa are those whose presence in an area is attributable to introduction by humans. Naturalized taxa are alien taxa that are self-sustaining. Invasive taxa are naturalized taxa that have spread substantially from introduction sites (further details in 
 <xref rid="PLU027C67" ref-type="bibr">Pyšek 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2004
 </xref>). We define ‘weedy’ taxa as native taxa that have increased in abundance and/or geographic range in their native ranges.
