<p>Numerous 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are recognized as major invaders across large parts of the world (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic>’ is listed as one of the 20 weeds of national significance in Australia and taxa in the genus are declared as major invasive species in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and South Africa, and Sudan is advocating for its eradication (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species successful invaders include the production of large numbers of seeds that remain viable for decades, rapid growth rates, an ability to coppice after damage (

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species can also withstand climatic extremes such as very high temperatures and low rainfall, and they are not limited by alkaline, saline or unfertile soils (
