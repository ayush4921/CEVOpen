<p>In many areas, invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees do not sustain their full use potential due to intraspecific competition in dense stands which, generally, form over time. In such cases relatively few pods are produced for fodder and human consumption and dense invasive stands become impenetrable for humans and livestock making utilization of resources difficult (

 <italic>Acacia</italic>, 
 <italic>Leucaena</italic> and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> because the adverse impacts tend to exceed the benefits as the invasions progress, if left unmanaged (
