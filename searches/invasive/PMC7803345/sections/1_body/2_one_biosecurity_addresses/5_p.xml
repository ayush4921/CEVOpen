<p>The increasing intensification of agriculture to supply an ever greater demand from the world's population for more food [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] will affect the ability to contain and limit the spread of a pest or disease following an incursion or outbreak. The role that the intensification of livestock production could play in future animal and human disease pandemics is well recognised by national and international bodies [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. While agricultural intensification is known to be a potential trigger for pest outbreaks in agricultural crops [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], the strategies to mitigate such risks are not well developed. There is, therefore, considerable opportunity for cross-fertilization in best practice across plant and animal health. More importantly, it is generally underappreciated how disease risks to human health can also impact global food security. Epizootic pandemics such as avian flu or African swine fever directly reduced animal-sourced food output, while restrictions in the international movement of agricultural labourers in response to SARS-CoV-2 have disrupted supply chains and increased the volatility of commodity prices on the international market [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The strong interrelationships between human, animal, plant, and environmental health associated with food production require joined up thinking across the health, agriculture, and environment sectors when building greater global food security.
