<p>In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, much of the world has become aware of the importance of biosecurity in protecting global health (
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and in particular the need for more effective management of the risks of introducing unwanted organisms at international borders [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This has led several countries to review their national biosecurity systems in order to gain from the lessons arising from the pandemic [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>]. Yet the lessons for implementing more robust biosecurity strategies are much broader than most policymakers currently appreciate, going far beyond the actions undertaken in response to SARS-CoV-2. Although biosecurity is sometimes viewed as a synonym of biodefense or biosafety [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it more commonly refers to the research, procedures, and policies that cover the exclusion, eradication, or effective management of the risks posed by the introduction of alien plant pests, animal pests and diseases, animal diseases capable of transmission to humans (zoonoses), the release of genetically modified organisms and their products, and the management of invasive alien species and genotypes [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although this definition is often adopted in multilateral policy guidance [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>], at an international level the issues encompassed by biosecurity have traditionally been dealt with by different sectors each with its own regulatory framework. The World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) provide international standards for human health, plant health, and animal health, respectively, while the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) sets non-binding standards for the management of alien species that threaten biodiversity [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These divisions are often echoed at the national level, with most governments developing domestic regulation relating to human health, agriculture and the environment through separate departments, ministries, or agencies [
