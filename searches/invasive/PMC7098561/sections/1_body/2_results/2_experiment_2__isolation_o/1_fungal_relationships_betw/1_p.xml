<p>The diverse Didymellaceae in the canopy air of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> may be associated with the easy release of Didymellaceae spores from monocultures of 
 <italic>A</italic>.

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> harbors diverse Didymellaceae fungi, we selected one population, KM, to isolate the leaf spot fungi. In total, 355 isolates were isolated and grouped into 75 unique cOTUs with a 100% cutoff of ITS gene similarity. The most dominant fungi were from the family Glomerellaceae (24.51%). The second most dominant fungi were Didymellaceae, which included 10 cOTUs and accounted for 20.00% of the isolated strains (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230822.s002">S1 Table</xref>). By comparing the results with the fungal library obtained by high-throughput sequencing technology, a total of 20 overlapping OTUs were identified, which accounted for 11.45% and 44.79% of the abundance of two libraries, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230822.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The shared OTU11 (cOTU24), OTU14 (cOTU12, cOTU35, cOTU36, cOTU37 and cOTU43) and OTU295 (cOTU75) belonged to Didymellaceae were the most abundant fungi in both the canopy air and leaf spots. The leaf spots showed relatively high overlap with LC compared with that with HC (
