<p>In total, the fungal co-occurrence network had 62 nodes and 85 edges, with 20 negative edges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230822.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The air from the low part of the canopy (LC) had more fungal co-occurrences than those of the air from the high part of the canopy (HC). The most abundant 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> rarely linked among themselves or with other fungi positively. In most cases, common phytopathogens, e.g., 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> (OTU117) and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> (OTU202), are positively linked with other fungi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230822.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that diverse fungi belonging to the Didymellaceae family frequently linked with each other positively, e.g., OTU11-OTU43, OTU43-OTU295, and OTU97-OTU295, but linked with other fungi negatively, e.g., OTU97 (Didymellaceae) with OTU117 (
 <italic>Alternaria</italic>), and with OTU325 (
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>). The exception to this pattern was that the most dominant genus 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> (OTU287) showed a positive relationship with Didymellaceae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230822.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).
