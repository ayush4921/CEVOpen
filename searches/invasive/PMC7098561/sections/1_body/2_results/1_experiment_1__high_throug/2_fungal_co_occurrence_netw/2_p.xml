<p>We identified nine Didymellaceae OTUs, with a sum of 7.53% of the sequences. Phylogenetically, OTU150 was combined with 
 <italic>Ascochyta</italic> into one clade, and the remaining OTUs were close to 
 <italic>Phoma</italic>, 
 <italic>Epicoccum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cumuliphoma</italic> and 
 <italic>Didymella</italic>, which were clustered into another clade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230822.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Relatively LC had a greater abundance of the Didymellaceae family than that of HC, with no statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05, paired t test). OTU11 and OTU90 were the predominant fungi and appeared in most samples. OTU150 only occurred in HCin-KM2, and OTU52 was detected in HCin-YL2. The remaining OTUs occurred in 2 to 8 samples (
