<p>Co-occurrence patterns do not allow mapping of microbial interactions directly, but provide information on particular groups sharing habitats or performing similar ecological functions [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, to reveal the co-occurrence among airborne fungi, network analyses of the OTU matrix based on Spearman’s Rho were calculated by the "psych" R package. The OTUs that occurred only in one sample were excluded when structuring the co-occurrence networks. We further divided the synthetic dataset into two parts: LC and HC of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic>. The co-occurrence among all the fungi was calculated for both LC and HC. These two valid co-occurrence events were considered to be robust if the correlation coefficient ρ &gt; |0.8| and if they were statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05 [
