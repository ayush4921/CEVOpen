<p>After OTU classification, we first deleted the unidentified OTUs at the phylum level and then subsampled all samples to the 30376 reads (minimized reads' sample) using the “sub.sample” function in MOTHUR v1.35.1. All the data were analyzed except those that were removed during subsampling (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230822.s003">S2 Table</xref> Data Subsampled OTUs table). The rarefaction curve for each sample was calculated using MOTHUR "rarefaction.single" and plotted using Graphpad Prism v7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). The alpha diversity was calculated using the R package "vegan" and plotted using Graphpad Prism v7. The alpha fungal diversity between two regions, as well as between two heights in the air column was compared using paired t test by SPSS 25.0 (IBM, NY, USA). We used two methods to compare the diversity between two regions, i.e. considering the heights in the air column (LC: 3 vs 3, HC: 3 vs 3) and not considering the height in the air column (6 vs 6). The same method was used to compare the different height in the air column with and without considering the region. Similarly, the differences in fungal abundance between two regions, as well as between two heights in the air column were also compared using paired t test using the methods above described at phylum, family, and genus level, respectively. The fungi with an average abundance of less than 0.5% were excluded from the comparison. For the phylogenetic analysis of Didymellaceae, the most similar sequences were downloaded from NCBI and neighbor joining (NJ) was used to construct phylogenetic trees with Mega X using 18S rRNA gene sequences (approximately 220 bp). 
 <italic>Leptosphaeria conoidea</italic> (CBS 616.75) and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>doliolum</italic> (CBS 505.75) were selected as the outgroup. The node stability was assessed with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The relative abundance of Didymellaceae fungi is shown in a heatmap plotted by the R package "pheatmap".
