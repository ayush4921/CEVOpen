<p>The diluted DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification. For the fungal diversity analysis, the fungal rRNA gene was amplified with primers ITS1-1737F (
 <monospace>GGA AGT AAA AGT CGT AAC AAGG</monospace>) and ITS2-2043R (
 <monospace>GCT GCG TTC ATC GAT GC</monospace>) targeting ITS1-ITS2 (approximately 246 bp) [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All the amplifications were conducted in an ABI GeneAmp® 9700 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 37 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. The PCRs contained 2 μL 10 × PCR buffer, 2 μL 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.8 μL 5 μM ITS1-1737F and ITS2-2043R primer, 0.2 μL of TakaRa rTaq DNA polymerase and 10 ng DNA template, with a final volume of 20 μL. Equal amounts of purified amplicon were pooled for subsequent sequencing using the Miseq sequencing platform at Shanghai Majorbio Biopharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The next-gen data were submitted to GenBank under bioproject accession numbers PRJNA590841.
