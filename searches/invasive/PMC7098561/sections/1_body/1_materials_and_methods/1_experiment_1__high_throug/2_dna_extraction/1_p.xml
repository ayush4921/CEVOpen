<p>Prior to DNA extraction, the concentrated spores were resuspended in approximately 250 μL of sterile distilled water. The resuspended fungal spores were extracted using the commercial DNA extraction kit FastDNA
 <sup>®</sup> SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The DNA quality was monitored by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. The extracted DNA was diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μL to balance the DNA amount among the samples, and then stored at -20°C until further processing. Meanwhile, the sterilized cellulose acetate membranes without performing collection of air spores were used as the extraction blanks, which were failed in DNA extraction and were excluded from the further processing.
