<p>The samples were collected in two regions in which 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> heavily occurs in Yunnan Province, China. These sampling sites are not located within the protected area and no sampling permit is required. At 2–4 pm, April 10 and 15, 2018, three sites per region were selected to collect the air in the same day and considered as the biological duplication. In each sampling site, we sampled two heights in the air column, and totally we collected 12 air samples. Briefly, in each region, three sampling sites over 1 km apart were randomly selected (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230822.s002">S1 Table</xref>, sampling sites information). The canopy air in each site was sampled from both the immediate canopy (the air from the low part of the canopy, defined as LC) and 1.5 meters above the vegetation (the air from the high part of the canopy, defined as HC). For each sample, airborne spores were concentrated from 1000 liters of air (~5mins), using a 9cm diameter Petri dish filled with a sterilized cellulose acetate membrane by a surface air system (SAS) Super ISO 180 (VWR International PBI SRL, San Giusto, Italy). The Petri dishes were immediately sealed with Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> "M" (Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Menasha, WI) after air collection and brought back to the laboratory. Then, the cellulose acetate membrane was removed, cut into small pieces and placed in 2 mL centrifuge tubes. The fungal spores on the cellulose acetate membrane were oscillated and removed with 600 μL sterile water and sterilized steel balls in a magnetic shaker for 10 minutes. The cellulose acetate membrane and steel balls were removed from the centrifuge tubes. Then, the spores from each sample were centrifuged and pooled, and the precipitant was stored in a -4°C refrigerator prior to DNA extraction.
