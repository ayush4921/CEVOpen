<p>To identify the fungal sharing, the ITS sequences from each representative OTU obtained from airborne fungi were selected to perform alignment with those sequences obtained from cultural leaf spot fungi above. Because the ITS sequence obtained by the high-throughput sequencing technology was short (~250bp), the alignment was trimmed to this range and was clustered to generate OTUs again using MOTHUR software with a 97% similarity cutoff [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Deletions/insertions were considered when comparing the sequences from next-gen and cultures. Those OTUs clustered from both sources were defined as the shared fungi; the Venn and bubble diagrams were used to show the shared fungal OTUs. Then, the shared Didymellaceae fungi obtained from leaf spots were selected to test their pathogenicity in the disease experiment. The used multiple isolates from one OTU were obtained from different leaf spots to avoid the origin of the same clone.
