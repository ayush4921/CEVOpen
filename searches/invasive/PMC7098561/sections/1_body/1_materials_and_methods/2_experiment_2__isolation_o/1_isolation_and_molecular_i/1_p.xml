<p>To verify if there is fungal sharing of the leaf spots with the canopy air of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic>, we selected one population of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> from one site (KM3) to perform fungal isolation. Diseased leaves with morphologically different symptoms were collected. Healthy leaf tissues and the margins of diseased tissues of each leaf spot were cut into six sections of 6 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and surface sterilized. The disinfected fragments were then plated onto PDA and incubated at ambient temperature for 6–8 days or until mycelia growing from the leaf fragments were observed. Then, all the fungal colonies grown from the leaf fragments were purified and used to determine the phylogenetic position and in the disease experiments. All the fungi were maintained as pure cultures at Yunnan University (Kunming, China). All the fungi were sequenced by the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using primers ITS 1 (
 <monospace>TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCGG</monospace>) and ITS 4 (
 <monospace>TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC</monospace>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Sequences of pure isolates were clustered to generate OTUs using MOTHUR software with a 100% similarity cutoff [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These cultured OTUs were named as cOTUs to distinguish from the OTUs generated by next-generation sequencing. The fungi were annotated and blasted against the UNITE database [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] using the MOTHUR classifier (confidence threshold of 80%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The nucleotide sequences of these OTUs have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MK813969—MK814043.
