<p>The disease experiment was performed in the field. The field site is located in Xishan mountain, Kunming (Lat 24°58′24″ N and Lon 102°37′17″ E) and has an elevation of 2,214 m. The site is not located within the protected area and no sampling permit is required. In this site, there is a natural plant assemblage, which includes weeds, forbs, trees and vines, native to Yunnan. The experimental period extended from June to the end of October 2018, the primary growth season for plants in Kunming. In total,

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], our experiment was performed as previously reported to test the virulence of necrotrophs in tropical forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Briefly, the fungi were grown on PDA for 7 days, and 6mm
 <sup>2</sup> fungal mycelium agar dishes were obtained and used to inoculate in plants in the field. Mature and healthy leaves were selected for inoculation. Small wounds were made by lightly touching the underside of the leaf with toothpicks; this resulted in 7 pin pricks in an area of 0.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The inoculum agar was pressed against the wound using cellulose tape on the underside of the leaf and clipped in place with a bent hair clip. The wounds were labeled with the strain number. One week after the inoculation, the leaves were harvested and leaf spot size was measured. The leaf spot size for each strain was visualized by a heat map, which was plotted by the R package "pheatmap". The PDA culture agar without fungus was used as the negative control. In the case that the obvious symptom was developed in the negative control group, the same batch of the fungi was tested again.
