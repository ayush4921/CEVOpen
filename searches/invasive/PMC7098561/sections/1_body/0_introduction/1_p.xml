<p>It has been suggested that invasive plants have the ability to decrease biodiversity in local ecosystems through competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) partially explains this competitive advantage, as hosts in the introduced range escape from their enemies [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Klironomos (2002) showed that five of North America’s most damaging exotic plant invaders modified the soil microbial community in ways that benefit themselves (i.e., positive feedback) [

 <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) found a switch from negative to positive plant-soil feedback for spotted knapweed when moving from its native to its exotic range [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, some invasive plants have been shown to accumulate pathogens in their invaded ranges, which is called the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline (PAID) hypothesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In some cases, pathogen accumulation can limit the spread of invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In eastern North America, the highly invasive annual grass
