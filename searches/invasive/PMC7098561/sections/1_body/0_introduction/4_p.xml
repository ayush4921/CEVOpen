<p>The invasive weed 
 <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> is one of the most serious invasive weeds in Yunnan Province, China. It has rapidly spread in southwestern China and is expected to invade southern and south-central China unless it is controlled [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Recently, several studies indicated that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> could be infected by the foliar fungal pathogens 
 <italic>Phaeoramularia sp</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], 
 <italic>Passalora ageratinae</italic> [

 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> [

 <italic>Collectotrichum</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In recent, our group has indicated that the foliar fungi from family Didymellaceae are adverse to the growth of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and these fungi frequently occurs in the surrounding environment, such as in the withered leaves and the canopy air of hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, two experiments were designed to verify the expectation above. Firstly, we used the high-throughput sequencing technology to characterize the fungal community and analyze their co-occurrence network in the canopy air of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> (experiment 1); and then the shared representative phytopathogenic fungi from family Didymellaceae were isolated from leaf spots of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> and their virulence to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> as well as native plants was tested (experiment 2).
