<p>Besides the direct adverse impacts on invasive host, these accumulated pathogens can indirectly exacerbate the effects of invasions if they are transmitted in the invaded ecosystem and affect the susceptible of native hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which is defined as disease-mediated invasion (DMI) [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Alternatively, invasive plants could be a reservoir of local pathogens, which may spread to wild plants, crops and generate very large ecological risks [

Evaluating these impacts of invasive hosts in the introduced range largely depends on the understanding if these fungi can be released from hosts into the surrounding air and if they have the potentials to cause diseases on neighboring native plants.
