 <italic>adenophora</italic> harbored abundant leaf spot pathogens from Didymellaceae in this study (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230822.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The data suggest that there may form a feedback between the pathogenic fungi associated host and the airborne spores, i.e., the monoculture hosts support high load of pathogenic fungal infection, which will develop into a pathogenic-fungus-dominant canopy air and in turn further worsen their infection on hosts. Such a feedback cycle may partially contribute to the prevalence of Didymellaceae fungi on

 <italic>adenophora</italic>. Here we reasoned that the co-occurrence pattern of the dominant airborne fungal pathogen may be a label in the monoculture plant, including invasive plants, as well as economic crops. Janzen-Connell hypothesis indicates that diverse host-specific pathogen is important to maintain plant diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. For native vegetation, higher plant diversity promotes higher diversity of fungal pathogens [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], it thus is expected that the airborne fungal co-occurrence become more abundant in native vegetation than in the monoculture plant. Although it remains to have such a conclusion due to the lack of air samples above native vegetation in this study, our data indirectly indicate that the diverse hosts and the diverse airborne pathogen co-occurrence network may partially contribute to high diversity of pathogens in native vegetation and thus decreases pathogen infection per plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Previously, increasing host diversity has been verified to help reduce the disease severity of airborne pathogens for monoculture crops. For example, Zhu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2000) reported that planting disease-susceptible rice varieties in mixtures increased crop yield by 89% and reduced blast severity by 94% when comparing with those in monocultures [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Therefore, it is worthwhile to verify the commonness of such fungal co-occurrence patterns in other invasive systems as well as in crop systems, and the study of airborne fungal co-occurrence networks represents a promising field of plant pathology.
