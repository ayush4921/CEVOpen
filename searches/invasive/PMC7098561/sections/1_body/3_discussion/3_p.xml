<p>Regarding the reason why an exotic plant invades successfully, many reports have focused on the positive soil microbial feedback of invasive plants compared with that of native plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our data indicated that the pathogen feedback in the canopy air may weaken plant invasion as the residence time increases. In addition, previous reports have indicated that invasive plants could accumulate pathogens and infect native plants [
