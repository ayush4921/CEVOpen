<p>For the fungi of Didymellaceae in the air, 
 <italic>Epicoccum</italic> is the most reported genus [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and the other groups have been disregarded because they were not identified. Didymellaceae is the largest family in the Pleosporales and has more than 5400 taxon names listed in MycoBank [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Although Chen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) classify Didymellaceae into 19 genera, many Didymellaceae remain to be identified [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Similarly, most Didymellaceae fungi in this study were of the unclassified group, indicating that many of them may be potential novel species and worthy of characterization in the future. Nonetheless, the high-throughput sequences obtained from air samples we used for the comparison with the cultured strains were too short (~250bp) to fully confirm their matches. Therefore, the traditional culture methods should be used to successfully culture Didymellaceae fungi from the air, and both the morphological taxonomic methods and multiple loci of gene sequences are needed to accurately determine their phylogeny. Interestingly, strains from OTU14 showed a great variation in virulence and host range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230822.g006">Fig 6</xref>); in particular some strains, e.g., DID2, have a narrow range of hosts. These strains are the candidates to develop into a potential biocontrol of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> in future.
