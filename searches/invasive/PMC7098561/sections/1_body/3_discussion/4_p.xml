<p>Interestingly, we found that the most dominant genus 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> (OTU287) showed a positive relationship with Didymellaceae in the canopy air of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic>. This pattern here does not mean that 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> specifically facilitates the accumulation of Didymellaceae in the air but mirrors the high prevalence of 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> spores in the air [

 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition, although Glomerellaceae fungi (e.g., 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic>) were the most abundant fungi isolated from the leaf spots (also see Supplementary Data Fungi isolation table) as well as foliar endophytes of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], they were rarely detected in the air by high-throughput sequencing. Because these 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> strains are rarely pathogenic on 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic> (unpublished data), we excluded them from this analysis. However, fungal spores in the air can be affected by microclimatic conditions, such as temperature and humidity [
 <xref rid="pone.0230822.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and it is worth determining the daily and seasonal dynamics of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> in the air of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophora</italic>.
