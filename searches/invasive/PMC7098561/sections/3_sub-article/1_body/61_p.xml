<p>- Exactly what is being tested with each statistical test is unclear. For example when lower canopy and higher canopy communities are compared it seems all of the data were thrown in, but wouldn't local differences be swamped by geographic/spatial differences? Shouldn't this be a paired test within sites, (low vs. high) X 3?</p>
