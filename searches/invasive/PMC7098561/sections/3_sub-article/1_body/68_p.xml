<p>Reviewer #2: This paper describes the fungal composition of air at different heights of an invasive plant, in the context of how pathogen spread might impact further colonization of the plant and of native plants. Further information needs to be provided about the methods in order to interpret the results. The true impact of the findings on further plant invasion are speculative and should be presented as such. In addition, the idea that pathogens may foster diversity by inhibiting spread of plant progeny is known as the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. The authors could discuss their findings in the framework of the Janzen-Connell mechanism of maintaining plant diversity, particularly in the context of invasive species. Overall the paper presents the study in a clear way.</p>
