<p>- The sample size and sampling approach should be clarified without requiring the reader to go to the supplement. From the main text it seem that the authors have sampled two regions with three sites per region. They sampled two heights in the air column. So, I think their study is based in this section on 12 samples (6 at each height). But then it is difficult to (1) understand why this sampling structure was chosen to address the research questions and (2) why there are four bars on the figures in Fig. 1 (it seems that this refers to 2 heights in 2 regions) -- but then, to what exactly are the statistics referring? Additional clarification will aid the reader greatly. At the moment the paper is weakened by the disconnect between questions, methods, and inference.</p>
