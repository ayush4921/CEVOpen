<p>Response: Thank you for your suggestions. As we reviewed in introduction, airborne fungi are influenced by multiple abiotic factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. Therefore, to conclude the vegetation impact, a comparison of native vegetation vs invasive plant may need a large size of samples obtained from multiple invaded regions in order to the exclusion of the effects of these abiotic factors. This is already beyond the aim of current study. </p>
