<p>Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. For the study of fungal diversity in next-generation sequencing, the classification of fungal groups using ITS fragments about 250 bp is a common method. However, the construction of phylogenetic trees using such short sequences is indeed largely limited. In the revised manuscript, we added the text in the discussion as “Nonetheless, the high-throughput sequences obtained from air samples we used for the comparison with the cultured strains were too short (~250bp) to fully confirm their matches. Therefore, the traditional culture methods should be used to successfully culture Didymellaceae fungi from the air, and both the morphological taxonomic methods and multiple loci of gene sequences are needed to accurately determine their phylogeny.” (Lines 468-476) </p>
