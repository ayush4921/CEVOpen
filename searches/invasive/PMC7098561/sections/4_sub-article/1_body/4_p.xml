<p>Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. As you pointed, it is somewhat mis-represented about introduction on current state of plant pathology. Many statements about airborne fungi are too basic and simplistic. By reorganizing the references, we narrowed these statements and focused the topic on the fungal pathology about invasive plants. Therefore, the introduction was rewritten. As you will see in this revision, our study aims were highlighted in the introduction and more supported the story as we showed in the title: to characterize the fungi associated with invasive plant.
