<p>1. In some cases the current state of the field seems somewhat mis-represented. Airborne fungal propagules have been a major focus of epidemiological studies in plant pathology for some time. In other cases, the introduction sometimes is rather basic, making statements (for example about the disease triangle) that read as rather simplistic. I suggest that the authors revise the introduction to more appropriately integrate the strong traditions and current views of plant pathology.</p>
