<p>Response: Thank you for your concerns. Our team has studied the fungi (including endophytes and pathogens) associated with A. adenophora for a long time. In two papers we published very recently, we found foliar Didymellaceae fungi are adverse to the growth of A. adenophora and therefore are considered as potential leaf spot pathogens; again, we also verified the occurrence of this family of fungi in the surrounding air of A. adenophora. Therefore we focused on these fungi in this paper. </p>
