<p>Response: Thank you for your concern. We added sentences in methods as: “After OTU classification, we first deleted the unidentified OTUs at the phylum level and then subsampled all samples to the 30376 reads (minimized reads' sample) using the “sub.sample” function in MOTHUR v1.35.1.” (Lines 176-178) </p>
