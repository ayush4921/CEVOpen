<p>Response: Thank you very much. We answered your concerns by added the sentences in the methods as: “To identify the fungal sharing, the ITS sequences from each representative OTU obtained from airborne fungi were selected to perform alignment with those sequences obtained from cultural leaf spot fungi above. Because the ITS sequence obtained by the high-throughput sequencing technology was short (~250bp), the alignment was trimmed to this range and was clustered to generate OTUs again using MOTHUR software with a 97% similarity cutoff [43]. Deletions/insertions were considered when comparing the sequences from next-gen and cultures. Those OTUs clustered from both sources were defined as the shared fungi; the Venn and bubble diagrams were used to show the shared fungal OTUs.” (Lines 237-245)</p>
