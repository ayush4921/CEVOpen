<p>“This pattern may result from their high infection and easy release of spores from the monoculture A. adenophora host into the surrounding air. Species of Didymellaceae mainly cause leaf and stem lesions [64,65] and produce many small conidia, which is conducive for spreading through the air [66]. We also verified that A. adenophora harbored abundant leaf spot pathogens from Didymellaceae in this study (see S2Table). The data suggest that there may form a feedback between the pathogenic fungi associated host and the airborne spores, i.e., the monoculture hosts support high load of pathogenic fungal infection, which will develop into a pathogenic-fungus-dominant canopy air and in turn further worsen their infection on hosts. Such a feedback cycle may partially contribute to the prevalence of Didymellaceae fungi on A. adenophora.” (Lines 409-419)</p>
