<p>Response: Thank you for your suggestions. As your concern, the impacts of the findings on further plant invasion are speculative, we added sentences in discussion as: “Nonetheless, whether these effects of Didymellaceae fungi ultimately translate into a competitive adverse of A. adenophora and the ecological risk must be evaluated against the background of the invaded ecosystems.” (Lines 445-447)</p>
