<p>Many claims need citations. For example, L44-46, did those studies show that the disease was spread via airborne propagules and not through other means? In L48-49, do references 9-10 show evidence that the spores spread over a long distance, rather than a short distance? L335, is there evidence that plant leaves and not the soil is the major release of fungal spores?</p>
