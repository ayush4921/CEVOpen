<p>Response: Thanks, as your concerns, we compared main taxonomies in different level (phylum, family, and genus) using a paired test within sites and also the heights in the air column. In the method section, we added the text as “The alpha fungal diversity between two regions, as well as between two heights in the air column was compared using paired t test by SPSS 25.0 (IBM, NY, USA). We used two methods to compare the diversity between two regions, i.e. considering the heights in the air column (LC: 3 vs 3, HC: 3 vs 3) and not considering the height in the air column (6 vs 6). The same method was used to compare the different height in the air column with and without considering the region. Similarly, the differences in fungal abundance between two regions, as well as between two heights in the air column were also compared using paired t test using the methods above described at phylum, family, and genus level, respectively. The fungi with an average abundance of less than 0.5% were excluded from the comparison.” (Lines 183-193)</p>
