<p>In this study, two experiments were designed to verify the expectation above. “Firstly, we used the high-throughput sequencing technology to characterize the fungal community and analyze their co-occurrence network in the canopy air of A. adenophora (experiment 1); and then the shared representative phytopathogenic fungi from family Didymellaceae were isolated from leaf spots of A. adenophora and their virulence to A. adenophora as well as native plants was tested (experiment 2).” (Lines 97-106)</p>
