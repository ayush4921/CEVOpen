<p>In introduction, we added sentences to state why we collected airs in different heights as: “Plant canopy air, with complex microclimates, thus acts as an important space for dynamic host-pathogen interactions [26]. Pathogens in the canopy air can infect plants under optimal microclimate conditions and in turn, release their spores into the air to complete their life cycle; meanwhile, the host can change the canopy microclimate to affect pathogen spread and disease development [26]. Some studies for the monoculture crop also have shown that numbers of conidia collected decreased with increasing height within and above the crop canopy [27-29]. Similarly, for the monoculture invasive plant, its canopy air would harbor diverse fungal spores released from leaf spots, which in turn, may infect host itself as well as neighboring species. It should be expected that: (1) The closer to the plant host, the higher diversity and more complicated co-occurring connections of fungi; (2) there are the sharing between fungi in the canopy air of invasive plants and host-associated pathogenic fungi. Currently, there is a total lack of the knowledge of the airborne phytopathogenic fungi surrounding the invasive plants.” (Lines 78-91)</p>
