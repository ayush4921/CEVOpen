<p>Response: Thank you for your suggestions. As you pointed and references reviewed in the introduction, airborne fungal spores are influenced by a lot of abiotic factors, in particular climate including temperature, wetness, etc. Therefore, as your hypothesis it would be that the effect of sampling site would be greater than sampling height; that, communities would cluster first by site, then by height. However, it failed to get such a conclusion when we used the paired t test for comparison of fungal community structure to test this hypothesis. Indeed, our current sample size (12 samples collected from two region) is not far enough to conclude the difference in fungal community composition between the regions, and between the heights in the air column in our study. Therefore, we changed the introduction (as you see statements above) to focus our aims on the characterization of fungal co-occurrence networks and fungal sharing between airs and host, as well as their potentials to be pathogenic. </p>
