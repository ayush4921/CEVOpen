<p>Response: In the method section, we added the information about sampling as “The samples were collected in two regions in which A. adenophora heavily occurs in Yunnan Province, China. These sampling sites are not located within the protected area and no sampling permit is required. At 2-4 pm, April 10 and 15, 2018, three sites per region were selected to collect the air in the same day and considered as the biological duplication. In each sampling site, we sampled two heights in the air column, and totally we collected 12 air samples.” (Lines 111-116)</p>
