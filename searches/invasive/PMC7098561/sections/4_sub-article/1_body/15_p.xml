<p>And also the statistics were added as “The alpha fungal diversity between two regions, as well as between two heights in the air column was compared using paired t test by SPSS 25.0 (IBM, NY, USA). We used two methods to compare the diversity between two regions, i.e. considering the heights in the air column (LC: 3 vs 3, HC: 3 vs 3) and not considering the height in the air column (6 vs 6). The same method was used to compare the different height in the air column with and without considering the region.” Meanwhile, we revised the figure 1 as Shannon index and species richness in each sampling region and each heights in the air column.(Lines 183-193 and Fig. 1)</p>
