<p>- The comparison method for determining whether the ITS sequences matched for the air samples (next-gen) and cultures needs more careful attention. How were the comparisons made? Were deletions/insertions important or also gaps? Were composites from 97% similarity OTUs compared against the longer reads from cultures, and how, or were the comparisons done for all sequences? </p>
