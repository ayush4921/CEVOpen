<p>Response: Thank you for your concern. When we did the DNA extraction, a sterilized cellulose acetate membrane without collection of spores was used as the extraction blanks. The negative control which was failed for DNA extraction was excluded from the further processing. We added this information in the revised manuscript (Lines 140-142). </p>
