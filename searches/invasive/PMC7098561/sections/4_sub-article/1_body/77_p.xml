<p>Response: Yes, we agreed with your point. The co-occurrence network represents a common dispersal mechanism. We deleted all words “interaction” and such meanings when describing the co-occurrence networks. And we added some information about co-occurrence in the methods section as “Co-occurrence patterns do not allow mapping of microbial interactions directly, but provide information on particular groups sharing habitats or performing similar ecological functions [46].” (Lines 200-202)</p>
