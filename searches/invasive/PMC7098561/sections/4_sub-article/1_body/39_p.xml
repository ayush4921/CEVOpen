<p>- The authors refer to five strains of OTU14 used in the inoculation experiments; were these truly five different strains? Is it possible this was exactly the same fungus isolated five times? More information to clarify will help. This is somewhat confusing because the authors refer to OTU14 but that OTU in the fungal isolation table is Xylariaceae. </p>
