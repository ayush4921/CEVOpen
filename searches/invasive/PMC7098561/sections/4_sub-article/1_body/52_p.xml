<p>Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. In this version, we rechecked our writing. We thought that there were somewhat mis-represented about the introduction on current state of plant pathology. Many statements about airborne fungi were too basic and simplistic. By reorganizing the references, we narrowed these statements and focused the topic on the fungal pathology about invasive plants. We rewrote the introduction. As you will see in this revision, our study aims were highlighted and more supported the story as we showed in title: to characterize the fungi associated with invasive plant. By doing this, the problems you mentioned here also were modified (Lines 46-106).</p>
