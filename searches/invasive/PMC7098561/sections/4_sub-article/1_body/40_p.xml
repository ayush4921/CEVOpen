<p>Response: Thank you for your suggestions. The isolates we used in the disease experiment were isolated from different leaf spots. So even the DNA sequences of these isolates are the same, it is unlikely that they come from one clone. We added sentences like: “These cultured OTUs were named as cOTUs to distinguish from the OTUs generated by next-generation sequencing.” “The used multiple isolates from one OTU were obtained from different leaf spots to avoid the origin of the same clone.” (Lines 228-229 and 247-248 in methods )</p>
