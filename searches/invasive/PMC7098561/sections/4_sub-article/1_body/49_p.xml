<p>We also discussed our data in the frameworks of Janzen-Connell hypothesis as: “Janzen-Connell hypothesis indicates that diverse host-specific pathogen is important to maintain plant diversity [67, 68]. For native vegetation, higher plant diversity promotes higher diversity of fungal pathogens [69], it thus is expected that the airborne fungal co-occurrence become more abundant in native vegetation than in the monoculture plant. Although it remains to have such a conclusion due to the lack of air samples above native vegetation in this study, our data indirectly indicate that the diverse hosts and the diverse airborne pathogen co-occurrence network may partially contribute to high diversity of pathogens in native vegetation and thus decreases pathogen infection per plant [69]. Previously, increasing host diversity has been verified to help reduce the disease severity of airborne pathogens for monoculture crops. For example, Zhu et al. (2000) reported that planting disease-susceptible rice varieties in mixtures increased crop yield by 89% and reduced blast severity by 94% when comparing with those in monocultures [70]. Therefore, it is worthwhile to verify the commonness of such fungal co-occurrence patterns in other invasive systems as well as in crop systems, and the study of airborne fungal co-occurrence networks represents a promising field of plant pathology.” (Lines 421-437)</p>
