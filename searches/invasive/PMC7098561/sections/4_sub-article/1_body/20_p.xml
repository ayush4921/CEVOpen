<p>Response: Thank you for your concern. As the text we mentioned “The extracted DNA was diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μL to balance the amount of DNA among the samples” (Lines 138-139), and also “After OTU classification, we first deleted the unidentified OTUs at the phylum level and then subsampled the 30376 reads (minimized reads' sample) using the “sub.sample” function in MOTHUR v1.35.1. All the data were analyzed except those that were removed during subsampling (see S2 Table Data Subsampled OTUs table)” (Lines 176-180). And all these methods were used to ensure that the next-gen study generated data are rationale to estimate abundance across regions, or heights. The application of the two diversity indices is redundant, so in the revised version, only Shannon index and species richness were used for alpha diversity comparison.</p>
