<p>In discussion: â€œPreviously, there have been verified the occurrence of more fungal spores in the air in the low part of the canopy, which is close to plant leaves (i.e., the important release source of fungal spores), compared with the number of spores in the air of the high part of the canopy [20,59]. Several reports from crop systems have also verified this trend [27-29]. We did not found a higher fungal diversity and abundance in low part than high part of the canopy (Fig. 1). This is possible due to the small distance of two heights (~1.5m, see methods). Many reports have indicated that the determining factors for airborne pathogen spores are very complex, related to the environment, season and time [60-62], and in particular meteorological factors [21, 23, 55, 56, 63]. In this study, therefore, it is impossible to conclude the difference in fungal diversity across air column due to the small size of air samples (only two heights from two regions). However, partially supporting our expectation, we found that the air in the low part of the canopy (LC) had more fungal co-occurrences than the air in the high part of the canopy (HC) (Fig 3). In particular, we found that the dominant pathogens on A. adenophora enhanced the links among themselves (e.g., Didymellaceae fungi OTU90) and reduced their links with other fungi in the canopy air (Fig 3, 4A). </p>
