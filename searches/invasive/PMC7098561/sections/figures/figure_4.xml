 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetics(A),bar graph (B), and heatmap (C) of Didymellaceae. (A) The node stability was assessed with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, and only nodes with stability &gt;0.5 are shown in the figure. The scale bar represents 2.0 substitutions per sequence position. (B)The percentage in the bar graph represents the percentage of Didymellaceae from different sources. The error bars represent one SE. (C)The relative abundances are expressed as the richness of fungi from a given isolation source transformed by log
   <sub>2</sub>(x+1).
