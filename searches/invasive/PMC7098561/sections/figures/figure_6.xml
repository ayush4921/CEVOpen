  <title>Host range and virulence of five Didymellaceae fungal strains belonging to shared OTU14.</title>
  <p>The relative abundances were expressed as the virulence, defined as leaf spot size (mm
   <sup>2</sup>) transformed by log
   <sub>2</sub>(x+1), of different fungi. All the fungi were isolated from leaf spots on 
   <italic>A</italic>. 
   <italic>adenophora</italic>.
