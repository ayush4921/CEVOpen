 <caption> Host range and virulence of five Didymellaceae fungal strains belonging to shared OTU14. The relative abundances were expressed as the virulence, defined as leaf spot size (mm 2) transformed by log 2(x+1), of different fungi. All the fungi were isolated from leaf spots on A. adenophora. </caption>
