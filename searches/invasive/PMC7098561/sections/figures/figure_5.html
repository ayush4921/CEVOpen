 <caption> Fungal overlap between the canopy air and leaf spots of A. adenophora. (A) Venn diagram of the fungal overlap between the leaf spots and canopy air with a 97% similarity cutoff. The numbers above the diagram represent the number of OTUs. The percentages represent the relative abundances of the OTUs. (B) The bubble diagram of the relative abundances of overlapped OTUs. The size of the bubble is proportional to the relative abundance of the OTU. The OTU number in the parentheses represents the OTU number in the fungal library obtained by high-throughput sequencing technology (see S2 Table). </caption>
