 <caption> Fungal co-occurrence networks. (A) Total fungal co-occurrence network and (B) the co-occurrence networks between Didymellaceae and Didymellaceae-linked fungi. The gray and black nodes represent fungi in the HC and in LC, respectively. The node sizes are proportional to the OTU abundances, and the color of each line reflects positive (orange) or negative (blue) associations. The numbers in parentheses represent the OTU number. DID: Didymellaceae; PER: Periconia; PEN: Penicillium; CLA: Cladosporium; ALT: Alternaria; FUS: Fusarium and U: unclassified. </caption>
