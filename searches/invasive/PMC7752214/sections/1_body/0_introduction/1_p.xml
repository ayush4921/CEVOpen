<p>Amino acid bioavailability can be defined as the proportion of amino acids reaching systemic circulation and that can be incorporated into body protein synthesis. It mainly depends on the protein digestibility and amino acid absorption as well as the latter's metabolic fate in deamination pathways. Although metabolic losses are a component of amino acid bioavailability, most studies refer to the efficiency of protein digestion. The term ‘protein and amino acid digestibility’ generally refers to the amount of these undigested components recovered in the digesta. The term ‘amino acid bioavailability’ is related to absorbed amino acids. However, these terms are not fully consistent in the literature. In the context of designing strategies to ensure protein security in the future while responding to environmental issues [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], there has been a renewed interest in protein digestibility as a key factor of protein quality in the 5 past years. Many studies were conducted in healthy volunteers or their related animal models. Whereas digestive disorders can compromise protein security in some populations due to protein malabsorption, little objective data exist. This review aims to provide a state of the art of recent developments related to protein and amino acid digestibility in normal and abnormal gut function.
