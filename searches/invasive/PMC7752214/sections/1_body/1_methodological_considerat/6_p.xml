<p>Animal models are also used to provide amino acid digestibility data, the pig model equipped with an ileal or ileocaecal cannula that allows the continuous recovery of digesta, in particular [

They are much less expensive and easy to use, but a major drawback is the impossibility of continuously collecting the ileal digesta. To circumvent the problem, two strategies exist. One consists of collecting the ileal digesta at a single time postmeal, with a repeated meal protocol [

Lastly, another methodological factor of variation is the method of differentiation between dietary and endogenous protein losses by either using a protein-free diet to assess the endogenous losses or stable isotopes to trace dietary or endogenous proteins [
