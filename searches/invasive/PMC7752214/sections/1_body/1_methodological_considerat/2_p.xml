<p>It must be mentioned that the term ‘amino acid availability’ is sometimes used on the basis of the plasma amino acid area under the curve (AUC) after a test meal, but it is confusing because it does not reflect amino acid absorption alone [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, other phenomena such as the speed of digestion and the efficiency of amino acid uptake in tissues considerably influences the incremental plasma amino acid postprandially. As an illustration of the confusion that can occur, casein generally displays a moderate AUC compared with other protein sources, such as whey; a result that is not ascribed to a low amino acid bioavailability from casein since it is one of the most digestible proteins, but rather to a slow digestion rate. As the entry of amino acids into protein synthesis rapidly saturates the process, there are more circulating, remnant amino acids when proteins are digested rapidly than when amino acids arrive progressively in the blood. When dietary protein is intrinsically labelled with a stable isotope and a labelled amino acid is intravenously infused, it is possible to determine the amount of dietary amino acids that appear in circulation [
