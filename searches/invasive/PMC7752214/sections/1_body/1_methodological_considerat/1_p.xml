<p>Methods for determining digestive efficiency, namely digestibility, have evolved in the context of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-recommended Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) values as the preferred criteria of protein quality [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this context, digestibility of each indispensable amino acid (IAA) must be measured at the ileal level because absorption occurs in the small intestine. Amino acids reaching the large intestine are fermented, and molecules are partly transformed into either other amino acids or metabolites that can be absorbed at the colon level, such as ammonia or indoles for nitrogen molecules, or H
 <sub>2</sub>S, phenol and branched-chain fatty acids for nonnitrogenous compounds [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. If the measurement of protein digestibility at the faecal level has been considered an overestimated but acceptable proxy of ileal digestibility, the measurement of faecal amino acid digestibility is generally not accepted, though already reported for pulse proteins, for instance [
