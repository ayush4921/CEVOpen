 <sup>15</sup>N [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the reference protein (spirulina or free amino acids) with 
 <sup>13</sup>C. The amino acid absorption from the test protein is determined by analyzing the relative ratio of these two tracers in the meal and the plasma amino acids. The low invasiveness is a major strength of this method, but it is analytically complicated. Moreover, it involves indirect calculations and to date, it has not yet been validated against the direct method of ileal sampling.
