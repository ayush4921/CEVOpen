<p>An entirely noninvasive method has been developed from the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method that was primarily used to determine amino acid requirements. It was adapted to identify the metabolic availability (i.e. including digestive and metabolic losses) of the limiting amino acid [

 </xref>]. The principle is that if one amino acid is limiting in the diet, the other amino acids are subjected to increased oxidation because their entry into protein synthesis is impaired. This is thus reflected by the increased 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> excretion in breath air from the indicator amino acid, generally 
 <sup>13</sup>C phenylalanine. The method consists in giving either synthetic meals with increasing levels of the limiting amino acid in a free form (thus theoretically 100% digestible) or meals containing the test protein with the same levels of the limiting amino acid. The amino acids are given under the requirement level to obtain a linear regression between the amino acid level and the 
 <sup>13</sup>CO
 <sub>2</sub> excretion. The slopes obtained with free amino acids and the protein meals are then compared, reflecting a lower bioavailability of the limiting amino acid in the test protein if the slope is weaker than with the free amino acid meal. As with the dual isotope method, it is an indirect method. It has the advantage of being analytically simple and entirely noninvasive, but it is cumbersome to formulate the meals and then adapt volunteers to different ones. Moreover, it ultimately only measures the bioavailability of the limiting amino acid.
