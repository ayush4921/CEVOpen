<p>Notably, the bioavailability of amino acids from plant sources has been substantially reported owing to the increasing interest in evaluating the quality of nonconventional protein sources. Data obtained in humans with the dual isotope method indicate a mean IAA bioavailability in three different legumes of 63–74% [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], whereas the value is around 90% for meat and eggs [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the amino acid digestibility of whole eggs can be severely decreased, down to 75%, when ingested with black tea [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a result that can be ascribed to the polyphenols. Using ileal tubes to measure the true ileal digestibility (endogenous protein being evaluated in a protein-free group), mean amino acid bioavailability from whey was close to that of egg and meat, whereas that of zein was very low [

 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] determined the metabolic availability of the limiting amino acids in corn meal, lysine and tryptophan, and found higher values for these individual amino acids than those found for zein by Calvez 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8

 </xref>]. It must be pointed out that in the latter study, the digestibility of lysine and tryptophan could not be determined because zein was almost completely deficient in both amino acids. Rafii 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11

 </xref>] also reported that the most limiting amino acid in chickpea, methionine, was only bioavailable at 63% against 100% in steamed rice. In rats, our team found a high digestibility of a sunflower isolate, almost as high as that observed for whey in the same model, whereas the digestibility of spirulina cell amino acids was moderate [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In rats, the amino acid digestibility from different cereals was shown to be higher in wheat than in rice, and especially in polished rice [
