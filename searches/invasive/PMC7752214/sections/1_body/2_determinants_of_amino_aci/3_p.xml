<p>The treatments applied to food are also a determinant of bioavailability. The effect of bovine meat cooking processes such as boiling and grilling were reported to be modest in pigs, with differences of 2.5% between grilled and boiled beef [

In a pig model, it was also observed that the cooking temperature of pork products, varying from 63 to 72 °C, did not modify amino acid digestibility; neither did the smoking process applied to bacon, however, curing improved the amino acid digestibility of ham from 95 to 99% [
