<p>In normal physiological conditions, when digestive capacities are not impaired, the main determinant of digestive bioavailability is the nature of the protein as well as the food matrix in which it is incorporated â€“ protein isolates being generally more digestible than proteins in their crude matrices. Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents a representative set of the recent values of protein/amino acid digestibility, obtained in different models and with different methodologies described above. Both are major factors of variation that must be considered for any data comparison from the literature.
