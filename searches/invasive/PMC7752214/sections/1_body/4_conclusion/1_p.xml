<p>The past few years have seen a renewed interest in protein and amino acid bioavailability in view of documenting the quality of plant and alternative proteins to animal proteins and, furthermore, to enrich the DIAAS database. As protein and amino acid digestibility are methodologically complex and invasive, many developments have been conducted to reduce the invasiveness or to improve the accuracy of data. In conditions of healthy gut functioning, the true digestibility depends on the protein source, animal more than plant protein, especially in the context of the food matrix where several values are below 75% for plants. Important interindividual variability is observed for low digestible protein but the reasons remain unknown. In abnormal gut functions, protein digestibility has been little-addressed and dedicated studies to determine protein malabsorption and the subsequent risk of protein malnutrition are required.</p>
