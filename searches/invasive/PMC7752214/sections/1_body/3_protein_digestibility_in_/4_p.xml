<p>In inflammatory gut disorders, such as EED and IBD, there are almost no data on protein digestibility. Protein malabsorption can be suspected due to diarrhoea, intestinal mucosal abrasion and alteration of permeability, leading to undernutrition, especially in children [

 </xref>] indirectly addressed this question by assessing amino acid bioavailability in moderately stunted Indian children. They used the ratio kynurenine/tryptophan as a probable biomarker for intestinal inflammation. This marker was negatively associated with height-for-age

The authors observed a positive association between the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and proline digestibility, which they interpreted as a reflection of the specific role of metalloproteinases from the brush border membrane that both respond to inflammatory stress and activate proline-rich peptide cleavage. However, they did not find any correlation with the digestibility of other amino acids. In addition, the mean amino acid bioavailability of chickpea (87 ± 10%) and yellow pea (86 ± 10%) were higher that what was found in adults, as reported in the former paragraph [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is noteworthy, though, that the interindividual variability is greater and thus suggests an impairment of amino acid bioavailability. However, the experimental conditions, without any direct evaluation of gut dysfunction or inflammation, do not permit drawing conclusions regarding the absence of any protein absorption alteration in EED.
