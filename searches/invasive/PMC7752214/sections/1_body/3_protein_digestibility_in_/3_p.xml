<p>In gut disorders involving pancreatitis insufficiency, protein malabsorption has been little documented in contrast to lipids, of which absorption is majorly impaired. After ligation of the pancreatic duct in minipigs, we observed a drastic alteration of real ileal protein digestibility that was 29 ± 11 vs. 89 ± 6% in control pigs [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The administration of pancreatic enzymes partially restored protein absorption in a dose-dependent manner. Significantly, the ligation of the canal duct did not completely suppress protein digestion as about 30% of dietary protein was digested. This indicates that nonpancreatic enzymes, such as pepsin and/or brush border enzymes, can partially compensate for the experiment-induced pancreatitis insufficiency. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is also associated with pancreatic insufficiency. Using the principle of the dual isotope method described above, Engelen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that the digestibility of phenylalanine from spirulina was 80% in healthy volunteers but less than half in CF patients. This is a dysfunction that could be counteracted by enzyme substitution, as reported for chronic pancreatitis.
