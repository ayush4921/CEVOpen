 <caption> Interindividual dispersion of amino acid digestibility in rats depending on the protein source. Rats were given a 15N test meal and 15N amino acid losses were determined in the caecum 6 h after the ingestion to determine the orocaeal amino acid digestibility. 15N goat whey: n = 8; 15N sunflower isolate: n = 15; 15N spirulina (whole cell): n = 14. Adapted from [ 14 ▪ , 20]. </caption>
