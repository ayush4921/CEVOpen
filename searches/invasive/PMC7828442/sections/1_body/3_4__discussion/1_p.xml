<p>Since 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> invaded China, Chinese researchers have conducted investigations to identify natural enemies that are able to parasitize 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. Egg parasitoid wasps [

 <xref rid="B21-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and some other natural enemies parasitizing 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae were found and reported [

 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, some dipterans infesting 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> were observed and caught in four regions of China. Morphological and DNA barcode identification confirmed that all the fly specimens collected in the four regions were of the species of 
 <italic>M. scalaris</italic>.
