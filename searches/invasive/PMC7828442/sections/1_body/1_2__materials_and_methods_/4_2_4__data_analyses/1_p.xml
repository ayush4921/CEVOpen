<p>The sequences of the 28S rRNA and COI gene of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> were used to blast in the NCBI database. The top 100 sequences of each gene were downloaded and redundant low-quality sequences were removed after being aligned by MUSCLE v3.8.31 [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-12-00065" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method in MEGA5 [
