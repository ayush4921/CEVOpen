<p>In this study, five groups (YN, GX, CQ_2, HN, and CQ_1) of parasitic flies infesting 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> were collected from four regions in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00065-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Of these, four were found in containers of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> collected in Yunnan (YN), Guangxi (GX), Chongqing (CQ_2), and Henan (HN). The remaining group was found in the culture medium for 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> intestinal fungi isolation and was designated as CQ_1. Flies were captured with a combination of sweep netting over the container of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and maggots were collected into tubes directly. For each group 30â€“50 flies were collected, and 24 maggots were collected for the CQ_1 group. Following collection, flies and maggots were anesthetized over ice.
