<p>The anesthetized flies were washed by sterilized phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and preserved in 75% ethanol for 24 h. They were then put in a critical point-drier and fixated with double-side adhesive tape, and then coated with gold in vacuum condition. Subsequently, electron microscopy observations were conducted to observe details with regard to the mouthpart, compound eyes, wing, and terminalia for morphological identification with a Hitachi SU3500 Scanning Electron Microscope. </p>
