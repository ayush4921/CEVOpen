 <caption> Sinigrin is positively correlated with population densities later in the life cycle. Correlations of root sinigrin concentration with mean Alliaria petiolata population density (plants m −2) during four successive life‐history stages. Each point represents a Pearson correlation coefficient relating the variation in sinigrin concentration among populations to the variation in conspecific plant density. N = 10 for all correlations. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. </caption>
