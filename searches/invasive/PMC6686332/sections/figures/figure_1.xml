 <caption>
  <p>Competitive environment provides context for the relative costs and benefits of sinigrin production. Linear regressions of 
   <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> rosette biomass on root sinigrin concentration in three experimental competition conditions. Solid symbols = heterospecific competitors (
   <italic>Arisaema triphyllum</italic>); open symbols: conspecific competitors; grey symbols: no competitors. For the heterospecific and no competition treatments, symbols are means of two replicates (one grown in invaded and one in uninvaded soil). For the conspecific treatment, symbols are the mean of four replicates (one individual per population grown with two different 
   <italic>A. petiolata</italic> populations as neighbours in both invaded and uninvaded soils).
