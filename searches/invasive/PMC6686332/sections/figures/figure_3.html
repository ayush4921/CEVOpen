 <caption> Density dependence of seedling survival decreases with sinigrin production. Interaction of density‐dependent seedling survival with sinigrin concentration of Alliaria petiolata seedling roots grown in a common environment. Mean survival is highest, and negative density dependence is strongest, in populations with the highest sinigrin concentrations. Points show observed quadrat‐level seedling survival; lines show marginal predicted seedling survival from fitted GLMM of survival vs. sinigrin, seedling density and their interaction (Tables S1 and S2; see Materials and methods). </caption>
