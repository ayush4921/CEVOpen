 <caption> Sinigrin indirectly drives the population growth via effects on early survival. Linear regressions of (a) λ S on sinigrin concentration of Alliaria petiolata seedling roots grown in a common environment, (b) λ S on early survival, calculated as the mean of the product of seedling survival and summer rosette survival, and (c) early survival on seedling root sinigrin concentration. Growth rates were calculated from 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 data in Evans et al. ( 2012). Sinigrin concentrations represent the mean of multiple genetic families per population. </caption>
