  <p>Sinigrin is positively correlated with metrics of survival early in the life cycle. Correlations of root sinigrin concentration with mean 
   <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> vital rates during six successive life‐history stages. Each point in the figure represents a Pearson correlation coefficient relating variation in sinigrin concentration among populations to the variation in the vital rate. Per capita vital rates shown are SS: annual seed survival probability; G1: germination probability of seeds after one winter; SR: survival probability of seedlings to the rosette stage; Summer: survival probability of first‐year rosettes from June through October; Early: product of SR and summer survival; Winter: overwintering survival probability of rosettes from October through June the following year; F: fecundity (mean seeds produced per adult plant). The 
   <italic>A. petiolata</italic> life cycle progresses from seed survival to reproduction in the order plotted here from left to right. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 10 for all correlations. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.
