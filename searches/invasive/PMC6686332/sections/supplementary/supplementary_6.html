 <caption> Fig. S1. Mean (a) seed, (b) seedling, and (c) summer rosette survival rates vs. sinigrin concentration of Alliaria petiolata seedling roots grown in a common environment. Fig. S2. Expanded view of data used to generate Fig.  4. Fig. S3. Expanded view of data used to generate Fig.  5. Table S1. Information‐based model ranking of seedling survival GLMMs with binomial errors, random quadrat and year effects, and different fixed effects structures embodying alternative competing hypotheses about roles of sinigrin ( S) and population density ( D). Table S2. Output of linear mixed model relating Alliaria petiolata rosette biomass to root sinigrin concentrations in a greenhouse experiment manipulating competition and soil invasion history. Table S3. Parameter estimates from binomial GLMM mSRa (Table S2) of seedling survival as a function of seedling density, seedling root sinigrin concentration, and their interaction. Table S4. Output of a linear mixed effects model of sinigrin concentration in root tissue of greenhouse grown Alliaria petiolata seedlings. Appendix S1. Presentation of results with 2005 data included. Includes notes on timing of sample collection, data selection, and updated figures including 2005 data. </caption>
