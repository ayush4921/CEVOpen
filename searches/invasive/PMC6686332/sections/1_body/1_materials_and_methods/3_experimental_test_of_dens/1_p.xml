<p>To directly test whether sinigrin concentrations would be differentially selected in populations facing competition from hetero‐ vs. conspecifics, we performed a greenhouse experiment using individuals from the same populations where demographic rates and sinigrin investment were measured (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This involved the 10 populations mentioned above, as well as the Homer Lake site and an additional Michigan population (Gasinski Farm) for which sinigrin, but not demographic, data were available. We grew one individual from each of the 12 populations in one of eight conditions – four competitive environments crossed with two soil environments. The four competitive conditions were (i) no competitors, (ii) three individuals of the native, mycorrhizal species 
 <italic>Arisaema triphyllum</italic>, (iii) three 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> individuals from a young population or (iv) three 
 <italic>A. peitolata</italic> individuals from an old population. Each competition treatment was repeated in pots inoculated with live soil from a site with no history of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> (uninvaded soil community) or soil from directly underneath 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> plants at a nearby site. Both sites were in central Illinois; the Vermillion River Observatory is within the introduced range of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, but has been kept free of invasion via diligence of the site manager (S. Buck, pers. comm). This resulted in a total of 96 pots. Plants were grown in 650‐mL Deepots (Stuewe and Son, Inc. Tangent, OR, USA) with a 32‐cm
 <sup>2</sup> soil surface area. This resulted in a density of 0·03 plants cm
 <sup>−2</sup> for the no competition treatment and 0·125 plants cm
 <sup>−2</sup> for the competition treatments, well within the range observed at field sites (R. Lankau, pers. obs.). Plants were grown for 3 months, and the above‐ and below‐ground biomass of the target and neighbour plants in each pot were collected, dried and weighed.
