<p>To test whether the selection on root sinigrin concentrations differed between competitive conditions, we analysed total above‐ and below‐ground biomass of target 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> rosettes using a linear mixed model. Competition treatment, soil treatment and sinigrin concentration and all two‐ and three‐way interactions were included as fixed effects, and population was modelled as a random effect. We used a parametric bootstrap to determine 95% confidence intervals for all model parameters. Initial analyses found no difference between 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> competitors from young vs. old sites, so for simplicity we lumped these pots together into one ‘conspecific competitor’ treatment.
