<p>We used the population‚Äêlevel estimate of root sinigrin concentrations taken from the quantitative genetics screen described above, as this measure controls for maternal effects and integrates across minor environmental variation in the greenhouse. Because there was very little genetic variation detected within populations, we were more confident that the population mean sinigrin concentration would be a useful predictor of genetic investment to sinigrin in our experimental plants.</p>
