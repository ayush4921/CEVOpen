<p>The combined effects of sinigrin concentration and plant density on seedling survival were analysed using GLMMs and model ranking similar to the previous set of analyses. We focused on seedlings because conspecific densities, and hence intraspecific competition, were greatest at this stage, and the sinigrinâ€“survival relationship in the previous analyses was strongest for seedlings. We fit five binomial GLMMs with random quadrat and year effects and five different fixed effects structures embodying alternative competing hypotheses about the roles of sinigrin (

 <italic>D</italic>). All models included an intercept (
 <italic>I</italic>). These were as follows:
