<p>We calculated Pearson's correlations between mean 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> vital rates across years for each site and root sinigrin concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> was created similarly using mean population densities which we then correlated with sinigrin concentration. Population densities were calculated as mean plants per quadrat for each site year which we then averaged across years for each site, yielding one estimate per site. Density estimates were scaled to plants m
 <sup>−2</sup> from the various quadrat sizes used in sampling. See Evans
