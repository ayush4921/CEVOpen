<p>The stochastic population growth rates (λ
 <sub>S</sub>) used in our analyses were recalculated from data reported in Evans 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Readers should review that paper and its online appendices and citations for details on site selection, quantification of vital rates and matrix population model construction and interpretation. Briefly, we measured 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>'s vital rates in four replicate sets of quadrats within each of 12 natural field populations in southern Michigan and central to northern Illinois. All populations were sampled for three consecutive 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> generations whose sampling regimes began in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to estimate the vital rates that were then used to parameterize a matrix population model with environmental stochasticity for each site.
