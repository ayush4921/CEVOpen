<p>We estimated the genetic variation in sinigrin among populations using seeds derived from each of the 10 populations, after one generation of growth in a common greenhouse environment to reduce the variation due to maternal environment. Seeds from 10 maternal individuals were collected from each population in 2007. These seeds were cold, wet‐stratified for 90 days at 4 °C and then germinated and four individuals per maternal family were grown for 3 months in a greenhouse in Urbana, IL, and then moved to a growth chamber set at 4 °C for 6 months to simulate winter. The surviving rosettes were then brought back out to the greenhouse and allowed to bolt and flower. Flowering individuals were covered with a fine mesh to prevent pollen movement, and allowed to self‐fertilize.

 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), so this step was unlikely to cause the substantial inbreeding depression. We collected the seeds from all plants that successfully set seeds and stored them at 4 °C until the second stage of the experiment (
 <italic>c</italic>. 2 years). Greenhouse‐collected seeds were again cold, wet‐stratified for 90 days at 4 °C and then germinated at 20 °C. Due to mortality prior to flowering, failure of some flowering plants to set seed and failure of some seeds to germinate, final sample sizes of second‐generation plants were substantially reduced. We had no evidence that this mortality was biased across populations or with respect to sinigrin levels within populations. Therefore, while this loss reduces the precision of our estimates of population mean sinigrin concentrations, this should not introduce any bias that would alter our biological interpretations. In the end, we were able to grow an average of 7·3 grandmaternal families per population (i.e. on average 7·3 of the 10 field‐collected maternal families had descendants in the second‐generation experiment), with an average of 1·85 selfed maternal families per grandmaternal family, and an average of 2·39 replicate individuals per selfed maternal family, for a total of 322 individuals across the 10 populations.
