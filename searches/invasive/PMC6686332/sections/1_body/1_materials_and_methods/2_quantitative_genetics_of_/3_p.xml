<p>Microsatellite data were used to determine Nei's genetic distance between each population, as well as the overall degree of population differentiation using

 <sub>ST</sub>. Nei's genetic distance was calculated with the 
 <sc>adegenet</sc> package and 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> with the 
 <sc>hierfstat</sc> (Goudet 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) package in R. We used Mantel tests to determine whether the differences in either λ
 <sub>S</sub> or mean sinigrin concentration among populations correlated with neutral genetic distance or geographic distance. We used partial Mantel tests to determine whether the relationship between sinigrin concentration and stochastic λ remained significant when controlling for either neutral genetic or geographic distance between the populations. Finally, we computed an overall

 <sub>ST</sub> value across the 10 populations and 8 loci, and calculated 95% confidence intervals by bootstrapping across loci using the 
 <sc>boot</sc> (Canty &amp; Ripley,
