<p>Invasive species are ideal for investigating possible eco‐evolutionary feedbacks because the invasive populations may be far from their fitness optima in novel environments, are often in exponential phases of population growth and are frequently introduced multiple times from different source populations (Bossdorf 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), resulting in the substantial genetic variation upon which natural selection can act. Here, we marshal evidence from several linked studies along with the substantial new data to document an eco‐evolutionary feedback between population growth and genetic investment to an allelopathic secondary compound (sinigrin) in the aggressive invasive plant 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (Brassicaceae, Bieb. Cavara &amp; Grande, garlic mustard). This feedback is driven by interactions with soil microbial communities, which may act as important drivers of eco‐evolutionary feedbacks in plant systems more generally (terHorst and Zee,
