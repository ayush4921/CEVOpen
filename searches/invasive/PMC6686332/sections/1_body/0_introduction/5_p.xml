<p>Despite its significant impacts, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> stochastic growth rates (λ
 <sub>S</sub>) vary significantly among populations from rapid growth (λ

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Considering the temporal dynamics of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>'s allelochemistry and its relationships with 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> and native plant cover (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012a</xref>), we hypothesized that the variation in λ
 <sub>S</sub> (Evans 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) was likely related to the variation in allelochemistry and thus creates a feedback between evolution (changes in allelochemistry) and ecology (population growth rates). We propose that the gradients in sinigrin result from varying selection on sinigrin that is linked to the population dynamics of the invader; specifically, that selection favours high allelopathic concentrations in newly founded populations, but reduced investment to these chemicals over time as intraspecific competition intensifies and interspecific competition weakens. We assessed this by combining the reanalysed data from ten field sites included in the previous studies of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> demography (Evans 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) with new data on quantitative genetic variation in allelochemical production to assess the relationship of population growth and vital rates with changes in secondary chemistry. Additionally, we experimentally test whether the variation in the competitive environment alters selection pressures on sinigrin under controlled conditions, in order to confirm the proposed mechanism driving the previously observed patterns in sinigrin concentrations across the invaded range.
