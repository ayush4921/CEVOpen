<p>Introduction and subsequent spread of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> has generated a continental gradient of population ages (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Populations across this gradient showed decreasing glucosinolate production and reduced allelopathic effects on native trees and AMF communities as populations aged (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2011a</xref>). These changes could not be explained by founder effects or other stochastic evolutionary forces. Additionally, genetic variation in sinigrin was correlated with plant community composition, with heavy investment found in populations with a high frequency of heterospecific, but low frequency of conspecific, competitors (Lankau 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012a</xref>). Both soil microbial communities (including AMF) and native plant populations show signs of adapting to this invader (Lankau
