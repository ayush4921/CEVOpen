<p>We previously found that genetic variation in sinigrin among populations was negatively correlated with 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> relative abundance and age since invasion of the population, indicating that evolution of this trait responds to ecological interactions among plant competitors (Lankau

 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012a</xref>). Here, we show that (i) under experimental conditions, natural selection favours increased sinigrin levels for low‐density populations facing primarily interspecific competition, but favours decreased levels for high‐density populations facing primarily intraspecific competition, (ii) genetic investment in sinigrin in a population correlates strongly with population growth rates across ten natural populations and (iii) the distribution of quantitative genetic variation in sinigrin relative to that of neutral markers across these populations suggests that this variation reflects natural selection. Together, these results demonstrate an eco‐evolutionary feedback loop in which high mean sinigrin levels allow a population to grow, increasing density to the point where selection favours reduced sinigrin levels, which then dampen population growth rates and potentially lead to stable or declining population sizes. These results highlight the need to consider eco‐evolutionary feedback loops when understanding, predicting and managing population dynamics in environmentally consequential species.
