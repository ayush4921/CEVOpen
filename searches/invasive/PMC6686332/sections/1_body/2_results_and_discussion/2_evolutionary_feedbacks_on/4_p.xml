<p>Collectively, our results suggest the following causal pathway: sinigrin enables the establishment of new populations facing high inter‐, but low intraspecific, competition by enhancing survival of young plants during the first growing season (Figs 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), likely by reducing competition for water resources from mycorrhizal‐dependent competitors during spring and through the summer drought (Hale, Tonsor &amp; Kalisz 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). This yields higher plant densities by the end of the first summer which persist through seed production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and drive higher λ
 <sub>S</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), in spite of lower initial mean seedling densities in these populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Sinigrin's positive effects on survival and population density are thus restricted to the first growing season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Variations in population size and mortality from winter through the following spring and summer are driven by other factors.
