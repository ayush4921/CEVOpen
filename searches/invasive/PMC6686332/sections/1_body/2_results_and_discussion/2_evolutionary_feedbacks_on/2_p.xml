<p>Isolating selection as the culprit affecting population dynamics requires separating its effects from those of population density and other environmental factors that influence the population growth (Saccheri &amp; Hanski 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Given the selection pressures acting on seedling root sinigrin levels, we predicted that (i) sinigrin should positively covary with seedling survival at low conspecific densities, as the trait should increase interspecific competitive ability, and (ii) high‐sinigrin populations should be more sensitive to negative density dependence, since these genotypes should be poorer intraspecific competitors. Indeed, seedling survival in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was negatively density‐dependent in populations with high sinigrin production, but this effect diminished as sinigrin levels decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Tables S1 and S3). Note that both the slopes and the intercepts of the survival–density relationship decreased with declining sinigrin. High‐sinigrin populations reach seedling survival rates up to 100% at low densities, but survival declines rapidly as conspecific density increases. In contrast, low‐sinigrin populations have uniformly low seedling survival across densities. These results have important implications for population growth and regulation; high‐sinigrin populations should grow rapidly when first colonizing a new site or patch, but their high negative density dependence will strongly regulate the population as population densities climb.
