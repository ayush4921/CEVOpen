 <sup>2</sup> = 0·67,

 <sub>1,8</sub> = 19·19, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0·01). These early survival rates most strongly and positively related to sinigrin concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c; adj. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0·82, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,8</sub> = 40·89, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0·001). Relationships between sinigrin and mean survival rates of dormant seeds, seedlings and summer rosettes were also positive (Figs 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and S2). Germination, winter survival and fecundity were not directly related to sinigrin (see supplementary methods in Appendix S1). It is likely that sinigrin production is phenotypically plastic, and thus, the absolute levels in the field setting are likely different than those measured in our common garden. However, the tight correlation between common garden measurements and field demographic data suggests that phenotypic plasticity, while potentially important, is not so strong as to overwhelm the effect of constitutive differences in sinigrin investment among populations. This may be because phenotypic plasticity is relatively weak, or equally plausibly, plasticity is strong but does not vary much among populations, so that the relative ranking of populations in sinigrin levels is fairly consistent across environments.
