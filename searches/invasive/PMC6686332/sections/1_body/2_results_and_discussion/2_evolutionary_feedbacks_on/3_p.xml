<p>Consistent with our predictions, population genetic investment to sinigrin correlated negatively with 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> population density (plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>) in early life stages (i.e. seedlings), but became successively more positively correlated in later life stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Correlations of sinigrin with mean vital rates followed an opposite pattern with positive correlations in early life‐history stages and non‐significant negative correlations later (Figs 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, S1 and S2). Intense intraspecific competition among seedlings (self‐thinning) thus appears to select for low sinigrin genotypes with a low probability of surviving to adulthood. While a population consisting of high sinigrin genotypes ultimately grows faster and at higher adult densities (Figs 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and S3), persistent selection against sinigrin at the seedling stage may act to reduce population mean sinigrin levels over time, producing the pattern observed in Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (

 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> populations.
