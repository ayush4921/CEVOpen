<p>Importantly, the variation in genetic investment to sinigrin among populations was not correlated with neutral genetic distance (Mantel 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·055, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·370). Thus, the differences in sinigrin concentration among populations cannot be attributed solely to random genetic forces or independent invasion events. Neutral genetic distance was also uncorrelated with the variation in population growth rates (Mantel 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·155, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·216). Additionally, neither variance in sinigrin concentration, neutral genetic distance, nor population growth rates correlated with geographic distance (Mantel 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·237, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·105, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0·190, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·867, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0·006, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·417, respectively). Finally, differences in mean sinigrin concentrations among populations did correlate with the differences in population growth rates (Mantel 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·514, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·023), and this relationship remained when controlling for neutral genetic (partial Mantel 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·512, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·018) or geographic distance (partial Mantel 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·530, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0·008). Together, these results suggest that the relationship between genetic investment to sinigrin and population dynamics is not the result of a shared correlation between geographic location and broader genetic differences among the populations as a result of historical invasion patterns.
