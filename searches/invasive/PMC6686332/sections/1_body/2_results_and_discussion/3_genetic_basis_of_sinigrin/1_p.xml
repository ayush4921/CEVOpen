<p>Genetic variation in sinigrin was partitioned primarily among, rather than within, populations, with 
 <italic>c</italic>. 9% of total phenotypic variation attributable to population (Table S4) and 0% attributable to grandmaternal or selfed family. The resulting extreme estimate of 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> (1, 0·175–1, 95% CI) is not unexpected in a largely selfing species which likely establishes new populations from a small number of colonizing genotypes. Populations were also highly diverged in neutral markers, with an overall 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> of 0·688 (0·556–0·772, 95% CI). Nonetheless, each population contained multiple multilocus genotypes (MLGT) (ranging from 0·63 to 2·83 multilocus genotype in offspring per field maternal family across populations), so the low within‐population quantitative genetic variation is not solely due to sampling a single selfed lineage. This finding is at odds with our previous work suggesting a rapid evolution of sinigrin concentrations, which should require high levels of intrapopulation genetic variation on which to act (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). However, the levels of intrapopulation genetic variation are likely to vary across the introduced range. Previous work detected a positive relationship between population age and neutral genetic diversity, suggesting that over time populations accumulate genetic variation, likely via gene flow from other established populations. This suggests a scenario similar to one proposed by Kinnison &amp; Hairston (
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) in which populations are founded by a few individuals and there is a strong selection against low sinigrin genotypes as founders. This is consistent with our finding that young populations have consistently high mean sinigrin levels and low genetic diversity (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). As population density increases, selection may favour lower sinigrin levels due to the intense intraspecific competition among seedlings (Figs 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the population can only respond to this selection if genetic variation exists for the sinigrin trait. The same gene flow that brings additional neutral genetic variation to these older populations may also bring quantitative variation in the sinigrin trait, allowing the evolution of lower mean sinigrin levels. Depending on the strength of selection and speed of the evolutionary response, this may manifest as a positive relationships between population age and quantitative genetic variation in sinigrin, or the new alleles may be swept through the population fast enough to obscure this pattern. Unfortunately, our current population sampling is not well designed to test for patterns across the invasion age gradient or provide resolved estimates of genetic variation within individual populations.
