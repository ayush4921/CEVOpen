<p>As predicted, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass increased with increasing investment to root sinigrin when plants competed with interspecific competitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, this relationship changed when 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> individuals from the same populations were grown with conspecific competitors, resulting in a negative correlation between root sinigrin investment and rosette biomass (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the absence of competitors, the biomass–sinigrin correlation was intermediate and not significantly different from zero (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A linear mixed model confirmed that the slope of the root sinigrin–rosette biomass relationship was significantly more positive in the heterospecific vs. conspecific competitor treatment (competition treatment*sinigrin interaction, estimate = 92·97, lower 95% CI = 25·31, upper 95% CI = 160·11, Table S2). These results, along with the findings of previous studies, indicate that selection on root sinigrin levels in natural populations is likely to vary based on the density of the 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> population and the frequency of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> compared to other competing species in the community. This suggests the possibility of an eco‐evolutionary feedback, where at low densities/frequencies genotypes with high investment to sinigrin will have high fitness, but as densities increase, genotypes with lower investment to sinigrin will have a relative advantage.
