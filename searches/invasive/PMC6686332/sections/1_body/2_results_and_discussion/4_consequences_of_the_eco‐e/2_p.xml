<p>Many pressing challenges in applied ecology ultimately require that managers understand and accurately predict the dynamics of populations. Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks introduce additional complexity to these predictions, as these processes cause the 
 <italic>qualities</italic> of individuals to change in addition to their 
 <italic>numbers</italic>, and these changes in trait values directly feed back to alter the numerical dynamics of the population (Waples &amp; Hendry

However, eco‐evolutionary feedbacks may also allow for underappreciated stability of populations in the face of external pressures, potentially offering managers novel opportunities to affect population dynamics via evolutionarily guided interventions.
