<p>These and previous results from this system suggest a process in which spatial spread, local population dynamics and evolutionary change in a key trait feed back on one another to determine the temporal dynamics of the 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> invasion. Specifically, our data suggest that newly founded populations at the spreading invasion front will typically have low neutral genetic diversity (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), high mean sinigrin levels (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), low initial densities and consequently high population growth rates driven by high survival of seedling and rosette plants (Figs 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Over time, this high population growth will lead to an increase in seedling density and suppression of AMF and interspecific plant competitors (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), causing selection for reduced sinigrin concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), to which populations may respond following the introduction of genetic variation via gene flow. This evolutionary reduction in sinigrin concentration comes at the expense of per capita juvenile survival to adulthood and adult densities and consequently reduced or even negative population growth rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Ultimately, this may lead to a range‐wide pattern of continual spatial spread but stabilization, cyclical dynamics or even local extinction of established populations. The long‐term population dynamics of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> are uncertain. One possibility is that once 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> densities decline enough, selection will favour increased sinigrin levels allowing the population to rebound. However, the linear decline in glucosinolate production across a 
 <italic>c</italic>. 60‐year chronosequence provided no evidence for increasing sinigrin levels at the oldest sites (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="fec12685-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). While it is possible that such cyclical dynamics may occur over longer time periods, there may also be mechanisms, including low genetic variation in declining populations, to prevent this response. We urge caution against interpreting that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> populations should not be managed aggressively. Even if 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is ultimately self‐regulating, this species’ allelochemistry can cause a substantial harm to native communities if left unmanaged for decades, inducing detrimental legacies that can persist long after the invader has been removed (Lankau 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
