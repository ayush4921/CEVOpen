 <italic>strumarium</italic> usually competes with native plant species, and cause great loss in biodiversity. In order to detect the effects of the invader on biodiversity and evaluate its suitable habitats and ecological distribution, we investigated the abundance, relative abundance, diversity indices, and the number of the invasive and native plants in ten pairs of invaded and non-invaded quadrats in four locations in North and Northeast China (S1 Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228476.s001">S1 File</xref>). In this study, we want to explore the following questions. (1) Does 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> have significant effects on native plant species in paired comparison with diversity indices? (2) What is the paired correlation of different plant species both invaded and non-invaded quadrats in beta diversity? (3) How does 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invade and compete with native plant species in a paired comparison? (4) What is the relationship of Shannon Entropy with species diversity and evenness?
