 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> was a good competitor against natural flora in the studied network. The elevated Shannonâ€™s Diversity Index showed that plant networks in non-invaded areas were increased heterogeneously. 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion mechanism was diversified in the community at Huailai. Shannon Entropy recorded by 
 <italic>Setaria feberi</italic> found high evenness were found more diversified and stable in the community in its non-invaded quadrats at Zhangjiakou. Similar findings were recorded and found high diversity of 
 <italic>Seteria feberi</italic> and 
 <italic>Seteria viridis</italic> at Fushun. Higher estimates of global statistics 
 <italic>R</italic> showed the increased influence of decent species on the factors studied. The most affected location identified by

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion was Huailai followed by Zhangjiakou and Yangyuan. The mechanism of

 <italic>strumarium</italic> in our study recorded interspecific competition which suggested that this plant influenced negatively on native plant species. The degrees of

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion can affect species richness in invaded quadrat, resulting to reduce diversity indices significantly. There is dire need to develop integrated invasive plant management strategies to overcome

 <italic>strumarium</italic> invasion. This invasive plant species are spreading in cropped area of China, and may become future risk for growers. The study also encouraged researchers to explore the mechanism of protection, nutrient cycling, the role of pseudomonas bacteria, mechanism of resistance of invasive and native plants in future.
