<p>Remote sensing data indicate that the distribution of aquatic plants in the LTDB showed a gradually increasing trend from 1980 to 2014 and a sharp decrease in 2015, and the distribution remained at a low level until 2017 (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we found a decreasing trend for the biodiversity of aquatic plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), and the invasive plants 
 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic> and 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> directly reduced the plant biodiversity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies that found that biological invasion is an essential factor that driving the decrease in the biodiversity of plant communities (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Vilà et al., 2011</xref>). High biodiversity typically increases resistance to biological invasions, as high biodiversity affords greater resistance to invasion and limits the availability of vacant niches for new invaders (the “
 <italic>biotic resistance hypothesis</italic>”) (
