 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> (L.) R. M. King and H. Robinson (Asteraceae) is a noxious invasive perennial herb/subshrub in much of the worldâ€™s tropical and subtropical regions. It is native to North, Central, and South America, and was introduced to other tropical regions in the mid-19th century. 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> distributes sparsely in its native range. However, in invasive range, it usually forms dense monoculture

 </sup>. Different neighbor competitors indicate different competitive ability, interactions and adaptive ability with the invader, which might contribute to different distribution patterns of 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> between native and invasive ranges. To investigate this, we constructed a series of artificial garden communities, with 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> grown in conjunction with three dominant native species from its native range in Mexico or three dominant native species from its invasive range in China at two different levels of density. We hypothesized that the performance of 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> would be more suppressed when grown with high-density native plants from Mexico than when grown with them at lower density. We also hypothesized that this pattern would not be in evidence when 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> was grown with native species from China.
