<p id="Par16">The following four categories were defined: 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>odorata</italic> co-grown with species from Mexico, native species from Mexico, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>odorata</italic> co-grown with species from China, and native species from China. When 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>odorata</italic> was grown together with other species, differences in aboveground biomass and change in biomass among categories were determined by a linear mixed-effects model. Category, density and their interaction were treated as fixed factors. Species nested within category was treated as a random factor. A tukey HSD test was used to compare the differences of neighbor effects between high- and low-density communities. Duncan test was used to compare the differences of biomass among categories. We make a log transformation for aboveground biomass to suitable for the equality of error variances. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 18.0.
