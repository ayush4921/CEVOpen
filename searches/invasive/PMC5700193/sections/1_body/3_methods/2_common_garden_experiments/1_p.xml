<p id="Par14">Common gardens were constructed in Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (21°6′N, 101°15′E, 560 m above sea level), Yunnan Province, southwest China. Here the mean annual temperature is 21.7 °C, the mean temperature in July (the hottest month) is 25.3 °C, and that in January (the coolest month) is 15.6 °C. The average annual precipitation is 1557 mm with a dry period lasting from November to April. The soil is latosol, and total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents were 1.07 g/kg, 0.44 g/kg and 13.48 g/kg, respectively. Twenty-six 2 × 2 m artificial communities were constructed in early 2015 in each common garden, with each community 1 m apart from its neighbors. Three replicate common gardens were constructed. In March 2015, seeds of each species were sown separately into greenhouse seed beds. In the following June, similarly-sized seedlings were transplanted into artificial communities, consisting of monoculture of each species, either 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> + native range species or 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> + invasive range species, at either of two growing densities: high (36 individuals per plot) or low (8 individuals per plot) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These densities were set according to our field observation. One of each type of artificial community was constructed in each of the three common gardens. At the first month, a few seedlings died and we substituted them with seedlings of similar size immediately.
