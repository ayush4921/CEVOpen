<p id="Par13">In 2012, we collected seeds of 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> and three native species from China (
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Bidens biternata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Artemisia myriantha</italic>) in Xishuangbanna and Puer (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Seeds of three native species from Mexico (
 <italic>Tithonia tubiformis</italic>, 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Eupatorium ligustrinum</italic>) were collected in 2011 in Morelos and Veracruz (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). All these native species are common and dominant species in each site, and they can form dense stands in some patches. For each species, seeds were collected from more than 10 individuals growing at least 20 m apart, then mixed uniformly in paper bags. Seeds were germinated in a seedbed in April 2013 and transplanted to a common garden in June. In late 2013/early 2014, newly produced seeds of each species were collected from these next-generation plants in order to exclude maternal effect.
