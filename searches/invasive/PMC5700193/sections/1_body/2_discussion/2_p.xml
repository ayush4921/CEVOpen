 </sup>. The different coevolutionary histories of 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> and native species from Mexico and those from China might explain these findings. In Mexico, 
 <italic>Tithonia tubiformis</italic>, 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Eupatorium ligustrinum</italic> have longer coevolution history with 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic>, and have adapted its’ competitive strategies (growth rate, canopy shape, resource use, etc) accordingly. Further, as these three species are dominant species in Mexico, they may have evolved a stronger ability than 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> to cope with high-density conditions

 </sup>. Therefore, when grown in high density with 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic>, they may give a greater effect on 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic> than in low density condition.
