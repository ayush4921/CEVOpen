 <caption> Individual aboveground biomass of each species. Narrow bars indicate the mean value of individual aboveground biomass for each species when they grown together; four thicker bars in the center depict the mean value for four categories: C. odorara (co-grown with species from Mexico), native species from Mexico, C. odorara (co-grown with species from China), native species from China. *( P &lt; 0.05) indicates there are significant differences between high and low densities for each category; different letters indicate significant differences among categories ( P &lt; 0.05). Data was log(x) transformed before the analysis. T. t, C. l, E. l, A. i, B. b and A. m. is the abbreviations of Tithonia tubiformis, Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum, Eupatorium ligustrinum, Abutilon indicum, Bidens biternata, Artemisia Myrianth respectively. </caption>
