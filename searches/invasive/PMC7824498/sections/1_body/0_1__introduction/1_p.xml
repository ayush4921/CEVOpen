 <italic>Andropogon virginicus</italic> is an invasive weed that is widely distributed in the world. The weed is described as an herbaceous, perennial, C4 plant. 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> grows densely and up to 210 cm high [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Though this species has been sold in some regions such as Europe, it has been generally considered as not having economic value [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, the strong invasiveness of 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> is threatening biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In particular, this weed is problematically competing with endangered plant species like 
 <italic>Tetramolopium remyi</italic>, 
 <italic>Santalum freycinetianum</italic> var. 
 <italic>lanaiense</italic>, and 
 <italic>Schiedea nuttallii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due its dense and robust growth, 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> has also a negative impact on horticultural systems. For instance, it degrades the farmlands of Charmhaven apple in Australia [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> is dealing a blow economically to the forage and timber production in the southeastern USA because of high competition [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In soil, the weed also affects the cycle of nitrogen and water content leading to a decrease in the abundance of native species [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Considering that 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> is hardly to be controlled and causes numerous serious problems, this invasive weed has received little attention from scientists. Hitherto, no effective strategy has been proposed to control the invasiveness or obtain the benefits of 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> for human purposes. Therefore, an effective management of this natural resource is urgently needed, considering the potential of many other plants for therapeutic use, an attractive field of current research. Numerous plant species with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-skin aging, and anticancer properties have been globally known [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the biological activities related to antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase, anti-Î±-amylase, and cytotoxic properties of the invasive weed 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> have not been studied in detail.
