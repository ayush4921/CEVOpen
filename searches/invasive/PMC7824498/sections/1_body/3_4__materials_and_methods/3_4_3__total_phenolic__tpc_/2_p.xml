<p>The aluminum chloride colorimetric method represented by Tuyen et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] was applied to evaluate the TFC of extracts from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> with a slight alteration. In detail, the incubated reaction of 50 ÂµL of sample (in methanol) and an equal volume of 2% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> was carried out. The result was measured after 15 min at 430 nm and presented as milligrams of rutin equivalent per one gram of sample dry weight (mg RE/g DW).
