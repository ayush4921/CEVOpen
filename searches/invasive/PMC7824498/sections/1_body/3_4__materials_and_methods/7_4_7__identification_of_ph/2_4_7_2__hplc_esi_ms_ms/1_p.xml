<p>The phytochemicals of the ethyl acetate extract (E-Anvi) were identified based on the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. In particular, the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS system was equipped with LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United States) and an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. For analysis, sample (2 mg/mL) with a volume of 3.0 μL was injected into the XBridge® Shield RP18 (5 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) column, which maintained the temperature at 25 °C. The gradient model with 2 solvents was set up as follows: solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, solvent B was pure acetonitrile. The gradient program was: 95% A and 5% B over 0–2 min, then changed to 30% A and 70% B over 2–12 min, followed by 0% A and 100% B over 12–22 min. From 22–34 min, the mobile phase was subjected to the initial condition of 95% A and 5% B. The flow rate was 400 μL/min. For mass scanning, a negative FTMS mode with the range from 100 to 700 m/z was applied. The online database (Pubchem, National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda MD, USA) was used for reference to MS/MS spectra.</p>
