<p>In general, the invasive weed 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> shows the potential for antioxidant, anti-diabetes, anti-skin aging, and anti-CML properties via in vitro approaches. Therefore, in vivo tests and clinical trials should be further performed to develop novel natural-based drugs. Additionally, the screening results by GC-MS (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) indicate the most dominant compounds including palmitic acid, γ-sitosterol, phytol, and 8-methyl-1-undecene, flavonoids, and flavonoid glycosides, which might be the main contributors to the biological activities of this plant. Based on that, the research on confirmation of their role in biological and pharmaceutical properties of 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> should be conducted. Furthermore, the quantification of bioactive compounds in mixtures and extracts showing the potent activity should be also carried out. Palmitic acid has been reported as an inhibitor for anti-diabetes [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The quantification of dominant and specific bioactive compounds should use advantage analytical instruments such as LC-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS rather than the estimation of total flavonoids and phenols and quantification by only GC-MS. Future studies focusing on isolation, purification, and quantification of bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> should be performed to explore the medicinal and pharmaceutical potential of this invasive species. This could help farmers in developing countries to improve their income from the utilization of this harmful weed as a source of antioxidants, anti-skin aging, anti-diabetes, and anticancer.
