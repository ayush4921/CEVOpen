 <p>The extensive computation underlying our results was performed on the CamGrid cluster and an in-house cluster in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Cambridge, and we thank Mark Calleja for administering both these systems. Mark also administers the web server that hosts our Webidemics software. We also thank Stephen Parnell for helpful comments on an early draft, and Franco Neri for useful discussions.</p>
