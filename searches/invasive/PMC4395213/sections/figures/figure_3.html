 <caption> Effect of epidemiological and logistic factors on control. (a),(c),(e) and (g): Responses of median epidemic impact (κ E ) to cull radius ( L) for different values of probability of detection, p (a), the average cryptic period, 1/ σ (c), the interval between successive surveys, T s (e) and the notice period before culling, T c (g). (b), (d), (f) and (h): How the performance of the optimum control strategy is affected by changes in p (b), 1/ σ (d), T s (f) and T c (h). Insets show the response of the optimum cull radius L. Default parameter values were used for all parameters except that being scanned over: these are marked with black dots on the x-axis in (b), (d), (f) and (h). </caption>
