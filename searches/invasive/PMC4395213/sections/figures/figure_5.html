 <caption> The effect of thick-tailed dispersal. (a) Response of the epidemic impact κ E to the cull radius L with Cauchy dispersal and low infection rate ( β = 0.007d -1). (b) Response of median κ E to L for a number of values of β. Note how quickly the performance of control degrades with only relatively small increases to β. (c) Full response of κ E to L when β = 0.01d -1. Note the extreme variability at even the optimal radius (e.g. L = 300m, inset C), and the significant probability of a large epidemic at this cull radius, even though the median κ E is optimised. (d) Risk of failure for β = 0.01d -1: it is impossible to select a range of radii for which p(Risk &lt; Ω) &lt; 0.1 for Ω = 20% ( cf. Fig 2b). </caption>
