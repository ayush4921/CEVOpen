 <caption> Optimal control when there is uncertainty. (a) Epidemic impact κ E (total number of hosts lost to disease or control) as a function of the cull radius, L. The optimum value of L depends on the percentile of the distribution of κ E that is being optimised (e.g. the optimum L would be 159m if the objective were to minimise median κ E , whereas it would be 194m if minimising κ E on the 95 th percentile). The shape of the distribution of κ E varies with L (insets A to F; distributions renormalized to the same height by scaling all distributions relative to the largest value in each). (b) Risk of failure. Given a notion of “acceptable risk” (i.e. a value of Ω, the threshold κ E as a percentage of the total population), the probability of failing to achieve κ E &lt; Ω is shown. Dotted line marks radii with &lt; 10% risk of failure for Ω = 20% (range 122m &lt; L &lt; 329m). (c) Effect of the initial level of infection, E 0, on the response of median κ E to L (dots show minimum median κ E for each E 0). (d) and (e) Effect of the scale of dispersal ( α) and rate of infection ( β) on the optimal L (shown in d) and median κ E at optimal L to optimise median κ E (shown in e). The white dots on (d) and (e) indicate the default values of α and β; the white squares show the values of α and β fitted by Cook et al. [ 24] (and used in the studies of Parnell et al. [ 11, 12]) cf. S3 Text. </caption>
