 <caption> Local vs. global control. (a) Epidemic time (τ E ); i.e. the time for the epidemic to be controlled, as a function of the cull radius L. The black dots on the x-axis mark L = 159m, the cull radius at which the median epidemic impact (κ E ) is minimised, and L = 63m, the radius at which the median epidemic time (τ E ) is maximised. (b) Normalised epidemic cost ( ψ E = ​​(1-η)  κ ^ E  + η  τ ^ E ) for a number of values of the weighting factor, η. κ ^ E and τ ^ E are the epidemic impact and epidemic time normalised according to their maximum values over all cull radii considered, whereas η controls the relative weighting given to potential global impacts of the epidemic outside the area of immediate interest. The inset shows the value of L at which the minimum Ψ E is obtained as a function of η. As global impacts are increasingly weighted ( η → 1), the optimum cull radius increases, despite the increased number of local removals that would then result. (c) Area under the disease progress curve ( A E ) as a function of cull radius, L. The inset shows the logarithm of A E as L is changed. (d) The probability of escape, p E , as function of the cull radius, L, for different values of the connectivity parameter λ. (e) Normalised epidemic cost ( ζ E =  ​ ​ (1- δ )  κ ^ E  +  δ   p ^ E ) in which the probability of escape rather than the time until eradication is included, for a number of values of the weighting factor, δ, and for fixed connectivity parameter λ = 10 -5 d -1. The inset shows the value of L at which the optimum ζ E is obtained for 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1. (f) Robustness to the value of λ. The inset to panel (e) is repeated for a number of values of λ; as potential global impacts are increasingly weighted ( δ → 1), the optimal cull radius again becomes larger, for each value of λ we consider. </caption>
