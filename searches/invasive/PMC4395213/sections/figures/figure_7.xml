  <p>(a) Successful control, with fewer than 10% of hosts removed before the pathogen was eradicated after 790 days. (b) A larger and more long-lasting epidemic, with ~90% removal before eradication at 4300 days. Parameters controlling pathogen epidemiology and the control intervention were the same for both runs (default values;

(c) Histograms summarising the final state in an ensemble of 500 runs (of which the individual simulation runs shown in (a) and (b) were part); note the variability in the number of healthy hosts unaffected by disease or control by the time of eradication.
