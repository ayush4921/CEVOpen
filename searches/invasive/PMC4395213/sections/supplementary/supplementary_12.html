 <caption> Optimal control and the effect of uncertainty for HLB. (a) Epidemic impact κ E (total number of hosts lost to disease or control) as a function of the cull radius, L. This replicates Fig 2a in the main text for the HLB system. (b) Risk of failure. Given a notion of “acceptable risk” (i.e. a value of Ω, the threshold κ E as a percentage of the total population), the probability of failing to achieve κ E &lt; Ω is shown. Dotted line marks radii with &lt; 10% risk of failure for Ω = 40% (range 32m &lt; L &lt; 90m). This is equivalent to Fig 2b in the main text for the HLB system rather than citrus canker.
