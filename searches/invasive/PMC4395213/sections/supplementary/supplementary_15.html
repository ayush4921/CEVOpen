 <caption> Optimal control and the effect of uncertainty using the parameterisation of Cook et al. [ 24]. (a) Epidemic impact κ E (total number of hosts lost to disease or control) as a function of the cull radius, L. This replicates Fig 2a in the main text using the parameterisation originally developed by Cook et al. [ 24] and used in the subsequent analyses by Parnell et al. [ 11, 12]. (b) Risk of failure. Given a notion of “acceptable risk” (i.e. a value of Ω, the threshold κ E as a percentage of the total population), the probability of failing to achieve κ E &lt; Ω is shown. Dotted line marks radii with &lt; 10% risk of failure for Ω = 50% (range 287m &lt; L &lt; 549m). This is equivalent to Fig 2b in the main text but using the parameterisation originally developed by Cook et al. [ 24] and used in the subsequent analyses by Parnell et al. [ 11, 12].
