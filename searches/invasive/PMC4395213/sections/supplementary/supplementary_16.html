 <caption> Effect of epidemiological and logistic factors on control using the parameterisation of Cook et al. [ 24]. (a),(c),(e) and (g): Responses of median epidemic impact (κ E ) to cull radius ( L) for different values of probability of detection, p (a), the average cryptic period, 1/σ (c), the interval between successive surveys, T s (e) and the notice period before culling, T c (g). (b), (d), (f) and (h): How the performance of the optimum control strategy is affected by changes in p (b), (d), T s (f) and T c (h). Insets show the response of the optimum cull radius L. The parameter values fitted by Cook et al. [ 24] ( cf. S4 Fig) were used for all parameters except that being scanned over: these are marked with black dots on the x-axis in (b), (d), (f) and (h). This is equivalent to Fig 3 in the main text but using the parameterisation originally developed by Cook et al. [ 24] and used in the subsequent analyses by Parnell et al. [ 11, 12]. (TIF) </caption>
