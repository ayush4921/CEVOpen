<p>In explaining and discussing the practical use of this model with stakeholders, including policy makers, regulators and growers, it became apparent that providing a user-friendly version of the model for presentation was important to allow the inferences to be understood and visualised by non-specialists. We therefore developed an online interface to the model, allowing the results of either a single run or a small ensemble of runs to be explored, and also allowing for the alteration of parameters controlling disease spread and/or control. This Webidemics front-end runs in commonly-used web browsers via the freely-available Adobe Flash Player plug-in. It is an interface to a ‘back-end’ program that runs on a central web server; this is written in C, and is the component that actually performs the model simulations presented in this paper. Implementation of the back-end via Gillespie’s algorithm [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] allows the extensive replication (many millions of independent runs) that underlies the analytical results we present. It also allows the user of the front-end to obtain results from an entire ensemble of hundreds of replicate epidemics within a reasonable time. Parameters and results are passed between the front- and back-ends via a Perl CGI (“Common Gateway Interface”) wrapper program hosted on the web server.
