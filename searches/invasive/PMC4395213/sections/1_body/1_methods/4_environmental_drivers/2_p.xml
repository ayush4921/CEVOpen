<p>Markov chains offer a parsimonious approximation to environmental dynamics in a number of contexts [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and a similar two-state formalism has previously been used to model infection rates of plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An advantage of a Markov chain model is that it simply requires information on threshold conditions, for example temperature and humidity, that favour or inhibit infection, and these are likely to be known for many plant pathogens or can at least be quantified relatively easily. Although we acknowledge more extensive information concerning these drivers is in fact already well-known for citrus canker [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], in general this obviates the need to derive costly functional forms for relationships between propagule production and environmental driving variables. By default, however, in illustrating the use of the model we restrict our attention to the case in which
