  <p>The distribution of epidemic impact can be very sensitive to small changes in cull radius, particularly if the radius is decreased from the optimal value (compare distributions C and B with distributions D and E).</p>

  <p>If the objective is to minimise some other metric, e.g. the 95% percentile of the epidemic impact, κ
   <sub>
    <italic>E</italic>
   </sub>, thereby taking more explicit account of uncertainty, the optimum radius changes. For example, the optimum radius becomes 194m when optimising over the 95
   <sup>th</sup> percentile of κ
   <sub>
    <italic>E</italic>
   </sub>, and for this radius there are 149 removals on the 50
   <sup>th</sup> percentile and 271 removals on the 95
   <sup>th</sup> percentile (
   <italic>cf</italic>. 132 removals on the 50
   <sup>th</sup> percentile and 309 on the 95
   <sup>th</sup> percentile using the cull radius 159m obtained by optimising over the median value of κ
   <sub>
    <italic>E</italic>
