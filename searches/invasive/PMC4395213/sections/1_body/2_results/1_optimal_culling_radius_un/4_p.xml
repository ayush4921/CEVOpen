<p>In practice optimisation of any control strategy would be driven by parameters estimated for pathogen spread and epidemiology, and these would be subject to error and/or uncertainty. This tends to make the sensitivity of epidemic impact (κ

 </sub>) to changes in cull radius identified in i) (above) unworkable, since an optimum strategy (distribution D) that skirts so close to failure (distribution C or more dramatically B) would almost certainly be difficult to recommend in practice. A pragmatic choice would therefore be to focus on a higher percentile of the distribution of κ

  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub> when prescribing the control, with the particular percentile selected corresponding to the risk-aversion of the decision-maker. This approach can be formalised, by explicitly considering a risk of failure that is deemed to be acceptable (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). In particular, given a notion of an acceptable level of risk (e.g. at most a 10% chance of κ

  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub> corresponding to the loss of more than Ω = 20% of hosts) a range of acceptable cull radii can readily be determined. A workable strategy would then be to select a cull radius near the centre of this range. Such a combination of criteria would lead to a prescribed cull radius of around 225m here (for the default parameters, p(Failure at risk = 20%) &lt; 0.1 for 122m &lt; 
 <italic>L</italic> &lt; 329m).
