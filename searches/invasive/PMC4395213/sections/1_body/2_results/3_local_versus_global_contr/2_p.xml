<p>A possible proxy for the risk to the area outside the region of immediate interest is the time taken to eradicate the local epidemic (“epidemic time”, τ
 <sub>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub>), since this sets the duration of possible export of inoculum (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). Surprisingly the epidemic time (τ
 <sub>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub>) initially increases as the cull radius (
 <italic>L</italic>) increases, at least for 
 <italic>L</italic> below the optimum that minimises the local epidemic impact. While such controls fail to keep up with the region of cryptic infection surrounding detected hosts and so do not effectively control the epidemic, a proportion of infected plants is detected and removed on each round of surveying, and this causes the epidemic to spread more slowly (because infected hosts are being removed and there are fewer susceptible hosts to infect). Slower spread then allows the pathogen to persist for longer, since it takes more time for the infection and eventual removal of hosts. For larger control radii, however, we note the epidemic time can be very small; the pathogen is eradicated very quickly, generally within one or two rounds of detection and control.
