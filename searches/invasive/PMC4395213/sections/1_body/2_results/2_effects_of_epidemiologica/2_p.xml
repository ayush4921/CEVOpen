<p>We illustrate typical decisions that must be made by policy-makers by focusing on the effect on control performance of a selection of four parameters that may be changed during the course of an eradication scheme (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These are the average cryptic period, (1/
 <italic>σ</italic>), which may vary depending upon environmental conditions; the probability of detecting a symptomatic host (
 <italic>p</italic>), which may vary depending on the experience of the teams of observers; and the interval between successive surveys (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>) and the delay period before culling actually occurs (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>), which are both controlled by the availability of resources. As 1/
 <italic>σ</italic>, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> or 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> increase, or as 
 <italic>p</italic> decreases, effective control becomes more challenging, and so the optimal cull radius and epidemic impact at this radius both increase. Particularly striking is that extreme changes to the probability of detection and average cryptic period are required for performance to degrade significantly. The influence of changes to either of these is mitigated by averaging over a large number of hosts: only a single host must become detectable or be detected for control to be initiated locally, and the resulting cull then affects many nearby hosts simultaneously. However, because the survey interval and the notice period both affect all hosts equally, more modest changes affect the success of control to a greater extent.
