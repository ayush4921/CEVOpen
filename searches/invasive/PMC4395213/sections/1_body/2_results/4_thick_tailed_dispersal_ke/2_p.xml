<p>It is well known that exponential dispersal leads to epidemics characterised by wavelike spread, whereas thick-tailed dispersal (exemplified here by the Cauchy kernel) implies continual production of distant secondary foci with no well-defined epidemic front [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The striking difference in epidemic pattern suggests that effective control via local removal of hosts should be more difficult when there is Cauchy dispersal. For purposes of comparison, we therefore test the effect of fat-tailed dispersal on our analyses
