<p>At low infection rates, effective control remains possible even with thick-tailed dispersal. For the Cauchy kernel with scale parameter 
 <italic>α</italic> = 20m and infection rate 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.007d
 <sup>-1</sup>, good control can be achieved using a cull radius 
 <italic>L</italic> = 100m (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>), although the long tail of the epidemic impact distribution (Inset B) reveals large epidemics are possible even when controlling optimally. However, successful control requires a small infection rate, and only moderate increases to the infection rate 
 <italic>β</italic> greatly increase both the minimum median epidemic impact κ
 <sub>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub> and the cull radius, 
 <italic>L</italic>, at which this optimum κ
 <sub>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub> is achieved (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). What responses of the median κ
 <sub>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub> to 
 <italic>L</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic> do not reveal, however, is how quickly the chance of a large epidemic increases as the infection rate goes up. For an infection rate 
 <italic>β</italic> of only 0.01d
 <sup>-1</sup> there is a significant risk of failure of control, as indicated by the extremely variable distribution of epidemic impact for all control radii, even near the optimum cull radius 
 <italic>L</italic> ~ 300m (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>). Indeed it is impossible to select a range of radii that leads to at most a 10% chance of losing less than Ω = 20% of hosts for this value of 
 <italic>β</italic> (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref> and contrast with 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>), reiterating the relative difficulty of control when there is fat-tailed dispersal. We also note that fat-tailed dispersal would be expected to increase the degree of connectivity between the local and non-local populations of host plants, 
 <italic>λ</italic>, were we to repeat the analysis associated with 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> using such a dispersal kernel. Taken together these observations suggest that successful control by culling may be difficult for plant pathogens that spread via windborne propagules which are tolerant to desiccation. These include powdery mildews and rust pathogens. Effective control of these pathogens is likely to require large local cull radius and could be expected to have relatively high risks of failure.
