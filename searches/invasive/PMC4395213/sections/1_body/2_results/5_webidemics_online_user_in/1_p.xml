 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>) or summarises an entire ensemble of replicate simulations performed using identical parameters (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). When results from a single run are displayed, an animation of disease progress is shown, with hosts colour coded by epidemiological type (i.e. S, E, C or D, I, R), and with any hosts set to be inaccessible for detection denoted by a black cross. Any hosts in compartment R that were removed by disease-induced death are distinguished from those culled by control. The same colour coding is used for the graph showing the number of hosts in each class.
