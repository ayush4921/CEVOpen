<p>Epidemiological, climatic and/or control parameters may be set on either screen, using the three buttons at the bottom right: clicking any of these buttons reveals a pop-up panel allowing parameter values to be set (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c</xref>). When parameters are altered, the displayed results are not updated until a call is made to the back-end to actually run new simulation(s) with the new parameters (this is done by clicking the “Run New Simulation”/“Run New Ensemble” button). Changes to parameters that have not yet been followed by a call to the back-end and so are not reflected in the current results are indicated by a colour change of the button from grey to red. Further details of the user-interface are available via its help facility, which includes a full description showing how to use model in practice, designed for first time users.
