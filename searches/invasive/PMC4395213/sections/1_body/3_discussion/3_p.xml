<p>We investigated how the nature of the optimum control strategy is conditioned on a selection of parameters controlling the host-pathogen interaction and the logistics of control. Our results show how success of control depends strongly on the rate and spatial scale of pathogen spread (Fig 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). We also showed how factors that act differently at the level of the individual host can have less severe effects as they are altered than those that affect all individuals equally, as a consequence of the former being averaged over the entire population (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Even moderate rates of spread due to higher infection rates (Î²) lead to too many new disease foci when there is fat-tailed dispersal, and, in turn, this means that control is often unsuccessful, with significant risk of large epidemic impacts. This high risk of failure remains hidden if only the median epidemic impact is considered (
