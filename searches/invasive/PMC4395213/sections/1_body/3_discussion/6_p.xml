<p>Work targeting animal epidemics suggests optimal control strategies depend strongly on how local and global impacts are balanced [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We examined this by introducing two variants of the “epidemic cost”, that account for possible infections outside the area of interest via the proxies of local time to eradication or the probability of pathogen escape, but that are flexible enough to allow for different weightings of local vs. global priorities. Strategies giving a high weighting to global performance required extensive controls at the local level (Fig

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). This is because the potential for spread of disease to create a new focus of infection elsewhere is judged to be so harmful that it becomes optimal to use a rather draconian policy in the region under active control, even at the cost of many local removals.
