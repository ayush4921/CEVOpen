<p>While we motivate our analyses using citrus canker, our work can readily be placed in a broader context. The recent emergence of citrus greening or huanglongbing (HLB, caused by 
 <italic>Candidatus Liberibacter</italic> spp. bacteria), potentially an even more devastating disease [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], puts control of citrus pathogens firmly back on the scientific and political agenda in the United States. HLB is vectored by psyllids, and although it would be reasonable to assume dispersal of infective vectors declines monotonically with distance from infected plants, it might be expected that changes in psyllid populations over time would add extra complexity to disease dynamics. However, recent work has shown how our underlying model focusing only on disease status and representing disease spread via a time-independent and spatially-isotropic dispersal kernel can be applied to this pathosystem with no change to the fundamental model structure [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We recreated a selection of our results for the control of HLB in a citrus grove in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>. We emphasise that using this type of model for HLB means that the activity and population dynamics of the psyllid population are not tracked explicitly, but instead that these factors are included in the dispersal and infection rate parameters of the model. The results concerning principles for control were qualitatively unchanged, although of course the exact detail of the optimum radius and epidemic impact were different reflecting a different pathogen and host topology.
