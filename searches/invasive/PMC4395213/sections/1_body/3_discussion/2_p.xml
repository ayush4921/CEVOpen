<p>Our key result is to verify that it is indeed possible to optimise control via targeted host removal by matching the “intrinsic scale of the epidemic” [

 </sub> (i.e. the total number of hosts lost to disease or control before the pathogen is eradicated). However, given particular parameters controlling disease spread and the logistics of control, we have shown how the cull radius that would be selected depends on the percentile of the epidemic impact distribution that is to be optimised over, and therefore on the risk-aversion of the decision-maker. Since costs of disease are typically greater than costs of detection and control, under-control can be more harmful than over-control [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is reflected in the sharp increase in epidemic impact, with even small decreases in the cull radius below the optimum (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), a pattern that is largely unresponsive to the values of the parameters (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The pattern also holds for other baseline sets of parameters (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>). We have also confirmed the intuition that control should start quickly to be successful; if even a small proportion of hosts is infected when intervention commences, a large epidemic impact appears unavoidable, particularly if the initial infections are not spatially-clustered (
