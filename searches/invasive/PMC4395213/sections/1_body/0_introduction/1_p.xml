<p>Impacts of invading pathogens can be extremely severe, and so understanding how controls can be optimised is imperative [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the obvious food security and economic implications of epidemics in crops [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Increased global trade and travel mean the risk of introduction of exotic pathogens can only reasonably be expected to increase [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which in turn indicates control of invasive plant disease is likely to remain important for many years to come.
