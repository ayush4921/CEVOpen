<p id="Par5">Standard AA conditions proposed for several crop seeds varies between 41 and 43 °C for 48 to 72 h [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, even within a species, seed longevity in AA tests may depend on several factors such as moisture content, RH, oxygen partial pressure and temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Higher temperatures and high RH are known to boost seed viability loss [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but may have different effects in different species. Artificially aged seeds of rice lose their viability between 25 to 45 days at 40 °C and 80% of RH but just in 6 days at 45 °C and 100% RH, whereas 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds lose their viability within 3 days at 37 °C at 83% RH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Artificially aging protocols have been mainly designed for grain, vegetable, forage, and forestry crops [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] such as rice, wheat, soybean and tomato, leaving aside other species with ecological interest that could offer new insights into seed longevity regulation and over which an optimized AA test could be beneficial to assess ecological dynamics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Artificial aging tests may be useful to test seed lot status and predict when the seeds may reach the viability threshold that may require further actions to conserve the species’ germplasm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], thus improving genebanks’ management for ex situ germplasm conservation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Non-crop species’ germplasm conservation may be important for maintaining biodiversity’s option value (i.e. the value of potential future benefits that are unknown today, such as finding new pharmacologically-beneficial substances), in spite of the difficulties of defining this concept [
