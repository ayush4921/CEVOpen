<p id="Par9">The amount of water vapor in the aging atmosphere determined differences in seed survival curves. The superior RH obtained in the 82-87% RH experiment (using distilled water) determined an accelerated viability loss in contrast with the 71–76% RH experiment (using a saturated salt solution, NaCl) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This difference was observed under 55 °C but not at 43 °C, where no differences in the seed survival curve were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When contrasting treatments at 55 °C, high RH (87%) lead to a complete viability loss after two aging days, whereas a lower humidity (71%) triggered a progressive viability loss that leave 20% viable seeds after five aging days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Apart from a different seed survival curve, the imbibed seeds in low RH conditions (71%) at 55 °C were found with a hardened seed coat at all aging times, hindering seed piercing for viability analysis.
