<p>A serious threat to the meadow habitats, especially on areas where mowing stopped, are 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> Aiton. These species cause a drastic decrease in diversity of meadow phytocoenoses, but as species of melliferous properties, they have sprung up in some localities after the seeding by beekeepers or as ornamental plants in home gardens. Their presence can be seen as positive in the period of flowering, i.e., especially at the end of the growing season (August/September in Central Europe) when they produce a large amount of pollen and nectar. However, this positive effect refers mainly to honeybees, which arrive in such areas even from remote locations (e.g., a few kilometers).
