<p>Four models projected into the future rendered suitability maps with similar general trends but different magnitudes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182793.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Irrespective of the model, the native range is the most stable area that changes very little between the future projections and the current climatic conditions. Actually, only in the Anatolian Plateau some southward migrations may be observed and a small-scale contraction of the range within the Caucasus and the Western Anatolian Plateau that corresponds to the upward vertical shift associated with climate warming. Concerning the non-native range, there are larger differences between present and future distributions, as well as among future models. The major range shift differences are observed in the Central European Mountains (i.e., the Carpathians, the Sudetes and the Eastern Alps). In these areas, suitable habitats will decrease and become restricted to the higher altitudes. In scenarios assuming the greater increase of radiative forcing, this change will be more pronounced. The reverse trend is observed in the southern Europe where particular areas are designated as more suitable in scenarios with a higher increase of radiative forcing and include mountain ranges such as the Dinaric Alps, the Maritime Alps, the Apennines, the Eastern Pyrenees, and the ranges in the Iberian Peninsula. Considering non-native ranges, only the Pindus Mts and the Crimean Mts have similar suitable areas in the current and future climates with a slight increase of suitability associated with warmer conditions. In the future scenarios, noticeable new potential areas are indicated in the Rhodopes, the Rila Mts, the Pirin Mts, and the Balkans that in the current climate were supported only averagely. Also a relatively large area in the southern part of the Scandinavian Mts shows high climatic suitability but this region was excluded from the modelling in the current time (as described in the methods).
