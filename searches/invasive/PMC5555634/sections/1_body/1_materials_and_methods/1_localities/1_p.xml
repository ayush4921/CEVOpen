<p>The occurrence data were obtained from personal observations, herbarium specimens, and the literature. The georeferencing process followed that reported by [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the coordinates were assigned as precisely as possible to the location of the collection place.
