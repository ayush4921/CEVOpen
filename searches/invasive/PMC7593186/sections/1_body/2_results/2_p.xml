<p>Ground cover of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> was 100% in all invaded subplots. Reference plots did not contain 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> and were sparsely vegetated except for a single reference plot at Antietam, where dense vegetation consisted of non‐native shrubs (
 <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic>) and early successional plant species (
 <italic>Asimina triloba</italic> and 
 <italic>Verbesina alternifolia</italic>). Understory vertical vegetative structure was minimal in both invaded and reference plots, with mean plant cover of 2.25% between 0.5 and 2.0 m; however, the aforementioned reference plot at Antietam exhibited 35.63% vertical vegetative cover. 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> plots showed mean vertical vegetative cover of 0.27% while reference plots contained mean 4.23% cover. Across all plots, we collected a total of 15,453 invertebrates in 19 orders, including three arachnid groups: mites (Acari), spiders (Araneae), and harvestmen (Opiliones). The total number of invertebrates, including adult and juvenile spiders, was greater in plots within 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> patches (
 <italic>G

 </italic> = 44.007; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), with 12,879 individuals collected as compared to 2,574 collected in corresponding reference plots (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36752-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Invaded and reference plots at Antietam contained mean ± 
 <italic>SE</italic> 360.5 ± 173.0 invertebrates and plots at Monocacy contained 360.9 ± 87.7 invertebrates, whereas Great Falls included 604.9 ± 153.5 individuals. The abundance of prey palatable to forest spiders, including beetles, springtails, flies, and herbivorous true bugs, was similarly greater in invaded patches (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36752-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Most taxa, when assessed individually, also exhibited significant positive relationships with the presence of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>. This was often paired with a significant interaction term between 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> and individual park (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36752-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Flies were more abundant in 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>, with a total of 9,354 flies collected in invaded plots while 1,682 were found in reference plots (
 <italic>G
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 33.034; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Herbivorous true bugs displayed a similar relationship, with 804 and 287 individuals collected in invaded and reference plots, respectively (
 <italic>G
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 25.188; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Beetles, excluding the weevils, were not correlated with the presence of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> (
 <italic>G
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.335; 
 <italic>p</italic> = .5626). We also found significant differences in community composition between 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> plots and their paired reference plots (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,26</sub> = 5.970; 
 <italic>p</italic> = .00005) and among parks (
