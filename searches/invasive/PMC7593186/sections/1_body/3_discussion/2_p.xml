<p>Likely through physical changes to near‐ground structural complexity, microclimate, and leaf litter, 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> directly and indirectly increased the abundance of nearly all understory invertebrate groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36752-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The invasion of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> in these forested habitats directly resulted in greater local densities of insect taxa and indirectly benefited the spider community, leading to more abundant and more species‐rich spider communities. We did not detect the direct effects of understory vegetative structure on either spiders or the other components of the invertebrate community; however, our measure of structure included vegetation between 0.5 and 2.0 m from the ground. Particularly during the sampling period in our study area, 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> provides dense, near‐ground structure below 0.5 m. Through this near‐ground structure, we found that 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> directly benefited taxa that feed, reproduce, or develop within the detrital layer. For example, many of the dipteran species we collected belonged to taxa from detrital food webs, such as many within the Mycetophilidae. These results are similar to past research on the benefit of invasive plant species specifically to detrital communities (McCary et al.,
