<p>We conducted vacuum sampling within each individual square plot in mid‐July 2017. We vacuumed insects and arachnids between 0.5 and 2.0 m above the ground surface in order to avoid forest floor and fossorial taxa. We used a commercially available leaf blower and vacuum (Black+Decker LSWV36) with a 2‐gallon paint strainer bag affixed to the intake tube to vacuum vegetative surfaces, spider webs, and other spaces between vegetation in each plot. We vacuumed throughout the entirety of each 36 m
 <sup>2</sup> plot for a standardized 7 min. After sampling, we euthanized collected arthropods using ethyl acetate, removed vegetative debris, and placed invertebrates in 70% ethyl alcohol. We identified insects to order using Triplehorn and Johnson (

However, certain orders were further subdivided if palatability to forest spiders greatly differed within groups: Weevils (Curculionidae) were classified separately from other Coleoptera, predatory assassin bugs (Reduviidae) and damsel bugs (Nabidae) were separated from herbivorous Hemiptera, ants (Formicidae) were considered distinct from the other Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera were subdivided into caterpillars and adults. Spiders were identified to genus or species when possible using Ubick, Paquin, Cushing, and Roth (
