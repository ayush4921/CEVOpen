<p>Our study area included deciduous forests of U.S. National Park Service lands located in Washington, Frederick, and Montgomery Counties, Maryland: Antietam National Battlefield (Antietam), Monocacy National Battlefield (Monocacy), and portions of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park (Great Falls). Forests were similar in that they contained multiple invasive plant species and scant understory vegetation, in part due to dense white‐tailed deer (
 <italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>) populations (46–66 deer/km
 <sup>2</sup>) (U.S. National Park Service, unpubl. data). Dominant trees included native 
 <italic>Acer</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Carya</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Fagus grandifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Liriodendron tulipifera</italic> while the understory consisted of mostly 
 <italic>Lindera benzoin</italic>, 
 <italic>Asimina triloba</italic>, and exotic plants such as 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic>.
