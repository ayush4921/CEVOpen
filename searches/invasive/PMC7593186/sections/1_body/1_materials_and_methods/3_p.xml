<p>To study invertebrate community response to 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>, we used a paired plot design across our study area. Within each of the three parks, we opportunistically located 16 patches of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> at least 10 m by 10 m in size, and at least 10 m away from the forest edge. Sites were selected that contained greater than or equal to 80% visual ground cover of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>. We established the center of a 6 m by 6 m square plot at the approximate center of the patch. Paired with each 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> plot, we also established a reference plot of the same size, without 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>. We used random integers to select an azimuth from which to establish reference plots, 20 m from the edge of the 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> patch, at least 10 m from the forest edge, and within the same vegetation community type. Within individual square plots for both invaded and reference habitats, we estimated ground cover of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> in four 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> square subplots, 1 m away from the plot center in the four cardinal directions, and used the mean ground cover estimate for each plot. We also measured understory vegetative structure using a 2.0 m tall profile board placed in the center of the plot. We estimated the percentage of the board that was obscured by vegetation between 0.5 and 2.0 m in height and used the mean of the four values for each plot in analyses.
