<p>Our study seeks to (a) understand the role of plant and soil biota origin for the invasion success of 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> and (b) identify whether plant–soil feedbacks differ in the native versus. the exotic range. Here, we test for the influence of soil biota from the native and exotic range on native and exotic populations of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> in a reciprocal transplant experiment. We compared the effects of soil‐borne microorganisms from the native (Germany) and the exotic range (New Zealand) each on native and exotic plant origins. To test whether pathogenic or mycorrhizal fungi play a specific role in the invasion of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic>, we distinguished between the effects of soil fungi and bacteria by adding differentially selective biocides. We hypothesized that (a) native and exotic 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> populations provide evidence for genotypic divergence with exotic populations showing a higher overall plant performance in consequence of a release from natural enemies and a redistribution of resources. Furthermore, we assume that (b) exotic soil biota communities favor plant growth because of a more positive net effect of soil microorganisms from the exotic range compared with soil biota from the native range. As a result, we expect (c) plant–soil feedbacks to differ between ranges as revealed by significant interactions between plant origin and soil biota origin, expressing home‐away effects and thereby indicating the result of adaptive processes.
