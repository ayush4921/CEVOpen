<p>One of the main assumptions addressing the role of soil‐borne microorganisms in plant invasions is that the net effect of soil biota on native plant species is negative, whereas its effect on exotic species is positive or neutral, thereby providing an advantage to the colonizer (Callaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Klironomos, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). These differences might be ascribed to a release from belowground enemies during plant establishment in a new distribution area (enemy release hypothesis, ERH) and have been tested with a focus on aboveground enemies such as leaf and seed herbivores (Adams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Joshi &amp; Vrieling, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). An alternative explanation offers a positive effect of soil biota from the exotic range compared with the effect of soil biota from the native range, referred to as the enhanced mutualism hypothesis (EMH; Reinhart &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Several studies have provided evidence that a lack of mutualists in the new range may impede invasions, however, which can be overcome and supported, in contrast, by the introduction and “coinvasion” of mycorrhizal fungi into new habitats (Diez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Nuñez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Wandrag et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Zenni et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Hence, the effect of soil biota on plant performance strongly varies and depends on whether the soil biota originates from the native or the exotic range. Given such differences, van der Putten (
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) strongly recommends that studying soil biota in plant invasions requires information from both ranges. Apart from ecological release effects, plant invasions may reflect evolutionary variation in plant–soil interactions (Schweitzer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Blossey and Notzold (
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>) hypothesized that a release from natural enemies will induce a reallocation of resources from defense mechanisms to competitive abilities, which corresponds to the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis. The belowground dimension of this hypothesis implies that such a release from belowground enemies may induce shifts in root‐associated traits that in turn will translate into invasive exotic plant success (Dawson &amp; Schrama, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, as shown in several plant–soil feedback experiments, plants and soil‐borne fungi and bacteria can adapt to each other (Callaway, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Klironomos, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Reinhart &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Evolutionary consequences in plant–soil feedbacks can even imply better‐performing plants that translate into fitness advantages when grown in their home soil communities as has been shown for 
 <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> (Wagg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Experimental approaches addressing range effects of soil biota from native and exotic ranges as plant provenance trials are an appropriate tool to study such evolutionary variation in plant–soil feedback interactions. However, effects of soil‐borne microbes from home and exotic ranges on both native and exotic populations of a successful plant invader have been investigated only in a very limited number of studies and with inconsistent outcome to date (Gundale et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Lankau &amp; Keymer, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Shelby et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
