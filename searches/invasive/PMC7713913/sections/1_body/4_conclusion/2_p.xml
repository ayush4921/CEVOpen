<p>We tested the role of soil‐borne fungi and bacteria for the successful range expansion of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> in New Zealand by comparing the effects of soil microbes from the native and exotic range on the performance of native and exotic plant populations. Although we found no reliable evidence for soil microbes to be crucial for successful exotic range expansion, we showed that plants originating from different populations differ genetically in many traits and that soil‐borne fungi and bacteria significantly affect different functional plant traits. This emphasizes the particular role soil biota might play in deciding on failure or success of plant invasions (Dickie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, it seems that 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> populations from the native and exotic range differ in their interaction with different soil microbes and thus suggest plant–soil microbe coevolution. Given that many studies found populations from the native and the exotic range of an exotic plant species to differ genetically (Bossdorf et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Colautti &amp; Lau, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and that soil biota are not equally distributed around the globe (Rout &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), this finding may change our perspective on plant invasions. Thus, to understand the role of soil biota in the invasion context, more is needed to address the effect of soil biota from the home and exotic range on native or exotic populations. Future studies comparing the effect of soil biota from the home and exotic range should broaden such experimental approaches to multispecies testing in multiple exotic ranges in order to increase the generalizability of the findings and prevent missing important parts of the puzzle that might be necessary to get the whole picture.
