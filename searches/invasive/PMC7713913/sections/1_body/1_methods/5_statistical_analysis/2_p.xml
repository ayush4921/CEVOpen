<p>Continuously distributed response variables were analyzed with a linear mixed model (using the package lmerTest in R, version 3.4.0., R Core Team,

 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Residual plots of each selected model were examined to ensure random distribution of model residuals. Accordingly, response variables SLA, RSR, SRL (log), and belowground biomass (sqrt) were transformed as recommended by Zuur et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) to obtain normal distribution of residuals. Plant origin (PO; with levels: native (German) versus. exotic (New Zealand) population origin) and soil biota origin (SO; with levels: German versus. New Zealand soil origin) and soil biota treatment (T; with levels: C, B, F, BF) were considered fixed factors and tested for all interactions. Soil biota population was considered random and nested in soil biota origin, and plant population as a random factor was nested in plant origin and the greenhouse cabin. Cabin identity was considered an additional random factor in all models. We calculated 
 <italic>F</italic> and 
 <italic>p</italic> values using a type III ANOVA and Satterthwaite's method to calculate the degrees of freedom. Soil biota effects were subjected to Tukey's post hoc tests in order to identify significant differences among treatments. For analysis of repeatedly monitored variables, monitoring date was used as an additional covariate of time and the individual plant identity (ID) nested in cabin identity as an additional random factor. A model simplification via backward selection and comparison of the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) resulted in better/smaller values for the simplified models. Since, by general trend, there was no substantial difference between the models' outcomes, we used the original complete models for reasons of comparability. Survival data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effect model (glmer) with the same random and fixed factors as described above. 
 <italic>p</italic> values were calculated using the degrees of freedom from the lmer model.
