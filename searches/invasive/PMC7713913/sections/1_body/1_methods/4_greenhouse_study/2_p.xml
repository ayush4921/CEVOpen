<p>The experiment took place in autumn 2014 in the greenhouse cabins of the Botanical Garden at Martin Luther University Halle. To prevent a contamination of samples and experimental units by ambient biota, we applied sterilization procedures for the greenhouse cabins (0.3% Wofasteril E400, Kesla Pharma Wolfen GmbH, Germany), the seeds (rinsing 15 min 0.3% sodium hypochlorite solution), and the sand and soil used for seedling cultivation and growth (24 hr at 180°C, 8 hr break, 24 hr at 180°C). 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> seedlings grew on pure sand to facilitate later transplantation and were fertilized every 10 days with 0.4% Wuxal Universal (Hauert Manna Düngerwerke GmbH, Nürnberg, Germany). After 10 weeks, plants were transplanted into pots with 2 L of the sterilized soil/sand mixture. Pots were thereafter randomly assigned to biocide treatments and inoculated with the respective soil washes (10 ml microbial solution/1 L soil). Each ten plants of the ten origins were grown in all soil biota communities in a reciprocal design, that is, originating from all populations and each subjected to all treatments of soil biota reduction, yielding a total number of 400 experimental units (i.e., individuals). Because of their fast growth during the experiment, plants were repositioned anew in two cabins after 4 weeks. Thereafter, all plants from population NZ2, NZ4, GE1, GE3, and GE5 were randomly allocated to cabin 1, and all other plants remaining from populations NZ1, NZ3, NZ5, GE2, and GE4 were newly arranged in cabin 2. Pots were randomly positioned on benches, and saucers were used to avoid microbial cross‐contamination from neighboring pots. During the experimental period of 12 weeks, plants were watered every second day with deionized water, fertilized every 21 days with 0.4% Wuxal Universal and subjected to additional illumination from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. to ensure long‐day exposure to light according to a 16‐hr/8‐hr day/night cycle. The temperatures ranged between 28° and 15°C (day/night), accordingly. Every 3 weeks, rosette area size, leaf number, and leaf length of the largest fully developed nonsenescent leaf were monitored. For the calculation of leaf life span, leaves were marked after 6 and 9 weeks to distinguish between old leaves that already existed at the previous monitoring date, the newly emerged leaves, and the total leaf number at the initial date. By this, we were able to separate losses of previously present leaves from true increases because of emergences of new leaves (King, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). Leaf life span was calculated by dividing the number of leaves per plant by the average of leaf production and leaf loss rates. After 12 weeks, plants were monitored for survival and the largest fully developed nonsenescent leaf was harvested to determine the leaf fresh weight, area, length, width and dry weight per individual (after 48 hr at 60°C). This information was used for the calculation of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Total carbon and nitrogen on the leaf sample level were determined with a nitrogen analyzer (vario EL cube, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH) and used for C:N ratio calculation. Above‐ and belowground biomass was harvested separately. For the assessment of specific root length (SRL), roots were rinsed with water, and root area and length were measured suspended in water with a transmitted light scanner (Epson Expression 10000 XL, software package WinRHIZO). Both roots and shoots were dried for 72 hr at 80°C and weighed to obtain dry biomass by fraction and to calculate total biomass and root–shoot ratio (RSR).
