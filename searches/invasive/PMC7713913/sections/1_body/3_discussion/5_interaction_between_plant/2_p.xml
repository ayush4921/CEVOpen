<p>The outcome of our analyses on selected plant leaf traits provides evidence that 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> populations and soil microbes from the native and the exotic range have adapted to each other. When treated with their home soil biota communities, plants developed longer leaves and larger rosettes, which provides them with a high competitive strength for the suppression of nearby seedlings (Grime, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Werner, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>) and is positively correlated with the probability of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> to survive and flower (Gross, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">1981</xref>). When treated with soil biota from the native range, plants showed decreased performance due to their loss of defense against specialist soil‐borne pathogens that may be absent in the exotic range. In their review, Bossdorf et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) found only few studies providing a full test of the EICA hypothesis by addressing growth and defense in the same species, however mostly implying studies that consider herbivore effects. Several of these studies found increased growth or decreased resistance in introduced populations. To our knowledge, there is only one study explicitly testing the EICA hypothesis of plants and soil biota from the native and introduced range of a successful invader. Shelby et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) compared performance of three 
 <italic>Trifolium</italic> species native to Europe that were introduced to New Zealand but found no differences in competitive ability of introduced and native provenances when grown with soil biota from either the native or exotic range.
