<p>We found consistent evidence for genetic divergence in 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> populations from the home versus the exotic range. However, for most traits studied, native populations outperformed the exotic populations. Against our expectation, we did not find effects of soil biota origin on plant performance, but there was evidence provided that native and exotic plant populations differed significantly in their interaction with soil biota from the native and exotic range.
