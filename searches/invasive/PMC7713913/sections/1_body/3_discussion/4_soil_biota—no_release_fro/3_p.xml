<p>There are several possible explanations that could underlie our findings. First, soil microbe identities and composition in German and New Zealand 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> populations might not have differed significantly from each other. However, given that microbes are not exempt from the fundamental evolutionary processes of geographic isolation and natural selection (reviewed in Rout &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), this scenario is rather unlikely. A second scenario might be that soil microbes from the two origins, in fact, differ in their identity but not in their overall net effect on traits measured in this study. The absence of soil biota origin effects may arise from conflicting patterns when, for example, populations seem to be adapted to whole microbial communities at their home site while being maladapted to particular microbial populations present at the same time and site (Lankau &amp; Keymer, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In that case, a neutral response may simply be the net outcome of outbalanced antagonistic responses. It is important to take into account the possibility that potentially mutualistic soil microbes from the exotic range, dominated by low pH, did not perform optimal in the less acid‐sterilized German soil used for the experiment. Admittedly, one might consider that different biocides may provide weak or weird results in some cases, but certainly not all.
