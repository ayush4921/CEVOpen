<p>In our study, soil‐borne microbes mainly affected root traits and leaf area of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic>. Compared with the control, the exclusion of soil fungi evoked an increase in SRL and a decrease in leaf area. The exclusion of bacteria produced similar but weaker results. The additional experiment in sterilized soil without soil biota revealed no physiological effect of the biocide treatment on the leaf area and the SRL of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> (data not shown). Thus, we infer that the observed patterns were truly caused by the reduction in soil fungi and bacteria and not by the application of biocide. In general, an increased root–soil surface contact per unit of biomass due to high SRL is associated with a greater physiological capacity for nutrient and water uptake (Ostonen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Perez‐Harguindeguy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and less mycorrhizal dependency (Eissenstat, 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). Accordingly, there is reason to suggest that 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> is compensating the absence of mutualistic microbes by a reallocation of resources from leaves in an increased SRL. However, the nonsignificant interaction between biocide treatment and soil biota origin indicates that the positive effect of soil‐borne fungi and bacteria is not crucial for the invasion success of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> in New Zealand. It is important to mention that we only analyzed soil‐borne microorganisms and not the whole soil biota community. However, nematodes, for example, were also shown to globally attack local native plant species significantly stronger than an exotic invader (van der Putten et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Admittedly, interpretation of soil biota effects on plant performance to some extent is limited when studying effects of isolated soil biota components (Callaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36894-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In addition, in the present study, we applied an exclusion treatment of soil biota directly on fresh soil samples from the field, whereas many experiments studying plant–soil feedbacks rely on more than one generation in soils, which might also contribute to different outcomes. Therefore, a prominent role of plant–soil feedbacks for explaining the successful exotic range expansion of 
 <italic>V. thapsus</italic> in New Zealand cannot be completely ruled out.
