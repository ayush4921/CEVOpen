<p>The reduction in different soil biota significantly affected leaf area (Table

 <sub>3,294.95</sub> = 17.41,

 <xref rid="ece36894-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Leaf area was significantly decreased in treatments where fungicide application was involved; however, leaf area responses to bacteria reduction did not differ significantly from the control treatment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36894-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Root area was reduced when bacteria were excluded, whereas an exclusion of fungi or both did not significantly affect the root area. The total root length was not affected by the biocide treatments when compared to the control; however, plants growing in the fungi exclusion developed significantly longer roots than plants growing in the bacteria exclusion (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36894-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The application of biocides always induced a significant increase in SRL if compared to the control. This effect was strongest when fungi were exclusively reduced and still significantly different from bactericide‐only and combined bactericide/fungicide treatments (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36894-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).
