<p>For repeatedly monitored variables, time analysis displayed additional significant effects of plant origin and plant origin × time interactions (Table

All plants had their maximum leaf number at the end of the experiment, but plants from New Zealand displayed a lower increase in leaf number after the second monitoring date at 6 weeks (Figure
