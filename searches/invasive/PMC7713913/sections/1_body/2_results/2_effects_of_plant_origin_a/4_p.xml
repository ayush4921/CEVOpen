<p>The soil biota origin failed to display any main effect on the investigated plant traits; that is, soil biota communities from native and exotic plant ranges did not differ in their effects on plant performance. However, there was a significant plant origin × soil biota origin interaction effect for rosette area (

 <sub>1,289.20</sub> = 5.17,

For exotic NZ plant origins, responses in leaf length and rosette area were similar when grown in German or in NZ soil biota communities. In contrast, responses in native German plant origins decreased in magnitude when grown in NZ soil biota communities if compared to treatments with German soil biota, thereby indicating a significant home‐away effect (Figure
