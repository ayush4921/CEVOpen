 <p>We tested for differential effects of soil microbes from the native and introduced ranges for the exotic range expansion of 
  <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> in a reciprocal transplant experiment. We found significant interactions between plant range origin and soil biota origin and suggest that 
  <italic>V. thapsus</italic> may compensate a lack of mutualistic microbes by increasing root surface. Our results emphasize that the evolutionary dimension of plantâ€“soil biota interactions needs to be considered in explaining plant invasions.
