<p>RY
 <sub>ab</sub> measures the average performance of individuals in mixed cultures compared to that of individuals in pure cultures. A RY
 <sub>ab</sub> of 1.00 indicates species a and b are both equal in terms of intraspecific competition and interspecific competition. A RY
 <sub>ab</sub> greater than 1.00 means intraspecific competition of species a and b is higher than interspecific competition, and a RY
 <sub>ab</sub> of less than 1.00 implies intraspecific competition of species a and b is less than interspecific competition. RYT is the weighted sum of Relative Yields for the mixed culture components. A RYT of 1.00 means that both species are competing for the same resources, and one is potentially capable of excluding the other; a RYT of greater than 1.00 means that the two species exploit different resources and therefore do not compete (e.g., due to different root depths); finally, an RYT of less than 1.00 implies that the two species are mutually antagonistic, with both having a detrimental effect on the other [

 <sub>a</sub> greater than 0 indicate that species a is more competitive than species [
