<p>All growth variables (shoot length, branch number, leaf area, flower number, and dry weight biomass) of both plant species, and soil properties were analyzed by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). If significant differences were detected with the ANOVA, Duncan’s multiple range tests were used to detect differences among treatments at a 5% level of significance. RY and RYT from each mixed culture were compared to the value of 1.00 using t-tests (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 or 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01), and values of RYT were tested for deviation from 1.0 and values of CB for deviation from 0 using a paired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
