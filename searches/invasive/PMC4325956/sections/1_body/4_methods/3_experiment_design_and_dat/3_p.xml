<p>To examine the effects of the interaction of the two plant species on soil traits, initial soil samples from experimental units and soil samples (0–10 cm in depth) after harvest were collected from each of the 25 m
 <sup>2</sup> plots. Fifty soil samples were taken randomly from each plot and then combined and treated as one composite sample. Soils were characterized by measuring the pH, soil organic matter, total and available N, total and available P, total and available K, exchange Ca and Mg, and available Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, B at the Soil Analysis and Detection Center of Agricultural Environment and Resource Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China.
