<p>The experiment was conducted during the April-December 2013 growing season within maize and sweet potato intercropping land in the vicinity of Zhangfeng Town, Longchuan County, Dehong Prefecture, utilizing a de Wit replacement series method [

On 15 April 2013, whole mile-a-minute plants (including roots) were collected from a mile-a-minute population located in a nearby forest margin and whole sweet potato plants were collected from farmland near Zhangfeng Town, respectively. To ensure relative uniformity among the experimental stock, one-node segments (fresh weight 3.0-3.5 g, 7–8 cm pieces) were taken from central stem portions of relatively young plants of similar size from both species. All materials were placed in Hoagland’s solution [

Seven ratios of sweet potato and mile-a-minute plants were utilized (4:0, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 0:4) while maintaining a constant planting of 20 plants m
 <sup>−2</sup> (0.25 m × 0.20 m space). All plots were arranged in a complete randomized design with 4 replicates utilizing 25 m
 <sup>2</sup> plots (5 m × 5 m). All plants were distributed evenly within the plot. During the experiment, the two species exhibited prostrate growth. The plots were not weeded and no synthetic fertilizers were used.
