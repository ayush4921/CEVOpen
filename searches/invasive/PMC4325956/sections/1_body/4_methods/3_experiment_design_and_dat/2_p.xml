<p>The experiment ended on 15 December 2013, 8 months after planting. Thirty five plants of each species were selected randomly and harvested within the middle region of each plot. Mile-a-minute and sweet potato plants were carefully removed, separated, and weighed. Total shoot length, main stem length (for mile-a-minute, after the one-node cutting with two leaves produced two main stems from each sprout; for sweet potato after the one-node cutting with one leaf produced one main stem from each sprout), branch length, internode length, branch number, leafstalk length (just the petiole, not including leaf blade), leaf area, and number of flowers per shoot were counted and measured. Here, we did not measure seed characteristics (size, length and biomass) because at this point in time both species were still growing vigorously; after flowering mile-a-minute tended to wither whereas sweet potato continued to grow. Branch length was measured as the sum of sub-branches coming off the main stem. Leaves were clipped and passed through a leaf-area meter (Li-3000A; Li-Cor Corp.) to determine leaf area index. Then roots were rinsed gently with water to remove soil particles. The adventitious root (produced by stems aboveground) weight and total biomass of each plant were measured after drying for 72 h at 78°C (0.001 g).</p>
