<p>Mile-a-minute is one of the most serious invasive alien species in Dehong Prefecture where this study took place. This perennial weed exhibits a climbing growth form in forests, orchards and shrublands, but on roadsides, in wastelands, and other areas without woody vegetation, it takes on a prostrate form. It has infested sugarcane, orange, banana, coffee, pineapple, bamboo, sweet potato, maize crops, as well as artificial pasture and secondary forest in Longchuan County, Dehong Prefecture [
