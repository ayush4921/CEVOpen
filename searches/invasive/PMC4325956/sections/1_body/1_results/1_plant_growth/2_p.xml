<p>The internode length of mile-a-minute was greater in magnitude than that of sweet potato in both mixed and monoculture (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). With decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute, its internode length was reduced to a certain extent by sweet potato but the trend was not too clear. The branch number of mile-a-minute was greater than that of sweet potato in monoculture (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> In mixed culture, the branch number of mile-a-minute was significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05), and the inhibition rates were higher than those of sweet potato with decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute.
