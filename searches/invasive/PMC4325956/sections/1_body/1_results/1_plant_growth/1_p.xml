<p>Comparing growth in monoculture, sweet potato attained twice as much biomass as mile-a-minute; 53.27 ± 0.73 g for sweet potato vs. 25.18 ± 1.35 g for mile-a-minute (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In mixed culture, the total shoot length (main stem + branch length) and branch length of mile-a-minute were significantly suppressed, and the inhibition rates (except branch length for a ratio of sweet potato to mile-a-minute of 1:3) were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those of sweet potato with decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). With proportional increases in sweet potato, the main stem length of mile-a-minute was highly suppressed; for ratios of sweet potato to mile-a-minute of 3:1 and 2:1 total shoot length was much greater for sweet potato
 <italic>;</italic> even at a 1:3 ratio, mile-a-minute shoots were significantly shorter than in monoculture (P &lt; 0.05).
