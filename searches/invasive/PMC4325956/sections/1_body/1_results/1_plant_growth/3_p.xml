<p>The leafstalk length and leaf area of mile-a-minute were markedly less than those of sweet potato in all treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In monoculture, the mean leafstalk length and leaf area of sweet potato were 17.18 cm and 101.25 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, and the leafstalk length and leaf area of mile-a-minute were only 7.06 cm and 21.21 cm
 <sup>2</sup>. In mixed culture, mile-a-minute leafstalk length averaged about half that of sweet potato at the highest ratio of mile-a-minute: sweet potato (3:1) and declined to less than one third of sweet potato leafstalk length at the 1:3 ratio. Likewise leaf area of mile-a-minute progressively declined with increasing proportions of sweet potato; even at the 1:3 sweet potato: mile-a-minute ratio, the leaf area of mile-a-minute was just one fifth of the leaf area of sweet potato.
