<p>The adventitious root biomass of sweet potato was much greater than that of mile-a-minute in all treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In mixed culture, the adventitious root biomass of mile-a-minute was significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05), and the inhibition rates were higher than those of sweet potato with decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute
 <italic>.</italic> In monoculture, the total biomass of sweet potato was 2.12 times that of mile-a-minute, and was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than that of mile-a-minute in mixed culture (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The total biomass of mile-a-minute was significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05), and the inhibition rates were higher than those of sweet potato for ratios of sweet potato to mile-a-minute of 3:1, 2:1 1:1, and 1:2. In all treatments, the number of flowers per shoot for mile-a-minute was greater (at least 15 times greater) than for sweet potato (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> Still, in mixed culture, the number of flowers per shoot of mile-a-minute was significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05), and the inhibition rates were higher than those of sweet potato with decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute.
