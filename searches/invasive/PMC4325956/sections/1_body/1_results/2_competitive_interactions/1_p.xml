<p>The relative yield (RY) of mile-a-minute and sweet potato in different ratios showed that the two plants compete strongly (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The RY of mile-a-minute and sweet potato was significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) than 1.0 in mixed culture, and only for a ratio of sweet potato to mile-a-minute of 1:3 was the RY of mile-a-minute greater than that of sweet potato
 <italic>,</italic> showing that the intraspecific competition between two plants was less than their interspecific competition. The relative yield total (RYT) of mile-a-minute and sweet potato was less than 1.0 in mixed culture (ranging from 0.45 to 0.54) indicating that there was competition between the two plants. The competitive balance index (CB) of sweet potato of −0.39 was significantly less than zero (P &lt; 0.05) when grown with mile-a-minute in mixed culture at 1:3 (sweet potato: mile-a-minute), whereas for the other ratios the CB index was greater than zero and the maximum CB index was 1.87. With decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute, the competitiveness of sweet potato increased at a rate exceeding what would be predicted by the increase in relative density.
