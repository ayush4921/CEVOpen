<p>Both exchangeable Ca content and Mg content of the soil in mile-a-minute monoculture were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than those of sweet potato in monoculture, and significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) as the proportion of sweet potato increased in mixed culture (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For the soil micronutrients in monoculture, available Cu, available Zn and available Fe associated with soil where mile-a-minute was grown were all significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) than those of sweet potato, and increased as the proportion of sweet potato increased in mixed culture. However, available Mn content and B content of mile-a-minute were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than that of sweet potato in monoculture, and gradually decreased as the sweet potato proportion increased in mixed culture.
