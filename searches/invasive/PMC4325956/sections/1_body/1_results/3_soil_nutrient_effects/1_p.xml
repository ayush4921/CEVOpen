<p>Soil nutrient characteristics varied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) among the seven different treatments corresponding to the seven ratios of the two species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The pH of initial soil (CK) was obviously lower than those of seven treatments, but other soil nutrient contents of initial soil were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05). In monoculture, the organic matter content, pH, total N content, total K content, available N content, available P content, and available K content of mile-a-minute soil were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those of sweet potato, and significantly decreased as proportions of sweet potato increased in mixed culture. The total P content of soil from the mile-a-minute monoculture was significantly less than in sweet potato soil (P &lt; 0.05), and increased as the proportion of sweet potato increased in mixed culture.
