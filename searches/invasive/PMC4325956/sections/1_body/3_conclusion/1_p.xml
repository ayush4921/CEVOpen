<p>The competitive advantage of sweet potato over mile-a-minute in terms of both plant growth and nutrient utilization that we observed could be used to reduce mile-a-minute growth in tropical and subtropical agricultural regions suitable for cultivation of sweet potato. At the same time, other techniques would be necessary to contain the spread of mile-a-minute in nearby natural areas, perhaps involving similar measures such as planting native vegetation that is competitive with mile-a-minute. During the growth of a mixed culture of mile-a-minute and sweet potato
 <italic>,</italic> sweet potato consumed more soil organic matter, total K, total N, available N, available P, available K, exchange Ca, exchange Mg, available Mn, and available B; meanwhile soil nutrients absorbed by mile-a-minute were considerably reduced. In order to provide a more comprehensive perspective on long-term management of mile-a-minute via competition with sweet potato, long-term successional patterns, growth-stage specific competition, and impacts of varying fertilizer levels and other environmental factors on the relationship between the two species should be researched further. This study also shows the potential value of replacement control methods which may apply to other crop-weed systems or invaded natural ecosystems.
