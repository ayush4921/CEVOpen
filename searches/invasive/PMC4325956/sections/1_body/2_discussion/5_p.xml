<p>Successful invasive plants may alter soil conditions such as nutrient availability, microbial composition and functioning, and in turn the altered soil conditions in some invaded ecosystems may promote further invasion [

Our findings found that with the exception of pH, soil nutrient contents of initial soil (CK) were significantly higher than contents following the seven treatments, demonstrating that both of sweet potato and mile-a-minute deplete soil nutrients during their growth. The concentrations of most soil macro-nutrients and secondary soil elements were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) in mile-a-minute monoculture soil than in sweet potato monoculture soil, and were reduced by the competition of sweet potato in the mixture, indicating that sweet potato has a stronger capacity to consume nutrients than mile-a-minute. Furthermore, soil nutrients absorbed by mile-a-minute were greatly reduced when the plant was grown in mixed culture with sweet potato
