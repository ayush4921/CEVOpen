 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported that mile-a-minute seedlings were inhibited by the aqueous leaf extract of sweet potato, with higher extract concentrations causing progressively stronger inhibition of mile-a-minute. The present research found that in all treatments, both the leafstalk length and leaf area of mile-a-minute were less than that for sweet potato
 <italic>.</italic> In monoculture, leafstalk length and leaf area of mile-a-minute were only 41% and 21% of that of sweet potato, respectively, and in mixed culture, both leafstalk length and leaf area of mile-a-minute were reduced with increased proportions of sweet potato. In mixed culture, 70-90% of mile-a-minute stems and leaves were covered by sweet potato, leading to a serious decline in mile-a-minute biomass.
