<p>Compared with mechanical or chemical control, replacement control clearly has the potential to provide a more sustainable management option for growers, as seen in the present study and other related studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Utilizing alternative crops in this way serves to increase crop diversity, creating a more resilient system more similar ecologically to natural, more stable systems [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, in the case of mile-a-minute, mechanical or chemical control often proves difficult or even counterproductive, resulting in limited options for managers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This difficulty extends to natural areas, so there might well be a role for planting sweet potato or perhaps a native plant species with competitive abilities comparable to sweet potato in natural areas infested by mile-a-minute. As mentioned previously, competition between locally available plants and mile-a-minute has recently been investigated in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and if the present study is any indication, there may be numerous opportunities to utilize plant competition in a variety of crop and non-crop situations. Although mile-a-minute is capable of rapid growth due to high photosynthetic rates at high light intensities, this capability is markedly reduced under shaded conditions, making it vulnerable to competition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This “Achilles heel” that makes mile-a-minute vulnerable to replacement control may well be a weakness in many other disturbance-adapted weeds that may be overlooked by managers who assume that control must exclusively rely on mechanical or chemical control, or for that matter, biological control by pathogens or insects.
