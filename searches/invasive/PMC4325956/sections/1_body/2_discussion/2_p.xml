<p>Both sweet potato and mile-a-minute are perennial evergreen vines that share many morphological similarities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], occupying virtually the same niche when grown in agricultural land in prostrate form. Mile-a-minute exhibits a high degree of morphological plasticity and has a large capacity for asexual propagation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Sweet potato likewise exhibits a high capacity for asexual reproduction, indicated by the fact that most local villagers only use its root and stem for cultivation. The present study showed that flowering of mile-a-minute was significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) in mixed culture, and that the inhibition rates were higher than those of sweet potato with decreasing proportions of mile-a-minute. The ability to suppress seed production is important in terms of reducing the potential for rapid population growth of mile-a-minute [
