<p>In the process of biological invasion, invasive alien plants may alter both the structure and function of ecosystems owing to their high degree of adaptability, morphological plasticity, competitive ability and potential to modify soil properties [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and compared to native species, invasive plant species usually have greater morphological plasticity and biomass. However, our research found that morphological and biomass characteristics of mile-a-minute put it at a disadvantage when grown in association with sweet potato. In mixed and monoculture, the total biomass per sweet potato plant was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than that of mile-a-minute for ratios of sweet potato to mile-a-minute of greater than 1:3. Because the initial size and weight of mile-a-minute and sweet potato plants were similar and they were grown under similar conditions, differences in final biomass were due to competiveness and plant morphology. The relative yield (RY) and relative yield total (RYT) of mile-a-minute and sweet potato were significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) than 1.0 in mixed culture, indicating that intraspecific competition was less than interspecific competition. The competitive balance index (CB index) of sweet potato and mile-a-minute was significantly greater than zero (P &lt; 0.05) and positively correlated (P &lt; 0.01) for a ratio of sweet potato to mile-a-minute of greater than 1:3, indicating that sweet potato had higher competitive ability than mile-a-minute. Similarly, sweet potato was found to significantly reduce population density and importance values of invasive alien species
