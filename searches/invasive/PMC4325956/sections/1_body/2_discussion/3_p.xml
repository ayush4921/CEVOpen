<p>In mixed culture, the main stem length, branch length, and internode length of mile-a-minute were significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing proportions of sweet potato. The internode length of mile-a-minute is greater than that of sweet potato, but the shorter internode length of sweet potato enables it to rapidly multiply internode number to facilitate soil contact and better access to soil nutrients. This relationship was further confirmed by observing the number of adventitious roots and biomass of mile-a-minute and sweet potato in mixed culture. Tillering or branching is an important means to compete with other plants, and also has been considered as a means of pre-empting resources during scramble competition [

 <italic>;</italic> however, in mixed culture its branch number was obviously suppressed, and the branch number of sweet potato was usually increased, to the detriment of mile-a-minute. By contrast, studies of competition with other types of weeds found that a sweet potato cultivar with a sprawling growth form did not compete as well as a more erect cultivar [
