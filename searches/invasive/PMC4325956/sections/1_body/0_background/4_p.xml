<p>In order to control mile-a-minute, extensive research has been conducted on mechanical removal, chemical control, biological control, and ecological control over the past two decades [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, due to high capacity for both asexual and sexual reproduction and morphological plasticity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], high compensation capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and rapid adaptive evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], no single control method can effectively alleviate the damage caused by the mile-a-minute, and more comprehensive prevention and control measures must be adopted. Replacement control technology, utilizing plant competition, represents a promising component of a more holistic, integrated management strategy. Competition between locally available plants and mile-a-minute has recently been investigated in China [
