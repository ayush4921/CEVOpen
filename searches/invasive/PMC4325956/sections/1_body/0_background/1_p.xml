<p>The conventional agricultural paradigm of reliance on chemical or mechanical control of weeds to maintain yields in monocultures often proves to be unsustainable [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, in many jurisdictions more holistic agroecosystem management approaches are being implemented that incorporate crop diversity, crop rotation, and concomitant reduced inputs for weed control [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More holistic management approaches tend to increase crop diversity to improve ecosystem health. For example, involving alternative crops in a rotation introduces greater crop diversity. Rotating crops has been found to reduce both the economic impact and diversity of weeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These crop rotation benefits are frequently accounted for by lack of a buildup of problem weeds associated with particular crop as well as rotation of control methods associated with particular crops. Furthermore, an increase in crop diversity has numerous other benefits including improved soil properties, microbial diversity and advantages in terms of insect or fungal pest management as the more diverse agroecosystem takes on more characteristics in common with natural ecosystems [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There are several other established ways of increasing agroecosystem diversity such as cover cropping, intercropping or diversifying the soil environment through composts or manures [
