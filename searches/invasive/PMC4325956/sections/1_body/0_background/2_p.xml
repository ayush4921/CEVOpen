<p>One relatively novel means of increasing crop diversity while improving weed management is by deliberately introducing an alternative crop that is known to be highly competitive with a weed that is difficult to control. Replacement control with high value species (e.g., local food, native species and/or cash crops) recently has emerged as a viable option for management of invasive alien plant species [

Although essentially a type of crop rotation, the difference is that the competitive crop itself is the means of weed control in the case of replacement control. As a potential alternative to traditional bio-control which generally employs insects or pathogens, replacement control relies on growth advantage of one or more plants to suppress exotic plants, simultaneously reducing damage caused by the invasive species and improving local natural ecosystem health by reducing the potential for invasive plants to spread beyond agricultural fields [
