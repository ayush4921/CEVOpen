<p>To gain a better understanding of the competitive effects of sweet potato on control of mile-a-minute and associated soil nutrient dynamics of invaded communities in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, we conducted a set of field experiments in Longchuan County where mile-a-minute causes serious economic damage and sweet potato is commonly cultivated. The main objective of this study was to examine competitive mechanisms and soil interaction between sweet potato and mile-a-minute, in order to provide a scientific basis for setting up an effective management method utilizing ecological control techniques for mile-a-minute in the field. Lessons learned from this potential replacement crop system may be applied to other crop-weed combinations in pursuit of more holistic management approaches utilizing plant competition and crop diversification.</p>
