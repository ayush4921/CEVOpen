<p>The construction of the SGR has led to major impacts on ecosystem, particularly degradation fragmentation and to a less extent ecosystem destruction. Landscape modification by the SGR construction has resulted in increased soil erosion, land degradation, flooding, sedimentation of water bodies, habitat destruction and impeding wildlife movements. It is therefore recommended that linear infrastructure projects, like the SGR, develop sustainable and ecologically sensitive measures to mitigate against these impacts. For example, underpasses at the right density and of the right size will maintain wildlife movements, water courses can be channelled and redirected, invasive plants may need to have direct control measures implemented to try and stop their spread. Furthermore, a wholesome assessment of the environmental impacts of transportation infrastructure which involves extensive engagement of stakeholders is key for designing and implementing inclusive, resilient and sustainable infrastructure so that the development gains are maximised while the ecosystem impacts are minimised. Further research is needed to quantify the ecological impacts of the SGR, and other transport infrastructure on ecosystems and the associated natural capital with a view of establishing mitigation measures that would promote more sustainable and resilient developments in future.</p>
