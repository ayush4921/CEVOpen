<p>The majority of participants in this study identified ecosystem degradation as the main impact around the SGR. Within the context of transportation infrastructure, degradation may arise from disturbance, pollution and contamination of soil, water and air and disruption of natural processes [

The SGR construction was accompanied by activities such as soil compaction, excavation and movement of soil from one location to another to erect the embankments. These activities altered and created barriers to natural processes including natural hydrology and animal migration routes. Previous research demonstrates how wildlife residing close to the infrastructure is affected by the traffic noise, vibrations, chemical pollution and human presence [

Although infrastructure engineers rely on technical considerations when designing and implementing these projects, local knowledge and experiences of critical ecosystems can contribute to the identification and protection of these ecosystems. In areas where engineers and scientists have no prior knowledge and experience of potential impacts, stakeholder perceptions can play an important role in providing baseline information to design, implement and monitor impact mitigation activities.
