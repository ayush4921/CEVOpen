 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The construction of transportation infrastructure often results in land use conversion, from natural ecosystems such as forests and water bodies, to transportation land use or right-of-way [

It further entails the elimination, replacement or modification of the original characteristics of natural vegetation and aquatic ecosystems [
