Effective management requires surveillance to detect epidemics at an early stage. However, despite the increasing use of risk-based surveillance programs in plant health, it remains unclear how best to target surveillance resources to achieve this. We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid &#x02018;putting all your eggs in one basket&#x02019;. However, this depends on an interplay with other factors, such as the sensitivity of available detection methods. Using the economically important arboreal disease huanglongbing (HLB), we demonstrate how our approach leads to a significant performance gain and cost saving in comparison with conventional methods to targeted surveillance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Emerging infectious diseases of plants continue to devastate ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide.

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as these are an increasing threat to wild and cultivated plants worldwide [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In some cases, EIDs may be established pathogens that have moved into new areas, as exemplified by the ongoing spread of the bacterium causing the citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) in the US [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a competent vector of this pathogen in Europe [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In other cases, completely new pathogen strains may emerge, as seen with the emergence of the CoDiRO strain of <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> (<italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> subsp. pauca, sequence type [ST]53: the cause of olive quick decline syndrome) in Italy [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and new strains of <italic>Puccinia graminis</italic> (the cause of wheat stem rust) worldwide [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although changes in farming practices, land use, and climate are important drivers of these processes [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], most attention to date has focused on the global movement of people, plants, and plant products through travel and trade [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, efforts to target these pathways directly through movement restrictions, quarantine, and border inspection [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] often fail [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], allowing pathogens to enter and potentially establish and spread to levels at which control efforts are infeasible [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a result, it is increasingly recognised that surveillance activities must already be in place in the region of interest before pathogen entry [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and must be capable of detection before the prevalence (that is, the proportion of the host population that is infected) exceeds the point at which control is almost certain to be no longer possible. This &#x02018;maximum acceptable prevalence&#x02019; will be impacted by factors such as the epidemiology of the pest, its likely impact, and the availability and feasibility of control measures.</p><p>Developing an effective early detection surveillance strategy is complicated by the need to survey large, heterogeneous, areas of landscape over an indefinite timespan in the face of limited financial and logistical resources. Whilst it is well accepted that attention must be focused on sampling enough hosts regularly enough for the likely prevalence at first detection to be acceptably low [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], consideration must also be given to which hosts should be inspected and where to sample. One way of achieving this is through &#x02018;risk-based&#x02019; or &#x02018;targeted&#x02019; surveillance [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in which the types of hosts or locations judged most likely to contain the pest or pathogen are preferentially selected for inspection or sampling [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the merits of targeted surveillance are well recognised, most work to date has focused on identifying static &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; groups and locations using statistical models [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although these methods of planning targeted surveillance are a valuable and versatile method of quantifying the infection risk amongst different groups, they do not explicitly account for the epidemiological processes that determine where and, importantly, when a pathogen will be present. As a result, there is a risk that the surveillance strategy may not be optimally targeted, resulting in low performance and/or excessive costs&#x02014;both of which can ultimately lead to surveillance system failure.</p><p>The inability of conventional risk-based strategies to account explicitly for the epidemiology of a pest or pathogen also has important implications for early detection surveillance planning. To take a simple example, a common targeted surveillance strategy for EIDs is to focus on areas where the pathogen is more likely to first enter [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, conventional methods do not tell us whether resources should all be placed around the single highest-risk site or spread across other potential introduction sites as well. Such questions can be answered by considering the placement of surveillance resources as an optimisation problem [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By linking spatial and/or temporal simulation models that replicate the spread of the pest or pathogen to computational optimisation routines to identify particular sampling patterns, precise surveillance and/or control strategies that minimise the impact of the pest or pathogen can be identified [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although much work to date has focused on identifying how best to conduct surveys in order to achieve certain disease management or mitigation objectives whilst considering spatial spread of a pest or pathogen [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and on the value of different network metrics for identifying hosts to target for surveillance [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], there has been little work on the optimal deployment of surveillance resources for early pest or pathogen detection that explicitly considers the spread of the agent through a real-world landscape. No previous study has addressed the pivotal question: where exactly should surveillance resources be located to maximise the probability to detect an invading pathogen before it reaches a certain prevalence?</p><p>We propose and test a novel, to our knowledge, approach to surveillance planning that explicitly accounts for the spatial spread of a pathogen and that can be readily and easily applied to any pest or pathogen of interest. Using a spatially explicit, stochastic, epidemiological model, we represent the processes of pathogen introduction and onward spread across a real-world host landscape, continuing these simulations until a predefined threshold prevalence is exceeded. We then couple these simulation outputs to a stochastic optimisation algorithm designed to select those surveillance sites that maximise the probability of detection of the pathogen, allowing for a range of logistical parameters, such as different sampling intensities and detection abilities. We use this optimisation method approach to answer the question of where in a landscape surveillance should be targeted if we are to maximise the probability of detecting new pathogen incursions before the threshold prevalence is reached. We interpret our results by focussing on the following questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How much of an increase in detection probability can our method achieve compared to conventional site-selection approaches?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do the locations and frequency of pathogen introductions influence the optimal arrangement of surveillance locations?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the impact of the number of survey sites, the frequency of surveys, and the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection method on the optimal arrangement of surveillance locations?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Can we identify general rules for the selection of surveillance sites that approximate those of optimised surveillance schemes, which thus could be readily deployed in practice without the need for optimisation?</p></list-item></list><p>To demonstrate our method in the context of a pressing example, we use HLB (also known as citrus greening)&#x02014;a high-profile, devastating disease of citrus trees&#x02014;in the US state of Florida as a case study. HLB is caused by the bacterium <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) and spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic>, which has been established in Florida as an invasive species since at least 1998 [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. HLB is currently endemic in the state, where it decimated the citrus industry in less than a decade following first detection in 2005 [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We consider here a scenario prior to this incursion, in which the psyllid is present but Las is absent from the state, but in which there is an immediate and ongoing risk of introduction of Las through human movements from other currently infected areas (such as Brazil and China). We use different estimates of where and how often the pathogen is introduced to the state in order to capture the inherent uncertainty in these processes and investigate how these influence the optimal surveillance strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Summary</title><p>We consider here how best to deploy surveillance resources in order to maximise the probability of detection before a specified &#x02018;maximum acceptable prevalence&#x02019; is reached. To do this, we developed a grid-based, stochastic, spatially explicit, landscape-scale model and repeatedly simulated pathogen spread through this landscape until this prevalence was reached. Although the model is pathogen-generic, we parametrised it to replicate early stage spread of Las in Florida. We then used an optimisation routine (simulated annealing) in order to identify which arrangement of a specified number of sites, with a fixed number of samples collected per site, would give the highest mean probability of detection over all simulation model realisations, given a particular frequency of sampling using a detection method with known performance characteristics (the probability of correctly identifying infected hosts&#x02014;the diagnostic sensitivity&#x02014;and growth in detectability over time).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Simulation model</title><p>The simulation model is described in more detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The model runs on a gridded landscape of 1 km &#x000d7; 1 km cells, each containing a density of citrus informed by maps of commercial citrus densities (provided by the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [USDA-APHIS]) and estimates of residential citrus densities (calculated from population data at the census tract level obtained from the US Census Bureau [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). Individual cells transition stochastically from a susceptible to an infected status in continuous time, driven by pathogen spread from outside the landscape as well as secondary spread within the landscape. Secondary (between-cell) spread occurs according to an exponential dispersal kernel, fitted to data as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Following first infection, each cell becomes more infectious (and detectable) as infection bulks up locally, again at a rate parametrised using available data. This increase in infectiousness and detectability following detection is deterministic, allowing us to estimate the proportion of both infected and symptomatic plants in each cell at any point in time (given the timing of infection in each cell is known, which will vary for each simulation run).

This particular threshold was arbitrarily selected to indicate a point at which control would no longer be possible in the case of the HLB pathosystem but could alternatively be selected based upon regulatory guidance and/or economic considerations, as described in the Discussion. Since the model is stochastic, we simulate not only the spatial spread within a landscape over time but how this varies from one epidemic to the next. Taking the average over all of these epidemics, we find that the distribution of entry sites (whether only influenced by the distribution of citrus trees or also by the predictions of the travel census model) affected which sites were more or less likely to be infected by the end of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s002">S1 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Comparison with conventional targeted surveillance</title><p>As a result of spatial autocorrelation (that is, the fact that the risk status of any given site is likely to be similar to that of surrounding sites), we found that simply selecting the sites with the highest risk of infection tended to result in a small number of clusters of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>). To avoid this, we therefore used instead a selection method in which the probability of site selection was proportional to the risk metric, as has been used previously for targeted surveillance [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This resulted in a greater spread of selected sites (that is, a larger number of distinct &#x02018;clusters&#x02019; of sites) and a higher detection probability than the ranking approach (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">3</xref>). The detection probability of optimised sites was consistently higher than that for sites selected using more conventional methods (with the only exception being when the true rate of pathogen entry was underestimated by a factor of 3,200 or more [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6A</xref>]). However, of the conventional strategies, the risk metric calculated as the product of citrus density and relative rate of incursion gave the closest detection probabilities to the optimised approach. This was most pronounced in cases for which the rate of pathogen entry was very high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

Therefore, in order to achieve any given detection probability between 0.50 and 0.95 using a conventional site-selection strategy, between 2 and 13 times as many sites needed to be sampled as was required under the optimised strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). We can also consider this in terms of the total cost of these inspections, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5B</xref>. Here, the mean detection probability was estimated for different numbers of surveillance sites (between 1 and 50 sites for a single run of optimised sites and between 1 and 150 sites for 100 replicates of the other risk metrics). Using rough estimates of sampling costs taken from citrus survey activities undertaken by the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and USDA-APHIS in Florida, a single surveyor would cost around US$120 per day and a single PCR test around US$10 (T. Gottwald, personal communication). Assuming that a single 1-km cell can be fully surveyed in a single day by a single inspector and that each of the 50 trees inspected within this cell will be tested with a single PCR test, the total surveillance cost per cell is US$620. This would mean that our &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; surveillance strategy of 20 cells per year would have an annual cost around US$12,400. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5B</xref> shows that for any given detection probability between 0.50 and 0.95, the annual surveillance cost using the optimised strategy ranged from US$1,500 to $8,859 (mean: US$3,594). However, the costs of the best-performing conventional strategy ranged from US$3,297 to $19,282, with a mean of US$7,534, and those of random sampling ranged from US$19,606 to $88,689 per year, with a mean of US$42,092 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Varying surveillance characteristics</title><p>Under the baseline model (a low rate of pathogen entry, with spatial variation in entry rate, and 20 sites surveyed annually using a detection method with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.5), the optimised mean detection probability approached 1, with very little variation in the optimised detection probability between different optimisation runs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5</xref> Figs).

We identified 3 consistent clusters of surveillance locations in citrus growing regions to the northeast, northwest, and southwest of Lake Okeechobee, as well as clusters to the east of the lake and in the centre of the peninsula.

We found that misspecifying the rate of pathogen entry (that is, assuming that the baseline model was correct when the true entry rate was higher or lower than this) had a relatively small impact on the performance of the optimised method, which consistently outperformed all other selection strategies in the vast majority of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In all cases, higher rates of introduction were associated with equal or higher detection probabilities (even for optimised selection when site selection was based upon an incorrect model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Model-informed surveillance</title><p>In the current report, we describe a novel, to our knowledge, method of identifying how best to deploy surveillance efforts in order to detect epidemics of exotic pathogens at an early stage. We also explore how certain epidemiological and surveillance characteristics impact on the optimal surveillance strategies. Our method links the output of an epidemiologically informed, spatially explicit simulation model capable of reproducing early-stage pathogen spread with an optimisation routine informed by specified surveillance parameters [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our key finding is that it is generally best to avoid &#x02018;putting all your eggs in one basket&#x02019; when planning surveillance and that surveillance resources should generally be spread throughout the landscape to cover all areas of risk (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">3</xref>). This is an important message because many surveillance programs in plant health are typically disproportionately targeted to a small number of high-risk areas, such as areas immediately adjacent to current outbreaks or surrounding ports of entry. Suboptimal deployment of surveillance resources such as this can be ill-afforded at a time when the number of plant pests and pathogen threats is rising.</p><p>Our method also goes beyond the simple maxim of not putting all eggs in one basket by suggesting precisely which number of baskets should be used and where they should be. We find that the answer to these questions is particularly affected by the performance of the detection method being used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">Fig 3</xref>), whereas the rate and distribution of pathogen entry is less important (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Although the exact selected sites varied slightly when the optimisation algorithm was run repeatedly on the same model output, the general locations and arrangement were very similar and resulted in minimal perceivable change in the final detection probability (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5</xref> Figs), indicating that the performance of the optimised strategy was robust. We also found that that there was relatively little impact of making the wrong assumption regarding the rate and distribution of pathogen entry on the detection probability of the optimised strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Our method considers a surveillance strategy in which a static selection of sites are repeatedly visited, thus bearing similarities to &#x02018;sentinel surveillance&#x02019; [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This allows us to better explore the general drivers behind surveillance site placement and how these are impacted by different epidemiological and practical issues. We do not consider an &#x02018;adaptive&#x02019; surveillance strategy, in which surveillance sites are adjusted in light of previous findings. However, using optimisation methods to explore this would potentially have considerable practical value and would be worthy of further attention.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Optimisation outperforms conventional targeted surveillance strategies because it considers the system as a whole</title><p>For all scenarios assessed (including those based on an incorrectly parametrised model), the optimised surveillance strategy outperformed all strategies based on risk metrics (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s005">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6</xref> Figs).

In the presence of an effective detection method, visiting either of these locations would give valuable information on the other, thereby effectively freeing up surveillance resources to be placed in the third site, even though the probability of infection in this site is lower. This complex interplay between the spread of the pathogen and the performance of the detection method requires the consideration of patterns of spread on a run-by-run basis, which lends itself naturally to simulation modelling, which can replicate large numbers of simulation realisations. These patterns cannot be explicitly captured using conventional targeted surveillance strategies based on risk metrics, which are commonly more focused on &#x02018;average&#x02019; patterns of spread, nor by other heuristic methods of site selection [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The use of an optimisation algorithm provides a valuable method of collating and interpreting these individual simulation model outputs.</p><fig id="pbio.3000863.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000863.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Maximising the probability to detect a pathogen is achieved not by selecting the highest-risk patches, but by spreading surveillance across all clusters of risk.</title><p>For ease of communication, we consider patch status as a dichotomous variable (which can be infected, shown in red, or uninfected, shown in green), rather than considering dynamic trends over time. We wish to sample the 2 patches that maximise the probability of detecting infection over all realisations (selected patches are shown with a blue dashed outline). The 2 &#x02018;strategy&#x02019; diagrams on the top each show 3 possible realisations of patch infection status, with the status of the upper 2 host patches correlated due to their proximity. We consider 2 selection strategies: one in which patches are selected based on their mean risk (Strategy 1) and one in which only one high-risk patch is selected and the remaining resources placed in the low risk patch (Strategy 2). If our detection method is perfect, we demonstrate that Strategy 2 outperforms Strategy 1 (being able to detect infection in each of the 3 realisations). The plot on the bottom shows how this is affected by the ability to detect infection in the patch (that is, the diagnostic sensitivity), with the detection probability under Strategy 1 shown in orange and that under Strategy 2 shown in red, for all sensitivity estimates between 0 and 1. In this particular example, the mean probability to detect under Strategy 1 is calculated as 2 * (1 &#x02212; (1 &#x02212; sensitivity)<sup>2</sup>)/3, whereas for Strategy 2 it is equal to the sensitivity. When the sensitivity is low, selection of a single high-risk patch is insufficient to reliably detect infection, and since infection is more common in the uppermost sites, the optimal strategy is therefore to place all the resources amongst these sites (that is, Strategy 1). However, this strategy will never detect the infection in Realisation 3. This limitation becomes more apparent as the diagnostic sensitivity is increased, and beyond a sensitivity of 0.5, Strategy 2 outperforms Strategy 1, with the difference in performance increasing as the sensitivity is increased.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.3000863.g007"/></fig><p>Although it was generally not possible to replicate the performance of the optimal strategy using the conventional targeted surveillance strategy of selecting sites according to site-specific risk metrics, we found that the product of the relative probability of introduction and the citrus density (which effectively describes the expected relative rate of pathogen entry in the model) gave the highest detection probability of the risk metrics we considered (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s005">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6</xref> Figs). This metric gave a clear improvement in comparison to random sampling or selection based upon relative rate of pathogen entry alone, likely reflecting the ability of this metric to capture both the probability of pathogen entry and its onwards spread (which would be expected to be associated with citrus density). This reinforces the importance of considering pathogen epidemiology when selecting surveillance sites and shares characteristics with our previous targeted surveillance strategy of quantifying risk as the product of the introduction probability and the magnitude of onward spread if introduction occurs [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We found that the performance of this risk metric was particularly high when the true rate of pathogen entry was very high and either matched or outperformed the (incorrectly specified) optimised strategy in these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>The performance of the detection method should be considered when planning where to conduct surveillance</title><p>An important component of our optimisation algorithm is the ability to explicitly account for parameters which influence the detection ability, but do not affect the epidemiological dynamics of the pest or pathogen itself. Our analysis shows that the performance of the detection method (that is, the diagnostic sensitivity) has a considerable impact on the optimal arrangement of surveillance resources, as well as on the overall detection probability. This finding is due to spatial autocorrelation in the status of individual sites, meaning that the status of each individual surveillance site is not independent of that of nearby sites. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g007">Fig 7</xref>, each site inspected provides some information on the status of nearby sites, but the amount of this information decreases as the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection method and/or the number of samples taken per site decreases (and the probability of detecting individual infected hosts decreases). This means that the optimal surveillance strategy for any given pathogen will differ when a highly sensitive detection method is used compared to when the sensitivity is low, with focused sampling in a smaller number of clusters of sites advisable in the latter case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In cases for which the test sensitivity and the number of hosts inspected taken per site are low, the value of optimising the surveillance strategy is reduced, and conventional targeted surveillance strategies may be more acceptable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Further work will investigate the impact of detection lag periods [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] on the optimal deployment of surveillance resources.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Uncertainty in the rate and pattern of introduction has a relatively small impact on where best to conduct surveillance</title><p>Although the ability to explicitly account for the processes of pathogen entry (&#x02018;primary infection&#x02019;) and onwards spread (&#x02018;secondary infection&#x02019;) is a particular strength of our method, in some cases there may be considerable uncertainty and/or variability in these processes, making them difficult to parametrise. We therefore investigated how the rate and distribution of pathogen entry impact on the optimal surveillance strategy. Whilst the impact of changing these parameters was relatively low, the optimal surveillance sites tended to be clustered in the sites of highest citrus density for high rates of pathogen entry, with surveillance in lower citrus density areas only being promoted as the rate was decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Despite these differences, the impact of misspecifying the rate and distribution of pathogen entry had a relatively small impact on the overall detection probability, which remained high in all scenarios considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that the detection probability for all site-selection methods increased as the rate of pathogen entry increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>), likely reflecting a greater spread of infected sites due to relatively less spread within the state. Investigation of the impact of changes in secondary spread patterns, as well as spread within and between different groups of hosts, will be considered in future work.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Conclusions for HLB surveillance</title><p>Under the baseline assumptions regarding spread and detection, our method suggests that the highest probability of early detection of HLB prior to 2005 would have been achieved by focussing surveillance efforts in 8 spatial clusters, mainly located in regions of high commercial citrus density in the centre of the peninsula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We estimate that this arrangement of surveillance sites would have given a high chance (97%) of detecting incursions before a state-wide prevalence of 1% was reached. This suggested arrangement differs from the actual surveillance implemented prior to the first detection of HLB in Florida in 2005, which was focused to the southeast of Lake Okeechobee, around Tampa in the west of the peninsula, and around Orlando [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], none of which are suggested by our method. However, we note that the site of the first detection [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was close to the southernmost of our predicted sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and subsequent positive detections to the northeast and southwest of Lake Okeechobee [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] were also identified as surveillance targets using our method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Our approach thus has potential implications for early detection programs in areas where HLB is a threat but has not yet been detected, including citrus production areas in Europe.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Surveillance aims</title><p>We focus our attention in the current report on surveillance for early detection rather than other surveillance aims such as prevalence estimation or spatial delimitation [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (although our method can be adapted to a variety of surveillance aims by adjusting the objective function). This allows us to concentrate on early stage pathogen spread, when spread dynamics are more predictable and thus easier to model (although we appreciate that there may be uncertainty in parameter estimates in these stages [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]). In doing so, we do not explicitly consider the impact of the disease (or any associated control measures). By instead focussing on the probability of detection before a prespecified prevalence threshold is reached, we are better able to explore the impact of epidemiological and diagnostic parameters on the optimal deployment of surveillance resources for early detection. This allows us to draw valuable insights into surveillance strategies, unencumbered by the influence of other factors such as control costs, and thus bears similarities with studies of how to improve sentinel surveillance strategies in networks [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (which, similarly, generally do not consider costs explicitly). On a practical level, our current approach also fits in well with the concept of &#x02018;maximum prevalence thresholds&#x02019; commonly specified when planning conventional regulatory surveillance for regulated pathogens [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], making it valuable in a practical context.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Capturing costs</title><p>Our method considers how best to deploy surveillance in order to maximise the probability of detection of new pathogen incursions. Whilst the detection probability is a valuable metric for evaluating surveillance, it does not itself explicitly capture the costs of surveillance and the costs of disease control at the time of first detection or the benefits of disease control associated with earlier detection (that is, the additional economic impact of disease and the disease management costs avoided). Indeed, our decision to exclude these factors from explicit consideration in our method sets it apart from much of the previous work on optimising and improving surveillance strategies. These studies commonly consider the economics of surveillance and control in unison [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], whether through the linking of optimisation routines with simulation models [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] or through the use of simulation models to explore the impact of different surveillance and control strategies in real-world landscapes [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The aim of these studies has therefore predominantly focused on identifying the optimal balance of surveillance and control intensity required to minimise the total economic impact of invasive species, which can offer valuable practical insights into how surveillance and control strategies interact. By considering surveillance in isolation of control, our approach offers a different perspective on this important issue and demonstrates how noneconomic factors can influence surveillance performance. We do not attempt to answer the question of whether surveillance is an economically viable strategy (that is, that the economic costs associated with earlier detection are lower than the costs associated with later detection). Instead, this should be considered when the &#x02018;maximum acceptable prevalence&#x02019; is determined. This could be achieved by fixing the surveillance intensity and estimating, for a range of different maximum acceptable prevalences, the expected costs of surveillance, disease impact, and disease management if detection occurs at or before this prevalence and the costs of disease impact and management in the absence of surveillance. Given that surveillance is economically feasible, the maximum acceptable prevalence could then be selected as the point at which the expected costs of surveillance are lowest.</p><p>By considering surveillance effort and the performance of the detection method used, our method does lend itself well to the capturing of the costs of surveillance itself in isolation from the costs of disease or control, which can be achieved by simply comparing the number of samples that need to be collected in order to achieve a given probability of detection. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6 Fig</xref>, which clearly demonstrate that at least twice as many samples would be required to achieve any given detection probability when conventional site-selection methods are used in contrast to the optimised approach. If we ignore the costs of travelling between sites (which are likely minimal in comparison to the costs of inspection and testing of hosts) and assume a fixed cost of surveillance per site, the use of conventional site-selection strategies would therefore be expected to at least double the costs of surveillance in comparison to the optimised approach. Based on the cost estimates described above, in order to achieve a mean detection probability of 0.95, the optimised strategy would cost US$8,859 per year, in contrast to the US$19,282 per year required to achieve the same mean detection probability using the best-performing conventional strategy. This therefore represents a potential saving of US$10,423 per year. Assuming in our particular case that the first pathogen entry occurred around 1 year after the start of surveillance and took an average of around 7 years to reach the threshold prevalence, this represents a total cost saving of US$83,384 when using the optimised approach. This is a considerable saving, considering the limited funds generally available for plant health monitoring and surveillance. The bulk of this cost is associated with PCR testing, and whilst savings could be made by only testing suspected cases, this would likely require the use of more highly trained surveyors, which would constitute an additional cost in itself. Further exploration of the optimal balance of these costs would be an interesting and valuable area for further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Further work</title><p>Although the current study is intended to explore optimal surveillance deployment rather than make concrete suggestions for implementation, further work will apply our method to current ongoing threats, such as the spread of Las in California [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>fastidiosa</italic> in Italy [<xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

</p><p>Dear Dr Mastin,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Optimising risk-based surveillance for early detection of invasive plant pathogens." for consideration as a Research Article at PLOS Biology. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by three independent reviewers.</p><p>You'll see that while all three reviewers are broadly positive about your study, they diverge regarding its readiness for publication in our journal. Only reviewer #2 is largely satisfied; reviewer #1 feels that the lack of biological insight drops it below the level required for PLOS Biology, and reviewer #3 is lacking an economic component.</p><p>After discussion with the Academic Editor, we think that adding the extra aspect requested by reviewer #3 would strengthen your study significantly, and we would also recommend that you switch the paper to our "Methods and Resources article type, which does not have a formal requirement for novel biological insight, and which probably suits your study better overall.</p><p>IMPORTANT:</p><p>a) When re-submitting, please select "Methods &#x00026; Resources" as the article type. No re-formatting is required, though we appreciate reviewer #2's comment about bringing some methodological detail further forward in the paper (and we note that our "methods at the end" structure is not a hard-and-fast rule).</p><p>b) Reviewer #2 also requests that you make the data and code for this paper available. We'd like to emphasise that this is PLOS policy, and will be essential for publication.</p><p>c) Regarding the request from reviewer #3 that you "add an economics layer," the Academic Editor says "The authors could be given a little more guidance on how to address the economic problem. If the method does indeed maximise the probability of detection before some specified threshold prevalence is reached, then it might be expected to be cost-effective relative to alternative methods. The authors could be asked to address the cost effectiveness question directly."</p><p>In light of the reviews (below), we will not be able to accept the current version of the manuscript, but we would welcome re-submission of a much-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent for further evaluation by the reviewers.</p><p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 2 months. Given the current Covid-19 crisis, however, we are prepared to show some flexibility in this timeline.</p><p>Please email us (<email>plosbiology@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to request an extension. At this stage, your manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal; please notify us by email if you do not intend to submit a revision so that we may end consideration of the manuscript at PLOS Biology.</p><p>**IMPORTANT - SUBMITTING YOUR REVISION**</p><p>Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. Please submit the following files along with your revised manuscript:</p><p>1.

Do not selectively quote paragraphs or sentences to reply to. The entire set of reviewer comments should be present in full and each specific point should be responded to individually, point by point.</p><p>You should also cite any additional relevant literature that has been published since the original submission and mention any additional citations in your response. </p><p>2. In addition to a clean copy of the manuscript, please also upload a 'track-changes' version of your manuscript that specifies the edits made. This should be uploaded as a "Related" file type. </p><p>*Re-submission Checklist*</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit your revised manuscript, please refer to this re-submission checklist: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plos.io/Biology_Checklist">https://plos.io/Biology_Checklist</ext-link></p><p>To submit a revised version of your manuscript, please go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author.

The strongest aspect of this study is that the model/approach is operational, meaning it can give managers specific locations to target, which a lot of previous studies lack. However, I do not think the results are well enough explained or understood from a biological perspective. We can see that the optimisation routine improves detection probabilities quite dramatically, but why? The authors provide plausible explanations but because everything is numeric and related to a case study parameterisation, I'm left feeling that I don't understand why the optimisation is working so well. Just showing the optimisation works well because it is taking into account the whole problem is not enough, as there is a lot of similar case-studies that show this too. I'd expect more insights and a more interesting scientific story than "we developed a model, used an optimisation routine to improve detection, and it did well." Lots of papers tell that sort of story. For example in the abstract, there is no strong specific scientific insights described in the case study. It is a good, interesting paper, with some novel bits, and it is definitely publishable as is, in a more specialist journal. In my opinion though for a journal like PLOS Biology, I expect more biological insights.</p><p>Some other comments</p><p>Ln 23 a common name or associated disease might be useful for non-specialists here</p><p>Please state the biological description of the objective function, e.g. your goal is to select the spatial arrangement and sampling intensity at sites to maximize the probability of detecting the disease. There are a lot of possible objective functions one could choose, so really important to be explicit before getting into the methods at the end of the paper.</p><p>Ln 336 - 360: I found this section especially strong. It relates to work on optimal surveillance in the invasive species/pest literature and why it's different from the approach considered here. The fact that this approach is operational is a major advancement over past work. Some of this could be hinted at in the intro too if space allows [lines 42-50 seem like a natural place].</p><p>Ln 400 - 426: Flag what you are optimising over, is n fixed and just optimising over Omega? Also this info is not part of the optimisation "algorithm" it is part of the problem formulation. The optimisation algorithm is simulated annealing. So subtitles are a bit misleading.</p><p>Ln 374 - 462: Even after reading the full simulation and optimisation description, it is really unclear whether this is being thought of as a dynamic or static optimisation problem. Can the sampler change sites between rounds for example? My inclination is no. There are fixed spots where sampling occurs and the optimization statically evaluates where to sample once, and then continues to repeat sampling there. If my interpretation is incorrect and there is something in the supplement that spells everything out, that bit needs to be moved to the main text. Only selecting your sites at the first time step seems like a bit of a drawback as this can influence where a manager might choose at the start, if they cannot sample a new site later. If I have this wrong, I think a schematic diagram describing the order of events in the sampling and simulation might be useful.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[identifies himself as Samuel Soubeyrand]</p><p>The authors propose an original approach for early detection of emerging infectious diseases of plants. This approach is grounded on a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread, a statistical model of detection and a stochastic optimisation algorithm (simulated annealing). It is compared to several alternative surveillance strategies, including risk-based strategies, under several epidemiological and detection scenarios, and is applied in a real context, namely the emergence of huanglongbing in Florida, USA.</p><p>This manuscript describes a very good piece of work that deserves to be published.</p><p>* The manuscript and the SI are well written even if the PLOS typical structure (intro - results - discussion - M&#x00026;M) does not facilitate the reading of such a methodological work. I do not request changing the order of the sections, but I think that locating l.197-208 (slightly rephrased) before the initial presentation of the Figures at the beginning of the Results section would be more convenient and ease the understanding of the figures. </p><p>* L.64-67 : This statement is, from my point of view, exaggerated. The authors present a definitely original work. However, anterior studies targeted quite close objectives. See e.g.:</p><p>- Colman&#x000a0;E, Holme&#x000a0;P, Sayama&#x000a0;H, Gershenson&#x000a0;C (2019)&#x000a0;Efficient sentinel surveillance strategies for preventing epidemics on networks.

(2019).&#x000a0;Identifying lookouts for epidemio-surveillance: application to the emergence of&#x000a0;Xylella fastidiosa&#x000a0;in France. Phytopathology 109: 265-276.&#x000a0;</p><p>I suggest to the authors to re-word the sentence by writing that they propose an original approach for addressing the question l.65-67.</p><p>* About the number of repetitions for the optimal strategy. In Figures 3, 4, 5 and S2, the number of repetitions ranges from 1 to 10 for the optimal strategy whereas it ranges from 100 to 1000 for the other strategies. I guess performing the optimal strategy is particularly time-consuming and this explains the use of a reduced number of repetitions (by the way, can the authors provide typical computer time required?). However, the ms would be more convincing with larger numbers of repetitions, especially for providing evidence 1) that a low diagnostic sensitivity or a high rate of pathogen entry leads to a few survey clusters, and 2) that the advantage of the optimal strategy is still significant under incorrect assumptions, for which one has only a single repetition. </p><p>* L.165: (C) should be replaced by (D) and (D) by (E), shouldn't they?</p><p>* L.234: Figure S2 instead of Figure S3, isn't it?</p><p>* L.354-357: [47] uses a network-based formalization indeed, but the nodes of the network actually correspond to the cells of a grid covering a continuous real landscape, as in the authors' work.</p><p>Moreover, the following articles dealing with the search of improved surveillance strategies for Sharka with spatially-explicit stochastic epidemic/observation models are closely related to the points discussed in the last paragraph of the discussion and could also be cited:</p><p>- Picard C., Soubeyrand S., Jacquot E., Th&#x000e9;baud G.

Phytopathology, PHYTO-05.&#x000a0;</p><p>- Rimbaud&#x000a0;L., Dallot S., Bruchou C., Thoyer S., Jacquot E., Soubeyrand S., Th&#x000e9;baud G. (2019).&#x000a0;Improving management strategies of plant diseases using sequential sensitivity analyses.&#x000a0;Phytopathology 109: 1184-1197.&#x000a0;</p><p>* For reproducibility reasons, for allowing the application of the authors' approach to other case studies, but also for allowing methodological work on the comparison of different optimization approaches for early detection, in the vein of the authors' proposal, it would be relevant to provide the data, the code of the simulator and the code of the surveillance strategies on referenced open-access archives. </p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>A spatially explicit model of disease spread is developed and applied to the economically damaging huanglongbing disease, to identify the arrangement of surveillance sites that maximise the probability of early detection. The authors are interested in understanding whether surveillance resources should be placed around a single high-risk site or spread across other potential introduction sites as well. Mainland Florida is used as the case study application.</p><p>Given that the problem addressed in this paper is one of optimal resource allocation, my comments and concerns focus on the absence of any economic variables in the model. This is despite the importance of economic factors being alluded to: e.g. (line 38) "&#x02026; an effective early detection strategy is complicated by &#x02026; limited financial and logistical resources."; (lines 33-34) "the 'maximum accepted prevalence' will be impacted by &#x02026; likely impact, and the availability and feasibility of control measures."; and (line 49-50) "there is a risk that the surveillance strategy may not be optimally targeted; resulting in &#x02026; excessive costs"; (line 221) "&#x02026; demonstrating the value of targeted surveillance strategies &#x02026;".</p><p>So, despite discussion about the importance of considering the performance of the detection method and spatial arrangement, we have no information about the economically optimal strategy. There is no indication of the various costs involved in their surveillance strategies - the assumption is therefore an unlimited budget. Pest managers, who regularly decide how to spend limited resources on disease control, would require information on the costs and trade-offs involved in various surveillance strategies in order to make these complicated resource allocation decisions. In essence, to obtain the greatest benefits from investing scarce resources, surveillance design must explicitly balance the cost of surveillance with the costs of allowing invading populations to go undetected longer (Epanchin-Neill et al., 2014). </p><p>In my view, therefore, the model is incomplete -an economics layer needs to be included in the model and the analysis before the article can be considered for publishing. I leave this to the authors to decide on the best way of including the economics. Note that while some of the important literature on early detection that includes both biology and economics is cited, the authors appear to be critical of these papers in their focus on the optimal balance of early detection surveillance and control intensity required to minimise costs (lines 61-63 and 348-353). Others articles worth reviewing are Kean and Stringer (2019); and Epanchin-Neill and Hastings, 2010).</p><p>Linked to the above, the authors claim that no previous studies have addressed the question of where surveillance resources should be located to maximise the probability of detecting an invading pathogen before it reaches a certain prevalence. I would suggest this is because in those previous studies the authors have chosen to solve the much more relevant and pressing problem of developing surveillance strategies that balance the cost and benefits involved in particular designs.</p><p>Line 33: 'maximum acceptable prevalence': how is this determined, and could it based on balancing the cost of surveillance with the costs of allowing invading populations to go undetected longer? </p><p>Line 78-79: "How easy is it to implement this new strategy" - what does 'easy' mean in this context and how will it be evaluated?</p><p>Line 86: what is meant by 'general surveillance'?</p><p>Line 189-190: the model uses a pre-defined 'threshold prevalence' of 1% to indicate the point at which control would no longer be possible. This seems like an arbitrary value, and some additional explanation is required. For example, has the value of control at a prevalence of 1% been estimated? What is 'control'?</p><p>Table 1: 'pathogen entry', could additional explanation be provided on how entry is 'seeded' - is it a random process in a particular cell?</p><p>In summary, adding an economic component to the model would make it a very publishable paper.</p><p>References</p><p>Bradhurst, R.

</p><p>Dear Dr Mastin,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised Research Article entitled "Optimising risk-based surveillance for early detection of invasive plant pathogens." for publication in PLOS Biology. I have now obtained advice from two of the original reviewers and have discussed their comments with the Academic Editor. </p><p>Based on the reviews, we will probably accept this manuscript for publication, assuming that you will modify the manuscript to address the remaining points raised by the reviewers. Please also make sure to address the data and other policy-related requests noted at the end of this email.</p><p>IMPORTANT:</p><p>a) Please attend to the remaining requests from reviewer #3.</p><p>b) Please address my Data Policy requests (see further down).</p><p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within two weeks. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. In addition to the remaining revisions and before we will be able to formally accept your manuscript and consider it "in press", we also need to ensure that your article conforms to our guidelines. A member of our team will be in touch shortly with a set of requests. As we can't proceed until these requirements are met, your swift response will help prevent delays to publication.</p><p>*Copyediting*</p><p>Upon acceptance of your article, your final files will be copyedited and typeset into the final PDF. While you will have an opportunity to review these files as proofs, PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling or significant scientific errors. Therefore, please take this final revision time to assess and make any remaining major changes to your manuscript.</p><p>NOTE: If Supporting Information files are included with your article, note that these are not copyedited and will be published as they are submitted. Please ensure that these files are legible and of high quality (at least 300 dpi) in an easily accessible file format. For this reason, please be aware that any references listed in an SI file will not be indexed. For more information, see our Supporting Information guidelines:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/supporting-information">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/supporting-information</ext-link>
</p><p>*Published Peer Review History*</p><p>Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. Please see here for more details:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/</ext-link></p><p>*Early Version*</p><p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p><p>*Protocols deposition*</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods</ext-link>
</p><p>*Submitting Your Revision*</p><p>To submit your revision, please go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author.

For more information, please also see this editorial: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797</ext-link>
</p><p>Note that we do not require all raw data. Rather, we ask that all individual quantitative observations that underlie the data summarized in the figures and results of your paper be made available in one of the following forms:</p><p>1) Supplementary files (e.g., excel). Please ensure that all data files are uploaded as 'Supporting Information' and are invariably referred to (in the manuscript, figure legends, and the Description field when uploading your files) using the following format verbatim: S1 Data, S2 Data, etc. Multiple panels of a single or even several figures can be included as multiple sheets in one excel file that is saved using exactly the following convention: S1_Data.xlsx (using an underscore).</p><p>2) Deposition in a publicly available repository. Please also provide the accession code or a reviewer link so that we may view your data before publication. </p><p>Regardless of the method selected, please ensure that you provide the individual numerical values that underlie the summary data displayed in all main and Suppementary Figure panels as they are essential for readers to assess your analysis and to reproduce it. NOTE: the numerical data provided should include all replicates AND the way in which the plotted mean and errors were derived (it should not present only the mean/average values).</p><p>Please also ensure that figure legends in your manuscript include information on where the underlying data can be found, and ensure your supplemental data file/s has a legend.</p><p>Please ensure that your Data Statement in the submission system accurately describes where your data can be found.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have mostly addressed all my comments adequately. The abstract is especially more insightful, adding the "correlation" component, I can now better understand why its working. I think the new format is also beneficial. My only issue is that it is not explicitly stated in the optimisation summary whether n is fixed beforehand, or whether sets of sites that vary in size are considered by the optimization routine. I assume the latter, but the text makes it seem like the former, but doesn't explicitly say so.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper, as suggested in the abstract (line 5) is about "how best to target surveillance resources to achieve [detection of epidemics at an early stage]". This is therefore a problem about optimal resource allocation, thus the costs and benefits of control must be considered properly. I acknowledge that the discussion of the economics aspects of the problem has improved - e.g. control costs have been included -but the benefits of control (damages/impact avoided because control is applied) are also an important consideration and are not fully discussed. There is a trade-off between spending on surveillance for HLB and the cost of controlling future spread which would otherwise cause damage. This trade-off will also be important in choosing the 'threshold prevalence', but is still absent from the discussion.</p><p>When considering threshold prevalence the authors acknowledged that this represents 'the highest prevalence at which control could still be feasible'. The term 'feasible' is key, and again, has economic connotations that can't be ignored. Feasibility includes the costs of control and the benefits of control - the damages that are avoided because of control. Benefits should be incorporated into the discussion.</p><p>Other comments have been dealt with appropriately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pbio.3000863.r005" article-type="author-comment"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000863.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3000863" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
