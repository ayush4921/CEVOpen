 <caption> Distribution of mean end prevalence estimates under different patterns of pathogen entry, demonstrating the increase in variability when pathogen entry is more variable. These plots demonstrate the impact of varying the characteristics of pathogen entry into the state on the mean prevalence at the point the state-wide prevalence threshold of 1% is reached. Plots A–C show the mean prevalence when the probability of pathogen entry into any given site is affected by the density of citrus host and the travel census probabilities, and plots D–F show the mean prevalence when only the citrus density influences the probability of pathogen entry. Plots A and D show a ‘low’ mean rate of pathogen entry up to 0.05 entries per year, B and E show a ‘medium’ mean rate of up to 0.5 entries per year, and C and F show a ‘high’ rate of up to 5 entries per year. Higher rates of entry result in more variability in end prevalence estimates throughout the state.
