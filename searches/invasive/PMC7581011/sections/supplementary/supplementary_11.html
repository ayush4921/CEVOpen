 <caption> Impact of varying rate of pathogen entry on detection probability and numbers of clusters. These plots show the impact of rate of pathogen entry on the detection probability and number of clusters of sites within 20 km of each other for the different site-selection strategies explored in the manuscript. Plots A and B show the impact of varying the rate of pathogen entry on the overall mean probability of detection (A) and the total number of clusters (B) when the probability of pathogen entry into any given site is affected by the density of citrus host and the travel census probabilities. Plots C and D show the impact of varying the rate of pathogen entry on the overall mean probability of detection (C) and the total number of clusters (D) when only the citrus density influences the probability of pathogen entry. All estimates are taken from 100 realisations for both the optimised sites and sites selected using different risk metrics. These metrics are the product of travel census probabilities and citrus density (‘Entry and spread’), citrus density, probability of entry according to the travel census model (‘Pathogen entry’), and random selection from the landscape.
