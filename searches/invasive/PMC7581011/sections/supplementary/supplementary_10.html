 <caption> Impact of rate and distribution of pathogen entry on optimal targeting of surveillance. These plots show the spatial arrangement of optimal sites (taken from a single optimisation run) and clusters of these sites, along with the detection probability, when the rate of pathogen entry is varied. Plots A–C show the distribution when the probability of pathogen entry into any given site is affected by the density of citrus host and the travel census probabilities. Plots D–F show the distribution when only the citrus density influences the probability of pathogen entry. Plots A and D show a ‘low’ mean rate of pathogen entry up to 0.05 entries per year, B and E show a ‘medium’ mean rate of up to 0.5 entries per year, and C and F show a ‘high’ rate of up to 5 entries per year. Estimates of the number of clusters and the probability of detection under the different sampling patterns are also shown. The data used to create these plots can be found at https://doi.org/10.17866/rd.salford.12759929.v1 (file ‘spatialData_primaryInf.csv’). (TIF) </caption>
