 <caption> Impact of varying test sensitivity on detection probability and numbers of clusters. These plots show the effect of varying the test sensitivity and different site-selection strategies on the detection probability and number of clusters of selected sites. Each of 100 individual site selection runs are shown per selection strategy, along with the locally weighted regression curve. Plot A shows the impact on the probability of detection, and plot B shows the impact on the total number of clusters (with a cluster being all points within 20 km of each other). As well as the optimised strategy, sites were selected using 4 site-specific risk metrics: the product of travel census probabilities and citrus density (‘Entry and spread’), citrus density, probability of entry according to the travel census model (‘Pathogen entry’), and random selection from the landscape. The data used to create these plots can be found at https://doi.org/10.17866/rd.salford.12759929.v1 (file ‘optimisationOutputs_testSens.csv’). (TIF) </caption>
