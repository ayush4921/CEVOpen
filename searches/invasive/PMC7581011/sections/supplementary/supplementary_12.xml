  <title>Impact of varying the sampling interval on the detection probability.</title>
  <p>This plot shows the detection probability when the interval between sampling rounds is varied for both the optimised approach and a selection of different conventional targeted approaches using a variety of different metrics. All nonoptimised estimates are the mean of 1,000 sampling realisations in which the probability of site selection was based upon the site-specific measure of interest. These measures are the product of travel census probabilities and citrus density (‘Entry and spread’), citrus density, probability of entry according to the travel census model (‘Pathogen entry’), or random selection from the landscape. The optimised estimates are the mean of 10 optimisation runs. The dashed line indicates the ‘baseline’ scenario considered in the manuscript. The data used to create these plots can be found at
