 <caption> Impact of varying number of sites surveyed. This plot shows the effect of varying the number of sites on the detection probability under a range of selection strategies. A total of 100 site selection runs were performed for each strategy and a locally weighted regression curve was fit to each. As well as the optimised strategy, sites were selected using 4 site-specific risk metrics: the product of travel census probabilities and citrus density (‘Entry and spread’), citrus density, probability of entry according to the travel census model (‘Pathogen entry’), and random (that is, unweighted) selection. Estimates of the probability of detection were made for all numbers of sites between 1 and 50 for all selection methods and additionally for all numbers of sites between 51 and 150 for the risk metric strategies. The horizontal dashed line shows a detection probability of 0.95, and the vertical dashed lines shows the mean number of sites required to achieve this detection probability under the different sampling strategies.
