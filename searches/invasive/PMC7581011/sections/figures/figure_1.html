 <caption> Simulation model upon which the optimisation is based. Plot A shows the distribution of citrus trees (which also represents the relative rate of introduction under the assumption of a ‘flat’ distribution of pathogen entry). Plot B shows the distribution of the relative risk of introduction according to the ‘travel census’ model (which is combined with the citrus density to estimate the relative distribution of introductions under the ‘variable’ model [that is, the ‘baseline’ model]). Plots C and D show the mean end prevalence if introductions are based only on citrus density (‘flat’ pathogen entry, C) or both citrus density and travel census risk (‘variable’ pathogen entry, D). Plots E and F show the 5 th–95th percentiles of the disease progression curves under each of these assumptions, with greater intensity of colouration for percentiles approaching the median (shown as a solid line). The data used to create these plots can be found at https://doi.org/10.17866/rd.salford.12759929.v1 (files ‘spatialData_baselines.csv’, ‘dpcData.csv’, and ‘dpcSummary.csv’). </caption>
