 <caption> Arrangement of sampling sites under different selection schemes. These plots show the distribution of selected sites for 1 case of optimised selection and 2 alternative risk-based approaches based upon the mean end prevalence obtained from the simulation model. Plot A shows the sites selected to maximise the probability of detection when using simulated annealing. The progression of the detection probability over the first 15,000 iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm is shown in plot B, with the solid black line indicating the final detection probability after 100,000 iterations. Plot C shows the 20 sites with the highest mean end prevalence over all realisations, and plot D shows 1 arrangement of 20 sites selected with a probability proportional to the mean end prevalence. Clusters (defined as sites within 20 km of each other) are shown in distinct colours in plots A, C, and D. Estimates of the number of clusters and the probability of detection under the different sampling patterns are also shown. The data used to create these plots can be found at https://doi.org/10.17866/rd.salford.12759929.v1 (files ‘spatialData_baselines.csv’ and ‘ofProgressionExample.csv’). </caption>
