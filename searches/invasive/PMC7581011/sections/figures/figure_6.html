 <caption> Impact of incorrect assumptions on performance of different site-selection methods. These plots show the mean detection probability under different site-selection methods for different rates and patterns of pathogen entry. Plot A shows the detection probability when pathogen entry follows the travel census model, and plot B shows the same when entry is only affected by the citrus density. In all cases, sites were selected under the baseline model assumptions (that is, a maximal rate of pathogen entry equal to 0.05/year and a distribution of entry based upon the travel census model, as shown in the vertical dashed line). Each selection method was repeated 100 times, with each individual detection probability shown as a coloured point. The mean detection probability is shown as a black-bordered point, and a locally weighted regression curve is overlaid to better illustrate the trends. The risk metrics used for conventional targeted selection represent the product of travel census probabilities and citrus density (‘Entry and spread’), citrus density, the probability of entry according to the travel census model (‘Pathogen entry’), and random selection from the landscape. The data used to create these plots can be found at https://doi.org/10.17866/rd.salford.12759929.v1 (file ‘modelMisspecification.csv’). </caption>
