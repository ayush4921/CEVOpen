 <caption> Impact of test sensitivity on optimal sampling pattern. These plots show an example of the optimal distribution of sampling sites and clusters (points within 20 km of each other; shown in distinct colours) when the probability of correctly identifying any sampled infected tree (the diagnostic sensitivity) is low (0.01; plot A), medium (0.50; plot B), and high (1.00; plot C). The data used to create these plots can be found at https://doi.org/10.17866/rd.salford.12759929.v1 (file ‘spatialData_baselines.csv’). </caption>
