 <p>Emerging infectious diseases of plants continue to devastate ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide. By linking a mathematical model of pest spread with a computational optimisation routine, this study identifies where to look for invasive pests if we wish to detect them at an early stage; this method improves upon conventional methods of risk-based surveillance and is robust to model misspecification.</p>
