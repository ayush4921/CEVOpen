<p>This paper, as suggested in the abstract (line 5) is about "how best to target surveillance resources to achieve [detection of epidemics at an early stage]". This is therefore a problem about optimal resource allocation, thus the costs and benefits of control must be considered properly. I acknowledge that the discussion of the economics aspects of the problem has improved - e.g. control costs have been included -but the benefits of control (damages/impact avoided because control is applied) are also an important consideration and are not fully discussed. There is a trade-off between spending on surveillance for HLB and the cost of controlling future spread which would otherwise cause damage. This trade-off will also be important in choosing the 'threshold prevalence', but is still absent from the discussion.</p>
