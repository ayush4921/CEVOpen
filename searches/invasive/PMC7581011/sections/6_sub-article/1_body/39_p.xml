<p>The authors have mostly addressed all my comments adequately. The abstract is especially more insightful, adding the "correlation" component, I can now better understand why its working. I think the new format is also beneficial. My only issue is that it is not explicitly stated in the optimisation summary whether n is fixed beforehand, or whether sets of sites that vary in size are considered by the optimization routine. I assume the latter, but the text makes it seem like the former, but doesn't explicitly say so.</p>
