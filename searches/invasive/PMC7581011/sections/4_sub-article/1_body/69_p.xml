<p>So, despite discussion about the importance of considering the performance of the detection method and spatial arrangement, we have no information about the economically optimal strategy. There is no indication of the various costs involved in their surveillance strategies - the assumption is therefore an unlimited budget. Pest managers, who regularly decide how to spend limited resources on disease control, would require information on the costs and trade-offs involved in various surveillance strategies in order to make these complicated resource allocation decisions. In essence, to obtain the greatest benefits from investing scarce resources, surveillance design must explicitly balance the cost of surveillance with the costs of allowing invading populations to go undetected longer (Epanchin-Neill et al., 2014). </p>
