<p>In my view, therefore, the model is incomplete -an economics layer needs to be included in the model and the analysis before the article can be considered for publishing. I leave this to the authors to decide on the best way of including the economics. Note that while some of the important literature on early detection that includes both biology and economics is cited, the authors appear to be critical of these papers in their focus on the optimal balance of early detection surveillance and control intensity required to minimise costs (lines 61-63 and 348-353). Others articles worth reviewing are Kean and Stringer (2019); and Epanchin-Neill and Hastings, 2010).</p>
