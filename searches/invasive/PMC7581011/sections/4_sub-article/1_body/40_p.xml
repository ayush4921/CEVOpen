<p>This is a very interesting paper comparing the benefits of using a spatially explicit simulation model and optimisation to improve surveillance for achieving higher pest detection probabilities. The strongest aspect of this study is that the model/approach is operational, meaning it can give managers specific locations to target, which a lot of previous studies lack. However, I do not think the results are well enough explained or understood from a biological perspective. We can see that the optimisation routine improves detection probabilities quite dramatically, but why? The authors provide plausible explanations but because everything is numeric and related to a case study parameterisation, I'm left feeling that I don't understand why the optimisation is working so well. Just showing the optimisation works well because it is taking into account the whole problem is not enough, as there is a lot of similar case-studies that show this too. I'd expect more insights and a more interesting scientific story than "we developed a model, used an optimisation routine to improve detection, and it did well." Lots of papers tell that sort of story. For example in the abstract, there is no strong specific scientific insights described in the case study. It is a good, interesting paper, with some novel bits, and it is definitely publishable as is, in a more specialist journal. In my opinion though for a journal like PLOS Biology, I expect more biological insights.</p>
