<p>A spatially explicit model of disease spread is developed and applied to the economically damaging huanglongbing disease, to identify the arrangement of surveillance sites that maximise the probability of early detection. The authors are interested in understanding whether surveillance resources should be placed around a single high-risk site or spread across other potential introduction sites as well. Mainland Florida is used as the case study application.</p>
