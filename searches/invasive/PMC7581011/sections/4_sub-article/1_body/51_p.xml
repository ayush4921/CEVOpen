<p>* The manuscript and the SI are well written even if the PLOS typical structure (intro - results - discussion - M&amp;M) does not facilitate the reading of such a methodological work. I do not request changing the order of the sections, but I think that locating l.197-208 (slightly rephrased) before the initial presentation of the Figures at the beginning of the Results section would be more convenient and ease the understanding of the figures. </p>
