<p>Ln 374 - 462: Even after reading the full simulation and optimisation description, it is really unclear whether this is being thought of as a dynamic or static optimisation problem. Can the sampler change sites between rounds for example? My inclination is no. There are fixed spots where sampling occurs and the optimization statically evaluates where to sample once, and then continues to repeat sampling there. If my interpretation is incorrect and there is something in the supplement that spells everything out, that bit needs to be moved to the main text. Only selecting your sites at the first time step seems like a bit of a drawback as this can influence where a manager might choose at the start, if they cannot sample a new site later. If I have this wrong, I think a schematic diagram describing the order of events in the sampling and simulation might be useful.</p>
