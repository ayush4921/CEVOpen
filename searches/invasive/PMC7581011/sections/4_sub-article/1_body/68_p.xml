<p>Given that the problem addressed in this paper is one of optimal resource allocation, my comments and concerns focus on the absence of any economic variables in the model. This is despite the importance of economic factors being alluded to: e.g. (line 38) "… an effective early detection strategy is complicated by … limited financial and logistical resources."; (lines 33-34) "the 'maximum accepted prevalence' will be impacted by … likely impact, and the availability and feasibility of control measures."; and (line 49-50) "there is a risk that the surveillance strategy may not be optimally targeted; resulting in … excessive costs"; (line 221) "… demonstrating the value of targeted surveillance strategies …".</p>
