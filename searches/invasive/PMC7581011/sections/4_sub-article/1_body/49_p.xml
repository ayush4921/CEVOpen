<p>The authors propose an original approach for early detection of emerging infectious diseases of plants. This approach is grounded on a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread, a statistical model of detection and a stochastic optimisation algorithm (simulated annealing). It is compared to several alternative surveillance strategies, including risk-based strategies, under several epidemiological and detection scenarios, and is applied in a real context, namely the emergence of huanglongbing in Florida, USA.</p>
