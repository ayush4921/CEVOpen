<p>* About the number of repetitions for the optimal strategy. In Figures 3, 4, 5 and S2, the number of repetitions ranges from 1 to 10 for the optimal strategy whereas it ranges from 100 to 1000 for the other strategies. I guess performing the optimal strategy is particularly time-consuming and this explains the use of a reduced number of repetitions (by the way, can the authors provide typical computer time required?). However, the ms would be more convincing with larger numbers of repetitions, especially for providing evidence 1) that a low diagnostic sensitivity or a high rate of pathogen entry leads to a few survey clusters, and 2) that the advantage of the optimal strategy is still significant under incorrect assumptions, for which one has only a single repetition. </p>
