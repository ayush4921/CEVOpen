<p>The simulation model is described in more detail in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The model runs on a gridded landscape of 1 km Ã— 1 km cells, each containing a density of citrus informed by maps of commercial citrus densities (provided by the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [USDA-APHIS]) and estimates of residential citrus densities (calculated from population data at the census tract level obtained from the US Census Bureau [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). Individual cells transition stochastically from a susceptible to an infected status in continuous time, driven by pathogen spread from outside the landscape as well as secondary spread within the landscape. Secondary (between-cell) spread occurs according to an exponential dispersal kernel, fitted to data as described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Following first infection, each cell becomes more infectious (and detectable) as infection bulks up locally, again at a rate parametrised using available data. This increase in infectiousness and detectability following detection is deterministic, allowing us to estimate the proportion of both infected and symptomatic plants in each cell at any point in time (given the timing of infection in each cell is known, which will vary for each simulation run). By running this stochastic model a large number of times, we are able to capture the inherent variability in spatiotemporal spread and explicitly account for this when considering the optimal arrangement of surveillance sites.
