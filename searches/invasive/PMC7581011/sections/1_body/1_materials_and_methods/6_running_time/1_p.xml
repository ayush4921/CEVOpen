<p>The time required to run the simulation model and the optimisation will depend on the nature of the landscape and the patterns of spatial spread. However, on a 3.00-GHz Intel Xeon processor (Santa Clara, CA, USA), running 1,000 realisations of spread through the state of Florida (using the ‘baseline model’ parametrisation) takes 166 seconds. Running a single optimisation (again using the baseline parametrisation) with 100,000 iterations on this output requires 411 seconds. This gives a total of 577 seconds.</p>
