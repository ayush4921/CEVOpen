<p>Parameter values for the simulation model (
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were selected using a combination of statistical model fitting, iterative parameter adjustment, and published data and are described in more detail in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Because of the level of uncertainty in the rate and distribution of pathogen entry into the state (especially resulting from informal, unreported host movements), we ran different scenarios for these parameters. We considered ‘low’, ‘moderate’, and ‘high’ rates of pathogen entry, for each of which we modelled 2 different spatial patterns of entry:
