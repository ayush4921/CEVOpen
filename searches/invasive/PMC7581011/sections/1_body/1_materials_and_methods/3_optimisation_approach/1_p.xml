<p>We consider a set Ω of 
 <italic>N</italic> 1-km square grid cells, from within each of which 
 <italic>n</italic> hosts are assessed (using a detection method with given performance characteristics) every Δ
 <italic>t</italic> units of time. We aim to identify which Ω (that is, arrangement of surveillance sites) gives the highest probability of detection (
 <italic>p</italic>(Ω, 
 <italic>n</italic>, Δ
 <italic>t</italic>)) before the state-wide prevalence threshold is reached. In the current study, we allowed each site to be selected only once. Because complete enumeration of all possible arrangements is not feasible for a problem of this scale, we used a stochastic optimisation algorithm, simulated annealing, with an exponential cooling schedule [
