<p>We consider here how best to deploy surveillance resources in order to maximise the probability of detection before a specified ‘maximum acceptable prevalence’ is reached. To do this, we developed a grid-based, stochastic, spatially explicit, landscape-scale model and repeatedly simulated pathogen spread through this landscape until this prevalence was reached. Although the model is pathogen-generic, we parametrised it to replicate early stage spread of Las in Florida. We then used an optimisation routine (simulated annealing) in order to identify which arrangement of a specified number of sites, with a fixed number of samples collected per site, would give the highest mean probability of detection over all simulation model realisations, given a particular frequency of sampling using a detection method with known performance characteristics (the probability of correctly identifying infected hosts—the diagnostic sensitivity—and growth in detectability over time).</p>
