<p>We evaluated how well more conventional targeted surveillance approaches perform in comparison to the optimal sites by creating ‘risk metrics’ accounting for a range of different levels of knowledge about the entry, establishment, and spread of Las (described in the Results). These metrics were allocated to individual sites and the specified number of sites selected (without replacement) with probability proportional to the metric. We repeated this process 100 times for each metric and recorded the detection probability for each run using the data set of 1,000 runs used to estimate the detection probability for the optimal sites.</p>
