  <p>Estimating the mean detection probability. This was performed as described above, using a data set of 1,000 model simulation outputs distinct from those to which the optimisation was applied.</p>

  <p>Visualising and quantifying the spatial arrangement of selected sites by identifying ‘clusters’ of selected sites. We used a single-linkage agglomerative clustering method to group sites within 20 km of each other (this distance was selected as representative of the mean annual dispersal distance of HLB in Florida [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). The distribution of these clusters assists in the visualisation of the general arrangement of selected sites, and the total number of clusters provides a useful summary statistic (with lower values indicating more clustering).
