<p>Developing an effective early detection surveillance strategy is complicated by the need to survey large, heterogeneous, areas of landscape over an indefinite timespan in the face of limited financial and logistical resources. Whilst it is well accepted that attention must be focused on sampling enough hosts regularly enough for the likely prevalence at first detection to be acceptably low [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in which the types of hosts or locations judged most likely to contain the pest or pathogen are preferentially selected for inspection or sampling [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the merits of targeted surveillance are well recognised, most work to date has focused on identifying static ‘high-risk’ groups and locations using statistical models [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although these methods of planning targeted surveillance are a valuable and versatile method of quantifying the infection risk amongst different groups, they do not explicitly account for the epidemiological processes that determine where and, importantly, when a pathogen will be present. As a result, there is a risk that the surveillance strategy may not be optimally targeted, resulting in low performance and/or excessive costs—both of which can ultimately lead to surveillance system failure.
