<p>To demonstrate our method in the context of a pressing example, we use HLB (also known as citrus greening)—a high-profile, devastating disease of citrus trees—in the US state of Florida as a case study. HLB is caused by the bacterium 
 <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) and spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, 
 <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic>, which has been established in Florida as an invasive species since at least 1998 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. HLB is currently endemic in the state, where it decimated the citrus industry in less than a decade following first detection in 2005 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We consider here a scenario prior to this incursion, in which the psyllid is present but Las is absent from the state, but in which there is an immediate and ongoing risk of introduction of Las through human movements from other currently infected areas (such as Brazil and China). We use different estimates of where and how often the pathogen is introduced to the state in order to capture the inherent uncertainty in these processes and investigate how these influence the optimal surveillance strategy.
