<p>We propose and test a novel, to our knowledge, approach to surveillance planning that explicitly accounts for the spatial spread of a pathogen and that can be readily and easily applied to any pest or pathogen of interest. Using a spatially explicit, stochastic, epidemiological model, we represent the processes of pathogen introduction and onward spread across a real-world host landscape, continuing these simulations until a predefined threshold prevalence is exceeded. We then couple these simulation outputs to a stochastic optimisation algorithm designed to select those surveillance sites that maximise the probability of detection of the pathogen, allowing for a range of logistical parameters, such as different sampling intensities and detection abilities. We use this optimisation method approach to answer the question of where in a landscape surveillance should be targeted if we are to maximise the probability of detecting new pathogen incursions before the threshold prevalence is reached. We interpret our results by focussing on the following questions:</p>
