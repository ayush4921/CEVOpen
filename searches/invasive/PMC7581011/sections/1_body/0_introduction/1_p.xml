<p>The collapse of the American chestnut population in the eastern United States in the early 20th century [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the English elm in 1960s and 1970s UK [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], tan oak and coast live oak in the western United States over the last 30 years [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the citrus industry in Florida since 2005 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have all resulted from the emergence of pathogens that were not previously present. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as these are an increasing threat to wild and cultivated plants worldwide [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In some cases, EIDs may be established pathogens that have moved into new areas, as exemplified by the ongoing spread of the bacterium causing the citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) in the US [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a competent vector of this pathogen in Europe [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In other cases, completely new pathogen strains may emerge, as seen with the emergence of the CoDiRO strain of 
 <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> (
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>fastidiosa</italic> subsp. pauca, sequence type [ST]53: the cause of olive quick decline syndrome) in Italy [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and new strains of 
 <italic>Puccinia graminis</italic> (the cause of wheat stem rust) worldwide [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although changes in farming practices, land use, and climate are important drivers of these processes [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], most attention to date has focused on the global movement of people, plants, and plant products through travel and trade [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, efforts to target these pathways directly through movement restrictions, quarantine, and border inspection [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] often fail [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], allowing pathogens to enter and potentially establish and spread to levels at which control efforts are infeasible [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a result, it is increasingly recognised that surveillance activities must already be in place in the region of interest before pathogen entry [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and must be capable of detection before the prevalence (that is, the proportion of the host population that is infected) exceeds the point at which control is almost certain to be no longer possible. This ‘maximum acceptable prevalence’ will be impacted by factors such as the epidemiology of the pest, its likely impact, and the availability and feasibility of control measures.
