<p>The inability of conventional risk-based strategies to account explicitly for the epidemiology of a pest or pathogen also has important implications for early detection surveillance planning. To take a simple example, a common targeted surveillance strategy for EIDs is to focus on areas where the pathogen is more likely to first enter [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, conventional methods do not tell us whether resources should all be placed around the single highest-risk site or spread across other potential introduction sites as well. Such questions can be answered by considering the placement of surveillance resources as an optimisation problem [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By linking spatial and/or temporal simulation models that replicate the spread of the pest or pathogen to computational optimisation routines to identify particular sampling patterns, precise surveillance and/or control strategies that minimise the impact of the pest or pathogen can be identified [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although much work to date has focused on identifying how best to conduct surveys in order to achieve certain disease management or mitigation objectives whilst considering spatial spread of a pest or pathogen [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and on the value of different network metrics for identifying hosts to target for surveillance [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], there has been little work on the optimal deployment of surveillance resources for early pest or pathogen detection that explicitly considers the spread of the agent through a real-world landscape. No previous study has addressed the pivotal question: where exactly should surveillance resources be located to maximise the probability to detect an invading pathogen before it reaches a certain prevalence?
