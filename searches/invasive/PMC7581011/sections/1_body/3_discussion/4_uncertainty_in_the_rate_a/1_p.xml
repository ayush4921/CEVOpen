<p>Although the ability to explicitly account for the processes of pathogen entry (‘primary infection’) and onwards spread (‘secondary infection’) is a particular strength of our method, in some cases there may be considerable uncertainty and/or variability in these processes, making them difficult to parametrise. We therefore investigated how the rate and distribution of pathogen entry impact on the optimal surveillance strategy. Whilst the impact of changing these parameters was relatively low, the optimal surveillance sites tended to be clustered in the sites of highest citrus density for high rates of pathogen entry, with surveillance in lower citrus density areas only being promoted as the rate was decreased (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>), likely reflecting a greater spread of infected sites due to relatively less spread within the state. Investigation of the impact of changes in secondary spread patterns, as well as spread within and between different groups of hosts, will be considered in future work.
