<p>Under the baseline assumptions regarding spread and detection, our method suggests that the highest probability of early detection of HLB prior to 2005 would have been achieved by focussing surveillance efforts in 8 spatial clusters, mainly located in regions of high commercial citrus density in the centre of the peninsula (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We estimate that this arrangement of surveillance sites would have given a high chance (97%) of detecting incursions before a state-wide prevalence of 1% was reached. This suggested arrangement differs from the actual surveillance implemented prior to the first detection of HLB in Florida in 2005, which was focused to the southeast of Lake Okeechobee, around Tampa in the west of the peninsula, and around Orlando [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], none of which are suggested by our method. However, we note that the site of the first detection [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was close to the southernmost of our predicted sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and subsequent positive detections to the northeast and southwest of Lake Okeechobee [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] were also identified as surveillance targets using our method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Our approach thus has potential implications for early detection programs in areas where HLB is a threat but has not yet been detected, including citrus production areas in Europe.
