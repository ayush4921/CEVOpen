<p>Our method also goes beyond the simple maxim of not putting all eggs in one basket by suggesting precisely which number of baskets should be used and where they should be. We find that the answer to these questions is particularly affected by the performance of the detection method being used (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Although the exact selected sites varied slightly when the optimisation algorithm was run repeatedly on the same model output, the general locations and arrangement were very similar and resulted in minimal perceivable change in the final detection probability (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5</xref> Figs), indicating that the performance of the optimised strategy was robust. We also found that that there was relatively little impact of making the wrong assumption regarding the rate and distribution of pathogen entry on the detection probability of the optimised strategy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Our method considers a surveillance strategy in which a static selection of sites are repeatedly visited, thus bearing similarities to ‘sentinel surveillance’ [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This allows us to better explore the general drivers behind surveillance site placement and how these are impacted by different epidemiological and practical issues. We do not consider an ‘adaptive’ surveillance strategy, in which surveillance sites are adjusted in light of previous findings. However, using optimisation methods to explore this would potentially have considerable practical value and would be worthy of further attention.
