<p>In the current report, we describe a novel, to our knowledge, method of identifying how best to deploy surveillance efforts in order to detect epidemics of exotic pathogens at an early stage. We also explore how certain epidemiological and surveillance characteristics impact on the optimal surveillance strategies. Our method links the output of an epidemiologically informed, spatially explicit simulation model capable of reproducing early-stage pathogen spread with an optimisation routine informed by specified surveillance parameters [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our key finding is that it is generally best to avoid ‘putting all your eggs in one basket’ when planning surveillance and that surveillance resources should generally be spread throughout the landscape to cover all areas of risk (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">3</xref>). This is an important message because many surveillance programs in plant health are typically disproportionately targeted to a small number of high-risk areas, such as areas immediately adjacent to current outbreaks or surrounding ports of entry. Suboptimal deployment of surveillance resources such as this can be ill-afforded at a time when the number of plant pests and pathogen threats is rising.
