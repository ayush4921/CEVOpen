<p>An important component of our optimisation algorithm is the ability to explicitly account for parameters which influence the detection ability, but do not affect the epidemiological dynamics of the pest or pathogen itself. Our analysis shows that the performance of the detection method (that is, the diagnostic sensitivity) has a considerable impact on the optimal arrangement of surveillance resources, as well as on the overall detection probability. This finding is due to spatial autocorrelation in the status of individual sites, meaning that the status of each individual surveillance site is not independent of that of nearby sites. As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g007">Fig 7</xref>, each site inspected provides some information on the status of nearby sites, but the amount of this information decreases as the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection method and/or the number of samples taken per site decreases (and the probability of detecting individual infected hosts decreases). This means that the optimal surveillance strategy for any given pathogen will differ when a highly sensitive detection method is used compared to when the sensitivity is low, with focused sampling in a smaller number of clusters of sites advisable in the latter case (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In cases for which the test sensitivity and the number of hosts inspected taken per site are low, the value of optimising the surveillance strategy is reduced, and conventional targeted surveillance strategies may be more acceptable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Further work will investigate the impact of detection lag periods [
