<p>We focus our attention in the current report on surveillance for early detection rather than other surveillance aims such as prevalence estimation or spatial delimitation [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (although our method can be adapted to a variety of surveillance aims by adjusting the objective function). This allows us to concentrate on early stage pathogen spread, when spread dynamics are more predictable and thus easier to model (although we appreciate that there may be uncertainty in parameter estimates in these stages [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]). In doing so, we do not explicitly consider the impact of the disease (or any associated control measures). By instead focussing on the probability of detection before a prespecified prevalence threshold is reached, we are better able to explore the impact of epidemiological and diagnostic parameters on the optimal deployment of surveillance resources for early detection. This allows us to draw valuable insights into surveillance strategies, unencumbered by the influence of other factors such as control costs, and thus bears similarities with studies of how to improve sentinel surveillance strategies in networks [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (which, similarly, generally do not consider costs explicitly). On a practical level, our current approach also fits in well with the concept of ‘maximum prevalence thresholds’ commonly specified when planning conventional regulatory surveillance for regulated pathogens [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], making it valuable in a practical context.
