<p>Our method considers how best to deploy surveillance in order to maximise the probability of detection of new pathogen incursions. Whilst the detection probability is a valuable metric for evaluating surveillance, it does not itself explicitly capture the costs of surveillance and the costs of disease control at the time of first detection or the benefits of disease control associated with earlier detection (that is, the additional economic impact of disease and the disease management costs avoided). Indeed, our decision to exclude these factors from explicit consideration in our method sets it apart from much of the previous work on optimising and improving surveillance strategies. These studies commonly consider the economics of surveillance and control in unison [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] or through the use of simulation models to explore the impact of different surveillance and control strategies in real-world landscapes [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The aim of these studies has therefore predominantly focused on identifying the optimal balance of surveillance and control intensity required to minimise the total economic impact of invasive species, which can offer valuable practical insights into how surveillance and control strategies interact. By considering surveillance in isolation of control, our approach offers a different perspective on this important issue and demonstrates how noneconomic factors can influence surveillance performance. We do not attempt to answer the question of whether surveillance is an economically viable strategy (that is, that the economic costs associated with earlier detection are lower than the costs associated with later detection). Instead, this should be considered when the ‘maximum acceptable prevalence’ is determined. This could be achieved by fixing the surveillance intensity and estimating, for a range of different maximum acceptable prevalences, the expected costs of surveillance, disease impact, and disease management if detection occurs at or before this prevalence and the costs of disease impact and management in the absence of surveillance. Given that surveillance is economically feasible, the maximum acceptable prevalence could then be selected as the point at which the expected costs of surveillance are lowest.
