<p>Although the current study is intended to explore optimal surveillance deployment rather than make concrete suggestions for implementation, further work will apply our method to current ongoing threats, such as the spread of Las in California [

 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>fastidiosa</italic> in Italy [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further work will also consider the impact of different surveillance aims (such as maximising the number of detections rather than the probability of at least 1 detection) and incorporate disease and control costs and benefits more explicitly within the objective function (by estimating the exact prevalence at first detection and the implications of this for control).
