<p>Although it was generally not possible to replicate the performance of the optimal strategy using the conventional targeted surveillance strategy of selecting sites according to site-specific risk metrics, we found that the product of the relative probability of introduction and the citrus density (which effectively describes the expected relative rate of pathogen entry in the model) gave the highest detection probability of the risk metrics we considered (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6</xref> Figs). This metric gave a clear improvement in comparison to random sampling or selection based upon relative rate of pathogen entry alone, likely reflecting the ability of this metric to capture both the probability of pathogen entry and its onwards spread (which would be expected to be associated with citrus density). This reinforces the importance of considering pathogen epidemiology when selecting surveillance sites and shares characteristics with our previous targeted surveillance strategy of quantifying risk as the product of the introduction probability and the magnitude of onward spread if introduction occurs [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We found that the performance of this risk metric was particularly high when the true rate of pathogen entry was very high and either matched or outperformed the (incorrectly specified) optimised strategy in these cases (
