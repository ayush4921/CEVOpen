<p>Increasing the rate of pathogen entry into the state decreased the number of clusters of surveillance sites (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref> Figs). This effect was more pronounced when ‘high-risk’ entry sites were present, reflecting the end prevalence estimates in these sites from the model simulations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). We identified 3 consistent clusters of surveillance locations in citrus growing regions to the northeast, northwest, and southwest of Lake Okeechobee, as well as clusters to the east of the lake and in the centre of the peninsula. The detection probability increased slightly as the rate of pathogen entry increased and was higher when the distribution of introduction points was variable than when it was flat (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s004">S3</xref> Figs), likely reflecting the higher site-specific prevalences (and therefore higher achievable detection probabilities) in these situations. We found that misspecifying the rate of pathogen entry (that is, assuming that the baseline model was correct when the true entry rate was higher or lower than this) had a relatively small impact on the performance of the optimised method, which consistently outperformed all other selection strategies in the vast majority of cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In all cases, higher rates of introduction were associated with equal or higher detection probabilities (even for optimised selection when site selection was based upon an incorrect model) (
