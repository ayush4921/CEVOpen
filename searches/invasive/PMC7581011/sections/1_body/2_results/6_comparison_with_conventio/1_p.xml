<p>As a result of spatial autocorrelation (that is, the fact that the risk status of any given site is likely to be similar to that of surrounding sites), we found that simply selecting the sites with the highest risk of infection tended to result in a small number of clusters of sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>). To avoid this, we therefore used instead a selection method in which the probability of site selection was proportional to the risk metric, as has been used previously for targeted surveillance [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This resulted in a greater spread of selected sites (that is, a larger number of distinct ‘clusters’ of sites) and a higher detection probability than the ranking approach (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">3</xref>). The detection probability of optimised sites was consistently higher than that for sites selected using more conventional methods (with the only exception being when the true rate of pathogen entry was underestimated by a factor of 3,200 or more [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6A</xref>]). However, of the conventional strategies, the risk metric calculated as the product of citrus density and relative rate of incursion gave the closest detection probabilities to the optimised approach. This was most pronounced in cases for which the rate of pathogen entry was very high (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). As expected, random sampling gave the lowest mean detection probability, demonstrating the value of targeted surveillance strategies for early detection surveillance.
