<p>Our model simulates the early stages of an epidemic up to a predefined ‘threshold prevalence’ of 1%. This particular threshold was arbitrarily selected to indicate a point at which control would no longer be possible in the case of the HLB pathosystem but could alternatively be selected based upon regulatory guidance and/or economic considerations, as described in the Discussion. Since the model is stochastic, we simulate not only the spatial spread within a landscape over time but how this varies from one epidemic to the next. Taking the average over all of these epidemics, we find that the distribution of entry sites (whether only influenced by the distribution of citrus trees or also by the predictions of the travel census model) affected which sites were more or less likely to be infected by the end of the simulation (
