<p>We found that for any combination of epidemiological and surveillance parameters, the conventional method of selecting sites based on site-specific ‘risk metrics’ gives a consistently lower probability of pathogen detection than the optimised approach in almost all cases (even over 100 realisations of these alternative sampling methods; see Figs

These results clearly demonstrate the importance of carefully considering pathogen epidemiology and entry processes, but also the detection efficiency of inspection and detection technologies, in a holistic manner when planning early detection surveillance.
