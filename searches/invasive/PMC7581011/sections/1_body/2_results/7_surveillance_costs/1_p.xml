<p>As expected, for any given set of epidemiological and detection parameters, the detection probability could be increased by increasing the number of sites sampled (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Therefore, in order to achieve any given detection probability between 0.50 and 0.95 using a conventional site-selection strategy, between 2 and 13 times as many sites needed to be sampled as was required under the optimised strategy (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). We can also consider this in terms of the total cost of these inspections, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5B</xref>. Here, the mean detection probability was estimated for different numbers of surveillance sites (between 1 and 50 sites for a single run of optimised sites and between 1 and 150 sites for 100 replicates of the other risk metrics). Using rough estimates of sampling costs taken from citrus survey activities undertaken by the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and USDA-APHIS in Florida, a single surveyor would cost around US$120 per day and a single PCR test around US$10 (T. Gottwald, personal communication). Assuming that a single 1-km cell can be fully surveyed in a single day by a single inspector and that each of the 50 trees inspected within this cell will be tested with a single PCR test, the total surveillance cost per cell is US$620. This would mean that our ‘baseline’ surveillance strategy of 20 cells per year would have an annual cost around US$12,400. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g005">Fig 5B</xref> shows that for any given detection probability between 0.50 and 0.95, the annual surveillance cost using the optimised strategy ranged from US$1,500 to $8,859 (mean: US$3,594). However, the costs of the best-performing conventional strategy ranged from US$3,297 to $19,282, with a mean of US$7,534, and those of random sampling ranged from US$19,606 to $88,689 per year, with a mean of US$42,092 (
