<p>Under the baseline model (a low rate of pathogen entry, with spatial variation in entry rate, and 20 sites surveyed annually using a detection method with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.5), the optimised mean detection probability approached 1, with very little variation in the optimised detection probability between different optimisation runs (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5</xref> Figs). There was, therefore, little effect of reducing the sampling interval on the performance of the optimised method (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s007">S6 Fig</xref>) or the probability of correctly identifying infected hosts (that is, the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection method; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5 Fig</xref>) decreased the mean probability of detection under the optimised strategy. We also found that when the diagnostic sensitivity was high, surveys should be spread throughout the citrus landscape. However, as this was reduced, surveys become increasingly concentrated in a small number of ‘hot spots’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g003">Fig 3</xref>), where higher rates of pathogen entry intersected with higher citrus density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This was apparent when the numbers of clusters of sites were considered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000863.s006">S5 Fig</xref>).
