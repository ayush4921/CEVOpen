<p>Although our spread model identifies a number of areas of high risk of pathogen presence (predominantly centred around areas of high citrus density; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g001">Fig 1</xref>), when we apply the optimisation routine, we find that the common practice of focussing surveillance in a small number of highest-risk areas generally does not maximise the mean probability of detecting the pathogen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000863.g002">Fig 2</xref>). However, we show that the effectiveness of the detection method used to find disease determines how that method should be deployed across the landscape, with poorer performing methods often requiring a greater focus in a relatively small number of risk ‘clusters’ (
