<p id="Par36">For both species SLA was maximal under FA conditions at 20 °C which was significantly higher for the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> (p = 0.016; df = 8; t = 2.58; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> had a similar SLA at 7 °C and 30 °C, which was about 55% of the maximum. The slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> showed a similar pattern, but SLA was much more reduced at 7 °C than at 30 °C, 36% versus 87% of maximum (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
