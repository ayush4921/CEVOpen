<p id="Par47">Under LA conditions total available carbon for the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> was almost constant at all temperatures with totals being lower than at FA at 7 °C and 20 °C but almost identical at 30 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In contrast, total available carbon for the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> was highest at 20 °C, almost twice that at the other temperatures, with the total being lower than under FA at 7 °C and 20 °C but, as for the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>, almost identical at 30 °C. The proportion of total available carbon allocated to root respiration was higher than in FA which lowered the daily available carbon fraction in both species, but much more so in the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceu</italic>s. At 30 °C, carbon losses, due to increased root and dark respiration, were maximal in both species and resulted in the smallest available carbon fractions (Fig.
