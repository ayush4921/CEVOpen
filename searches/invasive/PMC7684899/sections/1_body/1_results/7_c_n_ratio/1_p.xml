<p id="Par41">Under FA conditions, both species had their lowest ratios at 20 °C and the ratio was increased at higher and lower temperatures (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with this effect being greater in the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The pattern of response changed markedly at low nitrogen supply with both species showing a significant (1.7 fold) increase in C:N ratio. In response to temperature, the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> showed a more mixed response with a marked increase (60%) at 30 °C and a decline (10%) at 7 °C
 <italic>.</italic> The fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> had higher ratios overall with a steady decline with a rise in temperature.
