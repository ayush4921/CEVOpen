<p id="Par42">Under FA conditions, both species 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> showed a similar pattern of response, being minimal at 20 °C (p = 0.003, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). NUE rates were higher but similar, at 7 °C and 30 °C with the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> always having lower values, 12% at 7 °C and 22% at 30 °C (p = 0.007 and p = 0.000, respectively). Responses of NUE to low nitrogen availability were species-specific (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> NUE increased slightly from 7 °C to 20 °C, and then markedly at 30 °C, resulting in a 59% higher NUE when compared to FA conditions. In contrast, the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> had similar NUE at 7 °C and 20 °C, which then declined to only 208.4 g/g at 30 °C.
