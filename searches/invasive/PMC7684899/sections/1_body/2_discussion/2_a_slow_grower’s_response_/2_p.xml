<p id="Par50">In contrast to the cold temperature response, the RGR of 
 <italic>B.erectus</italic> was reduced when growing at higher temperatures (30 °C) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). This occurs because NAR remained at the same level as at the 20 °C growth temperature but SLA decreased, which is a typical response of plants to warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In comparison to growing at 20 °C, the carbon uptake rates were reduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), while simultaneously, respiration rates increased (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Temperature is known to have a crucial influence on respiratory CO
 <sub>2</sub> efflux [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and therefore the daily carbon budget of a plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As a result, the carbon losses were so high that the available carbon fraction for growth was cut to one-fourth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) making it impossible for NAR to increase.
