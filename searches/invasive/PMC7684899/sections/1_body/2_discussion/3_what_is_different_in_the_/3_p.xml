<p id="Par55">‘Fast’ traits, are costly in the face of any kind of resource shortfall [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and fast-growing species are less tolerant to any changes in resource availability (whether water, nutrients or light). It has been shown previously, that the relatively low rates of root respiration in fast-growing grasses in comparison to slow growing ones are a result of the lower costs for nutrient uptake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising to find that LA conditions had more severe effects the total carbon budget of 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> than of 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>. Especially when exposed to a combination of cold growing temperatures and restricted nitrogen supply, the inability to adjust SLA and NUE (which was the response of 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> leading to only 10% reduction of RGR) results in the lowest RGR, which is less than 50% from LA 20 °C levels and even below that of 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>. Such a strongly limited growth performance was also shown when nitrogen limitation occurred in combination with warmer growth temperature; conditions that did not greatly affect RGR of 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Here, for 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> RGR was almost halved together with a reduction of NUE and an increase in R:S of less significance than in 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>. Effects on the daily available carbon fraction were additive, such that the uptake rates were reduced by temperature plus the carbon losses were higher because of increased root respiration due LA conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). From the plant carbon economics perspective, this meant that any resource allocation as a response to environmental changes became problematic, simply due to the fact that available resources were low.
