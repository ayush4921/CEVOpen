<p id="Par21">The spread of fast-growing invasive alien species is one of the major threats to habitats and their species diversity with implications for plant community assembly in future climate change scenarios. Invasive species may succeed even in low-resource environments by employing resource conservation traits such as high resource-use efficiency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and they are typically species located on the ‘fast’ end of the productivity‐persistence trade‐off axes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The ‘plant economics spectrum’ concept provides the theoretical framework to arrange plant species from the ‘fast’ end of the productivity‐persistence trade‐off axis to taxa with ‘slow’, conservative life traits. It integrates across leaves, stems and roots and is a key feature helping to explain individual ecological traits, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. According to Reich [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], a fast or a slow growth strategy each requires a particular set of leaf, root and stem traits. Plants with a slow growth strategy will have low respiration rates, low nutrient concentrations, dense tissues, with low water movement and loss capacities across all plant tissues. In contrast, fast-growing species are highly efficient in transporting water, in acquiring and using nutrients and in fixing carbon, but invest less in their tissues (whether root, stem, or leaf). The plant individual performance results from the coordinated operation of many processes, such as nutrient uptake, organ turnover or photosynthesis, thus a prediction requires a certain set of traits. A plants economy is determined by its handling/usage of three key resources: carbon, water, and mineral nutrients, and the most critical functional and eco-physiological traits relevant to these.
