<p id="Par71">To evaluate the effects of temperature, nitrogen availability and their interaction with the dependent variables SLA, NP
 <sub>max</sub>, NUE and C:N ratio, we applied a univariate linear model. Species (2 discrete levels: 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> vs
 <italic>. B. hordeaceus</italic>), temperature (3 discrete levels: 7 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) and nitrogen treatment (2 discrete levels: full access vs. low access) were treated as discrete explanatory variables. We evaluated single effects as well as all two-way and three-way interactions. T-tests were performed to compare between the species on selected groups.
