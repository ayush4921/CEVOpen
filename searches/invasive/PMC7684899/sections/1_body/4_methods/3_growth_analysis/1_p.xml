<p id="Par64">Harvests for the growth analysis were performed at regular intervals each with five replicates of each species. The plants were divided into leaves and roots. Fresh and dry mass (after 4 days in the dry oven at 80 °C) were recorded. Leaf area was measured using a LI-COR Li-3000C leaf area meter (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The dry material was ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and analyzed for total C and N concentration by mass spectrometry (Isotope ratio mass spectrometer (DeltaV, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany; Elemental analyzer (Flash EA 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)) as described by Werner et al. [
