<p id="Par62">Seedlings were germinated on a mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1). Immediately after the appearance of the second leaf, seedlings were removed from the sand, washed carefully and placed into custom-made aeroponic growth units (Biotronic AB, Sweden) that allow accurate control over the nutrient supply to the plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One growth unit contained up to 84 seedlings. Four growth units (2 for each species) were placed in a growth cabinet with a selected constant temperature, 16-h light period (7 am–11 pm) with a light intensity of 200 μmol photons/m
 <sup>2</sup> s and 70% relative humidity. The temperature of the nutrient solution was kept the same as the air temperature, with a maximum deviation of ± 1 °C. After transplantation, plants were first acclimated to the growing conditions in the aeroponic units, and this was determined to be completed once the pH and the conductivity of the medium solution became stable and the nutrient uptake had recovered as assessed by regular nutrient titrations being necessary (pH 5.5, conductivity 99–101 µS in 6 dm
 <sup>3</sup> solution).
