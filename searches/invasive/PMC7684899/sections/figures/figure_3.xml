  <p>Optimal growth temperature. Displayed is a ratio between the optimal temperature for photosynthesis (T
   <sub>opt</sub>) and the growth temperature during the experiment. These values are related to the growth temperature to visualize deviations and acclimation. A ratio of one indicates that the optimal temperature matches the growth temperature, values above one indicate that the optimal temperature was higher than the growth temperature and vice versa
