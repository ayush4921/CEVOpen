  <p>Daily carbon budget. Dry weight-based rates for net photosynthesis, dark respiration and root respiration rates were converted to a per day basis and the daily rates were weighted according to the number of hours that each gas exchange parameter took place (NP:16 h; DR: 8 h and RR: 24 h). The total size of the circle reflects the RGR that is normalized for fast-growing
