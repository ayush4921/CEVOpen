<p>In this work, we have demonstrated that the terrestrial morphotype of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> showed higher growth capacities in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats as compared to the aquatic morphotype confirming our hypothesis. When transferred to terrestrial conditions, both morphotypes activated glycolysis and fermentation pathways, but, only the terrestrial morphotype had the capacity to maintain efficient growth. In the future studies, comparative analysis of both morphotypes could be carried out to determine whether the terrestrial morphotype shows a loss of secondary tissues and formation of aerenchyma in anoxic conditions, as reported in helophytes. To go further in the understanding of adaptive mechanisms of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> to terrestrial condition, omics analysis will be realized.
