<p>Finally, we suggest focusing management actions on the terrestrial morphotype in order to control the expansion of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic>. Recent studies that assessed the effects of climate changes on the potential distribution of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> predicts future increase in the size of its bioclimatic range, especially into Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Gillard, Thiébaut, Deleu, &amp; Leroy, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In this context, the dispersal in terrestrial habitat of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> could also concern in the future these Europeans countries.
