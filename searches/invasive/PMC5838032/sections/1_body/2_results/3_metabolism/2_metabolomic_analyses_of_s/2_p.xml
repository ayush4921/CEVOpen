<p>Among the 47 metabolites detected in shoot tissues, 22 compounds were at least 75% correlated with axes of the PCAs and were kept to perform this statistical procedure. The first axis of the PCA accounted for 65.74% of the total inertia. It separated Am and Tm, with Am‐a and Tm‐t being clearly opposed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Plants from the Am‐a treatment were characterized by higher levels of citrulline, glycine, lysine, and ornithine in the shoots (Figures

 <xref rid="ece33848-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Plants from the Tm‐t treatment exhibited higher amounts of arabinose, fructose, fumarate, galactose, glucose, malate, maltose, and xylose (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece33848-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).
