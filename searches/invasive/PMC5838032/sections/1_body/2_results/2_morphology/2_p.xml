<p>The separation of the groups according to the experimental treatments is presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The first axis of the PCA explained 46.65% of the total inertia and separated the Am morphotype of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> from the Tm morphotype. On this axis, the seven variables being correlated at least at 70% were conserved for investigating the main differentiating factors between morphotypes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Tm was characterized by greater plant length, fresh and dry masses of shoots and roots, and number of nodes with buds (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="ece33848-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The second axis of the PCA explained 20.26% of the total inertia, and separated plants maintained under aquatic and terrestrial conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In the aquatic condition, 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> plants showed a greater number of nodes with leaves and roots, a larger shoots ratio of fresh and dry masses, and a smaller fresh mass of roots as compared to plants from terrestrial condition (
