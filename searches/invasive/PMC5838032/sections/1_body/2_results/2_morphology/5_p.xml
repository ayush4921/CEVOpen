<p>In the terrestrial condition, both morphotypes had less water content in shoots than in aquatic condition. The ratio of shoots (Sr) was significantly different in aquatic or terrestrial conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). However, changing conditions did not disturb significantly the water content (rr) in aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes (Table
