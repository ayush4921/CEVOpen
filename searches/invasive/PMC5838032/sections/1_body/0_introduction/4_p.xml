<p>Several localities of the French Atlantic coast are now being invaded by terrestrial form, where it is continuously expanding with more than 1300 ha in 2017 (Haury, unpublished data). For instance, in the national Park of Brière (nearby Saint Nazaire, Loire Atlantique, France), the terrestrial areas colonized by 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> were multiplied by five between 2011 (156 ha) and 2014 (848 ha), leading to a depreciation of the fodder value of meadows and resulting in the abandonment of pasturing (Haury, Damien, Maisonneuve, &amp; Bottner, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The invasion of terrestrial habitat by 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> can be considered as a secondary invasion following the primary aquatic invasion (primary habitat) of French Atlantic coast.
