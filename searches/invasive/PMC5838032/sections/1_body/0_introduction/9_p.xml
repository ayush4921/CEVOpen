<p>We focused our study on a population of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> that appeared in 1995 in its aquatic form. In 2000, this morphotype invaded meadows, leading to appearance of the terrestrial morphotype. We collected 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> plants from terrestrial and aquatic habitats and grew them either in their original sampling conditions or reversed their original ecological situation. Terrestrial morphotype comes from the aquatic population and as 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> is a vegetative reproduction species, we consider that terrestrial and aquatic morphotypes correspond to a same genotype.
