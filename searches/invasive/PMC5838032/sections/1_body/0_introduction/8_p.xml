<p>In this work, we compared the performance of the terrestrial and aquatic morphotypes of 
 <italic>L.Â grandiflora</italic> to understand the effect of the habitat change. We expected strong morphological and physiological differences between both morphotypes. We specifically aim (i) to investigate the differences and similarities in plant development and primary metabolism responses of both morphotypes in their original condition and (ii) to compare the same variables in a reversed condition (aquatic condition for terrestrial morphotype and terrestrial condition for aquatic morphotype).
