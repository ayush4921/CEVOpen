<p>In order to survive prolonged hypoxic conditions, aquatic plants have also developed adaptive mechanisms at the structural level. For roots, the commonest morphological and anatomical changes include the formation of adventitious roots, aerenchyma, and hypertrophied lenticels. These modifications improve the capacity for oxygen capture and transportation to submerged tissues in aquatic, semi‐aquatic, and terrestrial plants (Gladish, Xu, &amp; Niki,
