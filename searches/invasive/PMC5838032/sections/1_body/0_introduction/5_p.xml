<p>Aquatic and terrestrial environments differ greatly in terms of oxygen availability and have likely contributed shaping the aquatic and terrestrial morphological types (morphotypes) of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic>. The terrestrial morphotype is characterized by a bushy morphology, with shorter internodes and stems, as well as more secondary ramifications. Conversely, in aquatic habitats, the plant architecture is simpler (Haury et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and is most probably driven by the limited gas exchanges of water submerged leaves as O
 <sub>2</sub> and CO
 <sub>2</sub> have 10,000‐fold lower diffusion coefficients in water compared to air (Voesenek, Colmer, Pierik, Millenaar, &amp; Peeters, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). For completely submerged plants, like macrophytes, direct access to atmospheric O
 <sub>2</sub> is excluded and may cause anoxic or hypoxic conditions. Their only source of oxygen is produced during photosynthesis and diluted in water (Sand‐Jensen, Pedersen, Binzer, &amp; Borum, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). In these conditions, enhanced glycolytic fluxes and ethanolic fermentation are often characterizing the metabolism of aquatic plants (Fukao &amp; Bailey‐Serres, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), as the faster consumption of glucose to maintain ATP production (van Dongen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Narsai, Rocha, Geigenberger, Whelan, &amp; van Dongen, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In addition to the accumulation of ethanol and lactate during ethanolic fermentation, increased amounts of alanine, succinate, and γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) are often measured in aquatic plants (Antonio et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
