<p>The water primrose 
 <italic>Ludwigia grandiflora</italic>, subsp. 
 <italic>hexapetala</italic>, a plant species native to South America, is one of the most important invasive aquatic plants in Europe (Hussner, Windhaus, &amp; Starfinger, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In its native range, 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> is reported in wetlands and in the transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial environments (Thouvenot, Haury, &amp; Thiébaut, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In these habitats, water level fluctuations of up to 3 m during the year occur (Fortney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In its introduced range, it colonizes static or slow‐flowing waters, river banks and wet meadows (Thouvenot et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In France, 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> has a strong predominance in the Atlantic region and has invaded many types of fresh water ecosystem such as rivers, channels, ponds, and flooded meadows (Dandelot, Verlaque, Dutartre, &amp; Cazaubon, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Lambert, Dutartre, Coudreuse, &amp; Haury, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). As an amphibious plant, it can have different forms as submerged, floating at the water's surface or emergent in terrestrial habitats, rooted in the sediment with floating or emergent shoots/leaves (Hussner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The phylogenetic reconstructions of the 
 <italic>Ludwigia</italic> genus suggest that the aquatic distribution may result from a secondary colonization of these habitats by terrestrial plants (Bedoya &amp; Madriñán, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). However, recently, specimens of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> have propagated in wet meadows in France (Haury et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). As 5–10 years are necessary for the invasion of meadows, the transition from aquatic habitat to the terrestrial habitat is not spontaneous and requires an adaptation time for 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic>. So the quasi absence of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> into terrestrial some few years ago is clearly intriguing.
