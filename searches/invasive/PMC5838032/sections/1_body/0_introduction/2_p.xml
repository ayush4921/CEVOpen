<p>During geographic expansion of invasive plant species, the ability of the organisms to adapt to novel sets of environmental conditions is crucial for survival and establishment success. According to Dietz and Edwards (
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), an invasion can be subdivided into two phases; a primary phase, during which the abundance of a preadapted species increases rapidly (typically in a resource‚Äêrich or disturbed habitat), and a secondary phase, during which spread is contingent upon plastic responses or genetic adaptation to the newly encountered ecological conditions.
