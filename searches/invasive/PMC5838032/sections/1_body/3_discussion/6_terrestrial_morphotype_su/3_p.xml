<p>Amino acids are essential precursors for a large array of metabolites with multiple functions in plant growth and environmental stress responses (Less &amp; Galili, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), and amino acids can also have direct protective mechanism in many terrestrial plants (Rhodes, Verslues, &amp; Sharp, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). The terrestrial morphotype of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> could experience the aquatic condition as a stress and could accumulate amino acids to protect the plant cells from damage (Rhodes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the Am‐a seemed able to catabolize these three amino acids (Figure
