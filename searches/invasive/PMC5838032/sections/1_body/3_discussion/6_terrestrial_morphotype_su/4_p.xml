<p>In stressful conditions, increased amino acid concentrations have been associated with decreased growth rates in terrestrial and aquatic plants (Maggio etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Wallace, Secor, &amp; Schrader, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>). In the aquatic condition, most of morphological and biomass variables observed were higher in Tm than in Am suggesting that amino acid accumulation was not associated to reduced growth of Tm. Furthermore, as observed in terrestrial condition, Tm produced higher malate and pyruvate quantities than those observed for Am. This suggests that Tm could have also a high C4 photosynthesis activity in the aquatic condition as it was observed in terrestrial condition. Involvement of both metabolic pathways could reflect an adaptive response of terrestrial morphotype to the aquatic condition.
