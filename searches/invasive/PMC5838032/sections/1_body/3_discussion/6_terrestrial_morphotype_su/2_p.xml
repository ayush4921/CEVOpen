<p>Am‐a and Tm‐a have higher contents of glycine and lysine, and, for Tm‐a, higher levels of isoleucine, leucine, and threonine, in shoot tissues than plants from the terrestrial condition (Am‐t and/or Tm‐t). Our analysis of metabolic pathways revealed that the aminoacyl‐tRNA biosynthesis pathway was promoted for both morphotypes grown in the aquatic condition (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Aminoacyl‐tRNAs are key components of protein synthesis and consist of amino acids esterified to the 3′‐end of tRNA, which are essential for ribosomal protein synthesis (Ibba, Curnow, &amp; Söll, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). As the terrestrial morphotype of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> showed a greater amount of isoleucine, leucine, and threonine, especially in the shoots in the aquatic condition, we suggest that this morphotype should be particularly efficient at using the aminoacetyl‐tRNA biosynthesis for the production of these amino acids.
