<p>When released into a new geographic area, the habitats that best match with the biological requirements of the species should be colonized first, and the invasion success depends on propagules’ pressure (Colautti, Grigorovich, &amp; MacIsaac, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Specimens of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> first settled in different types of ponds and marshes (Lambert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) suggesting that this preferred habitat should maximize the biological performance of the plants as compared to their relatives thriving in supposedly less favorable terrestrial habitats. In this work, we thus assumed that the colonization of terrestrial zones corresponded to secondary habitats for this invasive plant species. However, we did not verify this assumption and found that the terrestrial morphotype had higher biological performance, whatever the experimental situation. In order to better understand the changes that facilitated the expansion to terrestrial habitats, we described and compared the functional responses of the two morphotypes throughout metabolomic experiments.
