<p>Irrespective of morphotypes, three sugar metabolic pathways were enhanced in the root system of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> grown in the terrestrial condition (starch and sugar metabolism, galactose metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolic pathways). In organs of wetland plant species, reserves of carbohydrates and ethanol fermentation are equally important in maintaining glycolysis and energetic metabolism in general (reviewed in Nakamura et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In our study, the significant decrease in glucose‐6‐phosphate and fructose‐6‐phosphate levels measured in both morphotypes, and the concomitant increase in fructose and mannose concentrations pinpointed the enhanced glycolytic activities and energetic needs of plants developing in terrestrial condition. The major fermentation end products of ethanol fermentation are lactate and pyruvate, and deficiency of oxygen is also associated with elevation of alanine, GABA, succinate, and occasionally malate (Dixon, Hill, Jackson, Ratcliffe, &amp; Sweetlove, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Drew, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). As quantities of malate were greater in plants grown in the terrestrial condition than in those grown in the aquatic condition, it is possible that the former may have partially relied on ethanol fermentation for energy production in their root system. Fermentation processes drastically increase the demand for carbohydrates, and sugars are thus crucially important for surviving prolonged hypoxic conditions (Nakamura et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Our results suggested that both morphotypes were able to active glycolysis and fermentation pathways in root tissues in response to the terrestrial condition. However, if glycolysis and fermentation pathways seemed to be similarly regulated between both morphotypes, root system were more developed in Tm. Poorter and Nagel (
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) reported that plants increase biomass allocation to roots in the presence of low levels of belowground resources, such as water and nutrients. This trait could correspond to a root adaptive response of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> in a terrestrial environment.
