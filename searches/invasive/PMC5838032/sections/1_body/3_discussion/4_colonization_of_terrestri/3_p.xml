<p>In the terrestrial condition, the amounts of the branched amino acids (BCAAs) isoleucine, leucine, and valine were reduced in the stems of both morphotypes. These three amino acids share four common enzymes in their biosynthesis pathways and are thus jointly regulated (Joshi, Joung, Fei, &amp; Jander, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Protein degradation may have contributed to the elevation of the levels of these three amino acids. BCAAs can indeed provide alternative carbon sources for plants during stressful conditions (Taylor, Heazlewood, Day, &amp; Millar, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), and the complete oxidation of these amino acids might have fuelled the particular needs of plants growing in supposedly stressful terrestrial condition. Finally, several amino acids, including BCAAs, play important roles in stressed plants through their osmoprotective action (Campalans, Messeguer, Goday, &amp; Pages,
