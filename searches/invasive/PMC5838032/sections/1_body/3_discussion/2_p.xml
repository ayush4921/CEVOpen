<p>Using a large range of morphological measurements, we demonstrated that the terrestrial morphotype (Tm) outcompeted its aquatic counterpart in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The terrestrial morphotype produced plants of higher biomasses and had higher numbers of leaves and roots. While the terrestrial morphotype could be described a fast‐growing plant, whereas aquatic morphotype is characterized by comparatively low growth performance. We suggest that this distinction may be partially supported by an increased root network in Tm, especially in the terrestrial condition, as it has been described under natural conditions by Haury et al. (

 <sub>2</sub> uptake is required for achieving a higher relative growth of the Tm, this morphological change is not sufficient for supporting its higher growth rate, which also involves a higher efficiency in acquiring and assimilating available nutrients.
