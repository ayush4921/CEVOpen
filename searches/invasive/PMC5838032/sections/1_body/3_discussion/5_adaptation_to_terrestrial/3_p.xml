<p>In addition to glycerate, Tm‐t plants also had more malate amounts than the three other morphotypes. 
 <italic>Ludwigia grandiflora</italic> is described as a C4 plant (Madanes, Quintana, Kandus, &amp; Bo, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In these plants, C4 pathway requires the close integration of distinct photosynthetic processes: phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation and regeneration through the Calvin cycle (Gowik &amp; Westhoff, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). For C4 plants, CO
 <sub>2</sub> is converted to bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase, and fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) using PEP as CO
 <sub>2</sub> acceptor. The resulting oxaloacetate is rapidly converted to the more stable C4 acids malate whose amounts are high in Tm‐t plants, or aspartate. These acids are then decarboxylated to supply CO
 <sub>2</sub> for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCo). The product of this reaction is 3‐phosphoglycerate (glycerate‐3‐phosphate).
