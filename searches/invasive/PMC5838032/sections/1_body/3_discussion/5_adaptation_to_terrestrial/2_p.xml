<p>The greater content of glycerate in Tm‐t than those observed for Am‐t, Tm‐a, and Am‐a, suggests that Tm‐t plants may have enhanced production of glycerolipids in shoot tissues. The decreased amounts of valine, leucine, and isoleucine from Tm‐t plants support this assumption and may evidence the increased activity of the glycerolipid metabolism pathway (Figure

 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), whose amounts might have been increased in Tm‐t, in parallel to the general increase of all morphological and biomass variables. In addition, glycerolipids are also one constituent of the cuticular that coats the surface of plants, providing the crucial hydrophobic barrier that prevents water loss (Bird,
