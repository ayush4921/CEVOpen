<p>Biomass allocation reveals the survival strategies and adaptations to the environmental of the (micro)habitats where plants are developing (Xie, An, &amp; Wu, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Several invasive aquatic weeds are known for their ability to respond to different water levels by adjustments of the root system and/or biomass allocation (Geng et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Hussner &amp; Meyer, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Hussner, Meyer, &amp; Busch, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Kercher &amp; Zedler, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Li, Yu, &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). All results indicated that 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> was well adapted to the terrestrial habitat because of its biomass allocation, morphological strategies that depended on the increase in root biomass allocation and water content. Significant morphological changes were also found in 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> plants from aquatic conditions, which developed a larger fresh mass of shoots as compared to plants from the terrestrial condition. Conversely, a larger fresh mass of roots was measured in 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> plants from the terrestrial condition. Accordingly, Hussner (
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) showed that the strong abilities of 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> to grow on drained soils were supported by an increase in the relative amount of root biomass and by changes in the development of the root system. Haury et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33848-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) also observed that the biomasses of field‐collected 
 <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> from meadows were characterized by twofold increase than in dykes and the percentage of roots was slightly higher in plants from meadows than in those from dykes.
