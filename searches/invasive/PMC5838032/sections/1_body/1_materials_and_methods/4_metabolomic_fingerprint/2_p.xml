<p>For each experimental treatment, six plants were randomly collected and pooled to constitute one sample. To standardize the samples, ten centimeters from the top of the stem (including stem, leaves, and buds) and roots were sampled and immediately snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then, samples were stored at −80°C until being ground into liquid nitrogen. Samples were lyophilized over 48 hr using a Cosmos 20K (Cryotec, Saint‐Gély‐du‐Fesc, France). Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) was used to scan for the 60 metabolites in our database, encompassing amino acids, organic acids, polyamines, polyols, and sugars. We used the method described in Serra et al. (

Briefly, for each sample, an aliquot of 10 mg of lyophilized powder was homogenized in 600 μl of a solution of ice‐cold methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v). Then, a volume of 400 μl of ultra‐pure water was added. Samples were homogenized and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000

Samples were vacuum dried (Speed Vac Concentrator, MiVac, Genevac Ltd., Ipswich, England). The derivatization of the samples was conducted with a CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland), and with the GC‐MS settings that were described by Serra et al. (
