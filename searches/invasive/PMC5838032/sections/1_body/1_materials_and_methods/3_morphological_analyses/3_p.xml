   <p>Number of nodes with roots (nbNR), number of nodes with leaves and roots (nbNLR), and number of nodes with buds (nbNB); these three variables were associated with the fitness of the plant. In this work, fitness of 
    <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> was considered to be the ability to produce propagules from buds or nodes with leaves and/or roots. Indeed, 
    <italic>L. grandiflora</italic> shows a high regeneration capacity and the ability to form new shoots from single nodes (with or without leaves) from a small (&gt;1 cm) plant fragments (Hussner,

   <p>Biomass of the plants was determined by measuring the fresh mass of shoots (FMS) and of roots (FMR). Their respective dry masses (DMS and DMR) were determined after oven drying the samples at 105°C for 48 hr. The ratios of fresh/dry mass of shoots (Sr) and roots (Rr), and ratio of ratios (rr = Sr/Rr) were calculated to determine water contents.</p>
