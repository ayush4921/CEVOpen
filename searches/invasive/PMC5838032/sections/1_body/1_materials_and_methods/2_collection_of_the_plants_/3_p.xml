<p>Starting from the apex, a 10‐cm portion of the stem was collected, without roots, buds, and lateral stems. Then, a preconditioning period of 2 weeks was applied to promote the development of roots in different aquariums, as described in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33848-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. During the first week, both aquatic and terrestrial plants were developed in the aquatic condition, with a total immersion of the stems. Then, plants from both morphotypes were allocated to one of two experimental conditions for one week: (i) terrestrial condition: plants were grown in a mixture of 
 <sup>1</sup>/
 <sub>3</sub> soil, 
 <sup>1</sup>/
 <sub>3</sub> sand, 
 <sup>1</sup>/
 <sub>3</sub> loam where the level of water was maintained flush, hereafter referred to as Am‐t and Tm‐t for aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes, respectively, and (ii) aquatic condition: plants were placed in the same substrate and were submerged into tap water—these plants are referred to as Am‐a and Tm‐a for aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes, respectively.
