 <caption> Overview of the metabolism of sugars, amino acids, and related compounds. (Elaborated from kegg pathways; http://www.kegg.jp.) The metabolites analyzed by mass spectrometry ( GC‐ MS) and metabolomic pathways identified by MetaboAnalyst's server were indicated in a character box. Metabolites and others pathways noted in italic were not screened or not identified by MetaboAnalyst's server. The adaptation of Ludwigia grandiflora to terrestrial condition mobilized four metabolomic pathways (numbers 1–4) in roots or shoots. The aminoacyl t‐ RNA biosynthesis pathway (no. 5) was specifically involved in shoots in aquatic condition. The valine, leucine, isoleucine metabolism, and degradation (no. 6) were only not involved in terrestrial morphotype in the terrestrial condition (Tm‐a, Terrestrial morphotype in aquatic condition; Am‐a and Am‐t, Aquatic morphotype in aquatic and terrestrial conditions, respectively). Ala, Alanine; Arg, Arginine; Asn, Asparagine; Asp, Aspartate; Cys, Cysteine; Ci, Citrate; FA, Fumarate; Fru, Fructose; F6P, Fructose 6‐phosphate; Gln, Glutamine; Glu, Glutamate; Gly, Glycine; Ile, Isoleucine; GABA, Gamma aminobutyric acid; Gal, Galactose; Glc, Glucose; G6P, Glucose 6‐phosphate; Leu, Leucine; Lys, Lysine; MA, Malate; OAA, Oxaloacetate; PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvic acid; Pro, Proline; Pyr, Pyruvate; Ser, Serine; Suc, Sucrose; TCA cycle, Tricarboxylic acid cycle; Trp, Tryptophan; and Val, Valine </caption>
