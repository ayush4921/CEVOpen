 <caption> Principal component analysis ( PCA) of morphological traits for the aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes conducted in aquatic (Am‐a, Tm‐a) or terrestrial (Am‐t, Tm‐t) conditions. (a) Individuals factor map. Each data point represented one plant. (b) Variables factor map. Variables were the length of the plant ( LP); the number of internodes (nbI); the number of leaves (nbL); the number of nodes with roots (nb NR) and with leaves and roots (nb NLR); the number of nodes with buds alone (nb NB) and with buds and leaves (nb NBL) and/or roots (nb NBLR and nb NBR); the fresh mass of stems ( FMS) and roots ( FMR); dry mass of stems ( DMS) and roots ( DMR); ratios of fresh/dry mass for stems (Sr) and for roots (Rr); and the ratio of ratios (rr = Sr/Rr) </caption>
