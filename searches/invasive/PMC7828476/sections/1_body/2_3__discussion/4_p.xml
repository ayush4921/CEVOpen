<p>In summary, as a heat-sensitive plant, the ability of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> to resist HT stress in South China was far lower than that of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic>. The main reason was the difference of photosynthesis in response to HT stress (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The resistance of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> to cope with HT stress was better than that of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, which made it a single superior population in the invasion area. These results further indicated that the gradual warming of global temperature will greatly accelerate the invasion area of 
 <italic>S. trilobata.</italic>
