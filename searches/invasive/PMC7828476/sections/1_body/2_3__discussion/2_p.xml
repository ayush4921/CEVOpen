<p>It has been seen that HT increases the generation of ROS [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The results of this study showed that there was no accumulation of ROS in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> at HT, while the situation in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> was contrary (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Some studies have shown that ROS accumulate in plants under stress and attack unsaturated fatty acids in cells, aggravate membrane peroxidation, and lead to membrane system damage and cell damage [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The MDA content and relative conductivity of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> both increased significantly under HT stress, while MDA content in 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> increased slightly, and its relative conductivity was not significantly increased compared with the normal temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). These results suggested that compared with 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>, 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> was less injured, and the cell membrane stability was stronger under HT stress. Maintenance of membrane integrity is a major mechanism by which plants cope with HT stress [

 <xref rid="B32-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which could explain the significant reduction in chlorophyll content of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> leaves and the phenomenon of yellowing under HT stress (
