<p>Flavonoids and total phenols are antioxidants that exist in plants to scavenge ROS, and the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of leaves is the comprehensive performance of the main antioxidant substances in the leaves. The results showed that, compared with the control treatment, no significant differences in the values of flavonoids, total phenols or TAC were observed for 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> under HT treatment. However, 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> showed decreased flavonoids, total phenols, and TAC values of 59.8%, 19.2%, and 52.8%, respectively (
