<p>Moreover, we observed that SOD, POD, and CAT activities of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> did not change under HT treatment, but all of them were greatly reduced in 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> with change ranges of 64.2%, 68.9%, and 30.3%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f004">Figure 4</xref>Aâ€“C). Unlike SOD, POD, and CAT, the decreased activity of APX was obtained in two Sphagneticola species under HT treatment, whereas the decreased range of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> (26.3%) was much smaller than that of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (34.5%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00748-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). These results are in agreement with the previous reports regarding the changes in non-enzymatic antioxidants content under HT treatment.
