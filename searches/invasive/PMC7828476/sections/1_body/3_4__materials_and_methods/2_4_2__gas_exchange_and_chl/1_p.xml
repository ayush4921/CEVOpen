<p>Gas exchange was measured using the Li-6400 portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Before the measurement, the leaves were acclimated for 5–10 min at a photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 800 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup> and a CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration was maintained at 400 µmol mol
 <sup>−1</sup> in this study. Once the steady-state gas exchange rates were observed at these conditions, the instrument automatically calculates and records the net photosynthetic rate (P
 <sub>n</sub>).
