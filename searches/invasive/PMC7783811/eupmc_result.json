    "The wild tree tobacco (<i>Nicotiana glauca</i>) is an alien species that invaded vast areas of the Southwestern region of Saudi Arabia. While, the Red Palm Weevil (RPW) (<i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i>) is considered to be the most damaging invasive insect species of palm trees all over the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, causing major economic losses to farmers and the economy of the country. Using conventional insecticides to control harmful insects such as RPW has undesirable effects on the environment and human health. Alternatively, using biocontrol agents such as poisonous extracts from <i>N. glauca</i> might be a better approach in pest management and can be considered as an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and safe alternative. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the larvicidal effect of <i>N. glauca</i> aqueous extracts against the red palm weevil larvae. The plant specimens were collected from Al-Baha region in the Southwest of Saudi Arabia. Each single test consisted of 20 larvae, and <i>N. glauca</i> preparations were; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 ml, besides the control test. Results obtained for the effect of botanical extracts; leaf, flower, stem and root against <i>R. ferrugineus</i> larvae for an exposure period of 24 hr. at the concentrations of 2.8, 4.2, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The concentrations for <i>N. glauca</i> extracts reflected an LC<sub>50</sub> of 2.7 ppm for leave, 2.6 ppm for flower, 2.8 ppm for stem and 7.00 ppm for root. While, the same concentrations extracts reflected an LC<sub>95</sub>of 11 ppm for leaf, 9.6 ppm for flower, 8.9 ppm for stem and 13.00 ppm for root. These results showed that <i>N. glauca</i> extracts have a remarkable potentiality as insecticidal substances that can be used as an ecofriendly integrated approach for the management of <i>R. ferrugineus</i>."
