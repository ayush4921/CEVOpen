<p id="p0040">Active insecticidal phytochemicals which extracted from plants are becoming increasingly important in research as a result of increased concern for the health and environment resulting of long use of conventional synthetic insecticides. Therefore, using biocontrol agents such as poisonous extracts from 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> might be a better approach in pest management with less harm to both environment and human health. Accordingly, the current study aimed to investigate the larvicidal effect of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> aqueous extracts against the red palm weevil larvae and the results are shown in the (
