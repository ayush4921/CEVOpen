<p id="p0045">The effect of leaf extract against 
 <italic>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</italic> larvae was used to test the susceptibility of 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> for a submission period of 24 hr. at concentrations of 2.8, 4.2, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Results showed that percentage of mortalities were as foloows; 55, 65, 75, 80, and 85, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The concentrations reflected an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.7 ppm, and LC
 <sub>95</sub> of 2.6 ppm. The lowest concentration (2.8 ppm) produced 55% mortality, whereas the highest concentration (8 ppm) reflected 95% mortality and the R-square was 0.79.
