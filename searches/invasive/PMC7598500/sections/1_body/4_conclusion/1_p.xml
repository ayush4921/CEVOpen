<p>The tested populations germinated under diverse environmental conditions, which indicates that the species can become noxious in marginal and cropped lands. The deep burial of seeds and application of mulches suppressed seedling emergence of the species. Thus, deep burial, shallow tillage and application of sorghum mulches could be successfully used to manage the species in agricultural habitats.</p>
