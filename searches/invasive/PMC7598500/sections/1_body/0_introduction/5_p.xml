<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> are rarely dormant, although they possess impermeable seed coat, which becomes permeable soon after seed dispersal. The mature ‘burr’ contains two seed, of which lower one germinates immediately after dispersal (after dry storage for some time), whereas the upper seed remains dormant until the testa is intact [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. More than 80% of the seeds produced by 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> are viable and exhibit high germination potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several studies have investigated the impact of individual environmental factors on seed germination of the species [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The seeds are non-photoblastic and do not have strict light requirement for germination [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The seeds rarely emerge if buried &gt;15 cm depth [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The species requires high moisture for seed germination and rarely emerge if field capacity is &lt;75% [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the seeds can absorb moisture under increased negative osmotic potential. The seeds lose their viability after few years of dispersal [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although, some information is available on seed germination, the complete knowledge relating to the impact of different environmental factors on seed germination of 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> is missing.
