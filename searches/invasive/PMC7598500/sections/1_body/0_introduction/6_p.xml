<p>The use of different mulches has gained increased importance for moisture conservation, weed management and improve soil nutrients [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The use of plant-based mulches not only lowers cost incurred on crop production, but also solves residue management issue. Nonetheless, mulches did not pose negative impact to crop production; therefore, can be successfully used for weed management [
