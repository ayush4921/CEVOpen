<p>The current study was conducted to determine the impact of different environmental factors on seed germination of 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> populations collected from agricultural and ruderal habitats. We were interested to know; i) whether there are differences among seed germination potential of populations stemming from different habitats, ii) are seeds able to germinate under diverse environmental conditions, iii) what is the optimum seed burial depth to retard seedling emergence and iv) what is the optimum dose of sorghum mulch to suppress the seedling emergence of the species. The results of the study would help to develop suitable and effective management strategies against the species.
