 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> is distributed in several geographic regions of the world and started to exert negative impacts on crop yields, biodiversity and economy [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, management strategies are inevitable for the species. The successful management of any weed species depends on the sound knowledge of seed germination biology [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Seed germination is the first transition step from ‘seed’ to ‘seedling’ in the life cycle of plant species, and readily affected by various environmental factors [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, seed dormancy level of the seed at different times strongly regulates seed germination of different plant species [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and among different populations of the same species [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Seed germination under wide range of environmental conditions guarantees successful establishment and dispersal. Similarly, retarding seed germination or making seeds dormant is the most successful weed management strategy [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, sound knowledge of seed germination biology is essential to manage/suppress weed seed germination.
