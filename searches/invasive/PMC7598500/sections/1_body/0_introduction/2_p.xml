<p>The infestation of 
 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> in cotton caused 5% yield losses in Mississippi, the USA [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, 6–27% cotton yield is lost in North Carolina [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] due to its infestation and critical period of competition is 2–10 weeks after crop emergence [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, groundnut yield is reduced by 31–39% with 0.5 plants m
 <sup>-2</sup> density and yield losses may reach ~88% if the density increases to 4 plants m
 <sup>-2</sup> [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 
 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> infestation in maize causes lower yield losses than in soybean, cotton and groundnut. A 10% reduction in maize yield occurs at 1 plants m
 <sup>-2</sup> density and reaches to 27% with 4.7 plants m
 <sup>-2</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Nonetheless, it also reduces the yield of horticultural crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A yield reduction of 5–50% is recorded in snap bean with 0.5 to 8 plants m
 <sup>-2</sup> density [
