 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is native to North America and Argentina [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and regarded as a noxious weed species of corn and soybean crops throughout the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, it produce large amounts of allergenic pollens due to close relatedness of

 <italic>Ambrosia</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The contact with glandular hairs of the plant causes dermatitis in allergenic individuals [
