<p>The establishment of plant species is strongly obstructed by salinity, pH and water stress. Germination ability under diverse pH, salinity and water stress levels guarantees the persistence and establishment of weed species [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The tested populations were able to germinate under diverse pH, salinity and osmotic potential levels. The germination of the tested populations under elevated pH, salinity and osmotic potential levels indicate that species could establish and persist in marginal habitats.
