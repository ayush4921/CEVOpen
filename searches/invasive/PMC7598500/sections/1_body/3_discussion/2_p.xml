<p>Photoperiod had a slight impact on seed germination of tested populations. The seeds proved non-photoblastic; however, higher seed germination was noted for 12-hour photoperiod. The results are in line with Weaver and Lechowicz [

 <italic>X</italic>. 
 <italic>strumarium</italic> did not depend on light availability. Overall, ruderal population exhibited low germination than agricultural population, which can be attributed to the disturbance faced by agricultural population. The seeds of ruderal population did not face frequent disturbance; thus, are less tolerant to adverse environmental conditions.
