<p>Seed germination is strongly dependent on soil temperature since numerous enzyme activities are regulated by temperature [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The tested populations exhibited seed germination under almost all tested temperatures with little differences. The optimum temperature ranged from 31 to 32°C for agricultural and ruderal populations. The earlier findings have also indicated that optimum temperature for seed germination of
