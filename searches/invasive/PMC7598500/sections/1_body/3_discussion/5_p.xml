<p>Seedling emergence increased up to 3 cm and followed by a sharp decline under deeper seed burials. The low emergence of the surface placed seeds can be linked to poor soil-seed contact and less water imbibition [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Several studies have reported that deep burial of the seeds of various weed species significantly decreased or even halted their seedling emergence [

 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It seems that burying seeds to maximum depth of emergence could combat the species agricultural habitats. However, topsoil is turned over by moldboard plow (conventional tillage) which help the seeds to included in the seed bank again. The weed management strategy must focus on decreasing seedling emergence, seed production and addition of seeds to soil seed bank. This will progressively reduce soil seed bank. Shallow tillage and management of the emerging seedlings through integrated weed management approach seems a viable option for the management of the species.
