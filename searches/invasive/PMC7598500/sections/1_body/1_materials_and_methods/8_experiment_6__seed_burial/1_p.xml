<p>The emergence of seeds arising from ruderal and agricultural populations was noted in a pot experiment conducted in greenhouse under controlled conditions. Ten different (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 cm) burial depths were included in the experiment. A total 20 seeds were buried at desired depth. Seedling emergence was recorded 21 days after the initiation of experiment. The pots were irrigated daily to exclude the danger of moisture stress. A mist sprinkler was used to irrigate the pots. The greenhouse was maintained at 30Â°C and 12-hour photoperiod throughout the experiment.</p>
