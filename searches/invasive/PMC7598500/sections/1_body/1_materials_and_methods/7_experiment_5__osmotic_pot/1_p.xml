<p>Seed germination of populations stemming from agricultural and ruderal habitats was observed under eight different osmotic potentials (-0.2 to -1.6 MPa), with -0.2 MPa difference among the treatments. The 0 MPa osmotic potential, regarded as control was included in the study for comparison. Polyethylene glycol 6000 was dissolved in distilled water to prepare solutions of respective osmotic potentials [
