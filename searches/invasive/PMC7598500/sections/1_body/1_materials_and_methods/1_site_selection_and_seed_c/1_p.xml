<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> L. populations were collected from Mian Channu. The seeds were collected at maturity, brought to lab, dried under shade (to meet after ripening requirements) and stored at 25°C until use. The seeds were collected from agricultural (30.419203, 72.300121) and ruderal (30.415984, 72.301836) population. Mature ‘burrs’ were collected from 50–60 mother plants. There are no specific permissions required for seed collection and the study did not involve any endangered species. Five laboratory and two greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the seed germination biology of both populations.
