The 90×15 mm Petri dishes were used to observe seed germination of ‘burrs’ (seeds hereafter). The dishes contained two layers of Whatman no. 1 filter paper, which was moistened with 5 ml deionized water or treatment solution. Paraffin film was used to seal the Petri dishes in order to prevent moisture loss. The dishes were kept at respective environmental conditions for 21 days and then seed germination was observed. There were 20 seeds in one Petri dish and each treatment had five replications. Two Petri dishes were considered as a single replication; thus, each treatment had 10 dishes and 200 seeds. All germination experiments were conducted at 30°C and 12 hours photoperiod with an exceptions for temperature and photoperiod experiments. Seed germination was recorded 21 days after the initiation of the experiments. The non-germinating seeds were tested for viability according to Onen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0241601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and germination was adjusted for viability. All experiments were terminated after 21 days and repeated over time (two experimental runs for each treatment). The experiments were laid out according to randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement. Populations were regarded as main plot, whereas experimental treatments were randomized in sub-plots.
