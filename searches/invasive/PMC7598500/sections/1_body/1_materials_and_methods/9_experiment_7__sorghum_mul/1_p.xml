<p>The impact of different doses of sorghum mulch on seedling emergence was recorded in pot experiment. The respective doses were applied at the soil surface after seed sowing. A total 20 seeds were sown in the pots and mulches were applied according to the treatments on soil surface. The greenhouse was maintained at 30Â°C and 12-hour photoperiod throughout the experiment. The pots were irrigated daily to exclude the danger of moisture stress. A mist sprinkler was used for irrigation. Sorghum plants (above ground parts) were dried to prepare mulches. The dried plants were chopped in a grinding mil to prepare mulches. The resultant powder was regarded as mulch and used according to the treatments.</p>
