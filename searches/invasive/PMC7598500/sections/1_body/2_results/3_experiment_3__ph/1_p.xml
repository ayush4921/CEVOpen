<p>Different pH levels included in the study altered seed germination of populations arising from different habitats. An increase in seed germination was recorded with increasing pH up to 8 and then seed germination sharply declined. Like temperature experiment, agricultural population exhibited higher seed germination (90.64%) compared to ruderal population (85.94%). The highest germination was recorded under 7.51 and 7.52 pH for agricultural and ruderal populations, respectively (
