<p>Different burial depths strongly suppressed the seedling emergence of populations stemming from two distinct. An initial increase was witnessed in seedling emergence up to 3 cm and then a linear reduction was noted. Higher seedling emergence was recorded for agricultural population (82.44%) compared to ruderal population (71.54%). Peak seedling emergence was recorded at 2.88 and 2.87 cm seed burial depths for agricultural and ruderal populations, respectively (
