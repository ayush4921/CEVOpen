<p>The application of different doses of sorghum mulches strongly mediated the seedling emergence of the tested populations. A constant reduction in seedling emergence of both populations was observed with increasing dose of sorghum mulches. Higher seedling emergence was recorded for agricultural population (84.17%) compared to ruderal population (75.78%). The sorghum mulches required to stop 50% of the final seedling emergence percentage were 5.83 and 5.89 t ha
 <sup>-1</sup> for agricultural and ruderal populations, respectively (

 <sup>-1</sup> application of sorghum mulches in both populations.
