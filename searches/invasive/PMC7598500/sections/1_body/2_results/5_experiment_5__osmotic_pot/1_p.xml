<p>Different osmotic potentials strongly mediated the seed germination of tested populations. A linear reduction in seed germination of both populations was noted with increasing negative osmotic potential. The seeds of agricultural population exhibited higher germination (94.11%) compared to the seeds of ruderal population (87.87%). The osmotic potential required to retard the 50% of the final germination of agricultural population was -0.86 Mpa, whereas -0.87 osmotic potential retarded 50% of the final seed germination of ruderal population (
