<p>Different salinity levels altered the seed germination of both populations. Seed germination was linearly decreased with increasing salinity level. Overall agricultural population had higher germination ability (95.71%) compared to ruderal population (93.28%). The 50% of the final germination of agricultural population was retarded by 248.55 mM NaCl salinity, whereas 240.56 mM was sufficient to retard 50% of the final seed germination of ruderal population (
