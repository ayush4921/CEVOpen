<p>Different constant temperatures strongly mediated the germination of both populations stemming from different habitats. An increase in seed germination percentage was recorded with rise in temperature up to 35°C and then a sharp decline was noted. Agricultural population had higher seed germination (92.66%) compared to ruderal population (81.74%). The highest germination was recorded at 30.62 and 31.08°C for agricultural and ruderal populations, respectively (
