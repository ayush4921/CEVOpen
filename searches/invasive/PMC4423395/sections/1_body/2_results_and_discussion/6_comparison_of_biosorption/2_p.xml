<p>Pretreatments (taking NaOH-boiling and immobilization as examples) could avail copper(II) ions more functional groups to bind. That may be why formaldehyde inactivated 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass had lower biosorption capacity than those pretreated fungal biosorbents. Compared with other unpretreated fungal adsorbents, however, biosorption capacity of 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> was relatively high.
