<p>Copper(II) biosorption capacity of dead 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass at different pH is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Approximately, the biosorption capacity of biomass increased with an increase of pH from 2.5 to 6.0, and then decreased at pH 6.5 and 7.0. Additionally, during the adsorptive process, the pH of equilibrium solution was slightly lower than that of initial solution.
