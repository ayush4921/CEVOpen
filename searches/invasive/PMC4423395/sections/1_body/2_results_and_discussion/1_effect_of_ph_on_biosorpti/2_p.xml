<p>Previous studies showed that pH value of the solution was an important parameter for both solution chemical properties of metals and surface characteristics of biosorbents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. According to Asmal et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], there are three species of copper present in solution: Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, CuOH
 <sup>+</sup> and Cu(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. At low pH (here maybe from 2.5 to 3.5), H
 <sup>+</sup> ions competed with Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions for the biosorption sites, that is protonation of the cell wall components negatively affected the biosorption capacity of dead 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass. However, this effect became less with the increase in pH (from 4.0 to 6.0) owing to that the raise of negative charges density on the cell surface offered more metal binding sites [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. At this pH Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and CuOH
 <sup>+</sup> were more favourable copper species. Therefore, just like the results of some works [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], we also found a sharp increase in biosorption with a slight increase of pH (at around pH 3.5). At higher pH (≥6.5), precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide occurred and precipitated on surfaces of biomass and bottle wall. Furthermore, all those above suggested that ion-exchange played an important role in biosorption of copper(II) ions by dead 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic>.
