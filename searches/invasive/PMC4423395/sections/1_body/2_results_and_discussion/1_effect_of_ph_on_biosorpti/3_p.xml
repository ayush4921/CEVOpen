<p>The optimum pH was 6.0 at which copper(II) biosorption capacity of dead 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass reached 6.79 mg/g. The optimum pH values of different reports on copper(II) biosorption by different biomasses differ quite a bit. 
 <italic>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> fungal biomasses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and three species of dead fungal biomasses (
 <italic>Cladosporium cladosporioides</italic>, 
 <italic>Gliomastix murorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Bjerkandera</italic> sp.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] showed the same optimum pH 6.0 for copper(II) removal, while cone biomass of 
 <italic>Thuja orientalis</italic> showed the optimum pH value to be 7.7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> algal biomass to be 5.0. The components and structural characteristics of various biomasses are quite diverse, which may be the most important reason for optimum pH differences. There must be other reasons such as different experimental parameters and operating error.
