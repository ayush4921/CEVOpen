<p>At optimum pH, the amount of copper(II) adsorbed by dead 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> increased during the biosorption process (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This process consisted of two phases: the rapid phase during the first one hour at which biosorption contributed significantly great to adsorptive equilibrium, and the subsequent slower phase when biosorption contributed relatively small. At the end of the rapid phase, the amount of copper(II) biosorption reached 86% of the equilibrium which cost about 1 hour. The copper(II) biosorption decreased at the 2nd and 4th hours might because at that time the slightly decrease of pH resulted in H
 <sup>+</sup> ions competing slightly with Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and CuOH
 <sup>+</sup> ions for the biosorption sites and/or because of experimental errors, which needs to be further studied.
