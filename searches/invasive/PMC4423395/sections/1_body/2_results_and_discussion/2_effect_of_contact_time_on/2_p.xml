<p>The equilibrium time of the copper biosorption by fungal biomass is determined by many parameters such as agitation rate of the solution, pretreated methods of the fungal biomass, structural properties and quantity of the biosorbents, the existence of other metal ions and initial copper(II) concentration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, one species of biosorbent may cost different time (ranging from a few minutes to several hours [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]) to reach equilibrium under different conditions. One hour as the equilibrium time of copper biosorption in this study was scarcely reported before.
