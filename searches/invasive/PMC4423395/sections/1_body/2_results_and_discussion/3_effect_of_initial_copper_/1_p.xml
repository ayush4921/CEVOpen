<p>The effect of initial copper(II) concentration on biosorption is presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Approximately, copper biosorption increased with the increase of initial copper(II) ion concentration at the same unprecipitable pH. At pH 6.0, copper biosorption capacity increased sharply from 0.85 mg/g to 6.79 mg/g (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) while the initial copper(II) concentration was from 5 to 100 mg/L, but this increase became minor if the initial concentration continued to be raised. The highest biosorption capacity was 7.76 mg/g for 200 mg/L at pH 6.0.
