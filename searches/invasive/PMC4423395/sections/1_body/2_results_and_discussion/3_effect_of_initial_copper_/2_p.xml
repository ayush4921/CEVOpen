<p>At pH 6.0, copper(II) precipitated at initial concentrations higher than 300 mg/L. Under the same conditions, in the solutions of higher concentration, there were much more copper(II) ions around the active sites of 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass. Thus the adsorptive process could proceed more sufficiently, and that is why copper(II) adsorptive capacity increased with the increasing of initial concentration.
