<p>Fungus 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> was isolated from the litter of 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> (an exotic plant to China) in Pukou, Nanjing, China. It was cultivated at 25°C in 250 mL flasks containing 100 mL liquid medium composed of malt extract (20 g/L), peptone (1 g/L) and dextrose (20 g/L). After about 10 days incubation on a shaker at 150 r/min, 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> mycelium was washed several times with deionized water, and then inactivated by immersion into 1% formaldehyde. After washing, the mycelium was dried at 60°C for 24 hour (h). Finally, dry mycelium was ground and sieved (mesh size &lt; 0.5 mm).
