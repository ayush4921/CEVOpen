<p>Batch biosorption experiments were conducted separately to evaluate the effects of pH, time, initial copper(II) concentration on biosorption of copper ions. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the mean values were taken as the final results. For every treatment, 0.2 g dead biomass was added into 100 mL of copper(II) solution in 250 mL flask. The flasks were shaken (150 r/min) at 25°C for 12 h. Then, copper(II) solutions were vacuum filtered through Millipore membrane filters (0.45 μm, Shanhai Xingya Purification Material Factory, China). After dilution, initial and equilibrium copper(II) concentrations were determined using an atomic absorption spectrometer (AA320CRT, Shanghai Analytical Instrument Overall Factory, China). The copper(II) biosorption amount was calculated by Eq. (
