<p>The results illustrated that formaldehyde inactivated 
 <italic>Ceriporia lacerata</italic> biomass (without acid or alkali treatment for improving adsorption properties) showed a relatively high capacity in removal of copper(II) from aqueous solutions. The optimum operating conditions was proved to be at pH 6.0, contact time of 1 hour, initial copper(II) concentration of 200 mg/L. The pseudo second-order adsorptive model gave the best adjustment for copper(II) biosorption kinetics, while the equilibrium data fitted very well to both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorptive isotherm models. Without further acid or alkali treatment for improving adsorption properties, formaldehyde inactivated 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass possesses good biosorption characteristics on copper(II) removal from aqueous solutions. Prospectively, immobilized or further pretreated 
 <italic>Ceriporia lacerata</italic> biomass has potential to be used as an efficient adsorbent in treatment of heavy metal polluted waters.
