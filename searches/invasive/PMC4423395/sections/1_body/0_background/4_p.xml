 <italic>Ceriporia lacerata</italic> is a white-rot fungus first isolated as a new species from white-rotted wood in Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Till 2006, only four other reports published about it, referring to its taxonomy, genetics or decomposition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Since 2007, 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> has been more widely researched on its clinical significance, wood-decaying effect, metal tolerance and sorption potential and some other characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that the cadmium(II) removal rates by 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> in stationary and shaking cultures were about 7% and 11%, respectively. However, there is so limited information yet available on this species that its other properties need further study. The objectives of this work were to verify the capacity of dead 
 <italic>C. lacerata</italic> in copper(II) removal under batch conditions, to determine the influences of parameters involved, and to simulate the adsorptive equilibrium and kinetics.
