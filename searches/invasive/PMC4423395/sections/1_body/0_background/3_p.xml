<p>Many fungi have been extensively studied and proved to be good biosorbents of heavy metals, such as 
 <italic>Rhizopus arrhizus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> spp. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, white-rot fungi were relatively less reported for their biosorption though they were strong degrader of various xenobiotics and detoxicating materials of contaminated effluents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. They also possess the capacity of heavy metal biosorption [
