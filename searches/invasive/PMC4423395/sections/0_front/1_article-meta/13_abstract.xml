  <title>Background</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Ceriporia lacerata</italic>, a strain of white-rot fungus isolated from the litter of an invasive plant (
   <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic>) in China, was little known about its properties and utilization. In this work, the copper(II) biosorption characteristics of formaldehyde inactivated 
   <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass were examined as a function of initial pH, initial copper(II) concentration and contact time, and the adsorptive equilibrium and kinetics were simulated, too.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The optimum pH was found to be 6.0 at experimental conditions of initial copper(II) concentration 100 mg/L, biomass dose 2 g/L, contact time 12 h, shaking rate 150 r/min and temperature 25°C. Biosorption equilibrium cost about 1 hour at experimental conditions of pH 6.0, initial copper(II) concentration 100 mg/L, 
   <italic>C. lacerata</italic> dose 2 g/L, shaking rate 150 r/min and temperature 25°C. At optimum pH 6.0, highest copper(II) biosorption amounts were 6.79 and 7.76 mg/g for initial copper(II) concentration of 100 and 200 mg/L, respectively (with other experimental parameters of 
   <italic>C. lacerata</italic> dose 2 g/L, shaking rate 150 r/min and temperature 25°C). The pseudo second-order adsorptive model gave the best adjustment for copper(II) biosorption kinetics. The equilibrium data fitted very well to both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorptive isotherm models.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Without further acid or alkali treatment for improving adsorption properties, formaldehyde inactivated 
   <italic>C. lacerata</italic> biomass possesses good biosorption characteristics on copper(II) removal from aqueous solutions.
