 <caption> ( a) Mean cumulative mortality (Â±SE) of Cydalima perspectalis (including mortality of malformed adults) treated with various concentrations of Isaria fumosorosea conidia. A generalized linear model was fitted and pairwise between treatment differences were tested using the least-square means. Different letters indicate significant differences between columns ( p &lt; 0.05); ( b) Log-probit regression line of concentration-mortality response of C. perspectalis to I. fumosorosea. </caption>
