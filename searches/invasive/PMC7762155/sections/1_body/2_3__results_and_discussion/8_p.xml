<p>Results of in vitro experiments using 
 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> hydro-alcoholic extract revealed that this extract has a negative effect on the germination of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> conidia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00342-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In the control treated by solvent, the mean germination was 100% (SE = 0, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), while on extract-treated agar, the mean germination was only 92.67% (SE = 0.88, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) in average. The difference was statistically highly significant (Ï‡
