<p>Most BTM larvae successfully passed to pupa regardless of treatment (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00342-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and no statistically significant effect of treatment on the duration of the larval stage was observed (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 10.08, df = 5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0730). Similarly, treatments had no significant effect on the duration of the pupal stage (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.19, df = 5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.9992), but higher mortality was observed in all treatments; the maximum mortality of 46.4% pupae was found with the highest concentration of fungal treatment.
