<p>The low efficacy is rather surprising, because the strain CCM 8367 of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> used in this study was previously found to be highly virulent against several pest species. For example, the mortality of pupae of 
 <italic>C. ohridella</italic>, an invasive pest of 
 <italic>Aesculus hippocastanum</italic> in Europe [
 <xref rid="B29-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], treated by blastospores or conidia suspension of concentration 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> spores per 1 mL reached 100% over a few days [
 <xref rid="B20-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Later, the high efficacy of this strain was confirmed against 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Boisd.) in which an application of CCM 8367 blastospores at a concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> per 1 mL caused larval mortality &gt;90% [
 <xref rid="B27-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The high efficacy of CCM 8367 under laboratory conditions similar to that used in the present study was reported also against Colorado potato beetle, 
 <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic>, (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) larvae [
 <xref rid="B30-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This indicated that the strain could be a prospective biocontrol agent, although some side effects against non-target natural enemies were also reported [
 <xref rid="B31-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
