<p>The inhibition zone assay showed the suppression of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> mycelium growth on filter paper discs treated by 
 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> extract. The mean area not covered by mycelium was 0.02 ± 0.01 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and 53.83 ± 19.86 mm
 <sup>2</sup> in control and treated discs, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (Z = −2.184,
