<p>The log-probit regression line describing the relationship between concentration and mortality has a form

 <italic>x</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00342-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), but the slope was not statistically significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 3.27, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.071). Thus, the extrapolated values of LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.42 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 7.88 × 10
 <sup>18</sup> were very high. For example, this contrasts with the LC
