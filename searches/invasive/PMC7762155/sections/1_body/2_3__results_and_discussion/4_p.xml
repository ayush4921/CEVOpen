<p>The cumulative mean mortality, including mortality in malformed adults, varied among treatments and reached a maximum value of 60% when larvae were treated by a suspension of 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> conidia per 1 mL (

 <xref rid="B28-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was only 42.9%. Although the effect of treatment on mortality was significant (χ

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.45, df = 1,
