<p>It may be concluded that the strain CCM 8367 of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> is not a potent biocontrol agent against 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> and that the reason for the low efficacy of the fungus might be the accumulation of host plant phytochemicals with antimicrobial activity in the fifth-instar larvae cuticle of the pest.
