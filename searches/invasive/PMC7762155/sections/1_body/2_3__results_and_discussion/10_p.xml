<p>Our findings indicate the presence of phytochemicals in box tree leaves having some activity against entomopathogenic fungi. Several secondary plant compounds were found to have a negative effect on the germination of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> blastospores, indicating that the presence of allelochemicals on a substrate (e.g., insect cuticle or leaf) may be an additional constraint to the survival of entomopathogenic fungi [
 <xref rid="B38-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Buxus</italic> trees contain a lot of alkaloids, some of which are sequestered by 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> larvae, while some are metabolized and/or excreted [
 <xref rid="B39-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of substances extracted from 
 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> by 65% ethanol were found earlier [
 <xref rid="B40-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and similar effects of box tree extracts were confirmed by other authors [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, it is thus likely that BTM larvae use phytochemicals obtained from the host plant for their own defense against the invasion of microbial pathogens. This might explain the low efficacy of two strains of entomopathogenic fungi, 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> (present study), and 
 <italic>B. bassiana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] against BTM.
