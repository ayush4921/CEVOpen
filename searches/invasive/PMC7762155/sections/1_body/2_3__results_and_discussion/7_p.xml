<p>LT-SEM imaging of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> conidia on the cuticle of BTM larvae revealed a high number of spores immediately after treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00342-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b), but after 24 and 48 h of incubation, the number of attached spores seemed to be much lower, as we found them only in some places of larvae, usually as small groups or individual conidia. This indicates low conidial attachment to the larvae cuticle. Examination further showed that the number of spores did not germinate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-06-00342-f004">Figure 4</xref>dâ€“f). This finding might explain the low virulence of the fungus against 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> because the successful germination of fungus conidia on the host cuticle has been considered to be necessary for infection [

 <xref rid="B35-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. One of the reasons might be the presence of antifungal compounds on the cuticle [

 <xref rid="B37-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which might be also case of 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic>.
