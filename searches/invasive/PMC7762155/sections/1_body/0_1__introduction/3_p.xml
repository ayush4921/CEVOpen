<p>The present study aimed to assess the possibility of fungal biocontrol of 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> by 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic>, which is known to be virulent to many insect species including a wide variety of butterflies and moths [

 <xref rid="B16-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and has received significant attention as a possible biological control agent for several economically important pests [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The obtained results showed low efficacy of the fungus against this pest. Therefore, additional experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that the low effectiveness might be due to the antifungal activity of some host plant phytochemicals consumed by the moth larvae. Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy revealed that the number of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> conidia did not germinate. In vitro experiments confirmed that the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>Buxus</italic> leaves suppressed spore germination and fungus growth.
