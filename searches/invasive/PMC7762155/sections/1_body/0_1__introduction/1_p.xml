<p>Box trees, 
 <italic>Buxus</italic> sp., are important evergreen shrubs occurring in natural 
 <italic>Buxus</italic> forests [
 <xref rid="B1-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or grown as ornamental trees in city parks in Europe. They are now endangered by the box tree moth (BTM), 
 <italic>Cydalima perspectalis</italic> (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), which is a serious invasive pest native to Asia that was first detected in Germany in 2007 and has since invaded a large area causing significant damage [
 <xref rid="B2-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This pest overwinters at the larval stage [
 <xref rid="B4-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and can have two to four generations per year in Europe depending on abiotic conditions [
 <xref rid="B6-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Natural enemies do not suppress the 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> population, which is probably because this exotic species does not seem to be a good host for native parasitoids [
 <xref rid="B4-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the pest is able to destroy 
 <italic>Buxus</italic> tree completely in one season [
 <xref rid="B9-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some synthetic chemical insecticides are effective in 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> control [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Still, their application in natural habitats is problematic because of their adverse side effects on non-target species. Their frequent application possibly leads to the risk of resistance development in the pest.
