<p>The use of microbial biopesticides against BTM offers a unique alternate solution to broad-spectrum chemical insecticides. The best results have been obtained by using products based on 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) while entomopathogenic nematode 
 <italic>Steinernema carpocapsae</italic> (Weiser) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) was less successful [

 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae), 
 <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> (Metsch.) Sorokin, (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), 
 <italic>Isaria fumosorosea</italic> (WIZE) Brown &amp; Smith (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae), and 
 <italic>B. brongniartii</italic> (Saccardo) (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) have been developed in the world [
 <xref rid="B13-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To our knowledge, only 
 <italic>B. bassiana</italic> strain GY1-17 was tested against BTM in Korea, but larvae were not affected significantly [
