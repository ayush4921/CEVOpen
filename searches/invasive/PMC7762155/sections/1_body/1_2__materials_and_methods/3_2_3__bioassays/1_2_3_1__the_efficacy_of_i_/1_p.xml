<p>Five concentrations of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> ranging from 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> spores per 1 mL were used in this experiment. The last-instar larvae of BTM in treated groups were individually immersed in the suspension of conidiospores of the fungus for five seconds (dip-test). All specimens in a control group were immersed in sterile solution of 0.05% Tween
 <sup>®</sup> 80 only. Then, the larvae were placed into polystyrene Petri dishes (vented, inner diameter 90 mm, height 15 mm, Gosselin™, Borre, France) lined with moist filter paper (KA 0, Papírna Perštejn, Ltd., Perštejn, Czech Republic) and kept under constant conditions (25 ± 1 °C and 16L:8D photoperiod). Larvae were fed with 
 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> leaves, which were replaced daily until larva developed into pupa or died. The filter paper was also daily moistened by distilled water to maintain optimal humidity inside the Petri dishes. The insects were monitored daily for a period of three weeks to record insect development, mortality, and the development of mycosis on cadavers until all individuals died or adults emerged.
