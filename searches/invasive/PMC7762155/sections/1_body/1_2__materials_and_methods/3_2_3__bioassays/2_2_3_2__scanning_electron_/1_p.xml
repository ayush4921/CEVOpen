<p>In vivo germination of fungal conidia on the insect cuticle was examined by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM). BTM larvae were treated by immersing in suspension of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> conidia (concentration 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> spores mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and incubated for 0, 24, and 48 h at the temperature of 25 °C. The larvae were mounted on an aluminum stub using Tissue-Tek (C.C.T.D. Compound, The Netherlands). The samples were extremely fast (&lt;10
 <sup>−3</sup> K/s) frozen in vapor of liquid nitrogen. After freezing, the samples were transfered into a GATAN ALTO-2500 high vacuum cryo-preparation chamber (Gatan Inc., Abingdon, UK). The surface of the sample was sublimated (freeze-etched) for 5 min at the temperature of −95 °C and at −130 °C. After sublimation, the samples were sputter-coated with gold at the temperature of −130 °C. Coated samples were inserted into the chamber of a JEOL JSM-7401F Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Images were obtained by the secondary electron signal at an accelerating voltage of 4 kV and current 10 µA using an Everhart–Thornley Detector (ETD).
