 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> extract on fungus growth was measured by a modified inhibition zone assay [
 <xref rid="B23-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A half mL of conidia suspension in 0.05% Tween
 <sup>®</sup> 80 at a concentration 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> spores mL
 <sup>−1</sup> was spread evenly on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium in a plastic Petri dish (diameter 90 mm). A hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> leaves prepared as described above was applied on filter paper discs (diameter 14 mm) in a dose 150 µL per disc. Control discs were treated with 150 µL of the pure solvent. The solvent was allowed to evaporate, and paper discs were placed carefully in the center of PDA plates. After 7 days incubation at 25 °C, the plates were photographed by a digital camera Olympus SP-510 (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) mounted on a tripod to document differences in fungus growth. Then, the area of plate in the center not covered by 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> mycelium was measured using ImageJ, a Java-based image analysis software [
