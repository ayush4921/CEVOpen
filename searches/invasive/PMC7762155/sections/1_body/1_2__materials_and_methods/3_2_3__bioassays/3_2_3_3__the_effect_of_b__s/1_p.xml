<p>Plant material was collected from untreated 
 <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> trees grown in the Biology Centre garden. The extract used for the study was prepared at the concentration of 20% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) by grinding 2 g of fresh leaves in 10 mL of solvent (water–ethanol 1:1 mixture). Analytic grade ethanol (Penta Ltd., Czech Republic) and distilled water were used. The mixture was filtered through filter paper (KA 0, Papírna Perštejn, Ltd., Czech Republic) to remove particulate materials, and one milliliter of fresh extract was spread on the surface of 2% water agar in Petri dish and left to dry for 24 h. Then, a suspension of 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> conidia was applied using an inoculation loop on the surface. Germination was evaluated in 100 spores after 24 h of incubation at 25 ± 1 °C as described above. The control plate was treated with solvent only. The experiment was conducted in three replicates. Spore germination was documented by NIS-Elements Imaging Software and a Nikon Eclipse E200 microscope equipped with Nikon DS-Fi3 color camera (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
