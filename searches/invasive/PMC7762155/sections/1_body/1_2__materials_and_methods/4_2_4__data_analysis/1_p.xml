<p>To analyze the effect of treatment on developmental time of 
 <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> larvae and pupae, we fitted generalized linear models (GLM) with a Poisson error distribution and log link function. Mortality as well as germination data were analyzed using GLM with a binomial distribution and logit link. Treatment and replication were set as fixed effects. The analyses were performed in SAS
 <sup>®</sup> Studio for Linux [
 <xref rid="B25-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] using the GLM procedure (PROC GENMOD) of SAS/STAT
 <sup>®</sup> module [
 <xref rid="B26-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Means were separated by the least-square means (LSMEANS) statement of SAS with Tukey–Kramer adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
 <italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub>) were estimated using Probit analysis (PROC PROBIT). Differences in area not covered by 
 <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> mycelium were compared by an exact Wilcoxon two-sample test (PROC NPAR1WAY) of the SAS/STAT
 <sup>®</sup> module.
