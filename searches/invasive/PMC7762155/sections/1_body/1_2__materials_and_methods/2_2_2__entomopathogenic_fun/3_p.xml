<p>The viability of spores was verified using a standard germination test [
 <xref rid="B22-jof-06-00342" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Ten drops from suspension were applied using a 1 μL inoculation loop on the surface of 2% water agar, which was poured in a thin layer onto the surface of a sterile slide. After the drops had dried, the slides were moved into a wet chamber and incubated at temperature 25 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The percentage of germinating spores was determined using an Olympus CH20 light microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); bright field, 400× magnification. The spore germination in all tests was 100%.
