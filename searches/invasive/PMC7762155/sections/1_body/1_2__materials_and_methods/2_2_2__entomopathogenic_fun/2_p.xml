<p>The fungus was grown on PDA medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) at 25 ± 1 °C and a 16L:8D photoperiod. After 10 days of incubation, the spore suspensions were prepared from each strain by scraping off conidia into the sterile solution of 0.05% (

In uniform suspension, the spores were counted with a Neubauer improved counting chamber (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), and subsequently, the suspension was adjusted to the required concentration.
