  <italic>Buxus</italic> sp. is an important native and ornamental tree in Europe threatened by a serious invasive pest 
  <italic>Cydalima perspectalis</italic>. The larvae of this moth are able to defoliate box trees and cause their death. The development of novel biopesticides targeting this pest might help protect 
  <italic>Buxus</italic> trees grown wildly or in city parks. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungus 
  <italic>Isaria fumosorosea</italic> strain CCM 8367 against 
  <italic>C. perspectalis</italic>. The last-instar larvae of the box tree moth were treated by the suspension of fungus conidia at concentrations ranging from 1 × 10
  <sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10
  <sup>8</sup> spores per 1 mL. Fungus infection was observed mostly in pupae, but the maximum mortality did not exceed 60%, indicating a very low susceptibility of 
  <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> to 
  <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic>. Furthermore, a number of ungerminated fungal conidia were found on larval cuticles using a low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. Our data also reveal that the hydroalcoholic extract from 
  <italic>B. sempervirens</italic> leaves significantly inhibits both the germination of 
  <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> conidia and fungus growth. It can be speculated that the strain CCM 8367 of 
  <italic>I. fumosorosea</italic> is not a potent biocontrol agent against 
  <italic>C. perspectalis</italic> and low virulence of the fungus might be due to the accumulation of host plant phytochemicals having antimicrobial activity in larval cuticle of the pest.
