<p>A retrospective review of records from the Poisons Information Helpline of the Western Cape (PIH), jointly run by the Poisons Information Centres (PICs) at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital and Tygerberg Hospital, was conducted over approximately 2.5 years, from June 1, 2015 to November 30, 2017. Standard PIC consultation forms include the date, origin of the call (province and district), circumstance of exposure, animal characteristics (species/sex/age), substances involved, clinical signs and route of exposure (eg, oral). All reported cases related to animal poisoning between June 1, 2015 and November 30, 2017 were reviewed to identify those caused by plants and mushrooms. The plants were identified by experts in the PIC in consultation with Universities and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. According to the data, the causative substances were classified into three main categories: alien, native and unknown taxa (unknown taxa refers to cases involving taxa that could only be identified to genus level), the origin of plants follows the classification by Richardson and others,
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> alien plant species ‘Plant taxa in a given area whose presence there is due to intentional or accidental introduction as a result of human activity’. The Gwaltney-Brant method
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> for classifying the severity of exposure was used postevent by the researchers, with the following categories: ‘no signs’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’.
