<p>This is one of the first studies to access poison centre reported records of animal poisoning at national scale in South Africa, and the data described provide useful information on animal exposure to plants and mushrooms in this country. The dog was the most reported species, and the most implicated group of plants were those not native to South Africa, probably because this species, which generally share the ownerâ€™s domestic environment, is more likely to come in contact with ornamental plants that are usually native to other geographical regions. The results indicated that there seem to be an under-reporting of intoxication incidences and that there is the need to implement strategies to stimulate the reporting of the cases. Moreover, more attention should be paid to prevention of poisoning in animals and that there is a need to engage the public for future surveillance and to enable people to recognise potentially hazardous plants and reduce the risk of poisoning in animals. Finally, strengthening the case management and increasing the pharmacovigilance would be beneficial to improve the survival and presentation of animal-related cases of poisoning.</p>
