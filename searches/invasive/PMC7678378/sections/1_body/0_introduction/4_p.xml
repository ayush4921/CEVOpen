<p>Previous studies conducted in South Africa focused on poisoning in humans,
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20 38â€“40</xref> and only a few studies specifically focused on human poisonings due to plant exposures.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 38</xref> Plant poisoning in South Africa has been described for horses and livestock,
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> but no report describing poisoning exposures in all types of animals at a country scale has previously been published.
