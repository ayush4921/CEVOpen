<p>The most worrying issue is the emerging impact on human health,

 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–23</xref> Animal poisoning occurs as a result of exposure to various toxic substances
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 24–26</xref> and episodes due to plant exposure are anything but rare.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23 27–29</xref> Long-term retrospective studies have shown that plants cause major animal poisoning: for example in Germany data of the Poison Centres (2012–2014) showed that plants and mushrooms accounted for 18.6 per cent of all the enquiries on animal (dogs, cats, horses, ruminants, rabbits/rodents and birds) poisoning and, as for calls involving a known toxicant (n=1752), plant and mushroom intoxications were responsible for the highest number of fatal cases (25.7 per cent), whereas in Italy plants accounted for 5.5 per cent of all the enquiries on animal (dogs, cats, horses, ruminants, rabbits, ferrets and exotics) poisoning received by the Poison Control Centre of Milan (2000–2010).

 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> indicated that between 2000 and 2010 in the USA, animal exposures resulted in 1 371 095 related cases; this represents 4.7 per cent of all the reported cases of poison exposures on humans and animals and, concerning the latter (dogs, cats, horses, ruminants, aquatics, birds and rodents), plants were responsible for 6.9 per cent of the cases.
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Moreover, according to this study, 15 animal poison exposures occur every hour in the USA, and globally, there are several notable cases of animal poisoning.
