<p>This study revealed that the majority of poisonings were caused by alien plant species, followed by plants and mushrooms that could not be identified to a species level (predominantly mushrooms), while native plants only accounted for a few reported cases. The most common toxic plants reported in literature, which were also reported in this study, include 
 <italic>Brugmansia candida,</italic>
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic>,
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 52</xref>
 <italic>N oleander</italic>,
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 28</xref>
 <italic>Duranta repens</italic>
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> and 
 <italic>Euphorbia marginata</italic>,
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55 56</xref> whereas the less common plants, both in this study and in previous literature, include 
 <italic>E subsessilis, Ficus carica L., M toluca</italic> and 
 <italic>P sylvestris</italic>. However, this could be attributed to the fact that most of the plants are ornamental plants; hence, the exposure of pets is likely.
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> According to the study by Caloni and others,
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> which focused on plant poisonings in domestic animals in Italy between 2000 and 2011 and revealed causative species that are also present in South Africa, 
 <italic>N oleander</italic> was responsible for nine poisoning cases in dogs, of which one case resulted in death. Due to the increased globalisation, many plants are moved around the world for various purposes such as pot plants or for gardening.
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> However, since these plants did not naturally occur in the area of introduction, people have little to limited knowledge about their toxicity in both humans and animals.
