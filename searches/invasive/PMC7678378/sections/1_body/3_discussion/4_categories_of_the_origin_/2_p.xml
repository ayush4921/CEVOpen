<p>The episode of intoxication recorded in a cow due to the ingestion of 
 <italic>S viminale</italic> with the animal exhibiting hypersalivation and weakness probably due to the presence of pregnane glycosides
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> is new in the literature. In South Africa, the most common episodes involving cows are exposures to cardiac glycoside-containing plants, mainly 
 <italic>N oleander</italic>, species that has been frequently implicated also in the southern USA, where it is very common, and in Brazil.
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 58â€“60</xref> Our findings are similar to those reported in other studies, which showed that the native plants that were the primary causes of animal poisoning around the world.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 44</xref> There are few studies reporting animal poisoning from 
 <italic>C comosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Crassula perforata variegata</italic>.
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> In livestock, the exposures generally occur when the hay or silage are contaminated by poisonous plants or when forage alternatives are not accessible. Other causes are drought, recently burned pastures, introduction of animals in new areas with different plants and factors like climate and livestock/pastures management.
