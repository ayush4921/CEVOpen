<p>Our results confirmed that animal poisoning exposures to plant and mushrooms are important in the world. In South Africa, 3.3 per cent of all plant–mushroom related calls involved animals, which is similar to the situation in Germany where animal-related calls accounted for at most 3.7 per cent of all poison calls received.

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23 28 29 45–48</xref> As for the other animals, we had just one report concerning a cow and one on a rabbit. This fact could possibly be attributed, among various reasons, to a poor reporting of cases due to lack of knowledge of the existence of facilities such as the PIH.
