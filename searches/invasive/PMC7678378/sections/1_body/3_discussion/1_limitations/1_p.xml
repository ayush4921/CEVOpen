<p>The major limitation of the study is the limited number of cases reported; moreover, there is uncertainty as to whether the reported cases reflect the actual situation with regards to animals being affected (mostly dogs reported) and severity. Furthermore, there is the possibility that owners may call the poison centre reporting as poisonings, symptoms actually due to other medical conditions. It is also a weakness that other underlying causes of the symptoms described were not ruled out by veterinary professionals, in particular when plant poisoning was suspected but the involved plants were believed to be non-toxic. The plant/mushroom variables analysed in this study were limited by the lack of description of some of the reported species, since not all the plants and mushrooms could be identified to a species level. Nevertheless, it should be considered that toxicity can often be similar throughout a broader taxon, thus specific classification is not always essential. Moreover, the correct classification of the plants according to their characteristics may be challenging for the public. Certain information was not available, such as the age of the animals involved. Our study was limited with regards to the quantity ingested; however, this is not unique due to the subject of study being animals.</p>
