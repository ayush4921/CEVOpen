<p id="Par5">The technical goal of this study was to explore the chemical and biological properties of fruit from three invasive plants; 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> Thunb., 
 <italic>Phytolacca americana</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Prunus serotina</italic> Ehrh. These species produce a large amount of fleshy fruits that are rich in secondary metabolites. Moreover, seeds of these plants represent the main tool for plant invasion and therefore, their collection and disposal for bioprospecting aims, could represent a suitable and innovative strategy for containment purposes.
