<p id="Par34">To better evaluate the risk of invasion in the three investigated plants, the viability of 100 seeds of each species was assessed (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Only seeds belonging to ripe fruits were analyzed, because unripe ones had no or contained only undeveloped seeds. The obtained results suggested that 54% of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic>, 56% of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic>, and 72% of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> were viable and therefore potentially active in enhancing the invasiveness of the sampled populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). To estimate the chemical and biological value of these fruits/seeds for human aims, the yield of extraction for each species was also reported. Starting from 100 fruit we obtained a minimum of 0.749 g of dry extract (ripe fruits, hydro-alcoholic extraction) from 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic> to a maximum of 7.069 g of dry extract (unripe fruits, aqueous extraction) from 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic>. Considering the best yield of extraction, the aqueous procedure obtained 7.043 mg of CLORA, 4.277 mg of RUT, and almost 0.400 mg of EGCG in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic>. Based on a rough estimate conducted by exploring the SciFinder database, these extracted chemicals could have a commercial value ranging from € 7.77 with the hydro-alcoholic procedure to € 58.97 with the aqueous one. In the case of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic>, 100 unripe fruits extracted with the hydro-alcoholic solution produced about 8.010 mg of RUT and 2.418 mg of CAT with a total commercial value of € 10.89. Finally, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic> yielded 6.227 mg of CAFA from the hydro-alcoholic extraction of unripe fruits and almost 3 mg of RUT as well as 0.595 of QUERC in the same conditions with a total commercial value of € 13.45. In some cases, ripe fruit also showed a conspicuous economic value (e.g., aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic> and hydro-alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> reached an estimated value of € 56.13 and of € 77.12 respectively). However, antioxidant activity detected by the DPPH assay was higher in unripe conditions than ripe ones.
