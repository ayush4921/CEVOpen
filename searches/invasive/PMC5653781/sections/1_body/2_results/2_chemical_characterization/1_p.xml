<p id="Par29">Given the well-recognized antioxidant activity of polyphenols, the occurrence of the most important classes was spectrophotometrically evaluated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Results showed that aqueous extracts of unripe fruit from 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> had a higher amount of flavonoids compared to the ripe ones (up to 7.41 times) including catechins (not detected in ripe fruits), tannins (up to 5.5 times), and hydroxycinnamic acids (up to 4.1 times). A similar pattern was observed in hydro-alcoholic conditions. Noteworthy, the amount of hydroxycinnamic acids 
 <italic>in P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> reached an average value of 650 mg of ferulic acid equivalents (FA eq.) per g of dry extracts in the aqueous extract from unripe fruits (more than two times the amount of FA eq. in 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>myrtillus</italic>). Also, hydro-alcoholic extracts of unripe 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic> fruits exhibited high amounts of hydroxycinnamic acids (386.68 mg of FA eq. per gram of dry extract). The highest amount of catechins was found in the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>serotina</italic> (average value of 73.69 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of dry extract), whereas no catechins were found in extracts from 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>americana</italic> fruits.
