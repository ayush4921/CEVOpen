<p id="Par37">We are aware that our proposal, if misunderstood, could open the possibility for the spread of invasive plants or even stimulate their deliberate cultivation. At the same time, we underline that the evolutionary history of plants shows that anthropogenic stress and overexploitation (including biopiracy) could result in a reliable containment or extinction of plant populations
