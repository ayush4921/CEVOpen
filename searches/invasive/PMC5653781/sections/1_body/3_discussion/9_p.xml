<p id="Par43">In this study, the chemical composition of the three alien species in their native areas was not assessed; however, a comparative analysis of secondary compounds from the original area vs. those in invaded areas could permit the identification of interesting metabolites for human aims and the evaluation of factors enhancing their presence. This could represent a core aspect of a bioprospecting approach along with the study of metabolic pathways and genes involved in the biosynthesis of high-added value compounds and the role played by the environment
