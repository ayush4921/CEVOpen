 </sup>. Samples were loaded onto a Strata-X column (33 mm polymeric sorbent 60 mg in 3 mL, Phenomenex, Torrence, CA, USA), and polyphenols were eluted by 100% v/v methanol. The eluates were completely dried in a speed vacuum at 45 °C and resuspended in 200 mL of 1:9 acetonitrile/0.2% v/v acetic acid before being directly injected into the HPLC. Polyphenols were analyzed by RP HPLC separation (column Gemini C18, 5 µm particles 250 × 4.60 mm, precolumn SecurityGuard Ea, Phenomenex, Torrence, CA, USA) equipped with an on-line diode array detector (MD-2010, Plus, Jasco Instruments, Großumstad, Germany) analyzing from 220 to 550 nm.
