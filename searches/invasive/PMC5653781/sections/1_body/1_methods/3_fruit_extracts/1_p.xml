<p id="Par16">For each species and for both categories (i.e. ripe and unripe), fruits were further processed using liquid nitrogen and were powdered. A total of 3 g of material was subjected to two different extraction procedures: hydro-alcoholic and aqueous. The hydro-alcoholic procedure was performed by following the method proposed by Amigoni and co-workers

 </sup> without filtering with 0.45 μm PTFE filters and with a modified drug/solvent ratio: 3 g of powder were extracted using 30 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol. The aqueous extraction was performed following the protocol described by Zhu and co-workers
