<p>The presence of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in Europe was reported from gradually more northern locations (see e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]), suggesting a progressive northward spread of the species during the early 20
 <sup>th</sup> century. In such a scenario latitudinal effects on different measures of the distribution of genetic diversity could be expected as the result of successive colonisation events. However, multiple introductions seem to be the norm for invasive species (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) and repeated introductions have been proposed for 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in Finland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. We found little evidence of latitudinal effects on the different measures of genetic diversity and equally strong correlations between the distribution of genetic diversity (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and latitude as longitude. A possible explanation could be that isolation by distance rather than gradual northward colonisation is responsible for the pattern observed in our PCA. However, our comparisons of geographical and genetic distances showed limited support for isolation by distance and implied that at least the traces of isolation by distance detected in the north are driven by the Stockholm population.
