<p>In a newly introduced plant species, genetic differentiation between populations can be expected to be low if mutation, selection and genetic drift have not yet led to diversification of populations. Such lack of genetic structuring has, for example, been found in the invasive range of 
 <italic>Macfadyena unguis-cati</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and 
 <italic>Olea europea</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], both believed to have a single introduction into its invasive range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. At the same time repeated founder events, or introductions from different sources, could cause populations to become genetically differentiated from each other (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]).
