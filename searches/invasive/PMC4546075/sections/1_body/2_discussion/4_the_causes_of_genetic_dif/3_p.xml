<p>Our AMOVA suggested fairly high differentiation among municipalities and to a lesser extent among populations. This could either be the result of limited gene flow, a founder effect or both, though the bottleneck usually associated with a founder event was not strongly supported in our data. F statistics (assuming migration â€“ drift equilibrium) suggested that gene flow may be higher between the Kashmir populations than the European ones. Although higher F
 <sub>ST</sub> values in the invasive range is consistent with some invasive species, invasive plants in general were found not to differ in F
 <sub>ST</sub> values or the distribution of genetic diversity as shown by AMOVAs (Additional file

 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, however, contrasted the distribution of genetic variance previously found in Lithuanian plants where a much higher percentage of the genetic diversity was found among populations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] was based on RAPD markers and that the reliability of this type of markers has been questioned [
