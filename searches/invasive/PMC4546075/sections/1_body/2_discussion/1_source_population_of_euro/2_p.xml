<p>The confident identification of the true source population(s) of any invasive species typically requires a wider and denser sampling of the native range than the one in the present study. Our ABC modelling suggests that the Kashmir populations sampled in this study are not the direct source of the European populations studied. The separation time between the Kashmir 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and either European cluster is at least several hundred years, indicating that the source population(s) of the European 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> most likely separated from the Kashmir populations at least a couple of hundred years before the species was introduced in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Indications of ascertainment bias from the higher presence of null alleles in Kashmir populations further suggest that it is not the source of European 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. A wider sampling of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, preferably from its full native range, will be needed if possible sources for the populations in Europe are to be identified.
