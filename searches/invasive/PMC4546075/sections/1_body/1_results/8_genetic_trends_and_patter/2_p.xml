<p>The species reviewed did not have significantly higher F
 <sub>ST</sub> values in the invasive compared to the native ranges (Additional file

Although small population sizes in newly introduced species could lead to an increase in the amount of inbreeding in a species, there was no significant difference in the inbreeding coefficients of the native and invasive ranges of species reported in the literature to be outbreeding (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, paired Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.651).
