<p>Looking at the regional clusters detected by STRUCTURE, the northern populations showed signs of isolation by distance when genetic similarity between populations was measured as F

 <sub>ST</sub>/(1-R

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.889 and 0.587 respectively), while the southern populations showed signs of isolation by distance when genetic similarity between populations was measured as R

 <sub>ST</sub>) (Mantel test R
 <sub>ST</sub>/[1-R

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.185; for all other comparisons in the northern and southern region
