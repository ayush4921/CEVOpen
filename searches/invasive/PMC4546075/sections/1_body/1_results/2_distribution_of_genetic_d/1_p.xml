<p>After Bonferroni correction, markers deviating from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were found in all populations (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Some pairs of loci showed significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) after Bonferroni correction (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). However, only two of the pairs of loci were in significant LD in more than one of the 13 populations studied.
