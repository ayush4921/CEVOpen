<p>Genetic diversity measures within European, and to a lesser extent Kashmir, populations varied markedly. Within Europe, none of the measures of diversity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were significantly correlated with latitude of origin (for all measures 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1). Instead populations with both comparatively high and low diversity measures could be found both among more northern and southern populations. Trondheim2, one of the northernmost populations, did, however, stand out as having the fewest number of alleles, lowest expected heterozygosity and most highly negative inbreeding coefficient of all populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
