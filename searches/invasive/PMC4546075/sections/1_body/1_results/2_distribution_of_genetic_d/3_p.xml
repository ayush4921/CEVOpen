<p>Both the average within-population genetic diversity (Europe: 0.210, Kashmir: 0.629) and the total genetic diversity (Europe: 0.351, Kashmir: 0.779) were lower in Europe than in Kashmir (Additional file

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The number of alleles (Table

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in Kashmir populations (total number of alleles 81, mean per population and locus 6.2) than in European (total number of alleles 44, mean per population and locus 1.9) as were the number of private alleles (Kashmir populations mean 6.19, European populations mean 1.92; Wilcoxon rank sum test p &lt; 0.05). The inbreeding coefficient was significantly higher in Kashmir than in Europe (
 <italic>t</italic>-test p &lt; 0.05) and two of the Kashmir populations (1 and 3), but none of the European populations, had significant inbreeding coefficients when calculated across all loci (Table
