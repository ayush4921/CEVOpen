<p>Plant tissue was dried overnight at 45 °C, after which total DNA was extracted using the E-Z 96 Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek Inc., Norcross, GA, USA), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Eleven already published microsatellite loci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] were used for PCR amplification. Multiplex PCR was performed with the Qiagen® Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) using a 17.5 μl reaction with 1 x Qiagen Mastermix and 0.1 – 0.4 M of each primer. PCR was carried out with an initial 15 min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 90 s and 72 °C for 60 s with a final elongation for 10 min at 72 °C. Microsatellite lengths were determined by running the PCR products on a Genetic Analyzer 3130xl (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), and the resulting data were analysed with Geneious v 6.1.8 (BiomatesLtd, Auckland, New Zealand).
