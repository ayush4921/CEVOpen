<p>In addition to literature reviewed in Bossdorf et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Dlugosch and Parker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Google Scholar was in May 2014 queried using “plant” together with “invasive”, “alien” or “exotic”. From the resulting studies from all publication years those reporting genetic diversity measures of invasive species both in their native and invasive ranges were chosen and the diversity of the two ranges was compared.
