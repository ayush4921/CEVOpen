<p>Populations of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (2n = 18, 20) with at least 30 flowering individuals were sampled in 2011 from six municipalities, the local area around a town or city, along a 1600 km latitudinal gradient in Western Europe. Populations were also sampled from Kashmir, India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the part of the native range suggested to be the source of the plants originally introduced into Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The populations ranged in size from less than 100 individuals to more than 1000 and were located both nearby and away from waterways. In each municipality, one to three populations were sampled (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with a minimum distance of 1.8 km between each population. The maximum distance between the Kashmir populations was 6.4 km. From each population leaf material from 30 randomly sampled individuals was collected and stored in tubes containing silica gel until used for analysis. Sampling was done according to national legislations and samples were destroyed upon molecular analysis. A map showing the location of the sampled populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was drawn using Ocean Data View version 4.7.2 [
