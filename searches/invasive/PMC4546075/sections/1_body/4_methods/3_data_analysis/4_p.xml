<p>Geographic structure was further explored using R v 3.0.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] to carry out DAPC analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], using the 
 <italic>Adegenet</italic> package, and PCA. The number of copies present in an individual (0, 1 or 2) for each allele at each locus was treated as independent variables in the PCA. In addition, R was used to test for correlations between latitude and genetic diversity and the two main principal components in PCA respectively as well as between geographic distance and pairwise F
 <sub>ST</sub>, R
 <sub>ST</sub>, number of alleles and genetic distance respectively, using Pearson’s product–moment correlation. R was also used to carry out t-tests, or alternatively the Wilcoxon rank sum test if the underlying assumptions of parametric tests were not met.
