<p>The expected heterozygosity under HWE (h) was calculated with a purpose-written Perl script (available upon request). GenePop [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] was used to test for deviations from HWE. FreeNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was used to test for the presence of null alleles and for obtaining estimates of F
 <sub>ST</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] and D
 <sub>CH</sub>, the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards genetic distance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Adjusting genetic diversity, F
 <sub>ST</sub> and D
 <sub>CH</sub> for the presence of null alleles did not affect the conclusions drawn and these measures are therefore not reported. D
 <sub>S</sub> (Nei’s genetic distance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]) and R
 <sub>ST</sub>, an equivalent of F
 <sub>ST</sub> using a stepwise mutation model, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] were calculated using Spagedi v 1.4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and differences between R
 <sub>ST</sub> and F
 <sub>ST</sub> were tested using the permutation test implemented in the software. D
 <sub>CH</sub> and D
 <sub>S</sub> were highly correlated (r = 0.949, Pearson’s product–moment correlation, p &lt; &lt; 0.001) and only the former is reported.
