 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="entropy-21-00571-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the combined map of climatic suitability (heat map) of 14 IAPS under current climate and RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. The projected map under current climate shows a region of potential IAPS concentration in the south and west parts of Sri Lanka (particularly in Colombo and Kalutara districts). In the future, this area is projected to become slightly less suitable for diverse IAPS. Under RCP 4.5, the very high suitability class (7–8 IAPS) is projected to have an overall decrease in the climatic suitability by 2050 and then increase by 2070, resulting in a 63% overall contraction of the suitable area relevant to current climate; while under RCP 8.5 the suitable area is projected to decrease continuously resulting in a 90% overall contraction (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-entropy-21-00571">Supplementary material S5</xref>). Under RCP 4.5, the high suitability class (5–6 IAPS) is projected to decrease by 2050 and then increase by 2070 resulting in an overall 3% contraction of the suitable area compared to the current climate; while under RCP 8.5, this suitable area is projected to increase by 2050 and then decrease by 2070 resulting in an overall 38% contraction. The moderate suitability class (3–4 IAPS) is projected to increase substantially by 127% under RCP 4.5 and by 280% under RCP 8.5 by 2070 relative to the current climate. The projected area expansions in this class are significantly high by 2050 under both scenarios. The low suitability class (1–2 IAPS) is projected to increase by 2050 compared to the current climate and then decrease by 2070 under both RCPs, resulting in an overall 37% area expansion and 16% area contraction by 2070 compared to current climate under RCPs 4.5 and RCP 8.5 respectively. Generally, the very low suitability class (area free from IAPS) is projected to contract significantly by 2070, resulting in 69% and 86% overall contraction compared to the current climate under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 respectively.
