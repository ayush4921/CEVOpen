<p>The challenges posed by invasive alien plant species (IAPS) on biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services, particularly in island countries, is increasing and well recognized [
 <xref rid="B11-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This issue continues to be a challenge and increasingly important regardless of rigorous control and management efforts. Species invasion has been facilitated by the rapid growth of trade and transportation between countries, especially after the industrial revolution [
 <xref rid="B12-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The natural barriers (i.e., mountains, rivers) that provided isolation required for unique species to evolve is no longer effective [
 <xref rid="B7-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Understanding the current and potential distribution patterns is fundamental for managing IAPS [

 <xref rid="B15-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Species distribution models (SDMs), which are based on ecological assumptions and theories, investigate how species shift their ecological niche spatially and temporally under climate change [

 <xref rid="B17-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,

 <xref rid="B19-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hutchinson defined the niche as n-dimensional hyper-volume within which a species can survive and reproduce; in the absence of biotic interactions this volume is equal to the species’ fundamental niche [
 <xref rid="B16-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, under given circumstances, a species will usually only occupy a certain part of the fundamental niche, which is called the realized niche [
 <xref rid="B20-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, theoretically, SDMs estimate a species’ potential distribution rather than the actual distribution. When the species niche is projected to a geographical space, it yields a predictive map of species’ presence [

 <xref rid="B22-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. But there is a clear uncertainty associated with the changing climate which could be due to several reasons, such as the assumptions underlying SDMs or uncertainty associated with general circulation models (GCMs), modeling algorithms, spatial scales and the data used [
