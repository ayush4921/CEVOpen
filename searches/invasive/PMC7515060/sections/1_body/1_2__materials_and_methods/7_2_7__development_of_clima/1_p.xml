<p>Thus, the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity logistic threshold of MaxEnt was used with the average model output to develop binary presence-absence maps for each species. The ‘reclassify’ tool of the ArcMap was used to develop presence-absence maps with suitable areas above the threshold and not suitable areas below. The suitable area prediction of each species was individually examined and assessed with the ecology of the species for verification. The range size of each species was calculated using the field calculator by multiplying the number of cells of presence by the cell size. All classified 14 layers were summed up to develop a combined raster using the raster calculator tool of the spatial analyst toolbox. The combined raster layer (climatic ‘heat map’ combining climatic suitability of 14 IAPS) was further classified into five classes in ArcMap (manual classification). The maximum number of layers that overlapped at any one place was 8; thus, we set five classes as: very low (0 IAPS), low (1–2 IAPS), moderate (3–4 IAPS) high (5–6 IAPS) and very high (7–8 IAPS). The very high class consisted of the highest (7–8) number of IAPS overlapped while the very low category is predicted as free from IAPS. The same exercise was carried out with the average model result of individual species for future climate, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. The five classes used for classifying the combined raster of current climate were used for classifying the combined rasters in the future climate as well. Therefore, we developed 5 maps combining climatic suitability of 14 IAPS under current and future climate. </p>
