<p>We used MaxEnt or the Maximum entropy species distribution modeling [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which is one of the most popular [
 <xref rid="B38-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and globally accepted correlative modeling technique currently in use for predicting the potential distribution of species [
 <xref rid="B44-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. MaxEnt predicts potential areas of suitability of species better than many other well-established species distribution methods using presence-only occurrence data, environmental variables and background records across the defined geographic area [
 <xref rid="B46-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. MaxEnt is underpinned on the maximum entropy (i.e., meaning most spread out or closest to uniform distribution) principle [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While running the model, MaxEnt estimates the probability distribution of maximum entropy of environmental variables across the entire study area which is represented by a number of grid cells [
 <xref rid="B44-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the species niche is defined relevant to these variables or features. MaxEnt has been used in many applications in conservation science today, particularly on invasive species [
 <xref rid="B48-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. For instance, MaxEnt has been widely used to model the ecological niches of invasive species to predict areas where an invasive species could potentially occur in the future [
 <xref rid="B49-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The focus of these studies is to examine the potential distribution of selected species to classify areas for future strategic management. Other popular applications of MaxEnt are reserve planning, identify critical habitats for threatened and endangered species, ecological risk assessment, species translocation, climate change impacts [

 <xref rid="B51-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
