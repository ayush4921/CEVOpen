<p>We used MaxEnt version 3.4.1 [
 <xref rid="B73-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] (
 <uri xlink:href="http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/</uri>) for the current modeling study. Selection of MaxEnt approach was based on several well-known reasons (i) MaxEnt is relatively more robust over the other methods for small sample sizes [
 <xref rid="B51-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]; (ii) MaxEnt is resistant to spatial errors in occurrence data up to a certain extent [
 <xref rid="B51-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and performs well with occurrences that show sampling bias [
 <xref rid="B77-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]; (iii) MaxEnt is more popular for predicting potential ranges of invasive plants [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and previously used for defining invasive plant hotspots [
 <xref rid="B63-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]; (vi) generally, simple models are more applicable for modeling IAPS and MaxEnt settings can be changed to make the model smoother (i.e., feature types) [
 <xref rid="B78-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and (vii) MaxEnt generates a continuous output, facilitating distinct binary predictions which is imperative in IAPS modeling [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Logistic output, which is depicted by a linear scale of values ranging from 0 to 1, was selected for easy interpretation of results [
 <xref rid="B35-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Background records (10,000) were used across the country as several species are used and the distribution of them in the landscape is not correctly known [
 <xref rid="B55-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Cross-validation was employed with 10 replicates as we had relatively smaller sample sizes for some species. This enables MaxEnt to use all data efficiently in model fitting and to receive a more realistic average output. Concurrently, it helps to evaluate the model uncertainty [
 <xref rid="B55-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, we understand that lack of validation of the independent dataset can cause biased predictions generated by unknown overfitting [
 <xref rid="B79-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. We also used 1000 maximum iterations in our models, enabling the algorithm to get close to convergence for a realistic prediction [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Linear, quadratic and hinge features were used since sample sizes were relatively low. All other default values of user-specified parameters of MaxEnt relating to model construction were used as species-specific model tuning is difficult in multiple species modeling [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Models were run individually for 14 IAPS and the average fitted models were projected to the future climate scenarios. The niche distribution of each individual species was examined in ArcMap (version 10.4.1) for further analysis.
