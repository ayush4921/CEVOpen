 <caption>
  <p>There were significant differences in (a) total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) belowground and (b) total % nitrogen for shaded plants, but in opposite directions. Unshaded plants had higher concentrations of TNC and lower concentrations of nitrogen than shaded plants. There was also a significant main effect of lime addition on (c) nitrogen, with higher concentrations in plants receiving lime addition. G.E. = glucose equivalents. C.I. = 95% confidence interval.</p>
