<p>There was no significant effect of soil quality (either fertilization or lime) on relative growth rate of eastern redcedars in the first experiment. This, at first glance, seems perplexing because it is known that eastern redcedars grow better in high-nutrient soils [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and they are known to be common on limestone substrates [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although the eastern redcedar is reputed to be able to tolerate a wide range of soil types, it has been widely observed that there are noticeable differences in their phenotypes on different soils [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. High abundance of nutrients such as nitrogen may also be important for niche expansion of eastern redcedar, especially in old fields that were usually fertilized [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Furthermore, a combination of shade and nitrogen fertilization may facilitate tree invasions of grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Possible reasons for the absence of an effect of nitrogen fertilization is that either there was sufficient nitrogen supplied by the potting soil, and/or that additional nitrogen would not further benefit growth (i.e., following Liebig’s law, there was another nutrient that was limiting [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]). However, several studies indicate that there is co-limitation of nutrients and not just nitrogen [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The purported preference for limestone substrates may reflect the fact that growing on cedar barrens may be related to the relative absence of interspecific competition there [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, I found no effect of competition with post oaks, a common co-dominant [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], with the exception of a shade X lime X competition effect on belowground biomass of eastern redcedars. Experiments are currently underway to test whether eastern redcedars and post oaks, as well as grasses, are partitioning access to the water resource (Hamati et al., in prep.).
