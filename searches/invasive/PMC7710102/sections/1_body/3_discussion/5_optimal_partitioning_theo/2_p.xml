<p>There was a significant effect of shade on the concentration of nitrogen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242003.g003">Fig 3</xref>), with a decrease in nitrogen concentration in unshaded plants. I did not find a significant effect of nitrogen fertilization on eastern redcedars in the first experiment. Nitrogen fertilization was found to have resulted in 
 <italic>higher</italic> nitrogen content of mature needles of a conifer 
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Nitrogen fertilization also increased the proportion of nitrogen in the needles that was translocated to the new flush in this species [
