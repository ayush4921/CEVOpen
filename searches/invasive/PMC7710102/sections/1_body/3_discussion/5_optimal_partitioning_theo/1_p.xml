<p>Unshaded plants had significantly higher concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) and lower concentrations of nitrogen than shaded plants (

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Furthermore, light availability in the understory is frequently close to the whole plantâ€™s light compensation point, resulting in large potential consequences for seedling carbon balance [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Thus, the results indicating storage of non-structural carbohydrates reported on from the current study are consistent with those reported elsewhere. Another study found no relationship between aboveground productivity and carbon storage in 18 native and 21 non-native species from light-limited deciduous forest understories of Eastern North America in a common garden [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Contrastingly, in the current study, there was a significant difference in TNC due to shading the eastern redcedars, which were smaller in the shade treatment, although the other factors did not show any significant effects. Furthermore, larger eastern redcedars stored more TNC than small trees regardless of burning treatment. Thus, results are not generalizable to all understory species living in the shade [
