<p>Inconsistent effects of lime addition have been recorded in a meta-analysis of lime studies, perhaps due to differences in inherent preference of the target species for high pH soils [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. I found a significant positive effect of lime on nitrogen concentration in the first experiment, in addition to a significant three-way interaction effect on belowground biomass between shade X lime X competition. My inference from the last-mentioned result is that, if the eastern redcedars are enduring competition from post oaks in shade, then lime is likely to have a negative effect. A similar effect of lime application on nitrogen concentration has been recorded [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. They ascribed the increase in nitrogen concentration to an increase in the rate of mineralization of N by lime fertilization, due to increased microbial activity in lime-rich soils [
