<p>There were also significant negative effects of fire on growth of eastern redcedars in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242003.g004">Fig 4</xref>). I found a reduction in total nitrogen in burned eastern redcedars compared to unburned trees, which was due to a reduction in nitrogen belowground in burned trees (there was no difference between aboveground treatments). However, I found no difference in non-structural carbohydrates between burned and control trees. Contrastingly, a threefold decrease in total nonstructural carbohydrates (sugars and starches) was found in a resprouting range-expanding woody shrub 
 <italic>Cornus drummondii</italic> after browsing and a prescribed fire in Kansas [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In another study, root starch was found to be a key nutrient that limits resprouting ability after fires in two savanna shrubs, 
 <italic>Miconia albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Clidemia sericea</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. However, root starch reserves were replenished in both species within two years after a burn [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], suggesting that only annual burns would cause a net loss of individuals. In the experiments reported on in the current study, there was a significant correlation between TNC and tree size, with larger trees storing more non-structural carbohydrates than smaller trees, regardless of treatment. This pattern also occurred for nitrogen in burned but not control trees. There was no significant differentiation in soluble sugars or starches with regard to the burning treatment. Thus, only the prediction regarding the negative effect of shading on TNC and elevated N with lime application were substantiated. Thus, optimal partitioning theory can only be considered to be partly supported.
