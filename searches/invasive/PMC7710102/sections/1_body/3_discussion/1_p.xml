<p>The clearest result from this study was that eastern redcedars are shade-intolerant. Shade intolerance has been recorded for eastern redcedars by other authors [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Indeed, there is a light optimum for photosynthesis higher than the maximum photosynthetically active radiation level that they measured (1750 μmol m

However, these measurements were all done in old-field grasslands; whether there are differences in photosynthetic ability between forest and old-field eastern redcedars is not known, although differences in phenotypes have been recorded [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Eastern redcedars can survive beneath a mature forest ([
