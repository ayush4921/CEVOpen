<p>Light attenuation in forests can result in &lt;10% sunlight reaching understory trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is likely that the longer growing season for these evergreen trees allows them to outcompete deciduous trees in the winter despite the lower light intensities [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. I note that, although eastern redcedars are evergreen, they stop growing (even in the greenhouse in Ohio) over mid-winter when the mean low temperatures in January and February in neighboring Chardon are -9.8°C and -9.4°C, respectively.
