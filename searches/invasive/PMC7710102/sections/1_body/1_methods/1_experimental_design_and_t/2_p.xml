<p>In the first experiment, run from May 2016 until August 2018, I manipulated the levels of shade, fertilizer, lime, and competition with the post oak 
 <italic>Quercus stellata</italic> in a greenhouse. I placed one eastern redcedar in each container (for further details, see below). I used Green-Tek
 <sup>®</sup> knitted 80% shade cloth (BFG Supply, Burton, Ohio) and a control (unshaded). I checked the shading effect using an AccuPAR model LP-80 ceptometer (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, Washington) in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the 400–700 nanometer waveband during biweekly measurements over the study period (32 measurements during each period). I confirmed that there was a highly significant reduction in the effect of sunlight caused by the shade cloth (78.7% ± 0.53 reduction; minimum = 73% reduction; maximum = 84% reduction).
