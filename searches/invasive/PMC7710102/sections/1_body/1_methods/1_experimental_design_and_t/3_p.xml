 <sup>-2</sup> twice per year [

 <sup>-2</sup> twice per year). The lower level of fertilization was used to minimize potential volatilization in case there was insufficient supply from the potting soil (Scott’s
 <sup>®</sup> Hyponex Potting Soil). I also raised the level of alkalinity in the soil by adding lime to half the containers to simulate the commonly seen association of eastern redcedars with limestone habitats and a control. At the end of the experiment, there was a significant difference in soil pH of the lime treatment (mean pH = 5.7 ± 0.26) and controls (mean pH = 5.4 ± 0.35) (t = 5.498, p &lt; 0.001). I also introduced competition with a common tree, the post oak 
 <italic>Quercus stellata</italic>, in half the containers (one post oak per container), with the remainder being controls (no post oaks). My rationale was that it may not be lime (i.e., high pH 
 <italic>per se</italic>) that causes eastern redcedars to be so abundant on cedar barrens but rather because there are relatively few competitors, particularly trees [

Mean initial heights of post oaks were 195.6 ± 7.75 mm, and mean initial stem diameters were 4.6 ± 0.11 mm.
