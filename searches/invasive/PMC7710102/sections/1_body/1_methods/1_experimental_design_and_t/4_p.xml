<p>I used 95 L containers (n = 120) (depth = 70 cm; 55 cm diameter) so that the trees would not be constrained by soil availability. I used a split-plot experimental design, with shade (and control) the 
 <italic>whole</italic> plot (replicated six times) and the 
 <italic>sub-plots</italic> completely randomized and consisting of the remaining factors (nutrients, lime, and competition). Water availability was not manipulated and was provided 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> by means of drip irrigation.
