<p>For the first experiment, I performed a general linear model for repeated measures for a split-plot design. The design was unbalanced and, consequently, a Type III model was employed. I first performed a MANOVA because of the large number of dependent variables. The dependent variables were mean relative growth rate (RGR) after one year (height and stem diameter; starting with initial height and stem diameter), and final mass (measured as total, aboveground and belowground), belowground total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) and total nitrogen. The independent variables were shade (whole plot), nutrients, lime, and competition (all sub-plots). All variables were log
 <sub>10</sub> transformed to fulfill the requirements of normality and homogeneity of variance.
