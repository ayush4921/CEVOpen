<p>Native species are capable of spreading rapidly into new habitats and niches, and act similarly to invasive species, usually in response to a disturbance of that habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, invasive species were far more likely than native species to respond to disturbances [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the impacts of range expansion by native species are usually of a much lower magnitude than those of invasive plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, some authors consider there to be little difference between invasive species and native invasive (range-expanding) species in terms of their effects on the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There clearly are negative effects of range-expanding native species on features of the environment, including alterations and reductions in diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], diminished light reaching the understory [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], alterations in stream discharge and runoff patterns [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], altered soil nitrogen and carbon dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and reductions in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity [
