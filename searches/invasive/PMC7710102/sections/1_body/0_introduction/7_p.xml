<p>Experiment 1: I manipulated the presence of shade, fertilizer, lime, and interspecific competition with a common co-dominant tree, the post oak 
 <italic>Quercus stellata</italic>. I predicted that shade would have a significant negative effect on their growth, fertilization and lime addition would cause an increase in growth, and interspecific competition would lead to a decline in growth. Plants growing in shade should invest more in aboveground biomass, nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates than unshaded plants [
