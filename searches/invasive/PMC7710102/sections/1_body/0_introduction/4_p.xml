<p>Despite the considerable concern over the range- and niche-expansion of eastern redcedars, the mechanisms behind its increases in abundance are poorly understood. While there have been many studies examining the consequences of heavy grazing and fire suppression on its range expansion, none have simultaneously examined the effects of factors such as shade, nutrient availability, competition, fire, and tree and grass competition. Furthermore, in many areas of the U.S. MidWest, eastern redcedar is particularly abundant in high-pH limestone glades, often termed ‘cedar barrens’ or ‘cedar glades’ ([

Also, eastern redcedars growing on limestone can be quite short as adults (2–4 m) while on deep, moist, well-drained alluvial sites they can often reach 16.5–18 m at 50 years of age, indicating that they grow better on high-nutrient soils [
