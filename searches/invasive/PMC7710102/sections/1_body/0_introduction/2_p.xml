<p>A particularly problematic range-expanding species is the eastern redcedar 
 <italic>Juniperus virginiana</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This species is the most widespread conifer in eastern North America, and is rapidly expanding both its niche [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Encroachment of the eastern redcedar on the Great Plains of the United States may have exceeded the threshold of control back to natural prairie grassland [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There has been about an 80% increase in the abundance of the eastern redcedar across its range [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Possible causes of change in its niche, and ultimately in its range, include sustained heavy grazing by domestic livestock [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and fire suppression [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], although the last-mentioned population increase may only occur during droughts (i.e., when insufficient water is available) [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This species has also expanded its niche through human plantings, for example, as a windbreak around houses or a shelterbelt around crop fields, as landscaping, and as wildlife habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Eastern redcedar abundance is increasing in terms of area occupied, number of locations, and tree size [
