<p>Partitioning of nitrogen and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) above- and belowground may determine whether there was resource re-allocation that was consistent with optimal partitioning theory (OPT) [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. OPT predicts that plants should allocate biomass to those parts or organs that most limit growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Thus, plants living in shaded habitats should invest more in leaf surface area than plants living in open habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and plants living in low-nutrient soils should invest heavily in roots [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, the generality of OPT has been questioned by several authors [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. For example, under high- and low-light conditions, variation in life-history traits (e.g., deciduous vs. evergreen) explained more of the variation in factors such as specific leaf area, specific root length and relative growth rate than could be explained by OPT [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Furthermore, much of the variation claimed to be explained by OPT may be driven by ontogenetic differences in plant size [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. I was particularly interested in ascertaining the effects of resource-allocation changes appropriate to the effects of shade, nutrient fertilization, fire and competition, such as increased investment in aboveground biomass in the shade and re-allocation of storage (particularly non-structural carbohydrates) to the roots in the case of low-nutrient soils and greater allocation of nitrogen to the aboveground parts of the plant when fertilized with nitrogen [
