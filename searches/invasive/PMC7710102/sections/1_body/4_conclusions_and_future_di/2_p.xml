<p>There may also be an interaction between nutrient availability and fire [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; some of the oldest eastern redcedar trees (in excess of 500 years old) can be quite short (1.7–2.0 m) where they occur on low-nutrient soils in rocky areas where fires are rare, such as on the infertile soils of the Niotaze-Darnell complex on the steep cliffs in the Cross Timbers of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. In the Great Plains states of the U.S., the abundance of eastern redcedar in grasslands may be related to both heavy grazing and fire suppression [

 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. An important factor that may interact with the effects of fire and grazing may be the 
 <italic>timing</italic> of fire, that was not tested in this experiment. When fires occur at the beginning of the wet season (i.e., before tree seeds are produced), then fire creates space in the grass sward for the tree seeds to germinate 
 <italic>en masse</italic>, resulting in range expansion of woody plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, if fires occur at the end of the wet season, those young tree seedlings that have managed to recruit during the wet season will be killed by the fire, and little or no range expansion will occur. These conclusions are consistent with those of Twidwell et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] who found that fire interacted with drought in reducing the abundance of the eastern redcedar on the Great Plains. Future studies could manipulate root non-structural carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="pone.0242003.ref157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] to test the effects of storage on responses to grazing and fire.
