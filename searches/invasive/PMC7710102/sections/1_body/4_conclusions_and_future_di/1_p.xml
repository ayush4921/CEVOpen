<p>I conclude that shade has a far greater effect than fire in controlling the growth of eastern redcedars. Furthermore, the effects of fertilizer and lime additions were small, although the sustained long-term benefits for an eastern redcedar tree to be in a high-nutrient site or high lime sites are probably considerable. Interestingly, there were few effects of interspecific competition with a common co-dominant, the post oak, indicating that neither a preference for lime substrates nor avoidance of competition could explain their use of cedar barrens [
