<p>I found no significant effect of shade with regard to RGR for post-oak height (F = 1.619, p = 0.215) but there was a significant effect with regard to post-oak stem diameter (F = 22.373, p &lt; 0.001), with the shade trees (6.4 ± 0.20 mm) having a smaller stem diameter than the controls (8.1 ± 0.47 mm). There were no significant main or interaction effects of fertilizer or lime on RGR for oak height and stem diameter (p &gt; 0.05).</p>
