<p>The univariate ANOVA showed that were neither significant differences in tree height (F = 1.038, p = 0.313) nor trunk diameter (F = 1.465, p = 0.231) between burned and unburned treatments one month after initiation of the experiment. There were significant effects for total biomass (F = 5.239, p = 0.026) and aboveground biomass (F = 6.388, p = 0.014), with the burned trees weighing less than the control (unburned) trees. However, there was no significant difference in belowground biomass between control and burned trees (F = 2.242, p = 0.140). There was a significant main effect for burning on tree condition (F = 5.328, p = 0.025) (

All of the burned eastern redcedar trees were in relatively good condition one month after burning (mean condition ± S.E. = 3.43 ± 0.358) but their condition was not as good as the unburned control trees (mean condition ± S.E. = 5.07 ± 0.571).
