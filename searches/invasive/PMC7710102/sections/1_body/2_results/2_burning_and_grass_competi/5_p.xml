<p>Although there were no significant differences in TNC between burned and control trees (above-, belowground, and total biomass), larger trees stored more TNC than smaller trees, regardless of treatment. There was a positive correlation between TNC and log
 <sub>10</sub> total biomass (burned trees: r = 0.59, F = 14.949, p &lt; 0.001; control trees: r = 0.39, F = 5.091, p = 0. 033). Similarly, there was a positive correlation between % nitrogen belowground and log
 <sub>10</sub> total biomass for burned trees (r = 0.49, F = 8.629, p = 0.007) but there was no significant relationship for control (unburned) trees (r = 0.1, F = 0.409, p = 0.528).
