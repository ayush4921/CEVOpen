<p>I recorded multiple dependent variables (tree height, trunk diameter, total biomass, aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, tree condition, nitrogen, and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC)). Consequently, I used a MANOVA to control for Type I statistical error. There was a significant effect of burning in the MANOVA (Wilks’ λ = 0.580, p = 0.008). However, there were no significant effects of grass competition (Wilks’ λ = 0.706, p = 0.138), nor significant interaction effects between burning and grass competition (Wilks’ λ = 0.678, p = 0.082).</p>
