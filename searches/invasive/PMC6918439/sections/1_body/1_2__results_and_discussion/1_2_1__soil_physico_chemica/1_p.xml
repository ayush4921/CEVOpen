<p>The soil analysis revealed significant variations between the coastal and inland habitat (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Soil texture showed a significant difference between the coastal and inland habitat (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008), where coastal soil is sandy, while the inland soil has a high content of clay. Moreover, the coastal soil attained high content of salt (electrical conductivity, EC = 1.68 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared to the inland soil (EC = 0.57 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). In addition, a significant difference was observed for organic carbon content, total dissolved phosphorus, and total nitrogen (
