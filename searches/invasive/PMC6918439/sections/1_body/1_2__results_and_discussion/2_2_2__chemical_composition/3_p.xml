<p>The EOs of the two samples, coastal and inland, were characterized by the preponderance of the sesquiterpenes (81.67% and 79.28%, respectively). These compounds were identified and categorized as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (10.31% and 12.67%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (71.36% and 66.51%). From the above result, the oxygenated sesquiterpenes represented the main ingredients of the two samples but the coastal sample was higher than the inland one. At the same time, the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in the inland sample were higher than the coastal one. This small difference between the two samples in all constituents, especially sesquiterpenes as a major class, may exhibit the effects of environmental factors of each plant sample. Similar observations were reported in previous studies [
