<p>Finally, one benzopyrane compound namely, dihydroedulan II, was identified in EOs of the two plant samples, coastal (0.66%) and inland (0.32%). While the phenolic compound, 2-tetra-butyl-4-isopropyl-5-methylphenol, with a concentration of 0.55% was characterized in EO of the inland sample of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic>. All these mentioned data exhibited that the inland sample of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> is more diverse in the EO components than the coastal one, where this observation could be attributed to the effect of habitat. 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> is reported to bloom well in salty soils in salt marshes, sandy beaches, and disturbed coastal sites [
