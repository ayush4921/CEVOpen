<p>The two EO samples were analyzed via GC/MS. The chromatograms exhibiting the main compounds of overall identified compounds in coastal and inland samples are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00482-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Moreover, all the identified compounds, representing 100% of the total mass of the EOs, are listed in detail, as shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Fifty-six compounds were characterized overall from the two samples, including 25 compounds from coastal while 52 from inland were identified. The results of the chemical characterization of the EOs of the two samples showed that the two EOs comprise monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, hydrocarbons, in addition to other compounds.
