<p>From the all identified sesquiterpenoids, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (50.39% and 35.82%), (-)-caryophyllene oxide (6.41% and 7.86%), humulene oxide, farnesyl acetone (0% and 7.17%), (5.01% and 4.02%), farnesyl acetone C (5.21% and 0.99%), and nerolidol epoxy acetate (3.0% and 1.64%) represented the major compounds. Hexahydrofarnesyl acetone was the main component of EOs of the two samples but it is observed that its concentration in the EO of coastal sample is higher than the inland one by around 15%. This result is in complete agreement with previously reported EO of Nigerian plant, 
 <italic>Heliotropium indicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, farnesyl acetone C represented a major compound in the coastal sample, while it is a minor in the inland one. In oppositely, farnesyl acetone was a major compound in the inland sample but completely disappeared in the coastal one.
