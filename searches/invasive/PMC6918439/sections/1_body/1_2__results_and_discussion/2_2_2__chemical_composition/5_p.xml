<p>Monoterpenes represented a considerable class of identified compounds in the two samples, but the inland one (7.21%) is richer than the coastal (3.99%). The oxygenated monoterpenes represented the major identified compound with a concentration of 6.49% in the inland sample compared to 3.2% for the coastal one. The two oxygenated monoterpenes, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-ionone (2.05%), and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-ionone (2.21%) were identified as major compounds in the inland sample only while 
 <italic>trans</italic>-p-menthan-7-ol (2.34% and 1.81%) was characterized in both samples. Only two monoterpene hydrocarbons, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (0.4%), and 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene (0.32%) represented the overall compounds identified in the inland sample, while 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (0.79%) is the only one in the coastal one.
