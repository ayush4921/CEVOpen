<p>Two samples of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> from two different habitats, coastal and inland, were subjected to hydro-distillation using the Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h and afforded two yellow oils samples with volumes of 0.026 and 0.021 mL, respectively. This variation in the quantity of the EOs between the coastal and inland samples could be ascribed to the effect of the habitat, particularly the salinity effect (
