<p>The hydrocarbons represented the second major class of compounds in coastal and inland plant samples with concentrations of 10.78% and 10.97%, respectively. The majority of the hydrocarbons were documented in the EOs of several plants around the world and herein from some 
 <italic>Heliotropium</italic> species such as 
 <italic>H. indicum</italic> [

 <italic>H. europaeum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Non-oxygenated hydrocarbons were characterized as major compounds of overall hydrocarbons with concentrations of 9.71% and 8.35% in addition to minor oxygenated hydrocarbons with concentrations of 1.07% and 2.62%.
