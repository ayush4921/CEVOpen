<p>The results exhibited that the inland sample of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> is richer than the coastal one in polyphenolic constituents. Naringenin with a high concentration in the inland sample was in complete agreement with the fact of high distribution of this compound in different species of this genus such as 
 <italic>H. subulatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], 
 <italic>H. sclerocarpum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and 
 <italic>H. taltalense</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For the phenolic acids and their derivatives, some reported stated the isolation of some derivatives such as filifolinol, filifolinylsenecionate, filifolinone, and filifolinoic acid, etc. [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All these reports described that the plants belonging to this genus are very rich with phenolic acids and their derivatives. Herein, the HPLC phenolic characterization of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> was totally coordinated with this fact by the high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially chlorogenic acid, vanillin, caffeic acid, and propyl gallate.
