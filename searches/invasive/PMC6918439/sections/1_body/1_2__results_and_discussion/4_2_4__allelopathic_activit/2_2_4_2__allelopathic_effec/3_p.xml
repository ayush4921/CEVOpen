 <italic>Chenopodium murale</italic> is reported as a nuisance weed that competes with various crops such as rice [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], barley [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], wheat [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and chickpea [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It is worth mentioning here that the synthetic herbicides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4, 5-T), and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) were reported to inhibit the seed germination of 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> by 97.06%, 61.76%, and 50.59%, respectively, at a concentration of 1000 ppm [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In this context, the present results revealed that the EO and the MeOH extract from 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> showed lower activity (2- to 3-fold) compared to synthetic herbicides. However, EO and MeOH extracts are still considered as a promising resource, and eco-friendly bioherbicide against weeds such as 
 <italic>C. murale</italic>.
