<p>The MeOH extracts from the coastal and inland revealed significant allelopathic activity against the weed, 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> in a concentration-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00482-f004">Figure 4</xref>). At the high concentration of the coastal sample extract (1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), the germination, root, and shoot growth of 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> were reduced by 32.5%, 81.57%, and 77.24%, respectively, compared to control. While the inland samples revealed inhibition of 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> by 27.5%, 77.42%, and 71.14%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00482-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the coastal samples for germination, root, and shoot growth were 1.37, 0.40, and 0.41 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. While the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the inland sample were 1.62, 0.54, and 0.50 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Although no significant variation was observed between the coastal and inland samples (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1362), the growth of root and shoot revealed significant variation (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0207 and 0.0002, respectively). These variations could be attributed to the habitat effects. Additionally, the allelopathic activity of the coastal sample may be due to the high content of chlorogenic and gallic acids (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Phenolic acids are considered as the most common and effective allelochemicals in the ecosystem [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Phenolics diffuse into the environment and inhibit germination and growth when absorbed by plants [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The allelopathic effect of 
 <italic>Delonix regia</italic> has been referred to a set of allelochemicals including chlorogenic and gallic acids [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, chlorogenic acid was identified as allelochemical compounds in 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>, 
 <italic>Chenopodium album</italic>, and 
 <italic>Xanthium strumarium</italic> [
