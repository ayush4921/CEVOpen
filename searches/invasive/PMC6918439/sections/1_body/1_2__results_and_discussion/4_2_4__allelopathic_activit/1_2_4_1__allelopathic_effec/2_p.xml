<p>Significant variations between the EOs of the coastal and inland samples were observed for germination, root, and shoot growth (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively). The coastal sample of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> EO showed more allelopathic effect on the 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> compared to the inland samples, which could be ascribed to the variation in the quality and quantity of the chemical compounds of the EO (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The variation in the chemical composition of the EOs from coastal and inland samples could be ascribed to the variation in the habitat (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), particularly the soil composition [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. High content of salinity characterizes the soil of coastal areas (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) due to the seepage of the seawater [

 <xref rid="B44-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, the EO content was increased by 16.11% under the treatment by 100 mM NaCl [
