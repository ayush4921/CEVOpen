<p>The EOs of the two samples (coastal and inland) from 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> aerial parts showed a significant allelopathic inhibitory effect on the germination and seedling growth of the weed

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00482-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The inhibitions of both germination and seedling growth were significantly dose dependent. At the highest concentration (1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), the germination was inhibited by 20.00% and 32.5% for inland and coastal samples, respectively. Moreover, the root growth of the seedling was reduced by 78.11% and 79.62%, while the shoot was reduced by 62.55% and 72.26%, for inland and coastal samples, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the EO from the inland sample was 2.66, 0.59, and 0.70 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for germination, root, and shoot growth, respectively, while the coastal samples attained the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.58, 0.45, and 0.66 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. It is clear that root was affected more than the shoot, where this sensitivity of roots could be attributed to the direct contact between roots and the allelochemicals or due to the permeability of root cells [
