<p>Several documented studies confirmed the role of phenolic compounds as antioxidants such as phenolic acids and flavonoids. Hammad et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] described that the combination of the hydrogen atom and electron transfer is the main antioxidant action pathway. In DPPH assay, the reactions with free OH in the B-ring of flavonoids or aromatic acids are the main discrimination between the phenolic compound and flavonoids [

By more analysis of the correlation of the antioxidant activity and the phenolic compositions, we can find that the inland MeOH extract is less active than the coastal one, although the inland sample is richer with phenolic compounds than the coastal one. According to the previously described mechanism of action of phenolic compounds as antioxidant agents, the results deduced that the concentration of the phenolic compounds and flavonoids, especially with free OH, in the inland MeOH extract is higher than the coastal one. The results exhibited that chlorogenic acid and rutin are the main components of the inland sample with significant concentration, while the non-free phenolic compounds are the main components of the coastal one. Thus, these results were in agreement with the fact of the direct relationship of the antioxidant potentiality and the numbers and concentrations of free OH groups [
