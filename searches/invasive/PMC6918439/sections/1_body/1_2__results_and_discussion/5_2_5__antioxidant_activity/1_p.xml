<p>The 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> EOs of the coastal and inland samples showed a significant scavenging activity of both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) in a concentration-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the EO from the coastal sample was 30.78 and 22.70 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for DPPH and ABTS, respectively, while the inland sample showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 40.40 and 29.92 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. On the other hand, the MeOH extract of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> revealed comparable antioxidant activity to the EO activity (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00482-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), where the coastal and inland MeOH extracts attained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 27.51 and 36.57 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, of DPPH scavenging and 23.12 and 27.41 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of ABTS scavenging.
