<p>From each location (coastal and inland), rhizospheric soil samples from five patches of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> were collected in plastic bags and brought to the laboratory. The collected soil was dried in room temperature at 25 ± 2°C, ground, sieved via 2 mm sieve, and packed until further analysis. Soil texture was determined by sieve method according to Piper [

Soil suspension (1:2.5) was prepared and pH was determined using the pH meter (Model: YK-2001PH, Lutron, Malaysia), while EC was measured by the conductivity meter (Model: CD-4306, Lutron, Malaysia). The total nitrogen of the soil was estimated using the micro-Kjeldahl method [
