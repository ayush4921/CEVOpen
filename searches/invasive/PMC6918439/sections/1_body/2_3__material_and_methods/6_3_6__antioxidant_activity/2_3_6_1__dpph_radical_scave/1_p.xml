<p>The ability of EO and MeOH extracts to reduce the color of the DPPH radical (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) were determined according to Miguel [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Various concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the EOs and residues of the MeOH extract were prepared using methanol. This range of concentrations was determined based on a preliminary test using either higher concentration or lower concentration. To assess the antioxidant activity, a reaction mixture of equal volumes from the freshly prepared 0.3 mM DPPH and each concentration of the EOs or the MeOH extract, was prepared, mixed vigorously, and kept in dark for 15 min at 25 °C. Additionally, a parallel positive control, using ascorbic acid as a standard antioxidant, at concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, were prepared and treated similar to the treatments. After incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer (Milton Roy Spectronic 21D UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, USA). The amount of EO or MeOH extract required to reduce the color of DPPH by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated graphically.
