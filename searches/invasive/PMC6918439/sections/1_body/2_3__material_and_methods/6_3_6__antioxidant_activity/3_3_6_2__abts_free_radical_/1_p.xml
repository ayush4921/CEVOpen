<p>In order to emphasize the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> EOs and MeOH extracts, the capability of scavenging ABTS radical (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was assessed following the method of Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In brief, the radical was prepared by mixing 7 mM of ABTS (1/1, v/v) with 2.45 mM of potassium persulfate and kept in a dark condition at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) for 16 h. ABTS radical was diluted by using methanol to reach the absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. The reaction mixture of 0.2 mL of each concentration of the EO (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 2 mL of the ABTS solution was prepared, mixed vigorously, left for 6 min at room temperature, and then the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Ascorbic acid as natural antioxidant was used as a positive control. The percentage of scavenging and IC50 (the concentration of the EO which scavenge 50% of the ABTS radical) were calculated as previously mentioned in the DPPH assay.
