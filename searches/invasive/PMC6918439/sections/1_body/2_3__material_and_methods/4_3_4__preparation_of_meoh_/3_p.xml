<p>HPLC analysis was performed using an Agilent 1260 series. The separation was carried out using a C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm i.d., 5 μm). The mobile phase contained water (A) and 0.02% trifloroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B) with a flow rate of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The mobile phase was automated successively in a linear gradient as follows: 0 min (80% A), 0–5 min (80% A), 5–8 min (40% A), 8–12 min (50% A), 12–14 min (80% A), and 14–16 min (80% A). The multi-wavelength detector was monitored at 280 nm. The injection volume was 10 μL for each of the sample solutions. The column temperature was maintained at 35 °C.
