<p>The EOs of the fresh aerial parts (150 gm) of the two samples of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> (coastal (0.026 mL) and inland (0.021 mL)) were extracted by hydro-distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h. The oily layer was separated using diethyl ether and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (0.5 g). This extraction was repeated two times and afforded two samples of EO for each plant sample. The extracted EOs of the two samples were stored in sealed air-tight glass vials at 4 Â°C until further analysis.
