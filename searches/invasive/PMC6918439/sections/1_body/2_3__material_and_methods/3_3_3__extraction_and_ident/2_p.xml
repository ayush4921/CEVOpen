<p>The EOs components of the extracted samples were analyzed separately and identified depending upon GC/MS analysis. The GC-MS analysis of the EO samples were carried out using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument at the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Department, National Research Center, Dokki, Giza, Egypt. The instrument had the following specifications: TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific™ Corporate, USA), lined with a Thermo Scientific ISQ™ EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC-MS system was equipped with a TR-5 MS column with a dimension of 30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness. The analyses were achieved using helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with a split ratio of 1:10 using the following temperature program: 60 °C for 1 min; rising at 4.0 °C/min to 240 °C and held for 1 min. Both injector and detector were held at 210 °C. An aliquot of 1 μL of diluted samples in hexane (1:10, v/v) were always injected. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of
