 <xref rid="B20-plants-08-00482" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while recently it was observed to colonize disturbed habitats inside the Nile Delta, Egypt (personal observation). This plant has the ability to shift its reproduction from vegetative to sexual and vice versa, which enables it to colonize multiple habitats [
