<p>The hypotheses of the present work were (a) does the ability of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> to colonize different habitats lead to changes in their bioactive constituents? (b) Are the changes in the bioactive composition with habitat, coupled with changes in their bioactivities? Therefore, the present study aimed to (i) characterize the chemical compound of the EOs from 
 <italic>Heliotropium curassavicum</italic> collected from two heterogeneous habitats, (ii) investigate the HPLC-quantitative and qualitative phenolic profile of the MeOH extracts of the two samples, (iii) determine the antioxidant activity of the EOs and the MeOH extracts, and (iv) evaluate the allelopathic activity of the EOs and the MeOH extracts against the nuisance weed, 
 <italic>Chenopodium murale</italic>.
