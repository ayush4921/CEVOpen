<p>The GC-MS analysis of 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> EOs revealed the presence of 56 compounds (25 for the coastal sample and 52 from the inland one). The major compounds were hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, (-)-caryophyllene oxide, humulene oxide, farnesyl acetone, farnesyl acetone C, nerolidol epoxy acetate. On the other hand, HPLC of the phenolic profile of MeOH extracts of the two samples revealed the predominance of chlorogenic acid, rutin, and propyl gallate are majors in the coastal sample, while vanilin, quercetin, 4â€²,7-dihydroxyisoflavone are majors in the inland one. These variations in the EOs, phenolics, or flavonoids reflect the effect of the habitat as well as adaptability of the plant to different environmental conditions by shifting its chemical composition. The coastal sample of the 
 <italic>H. curassavicum</italic> EO expressed more allelopathic and antioxidant activities than the inland samples, and the MeOH extract was stronger than the EO. These variations could be referred to habitat effects, especially as the coastal habitat is stressful than the inland habitat due to salinity, where the plants cope with harsh conditions via the enhancement of bioactive compound production. The bioactivity of the EO could be ascribed to the major compounds, particularly hexahydrofarnesyl acetone and (-)-caryophyllene oxide, while the bioactivity of the MeOH extract may be ascribed to chlorogenic acid, vanillin, quercetin, and propyl gallate. Although, the allelopathic activity of the EO and MeOH extracts was lower than the common synthetic herbicides, they are still a promising resource for an environmentally friendly bioherbicide for weed control, at least against 
 <italic>C. murale</italic>.
