  <p>Mean proportion spotted lanternfly (SLF) egg masses found sampling distances from vineyard edge, 0 m (at vineyard edge) to 75 m into the vineyard block. A total of 8 vineyards were sampled for SLF egg masses during 2018 and 2019. Bands for each distance represent 95% confidence interval. Different letters denote significant differences between distances at alpha = 0.05.</p>
