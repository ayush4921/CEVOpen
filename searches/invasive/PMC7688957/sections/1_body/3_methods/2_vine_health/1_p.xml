<p id="Par21">In grapevines, the fruit set in a given year is determined in the year prior, when buds are being formed. After overwintering, these buds provide shoots and clusters for the following season. In spring 2019 and 2020, the number of dead shoots, living shoots, and clusters on each shoot were counted on all monitored vines to evaluate the relationship between SLF infestation and bud fruitfulness and survival. Leaf redness in grapevines has been related to reduced translocation and accumulation of sugars within the canopy

 </sup>, which may be linked to phloem feeding by SLF. In the fall of 2019, percent leaf redness was estimated on a scale of 0–100% for all monitored vines. Leaf redness was only observed on red fruiting cultivars (e.g. ‘Pinot Noir’, ‘Chambourcin’). Similarly, crown gall severity at the trunks and cordon were taken for each vine due to the association of crown gall (caused by the bacterium

 </sup>. Severity was ranked on a scale of 0 (no crown gall visible) to 5 (extreme crown gall). For analysis, the severity rankings for both cordon and trunk were combined.
