 </sup>). The proportion of SLF at each distance was determined from the total number of SLF counted in that row. Proportion of SLF at each distance was analyzed using fixed effects of distance and site, and year, week, and row as random nested effects using a binomial distribution. In order to determine the effect of vineyard edges on the proportion of SLF, a ‘distance’ variable was assigned to each sampling point within a vineyard transect to indicate the distance from the edge of the vineyard block. Additional analyses tested the effect of vineyard block size and grape variety as fixed effects. Due to the potential variation of grape variety across the different vineyards, only vineyard blocks that contained both
