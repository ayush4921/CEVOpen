<p id="Par23">Adult SLF (n = 348) were collected from unmanaged forested areas and marked with fluorescent powder (DayGlo Color Corp., Cleveland, OH). SLF were randomly split into groups of 20 and released within vineyard rows featuring variable pre-existing densities of SLF. Prior to the release of the marked SLF adults, densities of SLF in experimental vineyard rows were determined by counting a subset of vines in each row. Marked SLF were placed at the base of vines in each vineyard row. After either 12 or 24 h, vines were examined, and the number of remaining of marked SLF counted. The powder was tested prior to the initiation of the experiment on adult SLF to ensure it would not lead to increased mortality after 48 h of exposure.</p>
