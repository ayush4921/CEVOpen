<p id="Par20">SLF infestations were sampled weekly in vineyards within southeastern Pennsylvania in 2018 and 2019. Six vineyards were used in both 2018 and 2019, plus an additional 2 vineyards were added in 2019. Weekly monitoring for adult SLF began in September in 2018 and August in 2019. In both years, monitoring continued until no more SLF were observed in each vineyard. At least two rows were randomly selected within each vineyard block and the number of SLF were recorded every 15 m along a transect spanning the entire length of the row. The length of each row varied depending on the vineyard (50 m–210 m). At each distance, the total number of SLF on the vine were counted. SLF was monitored on 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> varieties in all vineyards, and a subset of vineyards (n = 4) also included monitoring on hybrid 
 <italic>Vitis</italic> cultivars. Vineyards were actively managed for SLF and other pests with insecticide applications.
