<p id="Par4">Grape production is greatly impacted by SLF infestations. In the Northeast, growers report reduced vine production or complete plant loss with poor SLF control. Numbers of SLF on individual vines can easily exceed 400 adults, with seasonal averages of 7.5 SLF per vine

 </sup> which likely reduces photosynthetic potential and vigor of vines. Damage caused by these insects may significantly alter grape production. In a recent 2020 survey, most grape growers (53%) stated that they would forgo replanting or expanding their production without effective SLF management options (H. Leach, unpublished). The need for effective management strategies is paramount to securing the livelihoods and industries impacted by SLF.
