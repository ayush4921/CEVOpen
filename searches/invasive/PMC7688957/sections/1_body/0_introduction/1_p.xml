 </sup>. Spatial ecology offers unique insights into how organisms organize and utilize habitats across both space and time. Geostatistical and spatial analyses identify predictable invasion patterns of invasive pests, which aid in describing how these species colonize foreign habitats and what landscape attributes contribute to the their success
