 </sup>. Currently, pest management for SLF in grape has relied heavily on repeated insecticide applications. Unsurprisingly, the number of insecticide applications in SLF infested vineyards has increased drastically, with most vineyards increasing applications by 2â€“5 times as compared to pre-SLF infestation

 </sup>. SLF is expected to continue to be a serious threat to many agricultural and ornamental industries. However, the success of SLF management tactics relies on appropriate timing and placement. Therefore, it is critical that research addresses not only effective management options but also the biology underpinning the success of these management tactics.
