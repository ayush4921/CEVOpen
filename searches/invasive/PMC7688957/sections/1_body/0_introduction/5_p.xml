<p id="Par6">Management of SLF could significantly benefit from an improved understanding of the spatial patterns and damage caused by this pest. Scouting and monitoring can be targeted to specific problem areas, and insecticide use tailored to areas where infestations are highest. Despite a number of recent studies examining basic biology, management tactics, and monitoring efforts

 </sup>, no studies have identified the geostatistical or spatial patterns of SLF in grape production. The objectives of this study were to characterize SLF adult and egg distributions across space and time within commercial vineyards in Pennsylvania. Using a combination of weekly monitoring data and grid sampling from 6 to 9 Pennsylvania vineyards, we examined the spatiotemporal relationships of SLF in grape agroecosystems. Mark-recapture of adult SLF was also used to evaluate dispersal behavior based on existing abundance of SLF within vineyards. Further, vine health metrics were measured to determine associations with SLF infestation. We hypothesized that SLF would aggregate around vineyard edges, with greatest densities of SLF adults and egg masses within the perimeter of vineyards. We also predicted that SLF would be negatively associated with vine health.
