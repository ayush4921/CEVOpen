<p id="Par12">Pre-existing SLF populations on vines significantly impacted the percent of SLF recaptured after both 12 and 24 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Vines with greater SLF densities (&gt; 40 SLF/vine) had higher recapture rates than those with lower levels of pre-existing SLF suggesting local retention where more SLF was already present (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.49 at 12 h, adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.66 at 24 h). These results were consistent at both 12 and 24 h (12 h:

 <italic>, p</italic> = 0.01; 24 h:
