<p id="Par11">Distance from the wood edge was a significant factor in total adult abundance (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 16.6, df = 1, p &lt; 0.0001). On average, 2 times more adult SLF were found within the first 15 m of the vineyard edges compared to the interior of the vineyard. Distance from the wood edge also significantly influenced egg mass abundance (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 181.8, df = 1, p &lt; 0.0001). On average, 2.8 times more SLF egg masses were found within the 15 m of the vineyard edges compared to the interior of the vineyard block. SLF across all vineyards were significantly spatially autocorrelated using Moran’s I statistic with the Moran’s index ranging from 0.19 to 0.68 (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). All egg mass distributions were significantly spatially autocorrelated except for one location which was not significant (Vineyard G, indicating spatial randomness). Moran’s index values were generally lower for egg masses, ranging from 0.05 to 0.3. Mapping results from Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) show high predicted values on the outside edge of every vineyard sampled for adults, and low predicted values in the interior of the vineyard (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results are also shown with egg masses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), but to a weaker extent.
