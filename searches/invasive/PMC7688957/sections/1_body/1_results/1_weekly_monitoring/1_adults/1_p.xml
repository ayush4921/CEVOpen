<p id="Par7">SLF adults exhibited strong edge effects in all vineyards sampled (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 237.3, df = 5, p &lt; 0.0001). Approximately, 54% of SLF were found within the first 15 m of the vineyard edge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Proportions of SLF decreased as distance from the vineyard edge increased. Similar patterns were observed throughout the growing season in both sampling years (Supplemental Fig.
