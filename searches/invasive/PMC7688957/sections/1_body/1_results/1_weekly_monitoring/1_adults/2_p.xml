<p id="Par8">At vineyards where both hybrid and 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> vines were monitored (4/8 vineyards), SLF distribution was significantly impacted by the interaction between grape variety and distance from vineyard edge (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 29.1 df = 5, p &lt; 0.0001). Greater proportions of SLF were observed within the first two distances on hybrid vines (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>a, distances 0 m and 15 m) as compared to 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> vines where the first distance had greater proportions than all subsequent distances. Generally, larger vineyard blocks had a greater edge effect compared to smaller blocks (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 16.2, df = 5, p = 0.006). However, the pattern was similar for both small (&gt; 0.5 ha) and large (&gt; 1.5 ha) vineyard blocks, and SLF proportions decreased from the vineyard edge. (Supplemental Fig.
