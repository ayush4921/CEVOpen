<p id="Par9">The number of egg masses deposited significantly decreased with distance from the vineyard edge (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 11.1, df = 4, p = 0.02). Similar to the findings reported for adults, 44% of SLF egg masses were found within 15 m of the vineyard edge and a significantly lower proportions of egg masses (12%) were found on vines located 75 m from the vineyard block edge (Fig.
