<p id="Par10">Adult SLF numbers were significantly negatively associated with two plant health metrics: cluster production and leaf redness (cluster production: F = 6.3, df = 1, p = 0.01; leaf redness: F = 6.7, df = 1, p = 0.0009
 <italic>).</italic> Reduced fruit clusters were associated with high numbers of SLF in the previous growing season (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.44) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Additionally, leaf redness significantly increased with increased SLF infestation (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.41, data not shown). Other health metric measures (percentage of dead buds and crown gall severity) were not associated with adult SLF infestation in the previous year (p &gt; 0.05, data not shown).
