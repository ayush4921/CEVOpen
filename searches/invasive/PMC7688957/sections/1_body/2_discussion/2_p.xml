<p id="Par14">Weekly monitoring and grid sampling of SLF in vineyard blocks revealed clumping of SLF around vineyard edges. From geostatistical modeling using the EBK approach, higher densities of adult SLF were predicted at the outside edge of vineyard blocks and low densities in the vineyard interior. Importantly, this occurs regardless of overall population density within the vineyard. These edge effects are likely impacted by landscape features and the ability of SLF to utilize resources in those landscapes. SLF is not confined to vineyards and is known to disperse into vineyards from wooded edges

 </sup>. Therefore, these relationships are likely significantly impacted by the quantity and quality of nearby host plants. Indeed, in this study we found that vineyard distance from wooded edges was strongly correlated with both SLF adult and egg abundance in the vineyard. Successful SLF control will likely necessitate some type of landscape management, either at a local or regional scale. Edge effects have been observed for other agricultural insect pests (see review
