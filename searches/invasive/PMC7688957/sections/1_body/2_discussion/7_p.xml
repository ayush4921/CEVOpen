<p id="Par19">The spatial concentration of SLF adults at vineyard edges was consistent temporally, both between years and weeks of sampling. These findings suggest a predictable trend in behavior which can be used to optimize monitoring and precise targeting of management efforts, including release of natural enemies and chemical applications in these agroecosystems. Utilizing this knowledge to modify chemical applications could reduce overall insecticide input into the production system, reducing non-target effects and secondary pest problems.</p>
