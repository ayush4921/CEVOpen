<p id="Par15">All vineyards monitored in this study used repeated insecticide applications to manage SLF which could alter their spatial organization. Insecticides can be highly efficacious against SLF

 </sup>. Insecticide exposure could also cause sublethal effects on SLF (e.g. reduced mobility). Therefore, it is possible that SLF may assume a different spatial distribution in unmanaged or infrequently sprayed vineyards. While egg masses displayed a clumped distribution at vineyard edges, this pattern had a higher degree of variance compared to adult distributions. Further study is needed to elucidate the biological and/or ecological mechanisms that explain this discrepancy. Our previous study indicated that SLF densities decrease in vineyards towards the end of the growing season

 </sup> which may reduce overall ovipositional activity. Female SLF may prefer to oviposit in nearby wooded edges, thereby reducing egg laying in vineyards and decreasing edge effects associated with egg masses.
