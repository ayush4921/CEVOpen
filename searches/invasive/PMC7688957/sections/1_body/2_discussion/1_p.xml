<p id="Par13">SLF is a noted pest of vineyards in the Northeastern U.S., however, little is known about its biology, behavior, and management in these agroecosystems. In this study, we evaluated the spatial and temporal relationships of SLF in grape systems. In line with our proposed hypothesis, we found that the greatest proportions of SLF adults and egg masses were consistently observed along the vineyard perimeters. Further, greater densities of SLF were significantly related to reduced vine health (reduced fruit production and increased leaf redness). This is the first study to report on the spatial organization of SLF within a landscape as well as indicate the potential negative effects of SLF on grapevine yield.</p>
