<p id="Par17">The number of clusters per shoot were negatively associated with increased adult SLF from the prior year. Primary buds, which bear the majority of fruit, are the most sensitive to cold damage, followed by secondary buds (reduced fruit) and tertiary buds (no fruit)

 </sup>. If SLF feeding reduces overwintering resources for the vine, this could manifest as increased damage to primary buds rather than complete bud death. This may explain why our study failed to find a significant effect of SLF abundance on the prevalence of dead shoots. Red leaves on red producing cultivars were significantly related with SLF abundance, which could be used as a metric to predict stressed plants and inform potential changes in sap flow and nutrient status of the vine

 </sup>. Crown gall was not significantly related to SLF abundance; however, our study did not include measurements of crown gall in the vineyards prior to SLF infestations, which limits our ability to address this relationship. Further study is needed to evaluate the relationship between SLF feeding injury and the severity and spread of crown gall. Additionally, nymphal SLF were not evaluated in this study and may influence these vine health metrics, although low levels of this life stage have been documented in vineyards
