<p id="Par16">Our findings suggest that insecticide regimes can be optimized to control SLF populations. Specifically, vineyard edges infested with SLF can be targeted with insecticidal sprays (e.g. perimeter sprays) which will reduce overall insecticide use and cost and mitigate negative off-target effects. Furthermore, management that focuses on the reducing SLF populations at vineyard edges may prevent infestations in the vineyard interior. Non-chemical approaches, like netting along vineyard edges, may limit SLF dispersing into vineyards. These tactics have been successful with highly mobile insects including brown marmorated stink bug
