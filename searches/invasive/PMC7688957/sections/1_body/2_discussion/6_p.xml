<p id="Par18">Our mark and recapture results suggest that SLF may aggregate in areas with higher densities of other SLF individuals. Thus, the relationships presented here are likely not only a result of vineyard management but also SLF behavior. Advantages of feeding in groups including overcoming plant defenses or mate selection may explain these patterns. These results should be further explored as they could play a critical role in developing mass-trapping, monitoring, or behavioral disruption tactics. It is important to note that the potential effects of powder-marked SLF on their mobility has not been fully evaluated and this should be studied in greater detail. Furthermore, this study only examined the short-term retention of SLF within an area (12–24 h), and longer time periods (7–14 days) may provide meaningful insights to behavior and management of SLF.</p>
