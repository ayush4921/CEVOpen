<p id="Par42">Our real-time LAMP protocol on frass gave good results in terms of specificity, especially given that

The protocol was also sensitive and accurate, and overall, the reaction demonstrated its robustness when the test was performed on different thermocyclers and with different operators. The repeatability and reproducibility data showed SD values with a relatively high range (Teter and Steffen
