<p id="Par43">The use of LAMP based on a naked-eye detection system to determine the amplification result is becoming a routine approach in molecular diagnosis (Blaser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>). Our visual LAMP is a further simplification of the real-time LAMP technology as it does not require sophisticated instruments (which entail large investments, skilled personnel, and high management costs), is rapid, specific, sensitive and with a good accuracy, also compared to real-time LAMP. In addition, the limits of detection are identical to those of real-time LAMP (LoD of 0.61 pg/µL for the proposed techniques).
