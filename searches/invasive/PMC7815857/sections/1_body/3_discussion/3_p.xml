<p id="Par41">We used the LAMP method on 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> frass. Our results show that all three issues (aâ€“c above) were overcome. In all samples, the DNA quantity was always suitable and amplifiable for the LAMP reactions, managing the co-extraction of inhibitors from the frass samples, and with an A
 <sub>260/280</sub> ratio of between 1.8 and 2.0. However, the DNA amount extracted from adults and larvae of 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> was higher than in the frass samples, but with a higher variability in terms of concentration, probably related to the specimen size.
