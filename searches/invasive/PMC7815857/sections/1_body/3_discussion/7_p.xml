<p id="Par45">The analytical sensitivity is affected by the matrix investigated. This was clear when the LoD of a DNA extract from 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> larva serially diluted 1:4 (from 10 ng/L to 2.38 fg/µL) was compared with the values resulting from the LoD of the LAMP assay on 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> 's artificial frass. The LAMP test studied was 10
 <sup>3</sup> (from 0.61 pg/l to 9.53 fg/µL) more sensitive from the “pure” matrix of 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> larva than the corresponding artificial frass. These values confirm that the starting matrix is difficult to extract and amplify, but at the same time indicate the excellent performance of our LAMP assay.
