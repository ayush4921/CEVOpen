<p id="Par44">The analytical sensitivity of the LAMP (LoD) test compared with conventional PCR (28F/489R and 51F/368R) was more sensitive (&gt;â€‰10
 <sup>3</sup>) to the same starting matrix. The results show that LAMP assays and qPCR SYBR Green method (using the F3/B3 LAMP external primers) are equally sensitive, and they are more sensitive than conventional PCR.
