<p id="Par5">The high specificity and sensitivity of DNA-based technologies allows the detection of harmful organisms even at low concentrations of DNA extracted from plant tissues (Aglietti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>; Rizzo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020a</xref>). Among the most versatile, sensitive and specific methods, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can be used as a field-friendly and cost-effective diagnostic tool (Notomi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Several LAMP tests have been used both in the field and in laboratories, in particular for human and animal diseases (Lucchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>), in food safety controls (Abdulmawjood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>), as well as in identifying plant pathogens (Aglietti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>; Luchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>; Blaser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>) and invasive insect pests (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Hsieh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Fekrat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Przybylska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>; Ide et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">b</xref>; Blaser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Sabahi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2018</xref>; Rizzo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020b</xref>). LAMP is a highly specific and robust identification method for species with previously known DNA or RNA sequences and suitable for on-site application because it can be performed in a laboratory-free environment after minimal training (Kogov≈°ek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>).
