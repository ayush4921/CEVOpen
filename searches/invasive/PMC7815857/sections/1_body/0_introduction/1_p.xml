 <italic>Aromia bungii</italic> (Faldermann, 1835) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), the red-necked longhorn beetle, is an important pest of fruit and ornamental plants of the genus

 <italic>A. bungii</italic> can infest healthy or weakened host species and complete several overlapping generations in the same tree (Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). The larvae bore galleries in the trunk and main branches, causing structural weakness, dieback, and finally tree death. Biological parameters of 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> evaluated in the Italian population showed remarkable fertility and longevity (Russo et al.
