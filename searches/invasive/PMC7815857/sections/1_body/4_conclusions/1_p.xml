<p id="Par49">The efficient management of a quarantine insect pest is based on detecting outbreaks as quickly as possible. Among the molecular methods, LAMP is a promising tool and more simple than the classical morphological approach, which requires intact samples and highly specialized skills. This is particularly true for xylophagous insects, where the sample collection is onerous in terms of time and costs, but also difficult due to the endophytic life of the preimaginal stages.</p>
