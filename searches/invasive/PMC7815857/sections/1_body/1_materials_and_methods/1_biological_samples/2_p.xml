<p id="Par8">The non-target samples consisted of a set of DNA samples from the entomological biomolecular collection of the phytopathological laboratory of the Phytosanitary Service of the Tuscany Region. The non-target DNA samples were listed in a previous paper (Rizzo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020a</xref>) and included a total of 62 samples belonging to 26 species. They were used for testing the diagnostic specificity of the protocols. The non-target samples included, depending on the species, adults and/or larval specimens and frass samples in the case of some xylophagous species. Among the non-target species, a subset of six xylophagous species producing frass (
 <italic>Anoplophora chinensis</italic> (Forster), 
 <italic>An. glabripennis</italic> (Motschulsky), 
 <italic>Cerambyx cerdo</italic> Linnaeus, 
 <italic>Cossus cossus</italic> Linnaeus, 
 <italic>Sesia</italic> sp. Fabricius, and 
 <italic>Zeuzera pyrina</italic> Linnaeus) was chosen and DNA was extracted de novo from their frass for this study. These DNA samples will be hereafter be referred to as non-target frass samples.
