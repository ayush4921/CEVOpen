<p id="Par26">For each methodology used in the experimental design, LoD was estimated using a tenfold 1:4 serial dilution using an “artificial” frass DNA (100 ng/µL), obtained by adding frass of another species (
 <italic>An. glabripennis</italic>, in this case) with 10 ng/µL of 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> DNA from larvae. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. To evaluate the influence of the initial matrix in defining the analytical sensitivity of the method under examination, the LoD verified with pure larva DNA extract and DNA extract from 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> artificial frass were compared. The comparison between the LoDs of the end point PCR and LAMP protocol was carried out by electrophoretic runs in 1.7% agarose gel stained with Gel Red (Biotium Inc., Fremont, CA, USA). In parallel, a QIAxcel Capillary Electrophoresis System (QIAgen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used with the inclusion of a 25-bp DNA marker.
