<p id="Par13">In the LAMP reaction, six primers (F3/B3, FIP/BIP and LoopF/LoopB) were designed to specifically target a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> (accession n. KF737790). The primers were designed using the LAMP Designer software (OptiGene Limited, Horsham, UK) and synthesized by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). The sequences of the primers are shown in Table
