<p id="Par23">Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the real-time and visual LAMP assays were evaluated after the optimization of the LAMP protocols on DNA samples of target and non-target species (62 samples belonging to 26 species). Samples with a time amplification value (Tamp, min:s) (Aglietti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>) greater than 30Â min were not considered. In the visual LAMP, the diagnostic specificity was verified by the naked eye assessing the color change of the reaction mixture. These parameters were calculated according to the EPPO standards on diagnostics PM7/76-4 (EPPO 2017) and PM7/98-4 (EPPO
