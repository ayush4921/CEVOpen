 <italic>Real-time LAMP.</italic> The real-time LAMP reactions were performed using the Isothermal Master Mix (ISO-001) produced by OptiGene Limited (Horsham, UK) on a CFX96 thermocycler. Each isothermal reaction was performed in duplicate, in a final volume of 20 μL and using 2 μL of DNA. Negative controls (NTC—no template control) were included for each reaction. At the end of the LAMP reactions, a melting curve was generated by increasing the temperature from 65 to 95 °C with a 10-s interval every 0.5 °C (Abdulmawjood et al.
