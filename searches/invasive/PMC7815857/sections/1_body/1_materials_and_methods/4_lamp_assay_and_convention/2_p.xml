<p id="Par17">The LAMP protocol optimization considered the following variables: isothermal amplification time, primer concentration and annealing temperature through a thermal gradient. Once the LAMP reaction had been optimized, the reactions were carried out using a second portable thermocycler, Genie
 <sup>Â®</sup> II (Optigene, Ltd, Horsham, UK) to evaluate their reproducibility.
