<p id="Par20">To optimize the visual assay conditions, the same parameters considered for the real-time LAMP were assessed. The following reagents were optimized in their quantities and/or concentrations: buffer, dNTPs, Betaine, MgSO4, HNB and primer concentration and Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase. The reaction was performed at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by an additional cycle of 80 °C for 2 min. Isothermal amplifications were analyzed with a QIAxcel Capillary Electrophoresis System (QIAgen, Valencia, CA, USA) with the inclusion of a 25 bp DNA marker. The QIAxcel system uses ScreenGel software, which determines the base pair number of each amplicon in individual amplification reactions.</p>
