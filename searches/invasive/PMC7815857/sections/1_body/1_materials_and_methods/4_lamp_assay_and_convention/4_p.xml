 <italic>Visual LAMP.</italic> To develop an alternative and easy-to-use protocol to detect the 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> DNA from collected samples, a visual LAMP approach based on the primers designed for the real-time LAMP assay was also tested. The Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase kit (New England Biolabs Ltd., UK) was used for LAMP reactions on 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> DNA from frass with the same six LAMP primers used in the real-time LAMP test. Hydroxynaphthol Blue (HNB) was included in the reaction mixture (Goto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>) and the color change (from purple to blue) was evaluated at the end of the reaction.
