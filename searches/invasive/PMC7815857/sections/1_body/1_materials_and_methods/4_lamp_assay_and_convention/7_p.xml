 <italic>Conventional PCR.</italic> The conventional PCR reactions were performed in 20-μL reaction volumes containing 1X Master Mix PerfectTaq Hot Start 5Prime (Eppendorf, Milan, Italy), 0.4-µM forward and reverse primers, and 2 μL of DNA template in a MyCycler thermocycler (Biorad, Berkeley, CA, USA). Cycling conditions consisted of 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s, with a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were visualized on a 1.7% agarose gel using a 10-μL aliquot of PCR reaction or using a QIAxcel Capillary Electrophoresis System.
