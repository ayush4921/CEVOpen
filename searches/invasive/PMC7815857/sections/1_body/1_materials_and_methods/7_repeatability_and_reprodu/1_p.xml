<p id="Par25">The repeatability and reproducibility tests were carried out on ten samples of 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> DNA extracted from frass. The intra-run variation (repeatability) and inter-run variation (reproducibility) were estimated by standard parameters, such as the average Tamp and standard deviation (SD). Ten samples in triplicate, diluted to a final concentration of 5 ng/µL, were tested in two separate series for repeatability. The reproducibility of each protocol was assessed in the same way as carried out for the repeatability by comparing the data of two series of samples by two different operators on different days (Dhami et al.
