<p id="Par9">The DNA extraction procedure was the same for real-time and visual LAMP protocols but had some changes in relation to the matrix (frass or larvae/adults). The extraction was carried out on 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> frass and larvae or adults following the CTAB extraction method suggested in Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>) with slight modifications. Specifically, in the extraction from insect frass, about 1 g of matrix was homogenized in a 10-mL stainless steel grinding jar along with a TissueLyzer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 10 s at 2000 opm. Each larva/adult was ground and homogenized individually using nylon mesh U-shaped bags (Bioreba, Reinach, Switzerland). Variable volumes (10 mL for insect frass and 1 mL for larvae) of 2% CTAB buffer (2% CTAB, 1% PVP-40, 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium metabisulfite) were added immediately after grinding.
