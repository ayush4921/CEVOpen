<p id="Par10">A volume of 0.5–1 mL of lysate was then incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, 1 volume of chloroform was added, stirred by inversion and TissueLyzer centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. An aliquot of 600 µL was then taken from the supernatant and an equal volume of isopropanol was inserted, mixed by inversion and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was dried by speed vacuum (Eppendorf, Milan, Italy) for 5 min, then resuspended in 100 µL of sterile, ultra-pure water and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and used for LAMP/qPCR/conventional PCR reactions immediately or stored at − 20 °C until use.</p>
