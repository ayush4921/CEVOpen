 <sub>260/280</sub> ratios were evaluated for each sample using the QIAxpert spectrophotometer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To detect biological traces of insects (feces, etc.) in the frass samples, the quality of the extracted DNA was estimated using a dual-labeled qPCR targeting a highly conserved region of the 18S rDNA (Ioos et al.
