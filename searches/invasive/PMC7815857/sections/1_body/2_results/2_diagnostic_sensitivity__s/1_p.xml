<p id="Par30">None of the tests carried out on target and non-target samples showed any non-specific amplification, and only 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> produced amplification curves. A unique peak at 83.5 ± 0.5 °C, resulting from the melting curve analysis, was visualized for each 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> sample, regardless of the starting matrix and confirming the specificity of the real-time LAMP assay. In the case of the visual LAMP assay, only 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> samples (adult, larvae, and frass) were detected by the LAMP reaction, while none of the non-target samples (62 samples) was amplified. For both protocols, diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, and relative accuracy were 100%.
