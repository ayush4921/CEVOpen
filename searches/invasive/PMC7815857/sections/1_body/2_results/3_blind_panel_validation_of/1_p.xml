<p id="Par32">The blind panel test performed using the real-time and visual LAMP protocols showed the amplification only of the 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> frass samples, with a mean Tamp value equal to 18.21 ± 0.42 min in the case of real-time LAMP, whereas the non-target frass samples were not amplified. The specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of the data were 100%. In both laboratories, the results obtained with real-time and visual LAMP were the same. Only the 
 <italic>A. bungii</italic> frass samples amplified, whereas there was no amplification of the DNA samples extracted from the frass of the xylophagous species used as comparison (non-target frass samples).
