<p id="Par29">The amplifiability of the DNA extracted from target and non-target frass samples (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) gave satisfactory results. The Tamp average value of COX gene (LAMP protocol) was 12.3 ± 2.4 (min). The verification of amplifiability with the qPCR probe on insect extracts showed average values of Cq equal to 18.64 ± 3.6.
