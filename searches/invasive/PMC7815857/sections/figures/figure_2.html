 <caption> Alignment of the LAMP amplicon of A. bungii and the sequences belonging to the most taxonomically related species (included the non-target xylophagous species used in the assays) present in GenBank. The reference sequence is the A. bungii LAMP amplicon (yellow areas); the correspondent primers are reported in blue. The nucleotides which differ from the reference sequence are highlighted with different colors according to the specific base </caption>
