 <p>The allelopathic effects of different parts of the plant 
  <italic>Xanthium italicum</italic> Moretti were evaluated by conducting bioassays against two dicot plants, amaranth (
  <italic>Amaranthus mangostanus</italic> L.) and lettuce (
  <italic>Lectuca sativa</italic> L.), and two monocot plants, wheat (
  <italic>Triticum aestivum </italic>Linn) and ryegrass (
  <italic>Lolium multiforum</italic>). Leaf and fruit extract possessed the strongest biological activity, killing all seeds of four test species at 0.05 g/mL concentration. Fruits were chosen for further investigation because of their high biomass. This led to the isolation and identification of a phytotoxin—Xanthinosin—a known sesquiterpene lactone. Xanthinosin significantly affected seedling growth of all test species at 160 µM concentration. Cultivating seeds in 800 μM xanthinosin solution resulted in a great decrease in seedling growth of all test species, especially for the two dicot plants, amaranth and lettuce, whose root length was inhibited by 78% and 89%, respectively. By comparison, the numbers were 69% lower for wheat, and 66% for ryegrass, two monocot plants. When treated with 4 mM xanthinosin solution, seed germination of all test plants was almost completely inhibited. The possibility of utilizing xanthinosin as an eco-friendly herbicide was discussed.
