<p>The structure of the purified active compound was identified as xanthinosin by comparing its spectral data with published literature [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-04037-f002">Figure 2</xref>). We obtained 820 mg of xanthinosin from 8 kg of dried 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> fruits (0.01% yield). Xanthinosin has been previously isolated from 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic>, 
 <italic>X. macrocarpum </italic>and 
 <italic>X. strumarium</italic>, and it was confirmed to possess antileishmanial and antitumor activity [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; however, no phytotoxic activity has ever been reported for it. Due to the fact that xanthinosin also exists in 
 <italic>X. strumarium</italic>, a native 
 <italic>Xanthium</italic> plant, our current study thus cannot provide any evidence to support the “novel weapons hypothesis”, although it is possible that 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> does produce unknown novel allelochemicals [
