<p>The genus 
 <italic>Xanthium</italic> is the richest source of xanthanolides [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Besides xanthinosin, dozens of other xanthanolide lactones have been isolated from 
 <italic>Xanthium</italic> plants, and many of them have been proven to possess a variety of biological activities including antimicrobial, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and plant growth regulatory activity [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. So far, the majority of reported chemical constituents of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> are sesquiterpene lactones. 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> contains many other xanthanolide sesquiterpenes besides xanthinosin. Kovacs 
 <italic>et al</italic>. isolated four xanthanolides, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, xanthatin, 4-epixanthanol, 4-epi-isoxanthanol, and 2-hydroxyxanthinosin, from leaves of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> with antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Marco 
 <italic>et al</italic>. identified five xanthanolides from aerial parts of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> including xanthinosin and 4-epixanthanol [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Tsankova obtained six xanthanolides from leaves of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic>, mainly xanthinin and xanthatin [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is noteworthy to mention that xanthinin was reported to possess plant growth regulatory effects [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another xanthanolide, 8-
 <italic>epi</italic>-xanthatin, which doesn’t exist in 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic>, also exhibited plant growth regulatory activity [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In case both xanthinosin and xanthinin (or other xanthanolides, too) can be released to the environment and persist in soil at effective concentration for a certain period of time to affect other plants’ growth, it is necessary to investigate whether these co-occurring sesquiterpenoids could result in synergistic effects [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although xanthinosin (possibly xanthinin and 8-
 <italic>epi</italic>-xanthatin, too) has the potential to be exploited as an environmentally friendly herbicide, still, there is a long way to go before it can be successfully commercialized. There are some issues that limit the utilization of naturally occurring substances directly as herbicides including their low yields, weak inhibitory activity, high toxicity, instability, short persistence in soil, 
 <italic>etc</italic>.; on the other hand, there are successful cases of using natural products as new lead compounds to synthesize commercial herbicides. Examples include mesotrione, a synthesized analogue of leptospermone which is produced by the roots of the “bottle brush” plant 
 <italic>Callistemon citrinus </italic>[
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and cinmethylin, a derivative of 1,4-cineole which is a natural phytotoxin found in the essential oils of a number of plants [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
