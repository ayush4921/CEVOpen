<p>Xanthinosin didn’t affect seedling growth of any test plants when the concentration was low (32 µM). From 160 µM, significant inhibitory effects were observed on most test plants, especially lettuce, whose root elongation was inhibited by 58%. When treated with 800 µM xanthinosin solution, two dicot plants, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, amaranth and lettuce, seemed to be more sensitive than two monocot species, wheat and ryegrass. Root growth of amaranth and lettuce was inhibited by 78% and 89%, respectively, while the numbers were 69% lower for wheat, and 66% for ryegrass (
