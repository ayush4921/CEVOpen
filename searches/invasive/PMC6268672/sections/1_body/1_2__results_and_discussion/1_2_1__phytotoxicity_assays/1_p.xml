<p>The strength of phytotoxicity of ethanol extracts on test plants varied greatly with the plant parts (
 <xref rid="molecules-17-04037-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Leaf and fruit extracts exhibited the strongest biological activity on all test species compared with other extracts, completely inhibiting seed germination of all test species at 0.05 g/mL. Stem and root extract exhibited moderate to weak phytotoxic activity on four test plants, while litter extract showed the least effect. Given the fact that fruit has a much higher biomass than leaf, it was chosen for further investigation.
