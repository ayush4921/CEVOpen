<p>Two dicot plants, amaranth and lettuce, and two monocots, wheat and ryegrass, were chosen as test plants for this assay. Seeds were surface sterilized with 0.5% HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> before use. Air dried plants of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> were separated into stems, leaves, fruits, roots and litter. Five g of each part were ground into powder and soaked in 80% ethanol (100 mL) for 24 h to afford 0.05 g/mL extract. Three mL of ethanol extract of each plant part were then added to Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) lined with Whatman No. 3 filter paper. After complete evaporation of ethanol, distilled water (3 mL) was added to each Petri dish followed by addition of 10 seeds. Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm to prevent water loss and stored in the dark at 25 Â°C. Seedlings were measured after 4 days of cultivation for amaranth, lettuce and wheat, and 5 days for ryegrass. Three replicates were made for all phytotoxic bioassays.
