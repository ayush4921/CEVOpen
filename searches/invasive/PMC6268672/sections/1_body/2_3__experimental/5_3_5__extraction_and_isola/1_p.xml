<p>Eight kg of dried fruits were ground into powder and exhaustively extracted with 80% ethanol at room temperature for three weeks (3 × 40 L). The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a dark brown residue which was subsequently subjected to solvent-solvent partition into petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol subfractions. Results from the bioassays indicated that the chloroform extract possessed the strongest inhibitory effect. Thus 10 g chloroform extract were fractionated on silica gel eluted with a step gradient elution (CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>, CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>-MeOH at 98:2, 96:4, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 1:1, MeOH). Twenty-four major fractions were collected based on TLC profiles; they were all subsequently assayed for phytotoxic activity on lettuce at 1 mg/mL. Among them, fraction 5 and 6 completely inhibited seed germination of lettuce, and they were chosen for further study. Fractions 9–10, 16–17 also exhibited moderate biological effects. However, considering the low yield of these fractions, we gave up on them. Fraction 5 was then further purified by Sephadex LH-20 to afford an oily liquid that was later identified as xanthinosin; fraction 6, which contains lots of impurities, was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, after which we lost track of the active ingredient and thus failed to identify it in this fraction.
