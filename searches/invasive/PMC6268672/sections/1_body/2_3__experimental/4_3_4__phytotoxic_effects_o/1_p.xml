<p>Fruits of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> were selected for further isolation because of their strong phytotoxic activity and high biomass. Two hundred g of dried fruits of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> were first extracted in ethanol for a week and then subjected to solvent-solvent partition using the following organic solvents sequentially: petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, to afford corresponding extracts. The extracts along with the remaining water phase were filtered and evaporated to dryness 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic>, weighed, and redissolved in 95% ethanol (for organic extracts) or distilled water (for the water phase) to give 1 mg/mL solutions. They were then tested for their phytotoxic effects at 1 mg/mL concentration using the same method for plant part extracts. Again, amaranth, lettuce, wheat and ryegrass served as test plants.
