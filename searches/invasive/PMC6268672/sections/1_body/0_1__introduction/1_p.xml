 <italic> Xanthium italicum</italic> Moretti (family Asteraceae, Compositae) is a noxious annual invasive weed. Native to America, it was first spotted in Beijing, the capital of China in 1991 [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2007, it was listed on the “People’s Republic of China imported plant quarantine pests list” [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-17-04037-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which is consistent with the hypothesis that 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> was transported to China via international trade [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another interesting fact is that 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> is mainly distributed in three regions which are not only geographically far away from each other, but also characterized by distinctive climates: the northeastern region (which includes Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing and Shandong) has a temperate continental monsoon climate, the southeastern (Guangdong and Guangxi) is subtropical, and the northwestern region (Xinjiang) has a typical temperate continental arid/semiarid climate [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This phenomenon implies that 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> has the ability to easily adapt to different environmental conditions; it is also consistent with another report on the distribution of 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> in Japan, where this exotic plant was found to be dominant mainly in seaside habitats because it can tolerate salinity stress [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-17-04037" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>X. italicum</italic> is currently distributed in only a few places in China, ecological modeling has predicted that it has the potential to spread further to most regions in China, except for several areas with extreme environmental conditions such as Tibet [
