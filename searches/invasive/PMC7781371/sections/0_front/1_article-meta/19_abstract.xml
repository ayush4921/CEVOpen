 <p>The presented study evaluated effects of potassium nitrate (KNO
  <sub>3</sub>), ammonium nitrate (NH
  <sub>4</sub> NO
  <sub>3</sub>) and ammonium chloride (NH
  <sub>4</sub>Cl) on the germination-related characteristics of 10 species from European dry acidic grasslands. Germination was studied under controlled laboratory conditions. The seeds were subjected to KNO
  <sub>3</sub>, NH
  <sub>4</sub> NO
  <sub>3</sub> and NH
  <sub>4</sub>Cl in four doses (1, 10, 50 and 100 mM) and to distilled water. Final germination percentage, index of germination velocity and index of germination synchrony were determined. Content of nitrogen in the soil probed from the site of seeds collection was also analyzed. Significant effects of type of the nitrogen compounds and their concentrations were observed. High concentrations of nitrogen-containing salts inhibited completion of germination in almost all species.
