 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as well as the importance of N for development and persistence of acidic dry grasslands were analyzed [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] however the comparative studies on influence of N type and dose on completion of germination are not very common in literature. It can be hypothesized that exposure of seeds to exogenous N-containing salts can significantly affect ability of seeds to complete germination. Furthermore, it can be expected that NH

As an output of this study we intended to answer the following questions: 1) is nitrogen a factor controlling seed-based revegetation and 2) is the ability to complete germination under wide range of conditions species dependent. The hypotheses tested are that 1) nitrogen type and dose affect germination-related characteristics of the studied species and 2) responses to nitrogen type and dose vary among plant species.
