<p>The composition and diversity of species as well as primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems are strongly affected by the sources of limiting nutrients, e.g. N [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is an essential macronutrient for plants and is required for many primary and secondary metabolic processes. Regarding germination process, N may modulate germination in many plant species, both alone and in combination with other abiotic factors, e.g. changing temperature or light-dark cycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While the stimulating role of NO

 <sup>‒</sup> on completion of seed germination was well recognized [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], mode of action of NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> is more enigmatic. NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>-driven alternations of seed metabolism during germination are associated with decelerated mobilization of seed resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which may reduce germination-related parameters [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] however NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>-tolerant plants are less susceptible than intolerant ones. These harmful effects are related to toxic action of NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], especially in tissues with not overdriven metabolism, where NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> cannot be directly incorporated into bio-molecules. It must be mentioned that besides N availability, pH is another major factor limiting plant growth on acid soils. As an example, pH of the soils on which dry inland grasslands (
 <italic>Spergulo-Corynephoretum</italic>) are settled ranges 3.6–6.8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As plants are able to absorb N in cationic (e.g. NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) and anionic (e.g. NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>‒</sup>) forms, uptake of nitrogen-containing compounds influences the pH in rooting substratum [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is known that pH values of 1–100 mM solutions of KNO
 <sub>3</sub>, NH
 <sub>4</sub>NO
 <sub>3</sub> and NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl are slightly different [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, uptake and utilization of N by plant seeds and then seedlings can lead to gradual depletion of N sources on a local scale which may shift the pH status and create microhabitats, especially in sandy soils lacking developed sorption complex and when species-characteristic N uptake pattern can be observed.
