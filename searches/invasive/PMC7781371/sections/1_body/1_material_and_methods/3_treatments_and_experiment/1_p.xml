<p>The seeds were treated with 1, 10, 50 or 100 mM solutions of KNO
 <sub>3</sub>, NH
 <sub>4</sub>NO
 <sub>3</sub> or NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl. For control, distilled water was used (conductivity &lt; 0.06 μS cm
 <sup>-1</sup>). Thus, the experimental design consisted of 13 experimental groups for each species. By such a range of nitrogen types and doses we intended to simulate conditions which can be observed in nature as well as to create extreme situations which cannot be encountered there. The seeds subjected to distilled water (0 mM of N) germinated under absolute non-N conditions which are very rare in the field. Treatment with 100 mM of N was used to simulate the conditions with exceeding concentration of N which is not likely in sand-settled plant communities. Solutions of 1, 10 and 50 mM simulated very poor (regarding N concentration) conditions, perturbed soil with exposed deeper layers (where N content is c.a. 0.02% kg
 <sup>-1</sup> soil) and typical soil surface of sand soil, e.g. Podzol (where N content is c.a. 0.09% kg
 <sup>-1</sup> soil), respectively. Furthermore, previous studies indicated that 0–100 mM range of solutions of N-containing salts is suitable for studies on germination requirements [
