<p>The soil analyzed in this study was probed from the same site from which the seeds were collected. Four representative plots (1 × 1 m) were designated. Subsequently, one soil subsample (0–15 cm soil depth core; ø = 2 cm) from each plot was collected. All subsamples were pooled into a single bulk sample.</p>
