<p>To estimate reactions of the studied species to nitrogen type and dose, final germination percentage (FGP), index of germination velocity (IGV, known as modified Timsonâ€™s index [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) and index of germination synchrony (IGS, known as Z value [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) were calculated. Higher values of FGP (where minimum is 0% and maximum is 100%) indicate greater ability to complete germination. Higher values of IGV (where minimum is 0 and maximum is 100) denote more rapid completion of germination. Higher values of IGS (where minimum is 0 and maximum is 1) indicate greater synchronization of germination. The germination-related parameters were calculated using the germinationmetrics package v. 0.1.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] run in R software (v. 3.5.2, 64 bit version [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) with the functions implemented therein.
