<p>Mature seeds of all species were hand-harvested at the end of the summer of 2016, coinciding with their dispersal period. The seeds were taken from at least 10 individuals of one single, large and representative population. The seeds were collected on privately-owned property, where no specific permissions are required. The seeds were stored dry in paper bags at 20–22°C (relative humidity of 30%) for two weeks and then used for experiments within one month. Stratification of the seeds was not conducted due to the fact that fresh seeds of the species we studied are able to efficiently complete germination [

At this stage, the seeds were inspected under binocular magnifying glass; all malformed, wrinkled, damaged or discolored ones were removed from the seed pool. After inspection, the seeds were weighed. Dimensions of the seeds were taken from the literature [
