<p>Seeds of 10 species (nomenclature follows The Plant List [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) native to central Europe were used in this study: 
 <italic>Alyssum montanum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Arnoseris minima</italic> (L.) Schweigg. &amp; Körte, 
 <italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> L., 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scabiosa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Echium vulgare</italic> L., 
 <italic>Helichrysum arenarium</italic> (L.) Moench, L., 
 <italic>Hypochaeris radicata</italic> L., 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Jasione montana</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Spergula morisonii</italic> Boreau (syn. 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>vernalis</italic> Willd.) (
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These species are from 6 families (Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Hypericaceae, Campanulaceae and Caryophyllaceae) with the majority from Asteraceae. The species we studied were selected based on their Ellenberg Indicator Values [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for soil reaction (R, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All species we studied are light-demanding, require relatively high temperature, medium soil moisture and have low N indicators of ecological behavior, typical of N low habitats (

 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The species we selected were among the most representative and abundant in the patches of 
 <italic>Spergulo-Corynephoretum</italic> located in the eastern village periphery of Niewiesz in central Poland (19°83’N, 10°83’E at 149 m a.s.l.). The studied plant community is settled on Entic Podzol soil. The local climate is temperate (annual precipitation of 587.2 mm and a temperature range of –2.5 to 22.4°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), and the seasons are clearly differentiated. Meteorological data based on 10-year observations (2000–2010) indicated that the mean annual temperature was 8.8°C.
