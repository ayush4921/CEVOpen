<p>Soil analysis (
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) showed that acidity of the tested Entic Podzol was typical of this type of soil (pH
 <sub>KCl</sub> = 5.7) and met the requirements of the studied plant community. Analysis also showed that the soil contained relatively low total N. Mineral forms of N (N-NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>‒</sup> and N-NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) did not contribute substantially to the total N pool (0.99% of total N). Molar N-NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>: N-NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>‒</sup> ratio of 1.57 showed that N-NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> was a predominant N form in the studied soil.
