<p>Shift from N-poor to relatively N-rich conditions is a natural repercussion of succession in psammophilous grasslands due to deposition of plant biomass [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] which causes gradual development of mineral horizon [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Organic forms of N are released from reservoir of plant biomass via microbial metabolism [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and mineralized throughout succession of acidic grassland [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that N cycling process in Podzol soils (where mineral forms of N account only 1% of total N [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) is influenced by many physical and chemical soil traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It makes hard to predict quantitative equilibrium between NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>‒</sup> and NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> forms in soil. However, NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> is adsorbed mostly on silt and clay fractions, whilst NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>‒</sup> remains in a soil solution [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] thus is better available for plants (e.g. during seed imbibition) but is also more likely to percolate to ground water with precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In context of presented results it can be stated that the species persisting in acidic dry grasslands need systematic perturbations uncovering poorer soil layers, free of N depositions.
