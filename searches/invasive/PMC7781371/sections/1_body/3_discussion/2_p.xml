<p>The most abundant species (frequently only a few) in a given plant community (e.g. psammophilous grassland on acidic soils) can be defined as ‘core species’, while the less abundant ones are ‘satellite species’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. One might expect that species with wide ecological optimum, tolerant to insufficient level of resources or their excess are ‘core species’ and the other ones are ‘specialists’, However, meta-analyses in this field do not support the abovementioned assumption [

 <italic>morisonii</italic>, the species occurring in substantial numbers in inland sand grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], showed relatively low completion of germination in the narrow range of conditions, whereas

 <italic>radicata</italic>, the species persisting on acidic psammophilous grasslands in lesser number [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], showed cosmopolitan reaction in terms of N requirements. This shows that, in extremely poor environments of inland sand grasslands, wide tolerance to environmental N-dependent stimuli at germination stage does not guarantee survival and persistence. As an evolutionary solution to ensure successful establishment in optimal habitats, the seeds of plant species from Asteraceae (e.g.

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>arenarium</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>radicata</italic>) are equipped with pappus allowing distribution by wind (anemochory) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and by animals (exozoochory) [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] which is beneficial in the open ecosystem. Such an adaptation allows at least some of the produced seeds to colonize more favorable areas.
