<p>It was repeatedly showed that increasing N status in soil reduced species richness in semi-arid grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Most species we studied have low or very low N requirements and completed germination mostly at low levels of N, but some completion of germination was also observed in the solutions with N concentrations exceeding environmental values. As it was showed by numerous evaluations, completion of germination under supraoptimal load of N might lead to exhaustion of seed pool in seed bank due to high mortality at seedling stage under mismatched environmental conditions [

 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>perforatum</italic> and 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>montana</italic> showed substantial differences pertaining to synchronization of completion of germination (1 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl and 1â€“10 mM of NH
 <sub>4</sub>NO
 <sub>3</sub>, respectively). It can be assumed that synchronic completion of germination under such conditions is associated with some kind of adaptation allowing avoidance of the above mentioned seed bank depletion or that it is an efficient mechanism permitting rapid and massive establishment in N-poor vegetation gaps [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Completion of germination under very poor conditions suggests that 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>montana</italic> is an oligo-stenotopic plant species. Considering this information, germination pattern of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>montana</italic> seems to indicate advanced adaptation allowing successful establishment on inland sand dunes. It was shown in field evaluations, where 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>montana</italic> was showed to occur more frequently in low N-deposition sites [
