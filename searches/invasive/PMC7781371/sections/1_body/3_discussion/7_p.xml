<p>Summarizing, our study clearly showed that both N type and dose affected the ability of the studied species to complete germination (question 1). Furthermore, each species we studied showed different reaction to N type and dose, which suggests individual requirements for N type and dose to complete germination (question 2). Considering biology of the studied species, it can be seen that plants from dry psammophilous grasslands show two different types of adaptation, i.e. some species are adapted to complete germination on N-poor soils (true pioneer species), whilst only a few of them are able to withstand gradual eutrophication of the occupied habitat. It implies that advancing N deposition on dry psammophilous grasslands (both from natural and anthropogenic sources) may lead to loss of potential niches suitable for propagation of pioneer plants and may reduce genetic and species diversity. Last but not least, influence of progressive homogenization of edaphic conditions on the ability of seeds to complete germination (in terms of increasing N availability) is yet another mechanism that is likely to contribute to secondary succession in dry psammophilous grasslands. Thus, natural as well as anthropogenic processes associated with enhanced N deposition (e.g. due to increased atmospheric N load) shift the environmental balance, favoring establishment of mesophilic species and causing gradual loss of diversity of pioneer plants.</p>
