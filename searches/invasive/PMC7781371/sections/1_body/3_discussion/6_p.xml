<p>High light level and light heterogeneity are characteristic of loose-grassland-type vegetation [

 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Light conditions in this type of environments are not strongly differentiated, thus soil seems to be the major factor affecting plant functioning in this community [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Perceiving soil nutritional feature through the prism of the N status, we concluded that Entic Podzol, on which the studied community was settled, represented upper values of conditions characteristic of dry acidic grasslands [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, they are still relatively low and indicates poor nutritional quality. It can be even further diminished due to aeolian processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, in this type of environments, microbial nitrification is halted at early succession stages due to low pH of soil and symbiotic N fixation becomes significant only at advanced stages of community development due to establishment of 
 <italic>Trifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>Medicago</italic> species [
 <xref rid="pone.0244737.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to that, complex transformation of inland sand dunes causes gradual increase in N content in soil up to the stage of succession dominated by grasses, which mechanically stabilize soil, allow development of mineral horizon and deposition of nutrients. This can, however, eliminate species adapted to poor soils.
