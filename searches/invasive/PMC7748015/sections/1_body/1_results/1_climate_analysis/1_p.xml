<p id="p0040">We conducted a principal component analysis of the bioclimatic variables downloaded from WorldClim for our sampled populations (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). Principal component 1 (PC1) explained 56% of the variation in climate (henceforth called CLIMPC1) and was correlated with most of the bioclimatic variables (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). In particular, temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, and mean diurnal range were strongly positively correlated with CLIMPC1, while minimum temperature of coldest month; mean temperature of coldest quarter; annual precipitation; and precipitation of driest month, driest quarter, and coldest quarter were negatively correlated. CLIMPC1 was also strongly associated with range (F
 <sub>1,39</sub> = 84.29, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with introduced North American populations having higher CLIMPC1 values (mean ± SE: native = −2.59 +/−0.40, introduced = 2.72 ± 0.41), and therefore experiencing greater temperature seasonality and lower temperatures compared with native European populations. PC2 (now termed CLIMPC2) was strongly positively correlated with precipitation of warmest quarter and negatively associated with annual mean temperature and mean temperature of driest quarter. For this principal component, there was no significant difference between the ranges (F
 <sub>1,39</sub> = 0.017, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.90. Mean ± SE: native = −0.043 ± 0.46, introduced = 0.045 ± 0.48).
