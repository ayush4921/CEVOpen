<p id="p0045">We found that germination rate was significantly different between the ranges (F

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Higher germination rate was identified in the native range versus the introduced range (mean ± SE: native = 0.68 ± 0.030, introduced = 0.57± 0.033). However, it was also significantly associated with CLIMPC1 (F
 <sub>1,39</sub> = 4.40, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but not CLIMPC2 or latitude (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, germination rates were lower in seeds sourced from populations experiencing greater temperature seasonality and lower temperatures, which reflect conditions in the introduced North American range compared with Europe. Once range and CLIMPC1 were both included in the model, the significance of both effects was lost (range: F
 <sub>1,38</sub> = 0.31, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.58. CLIMPC1: F
 <sub>1,38</sub> = 0.50, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.49).
