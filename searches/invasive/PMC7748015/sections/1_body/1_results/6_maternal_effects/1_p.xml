<p id="p0100">Using the MANOVA we found a significant experiment by treatment interaction, but no interaction involving range and experiment, suggesting there was no evidence that maternal effects were driving patterns among the ranges. However, we also did not identify a main effect of range, perhaps because the maternal effects experiment only used a small number of populations, limiting power. We identified an experiment by treatment interaction (

 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). For the change in leaf number, the maternal effects and main experiment were equivalent in the control, but, in the nutrient stress, the change in leaf number was much reduced in the maternal effects garden resulting in a larger difference between the nutrient and the control for the glass-house-derived clones. For above- and below-ground biomass, there was a significant treatment and experiment effect, but no interaction of treatment with experiment. The below- and above-ground biomass was lower in the maternal effects experiment and in the nutrient stress. However, the small population sample size limited our capacity to readily detect differences in the greenhouse-derived clones versus the field-collected seed.
