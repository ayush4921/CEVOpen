<p id="p0065">We conducted a principal component analysis of vegetative traits using population means across all three treatments where final vegetative trait measurements were recorded on most individuals (control, nutrient, herbivory). We excluded the time point measured prior to the beginning of the stress (t0). We first eliminated traits that were strongly associated (Spearman's ρ
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.7) and retained six (out of 25) traits (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>) for subsequent analyses. We conducted a principal component analysis for this reduced trait set (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). The first two principal components explained 34% and 31%, respectively, of the variation in the traits (hereafter termed TRAIT
 <sub>CNH</sub>PC1 and TRAIT
 <sub>CNH</sub>PC2, respectively). The TRAIT
 <sub>CNH</sub>PC1 was most strongly positively correlated with below-ground biomass, final stem diameter, and final shoot number but negatively correlated with the change in leaf number. We did not detect a significant range by treatment interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.48), but, once the interaction was removed, there was a marginally significant difference between the ranges (F
 <sub>1,119</sub> = 3.76, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.055. Mean± SE: native = 0.35 ± 0.23; mean introduced = −0.30 ± 0.24) and a highly significant treatment effect (F
 <sub>2,119=</sub>93.32, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). TRAIT
 <sub>CNH</sub>PC2 was most strongly negatively correlated with final leaf number and leaf difference between time point two and the end of the experiment. There was no significant interaction between treatment and range (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.59), but, when the interaction was removed, we found a significant difference between the ranges (F
 <sub>1,119</sub> = 8.11, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. Mean± SE: native = 0.58 ± 0.27; mean introduced = −0.54 ± 0.28) and a highly significant treatment effect (F
