<p id="p0090">Similar to the patterns with CLIMPC1, CLIMPC2 had few significant associations with traits in the univariate analysis (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 12</xref>). For SLA, final leaf number (leaves
 <sub>t4</sub>), and change in leaf number between time point two and the end (leaves
 <sub>t4-t2</sub>) of experiment, we identified a significant range by CLIMPC2 interaction. SLA and the change in leaf number were significantly associated with CLIMPC2 (positively correlated with precipitation of warmest quarter and negatively associated with mean diurnal range and mean temperature of driest quarter) but only in the native range (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 13</xref>). Specifically, CLIMPC2 increased as SLA declined and the change in leaf number increased. By contrast, final leaf number was positively associated with CLIMPC2 in both ranges. We identified greater final leaf number and change in leaf number in the introduced range for equivalent CLIMPC2 values, but only at lower CLIMPC2 values (minimum European CLIMPC2).
