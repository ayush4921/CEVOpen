<p id="p0085">As the MANOVAs provided significance for all three main effects and the interaction between range and the climate PCs, we conducted univariate analyses to further dissect the cause of the significant effects. For most traits, associations with CLIMPC1 were not evident (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). For final stem diameter (stem diameter 
 <sub>t4</sub>), the univariate analysis that included CLIMPC1 produced non-significant effects for range and CLIMPC1, although when CLIMPC1 was removed range was highly significant (see 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We identified two traits with a significant CLIMPC1 by range interaction. For final leaf number (leaves
 <sub>t4</sub>), there was a significantly positive association with CLIMPC1 in the introduced North American range, but no significant pattern in the native European range (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 11</xref>). Consequently, leaf number increased in populations with historically greater temperature seasonality and lower temperatures but only in North America. The inclusion of CLIMPC1 also resulted in no significant overall effect of range, and a lack of significant difference between the ranges for equivalent climates where the climate variable overlapped between the ranges (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 11</xref>). Finally, the change in leaf number between time point two and the end of experiment (leaves
 <sub>t4-t2</sub>) was significantly negatively associated with CLIMPC1 in the native range, but this pattern was not significant in the introduced North American range. Here, the change in leaf number declined with temperature seasonality and colder historic temperatures. However, introduced populations had greater leaf production overall and for equivalent overlapping climates (
