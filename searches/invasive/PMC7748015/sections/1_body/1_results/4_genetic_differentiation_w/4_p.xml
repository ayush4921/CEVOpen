<p id="p0080">To determine if the apparent trait differences between the ranges reflected patterns in climate adaptation within each range, we ran two separate MANOVAs where we included the first two climate PCs (CLIMPC1 or CLIMPC2) in the analysis. With the inclusion of these climate PCs in the MANOVA, range remained significant (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>). Furthermore, we did not identify a significant range by treatment interaction or a three-way interaction between range, treatment, and either CLIMPC1 or CLIMPC2. The same pattern was also found when leaf number prior to the start of the stress was used as a covariate to control for initial size differences among the ranges (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 8</xref>). These patterns do not support the hypothesis of an evolutionary trade-off in response to stress, even when potential differences in local climates are accounted for. However, we did identify interactions between the climate PCs and range, indicating an association between traits and climate variables that differed between the introduced and native range.
