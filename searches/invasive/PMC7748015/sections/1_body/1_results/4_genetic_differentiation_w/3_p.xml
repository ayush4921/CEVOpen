<p id="p0075">Univariate analysis of vegetative traits in the control and treatment (herbivory and nutrient stress) revealed that final leaf number, final stem diameter, and the change in leaf number from time point two to the end of the experiment had a significant range effect, and no interaction with treatment was evident (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>; 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In these cases, the introduced populations had significantly larger trait means than the native populations. This pattern was maintained even when initial leaf number was used as a covariate to control for differences in size at the start of the stress treatments (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 9</xref>). Biomass and stem diameter in the herbivory and nutrient stress were significantly lower than the control, indicating a significant fitness impact of the stressors (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 10</xref>). Leaf and shoot production were also significantly lower than the control in the nutrient stress. However, this was not the case in simulated herbivory where half of each new leaf was removed, perhaps indicating that the simulated herbivory was compensated for by increased production of leaves and shoots.
