<p id="p0060">The univariate analyses of the control common garden revealed that greater final (time point t4) stem diameter and leaf number in the introduced range largely drove the differences between the ranges in the MANOVA (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). Both of these traits were also positively correlated with latitude in the native and introduced ranges (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Populations in the introduced range produced larger stems and more leaves at equivalent latitudes in both ranges (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 6</xref>). Flower head number declined with increasing latitude in both ranges, although both ranges produced a similar number of flower heads. An increase in below-ground biomass was also observed in the native range with increasing latitude, although this pattern was not evident in the introduced range.
