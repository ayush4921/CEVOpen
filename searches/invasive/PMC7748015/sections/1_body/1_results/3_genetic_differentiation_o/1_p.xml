<p id="p0050">Using population means for reproductive and vegetative traits, we eliminated traits that were strongly associated (Spearman's ρ
 <sup>2</sup> &gt;0.7) in the control treatment, either retaining traits that were most biologically significant (e.g., fitness-related traits such as flower head number or biomass traits) or randomly choosing traits if they were similar (e.g., leaf number at time point two versus three) when examining pairwise correlations. Following this procedure, we eliminated 20 traits that were strongly associated with other traits in the control treatment but retained 13 traits (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>) that were used for the subsequent analysis of the control treatment. We conducted a principal component analysis for this reduced trait set (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). The first two principal components explained 24% and 21%, respectively, of trait variation. PC1 (hereafter called TRAITcPC1) was most strongly positively correlated with above-ground biomass, final stem diameter, and leaf area at time point one and was not significantly different between the ranges (F
