<p id="p0200">We conducted a survival analysis for the drought, mowing, and shade experiment. Survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression, using the coxme function in the coxme R package and the survminer package was used to visualize the results. Range was considered a fixed effect and population was included as a random term. A log likelihood ratio comparing the full and reduce model was used to test the significance of range.</p>
