<p id="p0185">To explore patterns of climate-associated trait divergence as well as divergence among ranges, potentially indicative of local adaptation, we tested population mean trait responses to range (North America and Europe), climate variables, and their interaction in multi- and univariate models (MANOVA/MANCOVA or general linear models). We increased the power of the multivariate analysis (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Scheiner, 2001</xref>) by removing highly correlated traits (Spearman's ρ &gt; 0.7) and calculated the approximate F-statistics and Wilks' λ (multivariate F-value) to measure the strength of the associations. The reproductive traits flowering day and flower head number were only recorded in the control plot, as flowering was highly reduced in the other treatments. Therefore, we analyzed all traits including the reproductive traits from the control treatment only in a model with a main effect of range, and then a separate model including range as well as CLIMPC1 or CLIMPC2 and the interactions. As phenology is strongly affected by local growing season length in many flowering plant species, we also analyzed the control data using latitude as a covariate instead of CLIMPC1 or CLIMPC2. We subsequently removed those reproductive traits and analyzed all treatments (control, herbivory, nutrient), including the effects of treatment, range, and CLIMPC1 or CLIMPC2 as well as all interactions. We also conducted an additional analysis using initial leaf number prior to the onset of the treatments as a covariate to control for any size differences among the ranges that could confound our ability to address the impact of the stress on growth. We improved normality and reduced heteroscedasticity of the data by square root or log transforming traits where appropriate.
