<p id="p0195">We analyzed germination rate using a general linear model using an arcsine square root transformation of mean population germination rate and range as a main effect as well as with and without the covariates in the same manner as above. We did not include these data in the control MANOVA but analyzed them separately since germination rates of field-collected seed could be strongly influenced by the field environment.</p>
