<p id="p0190">We conducted univariate tests of trait population means using general linear models, removing non-significant interactions in the same way as above. We calculated least-squares means and SEs with the package lsmeans and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> tests. To explore differences in climate- or latitude-associated trait clines between ranges as revealed in the analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), we tested for significant two-way interactions between range and the covariates, which is indicative of nonparallel trait-covariate slopes among the ranges. When the interactions with the covariates were significant, to further dissect the extent of trait divergence and its dependence on the covariates, we compared ANCOVA model estimates of traits in the introduced ranges with the native estimates at the minimum and maximum observed covariate values in each range, where the covariate values overlapped. We explored the highest-order significant interactions, using v2 tests with Holm
