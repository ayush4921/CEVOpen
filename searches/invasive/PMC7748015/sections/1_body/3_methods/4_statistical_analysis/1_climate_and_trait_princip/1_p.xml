 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental TableÂ 3</xref>) and added a geographic dimension to the data by including longitude and latitude, with the latter potentially affecting season length and photoperiod. To explore associations between climatic variables in the sampled populations, we applied a principal component analysis using prcomp. We summarized, using the first two principal components, both trait (TRAITPC1 and TRAITPC2) and climate variation (CLIMPC1 and CLIMPC2) among populations using this approach.
