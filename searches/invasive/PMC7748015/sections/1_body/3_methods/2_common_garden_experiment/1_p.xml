<p id="p0165">In July 2009, 20 seeds from five families (i.e., mother plants) from each population were scarified with 100-grit sandpaper, and sown in petri dishes, on damp filter paper soaked with 1% Plant Preservative Mixture (Plant Cell Technology, Washington, DC) to prevent fungal growth during germination. Petri dishes were then placed in a germination chamber set for 30°C, 80% humidity, and 16 h daylight. Radicle emergence was checked on a daily basis and germination success was recorded after 2 weeks. Newly-emerged seedlings were transferred onto a 1:1 sand/soil mixture when root growth reached 1–2 cm in length, and moved to a growth chamber set for 20°C –22°C, 40% humidity, and 16 h daylight. After 1–2 weeks’ acclimation in the growth chamber, when one to two pairs of true leaves were out, young plantlets were transferred into 9-cm pots filled with the same sand/soil mixture (except plants assigned to drought stress, which were transferred into 100% potting soil), and moved to a flood bench at the UBC Horticulture Greenhouse.</p>
