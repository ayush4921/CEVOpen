<p id="p0170">Six individuals from each family (i.e., 30 plants per population from five different mother plants) were randomly assigned to each of six growth conditions: (1) a control, non-stressful condition, (2) a nutrient stress, (3) a light stress, (4) a drought stress, (5) a simulated herbivory, and (6) a mowing treatment. All plants, with the exception of those assigned to the nutrient stress treatment, received 1.5 mL of Osmocote 13-13-13 slow-release fertilizer. The light stress was simulated by growing the plants in a shade box (approximately 4.5 × 3.5 × 1.8 m) made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipes and covered by 121 Lee green filters (Andover, UK) and neutral density shade cloths, to mimic the spectral quality of light that is transmitted through the canopy of neighboring plants (

 <sup>−2</sup>·s
 <sup>−1</sup> based on an average of three measurements taken at noon on sunny days). The drought stress was induced by discontinuing the watering of the plants by elevating the trays over the flood bench. We then measured the time until wilting or death. Herbivory was simulated by clipping off half of each new fully expanded leaf and by spraying 1 mM methyl jasmonate on each plant on a weekly basis. For the mowing experiment, above-ground biomass was cut off at 2 cm above ground on a monthly basis during a timeframe of 8 months, as long as any given plant was able to regenerate. Plants were randomly distributed within each treatment block on the bench, for a total of approximately 200 plants per treatment (20 populations times five individuals per population for each range). Within each block and treatment combination, individuals were randomly assigned to a tray, whose position on the flood bench was randomized every fortnight. All traits measured during the experiment are summarized in
