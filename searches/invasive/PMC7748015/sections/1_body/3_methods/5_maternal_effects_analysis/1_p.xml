<p id="p0205">For the maternal effects analysis, we implemented a similar approach to above. Population means were taken for each treatment and experiment (maternal effects or main experiment). The same maternal lines in the nutrient and control treatments from the main experiment were used for the maternal effects analysis. We then randomly removed a trait if it was highly correlated with another in pairwise comparisons (Spearman's ρ &gt; 0.7). We conducted a MANOVA on the reduced trait set followed by univariate analysis to determine if the greenhouse produced clones and seed-grown maternal plants had similar trait patterns among ranges and treatments. We had three main effects in the model: treatment (control and nutrient), range (introduced and native) and experiment (main and maternal), and all interactions. We removed interactions that were non-significant starting with the highest-order interaction. Maternal effects that affected range and treatment patterns could be reflected in interaction of those effects with experiment. We calculated the approximate F-statistics and Wilks' λ (multivariate F-value) to measure the strength of the associations. For the same traits, we conducted a univariate analysis using general linear models, removing non-significant interactions in the same way as above. We calculated least-squares means and SEs with the package lsmeans and Tukey's HSD
