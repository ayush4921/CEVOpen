<p id="p0130">While the focus of our study was on genetic differences between the native and invaded range, we also found extensive, genetically based phenotypic variation within each range. Some traits, such as final leaf number, stem diameter, and number of flower heads, displayed parallel latitudinal clines in both ranges, which represents strong evidence of local adaptation. Several other traits (e.g., below-ground biomass) were correlated with latitude in one of the ranges only. Final leaf number was the only trait that was significantly correlated with climate in both ranges, although two other traits (SLA and change in leaf number) were found to be associated with climate in the native range. The finding of significant trait evolution in the invaded range is not unusual (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2018</xref>), and offers additional evidence that phenotypic evolution in introduced populations can be surprisingly fast, even in perennials such as Canada thistle, perhaps reflecting the high levels of genetic variation present in the introduced range of this outcrossing species (
