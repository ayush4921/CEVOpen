<p id="p0115">The most prominent explanations for the widely reported pattern of increased growth rate and reproductive output of introduced relative to conspecific native populations involve evolutionary trade-offs with tolerance to biotic (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blossey and Notzold, 1995</xref>) or abiotic stress (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Grime, 1977</xref>). While strong and significant treatment effects were observed in our experiments, no significant trade-offs were identified. In fact, populations from the invaded range significantly out-performed native populations in both the herbivory and nutrient stress treatments; trait means for introduced populations were higher than for native populations in most cases, and significantly so for final leaf number, final stem diameter, and change in leaf number over time. No significant differences in survivorship were seen between introduced and native populations under mowing, drought, and shading, although there was a trend towardÂ greater survivorship of native populations under mowing stress. If improved performance of introduced populations in benign environments evolved through increased resource allocation to growth and reproduction at the expense of stress tolerance, we would predict reduced performance of introduced compared with native populations in at least some of the stressful environments. However, our data do not support this hypothesis.
