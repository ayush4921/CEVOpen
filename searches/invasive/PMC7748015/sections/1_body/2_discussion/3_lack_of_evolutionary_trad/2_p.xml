<p id="p0120">Evolutionary trade-offs with tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stresses have previously been reported for other Compositae weeds, possibly contributing to invasion success. For example, trade-offs with performance under drought stress have been demonstrated in spotted knapweed (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, invasion success of diffuse knapweed has been attributed to an escape from the trade-offs with drought stress that were observed for plants from the native range (
