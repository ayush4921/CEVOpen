 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Cripps et al. (2019)</xref> detected significant genetic variation in response to complete defoliation after three rounds of mowing. We did so as well in terms of survival, but failed to detect significant differences in mortality across the two ranges and therefore cannot ascertain that Canada thistle has evolved along a fitness trade-off. Since Canada thistle repeatedly reallocates its resources between shoot and root, meaning that shoots alternatively serve as source for root elongation or as sink for stem and leaf production (

Irrespective of these considerations, the fact that only half of the individuals died over the course of our experiment indicates that sustained efforts need to be deployed to sufficiently deplete sinks and hence completely eradicate established
