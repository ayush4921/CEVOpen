<p id="p0135">Early studies on Canada thistle reported contradictory results regarding the enemy-release hypothesis. On the one hand, comparative field surveys between Europe (native range) and New Zealand (introduced range) failed to detect significant changes in plant performance between the ranges, despite reduced herbivory in New Zealand (

In the former, plants were not grown in a common garden setup, while the latter may not be representative, for only two populations were investigated per range, only one reciprocal transplant was investigated, and data were not corrected for climatic differences. As a result, neither study is sufficient to support or refute EICA.
