<p id="p0145">Aside from the fact that Canada thistle seems highly tolerant to defoliation, the circumstances where enemy release can be expected and how strong this effect has to be to become advantageous should be considered.

However, such a hypothesis does not hold for other regions, such as New Zealand, where no native thistles were initially present, and even a transient enemy release may suffice for a successful establishment, until (unfruitful) biological controls are deliberately released (
