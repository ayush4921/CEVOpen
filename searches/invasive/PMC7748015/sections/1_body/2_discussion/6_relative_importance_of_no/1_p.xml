<p id="p0150">During invasion, neutral processes can drive patterns of trait differentiation within and between ranges. Founder events and population bottlenecks associated with introductions are expected to reduce variation present in introduced populations and facilitate divergence, at both genetic and phenotypic levels. However, for highly quantitative traits, introduction bottlenecks are expected to lead to more limited change relative to molecular markers (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2018</xref>) as quantitative genetic variation should be less affected by the loss of rare alleles occurring during bottlenecks (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Lewontin, 1965</xref>). Furthermore, common garden data of quantitative traits often identify similar levels of differentiation in the native range as the introduced range (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>) and there is frequent evidence for adaptive trait divergence occurring during invasions (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 2015</xref>). To control for non-adaptive evolution of traits, ancestry using molecular markers can be assessed to partition the amount of trait variation due to non-adaptive evolution between the native and introduced populations (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schrieber et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">van Boheemen et al., 2019b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">McGoey et al., 2020</xref>). Although a study of invasion history using microsatellite markers has been performed in this species (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Guggisberg et al., 2012</xref>), the same populations were not examined between studies, so this analysis was not possible. However, the molecular data have revealed the presence of an introduction bottleneck in North American Canada thistle, although high levels of genetic variation are maintained within and among introduction populations. This likely reflects the outcrossing mating system of the species and multiple introductions from both western and eastern Europe (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Guggisberg et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, it is likely that quantitative trait variation in North America is not strongly limited by invasion history and patterns of divergence between ranges, and trait differentiation with respect to latitude and climate variables reflects to some degree adaptation to local conditions encountered during range expansion. However, future analysis of reciprocal transplant or common garden experiments incorporating population ancestry would be important in further assessing this hypothesis.
