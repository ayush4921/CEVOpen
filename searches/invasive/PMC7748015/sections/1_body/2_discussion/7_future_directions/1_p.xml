<p id="p0155">Canada thistle can reproduce through seed to maintain high levels of genetic diversity, but its primary mode of reproduction is through vegetative growth, since seedlings are poor competitors, which rarely establish in existing pastures characterized by low-light conditions at early life stages (

Accordingly, future studies should concentrate on asexual processes (in particular shoot versus root elongation and resource partitioning/mobilization between shoot and root), to deepen our understanding of below-ground interactions. Since root production depends on the photosynthetic opportunity of shoots, thereby determining shoot population through over-wintering root biomass in the following season (
