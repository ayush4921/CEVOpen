<p id="p0105">Our results show that plants derived from the invaded range of Canada thistle are significantly larger in terms of leaf and shoot production than those from the native range when grown in a common garden. In addition, several phenotypic traits were found to co-vary with latitude or climate in a similar way across both ranges, suggestive of parallel local adaptation. However, we failed to find evidence to support our hypothesis that evolutionary trade-offs between performance and tolerance to abiotic or biotic stress contribute to invasion success in the introduced range, as introduced populations tended to perform equivalently or better than native populations across treatments. This is despite the fact that we tested a wide range of stress treatments in controlled common gardens.</p>
