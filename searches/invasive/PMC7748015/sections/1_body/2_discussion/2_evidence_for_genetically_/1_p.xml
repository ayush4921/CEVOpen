<p id="p0110">Many previous studies have reported that plants from populations in the introduced range of a species are larger, grow faster, and are more fecund than those from conspecific populations in the native range (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>). While some such reports may not be reliable because of a failure to account for sources of within-range variation (e.g., latitude) or maternal effects, the overall pattern remains (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et al., 2009</xref>). Our results are consistent with this previous work; after controlling for latitude and climate variation, we found evidence of significant phenotypic differentiation between native and introduced populations. Therefore, the trait differences that we observed between the ranges are unlikely to be due solely to local adaptation to differential climate conditions within each range. While the differentiation between the ranges was mainly driven by significant increases in stem diameter and leaf number in populations from the introduced range, it is noteworthy that, in most cases, for performance-related traits (e.g., biomass and flower head production), means in the introduced populations exceeded those in the native populations. Lastly, our experiments showed that trait variation was not significantly affected by maternal environment, although our maternal effects experiment was likely underpowered. Thus, we can conclude that the differentiation in quantitative traits reported here is likely genetically based.
