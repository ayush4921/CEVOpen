<p id="p0035">To test the trade-off hypotheses outlined above, and to look for evidence of rapid adaptation to local habitats in introduced Canada thistle, we asked the following specific questions: (1) is there evidence of genetic differentiation of quantitative traits between native and introduced populations? (2) Do introduced populations have enhanced performance in benign conditions, and is this performance advantage eliminated or reversed under stressful environments? (3) Are there parallel patterns of adaptation to climate within each range? (4) Are trait differences between ranges likely due to maternal effects or are they rather caused by genetic differentiation? To address these questions, we collected seeds from across the introduced North American and the native European range, grew them in benign (control) and stressful conditions (nutrient stress, shading, simulated herbivory, drought, and mowing) in the glasshouse, and measured a number of performance-related traits.</p>
