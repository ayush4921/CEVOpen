<p id="p0025">Studies of rapid trait evolution in invasive species run in opposition to the classic view of evolution as a slow process. However, evolutionary change during invasion can result from both adaptive and non-adaptive processes (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, shifts in resource allocation are not the only explanation for trait divergence between the native and introduced ranges. For instance, inter- or intraspecific hybridization in the introduced range could lead to enhanced performance (

 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Schierenbeck and Ellstrand, 2008</xref>). Low densities experienced during rapid range expansion can lead to selection for increased investment in reproduction (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Burton et al., 2010</xref>), potentially contributing to variation within the invaded range as well as differences between the ranges. Similarly, adaptation to heterogeneous environments (e.g., local adaptation to climate) within the native and/or introduced ranges can potentially produce patterns of trait divergence consistent with EICA (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>). Therefore, a broad population sampling, and the inclusion of climate-associated variables in the analysis, are important in assessing likely drivers of trait differentiation between the ranges using common gardens.
