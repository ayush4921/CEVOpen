 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Richardson and Pyšek, 2006</xref>) and species abundant in resource-rich habitats often exhibit invasive traits like rapid growth rates (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, as an extension of this hypothesis, we predict that in benign common gardens invasive populations should have improved performance compared with native populations, but under resource-limited conditions this advantage should be lost. Several species in the Asteraceae have enhanced size and reproduction in introduced compared with native populations in control common gardens, while abiotic stressors (mainly drought) have reduced and even reversed this performance advantage (

 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). Biotic shifts can also contribute to increased resource abundance in the introduced range facilitating the evolution of invasiveness. This appears to be the case in invasive yellow star thistle where the loss of native species in California grasslands has reduced competition for water resources, facilitating the evolution of larger plants with reduced drought tolerance (
