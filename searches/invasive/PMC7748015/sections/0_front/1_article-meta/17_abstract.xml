 <p>Trade-offs between performance and stress tolerance have been invoked to explain often-observed size differences between native and introduced populations and even the success of invasive species. This study conducts extensive common garden experiments in invasive Canada thistle to investigate this hypothesis. Although this study provides evidence for rapid adaptation of introduced populations, it does not support hypotheses invoking the evolution of invasiveness in response to less stressful biotic and abiotic environments.</p>
