Canada thistle seeds collected from across the introduced North American and the native European range were grown in benign and stressful conditions (nutrient stress, shading, simulated herbivory, drought, and mowing), to evaluate whether native and introduced individuals differ in performance or stress tolerance. An additional experiment assessed the strength of maternal effects by comparing plants derived from field-collected seeds with those derived from clones grown in the glasshouse. Introduced populations tended to be larger in size, but no trade-off of stress tolerance with performance was detected; introduced populations had either superior performance or equivalent trait values and survivorship in the treatment common gardens. We also detected evidence of parallel latitudinal clines of some traits in both the native and introduced ranges and associations with climate variables in some treatments, consistent with recent climate adaptation within the introduced range. Our results are consistent with rapid adaptation of introduced populations, but, contrary to predictions, the evolution of invasive traits did not come at the cost of reduced stress tolerance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Trade-offs between performance and stress tolerance have been invoked to explain often-observed size differences between native and introduced populations and even the success of invasive species.

Assessing trait evolution in introduced species is important because functional traits can influence demographic parameters essential for invasion success. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in identifying trait differences between native and invaded ranges, to try and understand if and when evolutionary changes might causally drive invasion (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Th&#x000e9;baud and Simberloff, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hinz and Schwarzlaender, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bossdorf et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Although many invasive species are typically found within similar climatic envelopes in the introduced range as the native range (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Petitpierre et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Atwater et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>), the biotic environment is expected to show substantial differences (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Keane and Crawley, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Because of this, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blossey and Notzold (1995)</xref> hypothesized that escape from natural enemies in the introduced range should drive allocation of resources away from defense to growth or reproduction, resulting in the evolution of invasive traits (evolution of increased competitive ability&#x000a0;[EICA]). Specifically, they predicted that introduced populations should evolve to produce more biomass than native populations and that specialist herbivores will experience improved performance on introduced populations relative to native ones. Many common garden experiments comparing native and introduced populations have sought to test the EICA hypothesis (for reviews see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bossdorf et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Orians and Ward, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Evolutionary shifts in reproduction, growth, defense, and competitive ability have been identified in many cases (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>), although only size seems to frequently increase during invasion, resulting in limited general support for the EICA hypothesis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal and Hufbauer, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Enhanced resources in the introduced range may also facilitate the evolution of faster growth and greater size, which may come at a cost to abiotic stress tolerance (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Grime, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, increased resource availability can enhance invasion (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Davis et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Richardson and Py&#x00161;ek, 2006</xref>) and species abundant in resource-rich habitats often exhibit invasive traits like rapid growth rates (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Leishman et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Rejmanek and Richardson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, as an extension of this hypothesis, we predict that in benign common gardens invasive populations should have improved performance compared with native populations, but under resource-limited conditions this advantage should be lost. Several species in the Asteraceae have enhanced size and reproduction in introduced compared with native populations in control common gardens, while abiotic stressors (mainly drought) have reduced and even reversed this performance advantage (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins and Rieseberg, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Turner et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; but see&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Turner et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Biotic shifts can also contribute to increased resource abundance in the introduced range facilitating the evolution of invasiveness. This appears to be the case in invasive yellow star thistle where the loss of native species in California grasslands has reduced competition for water resources, facilitating the evolution of larger plants with reduced drought tolerance (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">Studies of rapid trait evolution in invasive species run in opposition to the classic&#x000a0;view of evolution as a slow process. However, evolutionary change during invasion can result from both adaptive and non-adaptive processes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, shifts in resource allocation are not the only explanation for trait divergence between the native and introduced ranges. For instance, inter- or intraspecific hybridization in the introduced range could lead to enhanced performance (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Rieseberg et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Schierenbeck and Ellstrand, 2008</xref>). Low densities experienced during rapid range expansion can lead to selection for increased investment in reproduction (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Burton et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), potentially contributing to variation within the invaded range as well as differences between the ranges. Similarly, adaptation to heterogeneous environments (e.g., local adaptation to climate) within the native and/or introduced ranges can potentially produce patterns of trait divergence consistent with EICA (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>). Therefore, a broad population sampling, and the inclusion of climate-associated variables in the analysis, are important in assessing likely drivers of trait differentiation between the ranges using common gardens.</p><p id="p0030"><italic>Cirsium arvense</italic> (L.)

(2) Do introduced populations have enhanced performance in benign conditions, and is this performance advantage eliminated or reversed under stressful environments? (3) Are there parallel patterns of adaptation to climate within each range? (4) Are trait differences between ranges likely due to maternal effects or are they rather caused by genetic differentiation? To address these questions, we collected seeds from across the introduced North American and the native European range, grew them in benign (control) and stressful conditions (nutrient stress, shading, simulated herbivory, drought, and mowing) in the glasshouse, and measured a number of performance-related traits.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Climate Analysis</title><p id="p0040">We conducted a principal component analysis of the bioclimatic variables downloaded from WorldClim for our sampled populations (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>).

In addition, several phenotypic traits were found to co-vary with latitude or climate in a similar way across both ranges, suggestive of parallel local adaptation. However, we failed to find evidence to support our hypothesis that evolutionary trade-offs between performance and tolerance to abiotic or biotic stress contribute to invasion success in the introduced range, as introduced populations tended to perform equivalently or better than native populations across treatments. This is despite the fact that we tested a wide range of stress treatments in controlled common gardens.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Evidence for Genetically Based Trait Differentiation of Traits between Ranges</title><p id="p0110">Many previous studies have reported that plants from populations in the introduced range of a species are larger, grow faster, and are more fecund than those from conspecific populations in the native range (reviewed in <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>). While some such reports may not be reliable because of a failure to account for sources of within-range variation (e.g., latitude) or maternal effects, the overall pattern remains (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Our results are consistent with this previous work; after controlling for latitude and climate variation, we found evidence of significant phenotypic differentiation between native and introduced populations. Therefore, the trait differences that we observed between the ranges are unlikely to be due solely to local adaptation to differential climate conditions within each range. While the differentiation between the ranges was mainly driven by significant increases in stem diameter and leaf number in populations from the introduced range, it is noteworthy that, in most cases, for performance-related traits (e.g., biomass and flower head production), means in the introduced populations exceeded those in the native populations. Lastly, our experiments showed that trait variation was not significantly affected by maternal environment, although our maternal effects experiment was likely underpowered. Thus, we can conclude that the differentiation in quantitative traits reported here is likely genetically based.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Lack of Evolutionary Trade-Offs in Introduced Populations</title><p id="p0115">The most prominent explanations for the widely reported pattern of increased growth rate and reproductive output of introduced relative to conspecific native populations involve evolutionary trade-offs with tolerance to biotic (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blossey and Notzold, 1995</xref>) or abiotic stress (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Grime, 1977</xref>). While strong and significant treatment effects were observed in our experiments, no significant trade-offs were identified. In fact, populations from the invaded range significantly out-performed native populations in both the herbivory and nutrient stress treatments; trait means for introduced populations were higher than for native populations in most cases, and significantly so for final leaf number, final stem diameter, and change in leaf number over time. No significant differences in survivorship were seen between introduced and native populations under mowing, drought, and shading, although there was a trend toward&#x000a0;greater survivorship of native populations under mowing stress. If improved performance of introduced populations in benign environments evolved through increased resource allocation to growth and reproduction at the expense of stress tolerance, we would predict reduced performance of introduced compared with native populations in at least some of the stressful environments.

For example, trade-offs with performance under drought stress have been demonstrated in spotted knapweed (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), common ragweed (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins and Rieseberg, 2011</xref>), weedy sunflowers (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mayrose et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), and star thistle (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, invasion success of diffuse knapweed has been attributed to an escape from the trade-offs with drought stress that were observed for plants from the native range (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Turner et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Trade-offs with biotic stress, consistent with the EICA hypothesis, have also been reported in some Compositae weeds, including weedy sunflowers (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mayrose et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), dandelion (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Teuber et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>), star thistle (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), and common ragweed (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Fukano and Yahara, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Roderick, 2019</xref>). However, other studies of Compositae weeds have failed to fully support the EICA hypothesis (e.g., <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Hull-Sanders, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Turner et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">van Boheemen et&#x000a0;al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p id="p0125">So why do we not detect abiotic or biotic trade-offs with tolerance to either abiotic or biotic stress in Canada thistle? One possibility is that there is a trade-off with survivorship under mowing stress, but our experiment lacked the power necessary to demonstrate this. Another possibility is that we studied the wrong stresses. The EICA hypothesis predicts that introduced plant species will be released from native specialist predators, but here we simulated herbivory, which might not accurately represent the effects of specialist herbivores (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blossey and Notzold, 1995</xref>). For example, leaf trichome/spine densities have been shown to reduce the performance of a specialized herbivore on Canada thistle (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Cripps et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), but we did not assay variation in leaf trichome/spine densities in our experiment. Alternatively, it might be that tolerance to different stresses in Canada thistle is largely uncoupled from performance, similar to that reported for introduced populations of diffuse knapweed (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Turner et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Such decoupling is often reported in cultivated germplasm (e.g., <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Fereres et&#x000a0;al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ali et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Gao et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) and is prized by plant breeders. Mechanistically, this can occur in different ways. Some stress resistance traits may be able to evolve independently of general resource use and growth potential or yield (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chapin et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Munns, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Sadras and Richards, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, decoupling can be associated with inducible resistance responses (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Sato et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), which are less costly than constitutive resistance mechanisms. This explanation is supported by transcriptomic studies, which show that native and introduced populations of Canada thistle differ with regard to inducible R-gene defense and sensitivity in response to abiotic stresses (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Guggisberg et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Signs of (Parallel) Local Adaptation</title><p id="p0130">While the focus of our study was on genetic differences between the native and invaded range, we also found extensive, genetically based phenotypic variation within each range. Some traits, such as final leaf number, stem diameter, and number of flower heads, displayed parallel latitudinal clines in both ranges, which represents strong evidence of local adaptation. Several other traits (e.g., below-ground biomass) were correlated with latitude in one of the ranges only. Final leaf number was the only trait that was significantly correlated with climate in both ranges, although two other traits (SLA and change in leaf number) were found to be associated with climate in the native range. The finding of significant trait evolution in the invaded range is not unusual (reviewed in <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), and offers additional evidence that phenotypic evolution in introduced populations can be surprisingly fast, even in perennials such as Canada thistle, perhaps reflecting the high levels of genetic variation present in the introduced range of this outcrossing species (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Guggisberg et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Comparisons with Previous Studies on Canada Thistle</title><p id="p0135">Early studies on Canada thistle reported contradictory results regarding the enemy-release hypothesis. On the one hand, comparative field surveys between Europe (native range) and New Zealand (introduced range) failed to detect significant changes in plant performance between the ranges, despite reduced herbivory in New Zealand (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cripps et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, a common garden experiment aimed at comparing the fitness of European (native) and North American (introduced) populations of <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic> in the absence of natural enemies in the home range suggested that introduced genotypes always produced more above- and below-ground biomass than their native counterparts, irrespective of the nutrient regime, which is consistent with our finding of increased performance of introduced populations for some traits (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abela-HofbPauerov&#x000e1; and M&#x000fc;nzbergov&#x000e1;, 2011</xref>). In the former, plants were not grown in a common garden setup, while the latter may not be representative, for only two populations were investigated per range, only one reciprocal transplant was investigated, and data were not corrected for climatic differences. As a result, neither study is sufficient to support or refute EICA.</p><p id="p0140"><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Cripps et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> detected significant genetic variation in response to complete defoliation after three rounds of mowing. We did so as well in terms of survival, but failed to detect significant differences in mortality across the two ranges and therefore cannot ascertain that Canada thistle has evolved along a fitness trade-off. Since Canada thistle repeatedly reallocates its resources between shoot and root, meaning that shoots alternatively serve as source for root elongation or as sink for stem and leaf production (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Donald, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Leathwick and Bourd&#x000f4;t, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Verwijst et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), the timing and strength (i.e., frequency) of mowing are of utmost importance&#x000a0;if differential responses between native and introduced populations are to be expected. Irrespective of these considerations, the fact that only half of the individuals died over the course of our experiment indicates that sustained efforts need to be deployed to sufficiently deplete sinks and hence completely eradicate established <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic>.</p><p id="p0145">Aside from the fact that Canada thistle seems highly tolerant to defoliation, the circumstances where enemy release can be expected and how strong this effect has to be to become advantageous should be considered. <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic> encountered a large guild of putative enemies upon its introduction to North America, because this continent sustains 92 indigenous <italic>Cirsium</italic> species with their suite of Cardueae-specialized herbivores (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Hill and Kotanen, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Cripps et&#x000a0;al., 2011a</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>). However, such a hypothesis does not hold for other regions, such as New Zealand, where no native thistles were initially present, and even a transient enemy release may suffice for a successful establishment, until (unfruitful) biological controls are deliberately released (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Nunes and Kotanen, 2018</xref>). A recent study by <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Nunes and Kotanen (2017)</xref> further indicates that below-ground herbivory has a stronger (negative) impact on plant performance than above-ground herbivory and should therefore be examined more deeply in the future.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Relative Importance of Non-adaptive Trait Evolution in Introduced Range</title><p id="p0150">During invasion, neutral processes can drive patterns of trait differentiation within and between ranges. Founder events and population bottlenecks associated with introductions are expected to reduce variation present in introduced populations and facilitate divergence, at both genetic and phenotypic levels. However, for highly quantitative traits, introduction bottlenecks are expected to lead to more limited change relative to molecular markers (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) as quantitative genetic variation should be less affected by the loss of rare alleles occurring during bottlenecks (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Lewontin, 1965</xref>). Furthermore, common garden data of quantitative traits often identify similar levels of differentiation in the native range as the introduced range (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau, 2015</xref>) and there is frequent evidence for adaptive trait divergence occurring during invasions (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bock et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). To control for non-adaptive evolution of traits, ancestry using molecular markers can be assessed to partition the amount of trait variation due to non-adaptive evolution between the native and introduced populations (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Schrieber et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">van Boheemen et&#x000a0;al., 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">McGoey et al., 2020</xref>). Although a study of invasion history using microsatellite markers has been performed in this species (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Guggisberg et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), the same populations were not examined between studies, so this analysis was not possible. However, the molecular data have revealed the presence of an introduction bottleneck in North American Canada thistle, although high levels of genetic variation are maintained within and among introduction populations. This likely reflects the outcrossing mating system of the species and multiple introductions from both western and eastern Europe (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Guggisberg et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, it is likely that quantitative trait variation in North America is not strongly limited by invasion history and patterns of divergence between ranges, and trait differentiation with respect to latitude and climate variables reflects to some degree adaptation to local conditions encountered during range expansion. However, future analysis of reciprocal transplant or common garden experiments incorporating population ancestry would be important in further assessing this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>Future Directions</title><p id="p0155">Canada thistle can reproduce through seed to maintain high levels of genetic diversity, but its primary mode of reproduction is through vegetative growth, since seedlings are poor competitors, which rarely establish in existing pastures characterized by low-light conditions at early life stages (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Moore, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Donald, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Heimann and Cussans, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Leathwick and Bourd&#x000f4;t, 2012</xref>).
