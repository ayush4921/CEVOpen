 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> (Asteraceae) (hereinafter 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>) is native to Central and South America and was introduced into China in 1919 (Holm, Plucknett, Pancho, &amp; Herberger, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). At present, 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> is distributed widely in Guangdong province in South China where it is invasive (Zhang, Ye, Cao, &amp; Feng, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). 
 <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> (hereinafter 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic>) is native to China and occurs in the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China (Wang, Wang, &amp; Liao, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). As a holoparasitic plant, 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> acquires some or all of its water, carbon, and nutrients via the vascular tissue of the hosts' roots or shoots, which significantly inhibits growth of the host. Previous field observations and greenhouse experiments showed that 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> preferentially parasitized 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> relative to native plants, which significantly reduced growth and cover of the invader and facilitated native species diversity in invaded patches (Shen, Hong, Ye, Cao, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The native plant 
 <italic>Coix lacryma‐jobi</italic> (Poaceae) (hereinafter 
 <italic>Coix</italic>) was chosen for this experiment because it was the most common native species that co‐occurred with 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> in the invaded community. Results of a previous field survey suggest that parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> may reduce competitive exclusion of 
 <italic>Coix</italic> by 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
