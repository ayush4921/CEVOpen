<p>We collected soil from a field near Dengshuiling village. Ten 1 m × 1 m plots were chosen randomly in an abandoned agricultural field site without 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. Vegetation and litter were removed from the upper soil surface, and then, soil (red clay) was collected at depths of 0–15 cm from the plots. The soil was mixed with sand (3:1, soil/sand) and homogenized before use. This mixture enabled us to maintain good drainage and accurately harvest roots at the end of the experiment.
