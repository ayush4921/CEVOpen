<p>We obtained stem cuttings of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> from multiple maternal families in a field near Dengshuiling village on 16 July 2006 and then propagated them for use in the experimental setup described below. Sharp pruning shears (sterilized with 70% ethanol) were used to generate the cuttings from upper intact plant parts. Each cutting measured 10 cm in length, and its leaf count was reduced by a half to reduce water loss upon transplant. The cuttings were then inserted into a potted soil (up to a third of the entire length), with the stem maintained in a vertical orientation. 
 <italic>Coix</italic> was raised from seeds that had been purchased from Shandong Heze Chinese Medicine Institute in March 2006. In order to eliminate any pathogen that might have been present on the 
 <italic>Coix</italic> seeds, the seeds were surface‐sterilized as follows. The seeds were immersed in 20% CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> for 10 min and later soaked in water for 24 hr, 70% ethanol for 1 min, water again for 5 min, 10% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 min, and finally rinsed with sterilized water three times (see Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In June 2006, we sowed similar‐sized seeds in plastic‐plug trays filled with soil of the same source as above. The soil was sterilized before use to prevent any microbes present in the soil from influencing early growth of 
 <italic>Coix</italic> seedlings and 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> cuttings.
