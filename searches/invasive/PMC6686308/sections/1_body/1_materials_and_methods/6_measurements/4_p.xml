<p>We also determined whether bactericide application had suppressed soil bacteria in the experimental soil material. To do so, we obtained soil samples from individual experimental pots after the plants had been harvested. The soil samples were then stored at 4°C and transported to the laboratory immediately. The soil was then sieved using a sterilized 2‐mm sieve to remove any debris. The number of colony‐forming units (CFUs) in each soil sample was then directly calculated using acridine orange fluorescent staining method under DMLS Fluorescence microscope (Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH Mikroskopie und Histologie; Li &amp; Jin,
