<p>We terminated the experiment at the end of week seven. We then separated 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> from 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and harvested individual 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic> plants separately. We separated roots and shoots of the experimental plants and then dried them to a constant biomass at 80°C for 48 hr. We then determined total biomass (root and shoot) of the dried plant materials.
