<p>At harvest, we determined whether fungicide application had suppressed soil fungi by examining root colonization of all the experimental 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic> plants by AM fungi. We did this before the plant materials were oven‐dried. From each individual plant, we obtained fine roots that were then cut into 1‐cm‐long segments and fixed using formalin/acetic acid/alcohol (FAA) fixative solution. Root samples were cleaned with 10% KOH solution at 90°C for 40 min, acidified in 2% HCl for 5 min, stained with 0.01% acid fuchsin (Kormanik, Bryan, &amp; Schultz, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1980</xref>), and then observed under a microscope for presence of AM fungi. We considered a root segment to have AM fungi when it had arbuscules in the cortical cells. For every individual plant, we then determined percentage colonization by AM fungi as follows: AM fungi colonization (%) = 100 × (infected root length/observed root length).
