<p>We used a three‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test whether parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> (three levels: no parasitism, light parasitism, and heavy parasitism), soil fungi (suppressed vs. not suppressed), and soil bacteria (suppressed vs. not suppressed) had main and interactive effects on biomass yield of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic>. Parasitism, fungicide, and bactericide were specified as independent variables, while total biomass of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic> (root and shoot combined) was specified as a dependent variable. We also used ANOVA to test whether colonization of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic> roots by AM fungi differed significantly between fungicide treatments, and whether the number of soil bacteria differed between bactericide treatments. In the cases where there were significant main and interactive effects of parasitism, soil fungi, and soil bacteria on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic>, root colonization by AM fungi, and the number of CFUs of soil bacteria, we performed post hoc least‐squares means comparisons between the treatment levels (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.05%). All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS v.16.0. All the figures were generated in Sigma Plot v.11.0.
