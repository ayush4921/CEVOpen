<p>To test whether parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> interacted with soil fungi and bacteria to influence competitive interactions between 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic>, we performed a factorial pot experiment. In the experiment, we grew an individual 
 <italic>Coix</italic> in competition with 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (parasitized vs. not parasitized), and when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed versus not suppressed. In late July 2006, individual 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> cuttings and 
 <italic>Coix</italic> seedlings (each measured 
 <italic>c</italic>. 15 cm in length) that had been raised as described above were carefully removed from the nursery without destroying the roots and transplanted into 3‐L pots (25 cm in diameter) that had been filled with nonsterilized soil from the same source as above. Within the pot, 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Coix</italic> were spaced 15 cm apart. Immediately after transplant, the pots were placed under a shade tree to avoid excess evapotranspiration. Then, three days later, the pots were moved to an open‐ field common garden. A week after transplant, bamboo sticks (1 m long) were driven into the soil near 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to provide support because 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> is a climber species. The plants were fertilized with 50% strength Hoagland's nutrient solution once a week. Throughout the experiment, the plants were watered twice a day with tap water.
