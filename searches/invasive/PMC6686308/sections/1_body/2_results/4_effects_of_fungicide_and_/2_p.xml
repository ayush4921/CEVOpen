<p>The addition of fungicide significantly reduced colonization of 
 <italic>Coix</italic> and 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> roots by AM fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a,b; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Fungicide application modified the effect of 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> on colonization of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> roots by AM fungi (significant two‐way interaction: parasitism × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). When fungicide was not applied, light and heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> had similar effects on colonization by AM fungi, although both parasitism levels caused significant declines in colonization relative to no parasitism (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). However, when fungicide was applied, colonization by AM fungi was similar across parasitism levels (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Application of bactericide modified the joint effects of fungicide and parasitism on colonization of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by AM fungi (significant three‐way interaction: parasitism × bactericide × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> experienced the highest level of colonization (58%) in the absence of parasitism and when fungicide and bactericide were not applied (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In contrast, colonization was lowest when both fungicide and bactericide were applied (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). For 
 <italic>Coix</italic>, parasitism and bactericide did not influence root colonization by AM fungi (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Similar to the effects of fungicide on colonization by AM fungi, the addition of bactericide significantly reduced the number of CFUs of soil bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Addition of fungicide modified the effect of bactericide on the number of CFUs (significant two‐way interaction: bactericide × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). When bactericide was not added, the number of CFUs was similar between pots where fungicide was applied and in pots without fungicide (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). However, when bactericide was applied, pots without fungicide had significantly higher number of CFUs than pots with fungicide (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> influenced the effects of both fungicide and bactericide on the numbers of CFUs (significant three‐way interaction: parasitism × bactericide × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). The mean number of CFUs was highest (5.37 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/g wet soil) when 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was subjected to heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and when fungicide was added but bactericide not added to the pot (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). However, the mean number of CFUs was lowest (2.97 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/g wet soil) when neither fungicide nor bactericide was added to the pot and in the presence of light parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).
