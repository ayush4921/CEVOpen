<p>Biomass of the native plant 
 <italic>Coix</italic> was significantly higher in treatments where 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was parasitized (light and heavy) than in the absence of parasitism (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Suppression of soil bacteria caused a significant increase in 
 <italic>Coix</italic> biomass (significant main effect of bactericide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). However, suppression of fungi caused a significant decline in 
 <italic>Coix</italic> biomass (significant main effect of fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Joint suppression of fungi and parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> influenced 
 <italic>Coix</italic> biomass (significant two‐way interaction: parasitism × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). When the full complement of soil fungi was present, 
 <italic>Coix</italic> produced similar biomass under light and heavy levels of parasitism (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). However, when fungi were suppressed, 
 <italic>Coix</italic> produced significantly higher biomass when 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was heavily parasitized than in the absence of parasitism and under light parasitism (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). 
 <italic>Coix</italic> biomass was also influenced by the joint effects of parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and soil fungi and bacteria (significant three‐way interaction: parasitism × bactericide × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). 
 <italic>Coix</italic> experienced the greatest gain in biomass (163.6%) when 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was heavily parasitized and in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). In contrast, 
 <italic>Coix</italic> experienced a marginal gain in biomass when either fungi or bacteria were suppressed despite heavy parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e).
