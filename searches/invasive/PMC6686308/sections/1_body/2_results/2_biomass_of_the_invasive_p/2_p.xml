<p>Parasitism by

 <italic>Mikania</italic> significantly reduced biomass of the invader (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). However, heavy and light parasitism caused similar declines in biomass (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Suppression of soil bacteria improved 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass, although not significantly (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> produced more biomass when soil fungi were suppressed than when not suppressed (significant main effect of fungicide Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Soil fungi and bacteria modified the effects of parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (significant two‐way interactions: parasitism × bactericide; parasitism × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c,d; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). In the presence of a full complement of soil bacteria (bactericide not applied), light and heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> reduced 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass by 62% and 79%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). However, when bacteria were suppressed (bactericide applied), light and heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> reduced 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass by 31% and 66%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Similarly, in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi (fungicide not applied), light and heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> reduced 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass by 68% and 72%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). On the other hand, when fungi were suppressed (fungicide applied), light and heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> reduced 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass by 35% and 75%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Soil bacteria influenced the effect of soil fungi on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass (significant interaction between bactericide and fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). When bacteria were not suppressed, 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> produced more biomass when fungi were suppressed than when not suppressed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). However, when bacteria were suppressed, the opposite pattern was observed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Bacteria and fungi jointly influenced the suppressive effects of 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (significant three‐way interaction: parasitism × bactericide × fungicide; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35407-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> caused the greatest decline in 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass (−85.3%) when fungi were suppressed while bacteria were not suppressed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f).
