<p>The factorial manipulation of soil fungi and bacteria and parasitism on the invasive plant 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by a native holoparasite 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> permitted us to measure the relative strengths and combined effects of parasitism and soil microbial community on interaction between an invasive plant and a co‐occurring native plant. Parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> caused a significant decline in biomass of the invader, although the magnitude of impact was modified by the presence of fungi and bacteria in the soil. More specifically, heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> caused the greatest reduction in 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> biomass when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). In contrast, the co‐occurring native plant 
 <italic>Coix</italic> experienced the greatest gain in biomass when 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was heavily parasitized and in the presence of a full complement of soil bacteria and fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> had the highest level of root colonization by AM fungi in the absence of parasitism and in the presence of a full complement of soil bacteria and fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In contrast, colonization of 
 <italic>Coix</italic> by AM fungi was not influenced by parasitism on its competitor 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> or by the presence of soil bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Heavy parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and suppression of soil fungi stimulated bacterial growth in the experimental pots (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Overall, these results suggest that heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and soil bacteria had synergistic negative effects on growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, while the co‐occurring 
 <italic>Coix</italic> benefitted under the same growth conditions. More broadly, the results suggest that native parasitic plants and soil microorganisms can synergistically facilitate coexistence of native plants with invasive plants. Through selective patterns of parasitism by native parasitic plants and in the presence of soil microbes, susceptible invasive hosts may exhibit diminished competitive ability, while co‐occurring nonhost (or less preferred) native species increase in dominance.
