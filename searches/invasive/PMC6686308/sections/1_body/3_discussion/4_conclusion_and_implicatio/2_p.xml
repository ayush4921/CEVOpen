<p>We found that the native holoparasitic plant 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and soil microbes had synergistic suppressive effects on growth of the invader 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, while the native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> benefitted from such interactions. Our results suggest that 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> may be used in combination with soil microbes to control 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. Practitioners of classical biological are often faced with the challenge of achieving a successful control of invaders at minimal environmental cost (Müller‐Schärer &amp; Schaffner, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Therefore, the native 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> may be a viable alternative to importation of new species to control 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. However, as the soil fungi and bacteria modified the effect of 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic>, the identity and impact of the soil microbial community should be an important consideration. Thus, we suggest that future studies should identify the lineage‐specific soil‐borne pathogens and mutualists that may be useful in management of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> in combination with 
 <italic>Cuscusta</italic>.
