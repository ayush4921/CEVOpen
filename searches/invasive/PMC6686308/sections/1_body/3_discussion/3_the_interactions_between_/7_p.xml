<p>It is also likely that the fungicide contributed to an increase in the number of CFUs of soil bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) by suppressing competitive effects of soil fungi on bacteria. Intermicrobial competition occurs in many natural ecosystems and may arise due to limiting nutrients and space, resulting in the reduced growth of some species, and a change in microbial community composition (Bell, Callender, Whyte, &amp; Greer, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). This may feedback on plant growth because different components of the microbial community may exert differential effects on plant growth (Bever, Platt, &amp; Morton, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Competitive interactions between fungi and soil bacteria have been observed (Fitter &amp; Garbaye, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Liu, Yu, Xie, &amp; Staehelin, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). For instance, suppression of pathogenic fungi (
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>) by application of fungicides promoted activities of nitrogen‚Äêfixing bacteria in the roots of 
 <italic>Ormosia glaberrima</italic> seedlings (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Hence, it is likely that in our case, the fungicide suppressed soil fungi, which in turn freed the soil bacteria from fungal competition.
