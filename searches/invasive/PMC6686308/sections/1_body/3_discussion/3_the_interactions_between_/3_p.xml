 <italic>Mikania</italic> had the highest level of root colonization by AM fungi in the absence of parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). This result supports findings on other study systems that infection by parasitic plants can reduce root colonization by AM fungi (Davies &amp; Graves, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Gehring &amp; Whitham, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>; McKibben &amp; Henning, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The causal mechanism might be a reduced carbon availability (Davies &amp; Graves, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Given that AM fungi and parasitic plants are both carbon sinks (Davies &amp; Graves, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>), dual infection could lead to the AM fungi and parasitic plants competing for carbon from the host plant. If the parasitic plant is a superior competitor, the reduction in available carbon resources may feedback to disrupt interactions between the host plant and fungal mutualists of the plant (Davies &amp; Graves, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Press &amp; Phoenix, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Stewart &amp; Press, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). In support of this, biomass production in 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> plants parasitized by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> was significantly reduced relative to nonparasitized 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f), suggesting that 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> suppressed the AM fungi through a reduction in the available carbon. Future mechanistic experiments should directly test whether parasitism on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> reduces carbon allocation to AM fungi.
