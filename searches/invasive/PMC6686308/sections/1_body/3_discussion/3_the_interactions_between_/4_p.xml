<p>Colonization of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> roots by AM fungi was lowest in the presence of parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In contrast, for the native plant 
 <italic>Coix</italic> that grew with 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> in the same pot, only fungicide application reduced root colonization by AM fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). These contrasting results could be explained both by the absence of parasitism on 
 <italic>Coix</italic> by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and suppressive effects of the fungicide and bactericide. As 
 <italic>Coix</italic> was not parasitized, there was no possibility of 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> indirectly reducing colonization of 
 <italic>Coix</italic> roots by the AM fungi through competition for carbon. On the other hand, suppression of AM fungi in 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> roots could have been caused by the direct effect of fungicide and indirectly through competition from 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> for carbon. However, whether the bactericide contributed to the decline in AM fungal colonization of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> roots indirectly through altered host plant physiology or by acting directly on the fungi remains to be resolved.
