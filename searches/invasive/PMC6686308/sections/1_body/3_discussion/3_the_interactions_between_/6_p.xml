<p>The number of CFUs of soil bacteria was highest when 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was heavily parasitized by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and the soil fungi suppressed and in the presence of a full complement of soil bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). These findings support the idea that the impacts of parasitic plants on their hosts can trigger indirect interactions between parasitic plants and other species in the community (Pennings &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). It is likely that heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> caused an increase in 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> root exudates that in turn promoted bacterial growth in the soil. Root‐derived exudates are a major source of carbon and nutrients for soil bacterial community (Dennis, Miller, &amp; Hirsch, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). It is thought that parasitized hosts may increase allocation of resources into the roots, but evidence is scarce and conflicting (Quested, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In a mixed grassland community, infection by a root hemiparasite 
 <italic>R. minor</italic> stimulated the activity of belowground decomposers, which was attributed to enhanced supply of substrates because the host's root exudation increased (Bardgett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). The same study reported a reduced fungal‐to‐bacterial ratio in the presence of the hemiparasite (Bardgett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Soil heterotrophic microbial communities tended to become more abundant and functionally even beneath 
 <italic>Pinus nigra</italic> trees that were parasitized by mistletoe (
 <italic>Viscum album</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>austriacum</italic>) than beneath nonparasitized trees (Mellado, Morillas, Gallardo, &amp; Zamora, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In contrast, parasitism by 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> caused a decrease in soil microbial biomass and altered functional diversity of soil microbial communities underneath the invader (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Thus, by altering soil microbial biomass and diversity, parasitic plants could influence key soil functions that are driven my microbial communities (e.g., decomposition and nutrient release), which may ultimately influence the growth of native plants around parasitized invasive plants.
