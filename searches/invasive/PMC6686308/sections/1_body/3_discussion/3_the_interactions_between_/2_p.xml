<p>Heavy parasitism by 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> had the greatest negative effect on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growth when soil fungi were suppressed and in the presence of a full complement of soil bacteria (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e), which suggests that heavy parasitism weakened defense of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> against pathogenic bacteria that were likely present in the soil. The results also suggest that suppressing soil fungi eliminated or reduced beneficial effects of fungal mutualists of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. Parasitic plants can affect growth of their hosts by extracting resources such as water, nutrients, and organic compounds from the host's vascular system (Press, Scholes, &amp; Watling, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Because these same resources are used by plants to make secondary metabolites that have been shown to be toxic to plant pathogens (Bouwmeester, Roux, Lopez‐Raez, &amp; Becard, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), it is likely that heavily parasitized 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> individuals had low concentrations of secondary metabolites and consequently low resistance against pathogenic bacteria that were likely present in the experimental soil. This hypothesis is plausible because species in the genus 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> have been shown to be powerful sinks of host photosynthates and nutrients and can therefore preclude host allocation of resources to growth, stress tolerance, or defense (Jeschke, Bäumel, &amp; Räth, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Shen, Xu, Hong, Wang, &amp; Ye, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The apparent synergistic negative effects of 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> and soil bacteria on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> likely released the native plant 
 <italic>Coix</italic> from strong competition from 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> as 
 <italic>Coix</italic> experienced the greatest gain in biomass under similar growth conditions, although when soil fungi were not suppressed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35407-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e).
