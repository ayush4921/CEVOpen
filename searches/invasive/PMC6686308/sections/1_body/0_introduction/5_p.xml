<p>Here, we used an invasive plant 
 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic>, a co‐occurring native plant 
 <italic>Coix lacryma‐jobi</italic>, and a native holoparasitic plant 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> to address the question: Can parasitism on an invasive plant by a native holoparasitic plant interact with soil fungi and bacteria to reduce fitness of the invader and promote growth of a co‐occurring native plant?
