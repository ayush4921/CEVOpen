<p>As parasitic plants are common in natural communities (Pennings &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>), invasive plants may interact simultaneously with native plants, soil microbes, and native parasitic plants (Li, Jin, Hagedorn, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Empirical studies have shown that soil microbial communities can mediate competitive interactions between invasive plants and native plants (e.g., Allen, Meyerson, Flick, &amp; Cronin, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Lankau, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Marler, Zabinski, &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Shivega &amp; Aldrich‐Wolfe, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). For example, rhizospheric soil biota of the invader 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> increased biomass of a native plant 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> when the two plant species were grown in competition with each other (Allen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In a separate study, microbial taxa inhibited the allelopathic effect of the invader 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> on seedlings of the native plant 
 <italic>Platanus occidentalis</italic> (Lankau, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In pairwise competition experiments that compared performance of two native prairie plants (
 <italic>Oligoneuron rigidum</italic> and 
 <italic>Andropogon gerardii</italic>) against one invader (
 <italic>Carduus acanthoides</italic>), the native plants fared better against the invader in the presence of a native microbial community (Shivega &amp; Aldrich‐Wolfe, 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). AM fungi increased the negative effects of the invader 
 <italic>Centaurea maculosa</italic> on a native bunchgrass 
 <italic>Festuca idahoensis</italic> (Marler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Studies have also shown that native parasitic plants can affect competition between invasive host plants and co‐occurring native plants. For instance, native holoparasitic plants such as 
 <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), 
 <italic>C. australis</italic> (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), and 
 <italic>Cassytha pubescens</italic> (Prider et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) caused more damage to their invasive host species than co‐occurring native species. Thus, the holoparasitic plants have been suggested as a potential biological control agent against the plant invaders (Miao et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35407-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, previous work only examined the separate effects of soil microbes and native parasitic plants on interactions between invasive plants and native plants. Therefore, whether soil microbial community and native parasitic plants operate independently or interact in ways that exacerbate or ameliorate the effects of each other to influence competitive interactions between invasive plants and native plants remains unexplored.
