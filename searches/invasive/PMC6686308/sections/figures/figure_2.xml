  <p>Mean (±1 
   <italic>SE</italic>) biomass of 
   <italic>Coix lacryma‐jobi</italic> plants grown with 
   <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> plants that were parasitized by 
   <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> at different intensities and in the presence versus absence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. (a) Main effect of parasitism by 
   <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic>: +P0, +P1, and +P2 indicate no parasitism, light parasitism, and heavy parasitism on 
   <italic>C. campestris</italic>, respectively; (b) Main effect of bactericide: −B indicates without bactericide, +B indicates with bactericide; (c) main effect of fungicide: −F indicates without fungicide, +F indicates with fungicide; (d) interactive effect of parasitism on 
   <italic>C. campestris</italic> and fungicide; (e) interactive effect of parasitism on 
   <italic>C. campestris</italic>, fungicide, and bactericide. Significance of the main and interactive effects was determined by three‐way ANOVAs tests (
