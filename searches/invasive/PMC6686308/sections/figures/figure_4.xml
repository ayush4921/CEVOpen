  <p>Mean (±1 
   <italic>SE</italic>) number of colony‐forming units (CFUs) of soil bacteria in a pot with 
   <italic>Coix lacryma‐jobi</italic> and 
   <italic>Mikania mcirantha</italic> in the presence of different levels of parasitism on 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> by 
   <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> and soil fungi and bacteria. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. (a) Main effect of bactericide; (b) interactive effect of bactericide and fungicide; (c) interactive effect of parasitism, bactericide, and fungicide. Significance of the main and interactive effects was determined by three‐way ANOVAs tests (
