 <caption> Mean (±1 SE) biomass of Coix lacryma‐jobi plants grown with Mikania micrantha plants that were parasitized by Cuscuta campestris at different intensities and in the presence versus absence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. (a) Main effect of parasitism by Cuscuta campestris: +P0, +P1, and +P2 indicate no parasitism, light parasitism, and heavy parasitism on C. campestris, respectively; (b) Main effect of bactericide: −B indicates without bactericide, +B indicates with bactericide; (c) main effect of fungicide: −F indicates without fungicide, +F indicates with fungicide; (d) interactive effect of parasitism on C. campestris and fungicide; (e) interactive effect of parasitism on C. campestris, fungicide, and bactericide. Significance of the main and interactive effects was determined by three‐way ANOVAs tests ( cf. Table S2). Letters above bars indicate the results of post hoc least‐squares mean comparisons (bars that do not share a letter are significantly different) </caption>
