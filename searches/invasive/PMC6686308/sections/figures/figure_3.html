 <caption> Mean (±1 SE) AM mycorrhizal colonization levels of Coix lacryma‐jobi and Mikania mirantha roots in the presence of different levels of parasitism on M. micrantha by Cuscuta campestris and in the presence versus absence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. (a) Main effect of fungicide on the mycorrhizal colonization level of Coix root; (b) main effect of fungicide on the mycorrhizal colonization level of Mikania root; (c) interactive effects of different levels of parasitism and fungicide on the AM fungal colonization of Mikania root; (d) interactive effects of different level of parasitism, bactericide, and fungicide on the AM fungal colonization of Mikania root. Significance of the main and interactive effects was determined by three‐way ANOVAs tests ( cf. Tables S3 and S4). Letters above bars indicate the results of post hoc least‐squares mean comparisons (bars that do not share a letter are significantly different) </caption>
