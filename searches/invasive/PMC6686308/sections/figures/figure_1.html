 <caption> Mean (±1 SE) biomass of Mikania micrantha plants grown in the presence of Coix lacryma‐jobi under different levels of parasitism by Cuscuta campestris and in the presence versus absence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. (a) Main effect of different levels of parasitism: +P0, +P1, and +P2 indicate no parasitism, light parasitism, and heavy parasitism on C. campestris, respectively; (b) main effect of fungicide; −F indicates without fungicide, +F indicates with fungicide; (c) interactive effects of different level of parasitism and bactericide; (d) interactive effect of different level of parasitism and fungicide; (e) interactive effect of different level of bactericide and fungicide; (f) interactive effect of different level of parasitism, bactericide, and fungicide. Significance of the main and interactive effects was determined by three‐way ANOVA tests ( cf. Table S1). Letters above bars indicate the results of post hoc least‐squares mean comparisons (bars that do not share a letter are significantly different) </caption>
