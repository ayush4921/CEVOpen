  <p>Mean (±1 
   <italic>SE</italic>) biomass of 
   <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> plants grown in the presence of 
   <italic>Coix lacryma‐jobi</italic> under different levels of parasitism by 
   <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> and in the presence versus absence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. (a) Main effect of different levels of parasitism: +P0, +P1, and +P2 indicate no parasitism, light parasitism, and heavy parasitism on 
   <italic>C. campestris</italic>, respectively; (b) main effect of fungicide; −F indicates without fungicide, +F indicates with fungicide; (c) interactive effects of different level of parasitism and bactericide; (d) interactive effect of different level of parasitism and fungicide; (e) interactive effect of different level of bactericide and fungicide; (f) interactive effect of different level of parasitism, bactericide, and fungicide. Significance of the main and interactive effects was determined by three‐way ANOVA tests (
