<p>We used mixed model ANOVAS (SPSS Proc GLM; v 19.0, SPSS institute Inc, 2010) to test effects of origin (native versus invasive), shading, herbivory, and their interactions on biomass, allocation parameters, and functional traits. We treated population nested within origin as a random effect. We used K-S test and Levene’s test to analyze normality and homoscedasticity respectively. To achieve normality and homoscedasticity, total biomass, BI and SSL were square-root transformed; SLA was log-transformed. In the cases where transformations were done, the results are presented as back-transformed means and standard errors. We used type-III sum of squares for the calculation of F statistics. Tukey’s 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> tests were used to contrast specific means.
