<p>Alligator weed (
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic>) is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America from Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (39°S) to southern Brazil (18°S). It typically emerges from belowground buds on storage roots in spring and then spreads vegetatively throughout a growing season to form dense monospecific stands. It overwinters with storage roots and rhizomes [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]: the large root reserves act as the primary energy sources for shoot emergence in early spring and also enable rapid shoot regrowth after herbivory or other physical damage. Root fragments also act as propagules for long-distance dispersal by flooding or human activities (e.g. soil transportation and dredging). Therefore, the biomass of storage roots is in some sense equivalent to the reproductive output for
