<p>Alligator weed flea beetle (
 <italic>Agasicles hygrophila</italic>) is a specialist phytophagous insect of alligator weed that has been used as one of the most important biological control agents of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> in USA since 1964. The life stages of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic> consist of the egg, 3 larval instars, the pupa, and the adult [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Both adults and larvae feed on the leaves and other aerial portions of alligator weed. Mature larvae bore into the hollow stems where they pupate as adults, and exacerbate the acquisition of nitrogen by phloem, which causes damage to the fitness of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has been suggested that the completion of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic>â€™s life cycle requires hollow stems for pupation, which may contribute, in part, to its specific adaptation to
