<p>The two light treatments were control light and shading. Plants in the control light treatment were covered with nylon nettings to exclude herbivores. Plants in the shading treatment were first covered with the nylon nettings and then covered with black fiberglass shading cloth in order to decrease light quantity without changing light quality. The control treatment received approximately 80% light compared to ambient sun measured by an illuminometer (Li-1400, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NB, USA). The shading treatment received approximately 25% light compared to the control light treatment.</p>
