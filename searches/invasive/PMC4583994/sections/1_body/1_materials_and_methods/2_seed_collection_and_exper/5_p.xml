<p>Before the herbivory treatment, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic> were fed on Fujian populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> and raised for three generations to reduce maternal effects. Four weeks after transplantation, plants in the control treatment received no herbivory. Plants in herbivory treatment were first uncovered from the nettings and shade cloth, then two randomly chosen second-instar larvae were carefully placed on a fully expanded leaf (second or third position from the tip) with a paintbrush, finally the nettings and shade cloth were replaced. The larvae fed on the plants for five days and consumed an average of 4.6% of leaf area in control light conditions and 15.6% of leaf area in shade conditions. Larvae were then allowed to bore into the stem till the end of experiment.
