<p>On 18 June 2013, we propagated over 30 stem fragments (with one node, 2cm in length) from one genotype of each population, and 16 randomly selected ramets with similar height and leaf numbers (four leaves) from each population were transferred individually to 700ml plastic pots. Each plant was watered 100ml every two days and received a total of 2 g slow-release 16:9:12 N:P:K fertilizer (Osmocote). A three-factor, randomized block design was then used for executing this experiment. The layout consisted of four blocks. In each block, treatments were randomly assigned to each pot and included two levels of light and two levels of herbivory. Thus, a total of 320 plants were tested in the experiment (2 origins: native and introduced ranges x 2 light x 2 herbivory x 10 populations x 4 blocks).</p>
