<p>In 2006, clones (stem fragments) of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> weed were collected from ten native populations in Argentina that covered a broad range distribution (
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For each population, we created a mixture of clones from 20â€“30 maternal families. In 2005, similar collections were made in ten American populations. The sampled stem fragments were transplanted in a greenhouse and vegetatively propagated three times before experiments to remove maternal effects.
