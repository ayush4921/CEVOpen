<p>All plants were harvested on 18 August 2013 (six weeks after transplantation). We separated each plant into leaf, main stem, lateral branch, storage root, and fine root. We also measured the length of the main stem, and determined leaf areas with a leaf-area meter (Li-3100, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NB, USA). All plant materials were dried at 70Â°C to a constant weight (for 72 hours) and weighed to determine leaf dry weight, stem dry weight, branch dry weight, storage root dry weight, and fine root dry weight.</p>
