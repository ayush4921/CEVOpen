<p>The following allocation parameters were further derived from the above measurements: (1) biomass traits including total biomass as total dry weight, storage root biomass as storage root dry weight; (2) biomass allocation parameters including root/shoot ratio (RSR, [root dry weight]/[shoot dry weight], branch index (BI, [branch dry weight]/[stem dry weight]), (3) functional traits related to light capture and resistance including specific stem length (SSL, [length of stem, cm]/[stem dry weight, g]), and specific leaf area (SLA, [leaf area, cm2]/[leaf dry weight, g]).</p>
