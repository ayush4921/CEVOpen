<p>We found no significant origin by shading interaction for total biomass, indicating that native and introduced populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> did not differ in the shade tolerance of total biomass. But we found a significant effect of origin by shading on storage root biomass, and introduced populations showed a flatter slope of the response of storage root biomass to shade, indicating that introduced populations had higher shade tolerance of storage root biomass. Since storage root serves as the primary resource pool from which clonal plants can support population regeneration [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There is little available literature on comparisons of shade tolerance between native and introduced populations. Matlaga et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have found that invasive 
 <italic>Miscanthus sinensis</italic> seedlings have similar shade tolerance to natives.
