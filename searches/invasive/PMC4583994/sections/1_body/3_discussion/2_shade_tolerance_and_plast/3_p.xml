<p>Our result also showed that except for SSL there are no significant differences between native and invasive ranges in plasticity to shading. This is contrary to the hypothesis proposed by Richards et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]which predicted increased plasticity in introduced populations, but in accord with other observations. For example, invasive populations of 
 <italic>Microstegium vimineum</italic> showed similar plasticity of SLA to shading [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and invasive populations of 
 <italic>Clidemia hirta</italic> had similar plasticity to shading for eleven growth and biomass allocation traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Only one study [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found leaf area and biomass of 
 <italic>Sapium sebiferum</italic>, showed greater plasticity to light in introduced populations. Given that plasticity is correlated with risks that compromise long-term survival [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and is not always adaptive [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the evolution of increased plasticity does not appear to be a universal phenomenon among invasive alien plants. Because plants often increase SSL in response to shading or crowding [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], lower plasticity of SSL to shading in introduced plants may reduce intraspecific competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and hence help to form dense stands in fields.
