<p>These results have practical implications for biological control of invasive plants. Although invasive populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> had significantly reduced their resistance to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], maintained tolerance to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic> will probably decreased the impact of biological control on introduced populations. Our study may also explain why shading does not accelerate the biological control of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> using 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic>. It is important to detect which resources influence plant tolerance of herbivory and to consider these in biocontrol programs.
