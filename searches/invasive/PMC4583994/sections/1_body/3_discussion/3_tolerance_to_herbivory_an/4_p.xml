<p>To our knowledge, no one has ever tested the effect of light availability on the evolution of herbivore tolerance in invasive plants. Here we have made a first attempt to address this question. We found no significant origin by shading by herbivory interactions for total biomass or storage root biomass, indicating that light availability did not affect the evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivory in invasive populations of
