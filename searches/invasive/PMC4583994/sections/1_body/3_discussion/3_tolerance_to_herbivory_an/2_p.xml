<p>Contrary to our predictions, we found no significant herbivory by shading interaction for total biomass or storage root biomass, indicating that light availability did not affect tolerance to specialist herbivores. This finding is inconsistent with the compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH) or growth rate model (GRM), but seems to be consistent with the prediction of the limiting resource model (LRM) [
