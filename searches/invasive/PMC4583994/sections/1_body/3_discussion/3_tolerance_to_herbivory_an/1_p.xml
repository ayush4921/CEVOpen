 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> that was damaged by specialist herbivores had a significantly lower total biomass and indicated under-compensating tolerance in our study. We found that damaged plants showed decreased branch intensity (BI). The responses of BI to herbivory are in contrast to several other studies. Bergman found that 
 <italic>Salix caprea</italic> increased branches after foliar damage [

 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> increased branches after stem removal [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying different forms of herbivore tolerance vary widely [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], thus plants may vary in response to different types of damage. Damaged plants showed decreased SLA while shaded plants had increased SLA, indicating plant responses to herbivory and shading may vary among the traits of different functions [
