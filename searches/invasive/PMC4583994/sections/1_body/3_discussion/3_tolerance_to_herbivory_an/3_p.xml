<p>In this study, we found no significant difference in tolerance to specialist insects between native and invasive populations, as indicated by the lack of significant herbivory by origin interaction for biomass. This is consistent with previous studies of 
 <italic>Sapium sebiferum</italic> and 
 <italic>Solidago gigantean</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. But some alien species have evolved increased tolerance to specialist insects [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in the introduced ranges. Since invaders have no history of local adaptation and co-evolution with the community of enemies in the introduced ranges, their resistance traits may be less effective [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, tolerance is likely to be a more reliable mechanism for reducing the negative effects of damage and should be maintained or increased in the introduced ranges.
