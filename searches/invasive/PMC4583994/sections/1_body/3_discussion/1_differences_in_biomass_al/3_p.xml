<p>Specific leaf area (SLA) is a morphological trait which is associated with light capture and resistance to herbivory [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although we found that introduced populations had lower SLA, the fact that they had similar biomass to native populations suggested that light capture may be similar between native and introduced populations of

 <italic>philoxeroides</italic>. This is also supported by our previous study which found introduced populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> exhibited similar photosynthetic energy use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency to the natives [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, the lower SLA may be indicative of increased sclerophylly and suggests that the introduced populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> which are not released from generalist herbivores [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] may have higher resistance.
