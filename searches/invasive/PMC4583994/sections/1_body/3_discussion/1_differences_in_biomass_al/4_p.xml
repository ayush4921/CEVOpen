<p>The differences among native and introduced populations in several traits examined in this study suggest that evolution might have occurred in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> in the introduced ranges. However, we also recognize that this study does not provide direct evidence of such evolutionary. Further studies from population genetic within and between native and introduced populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> are still needed.
