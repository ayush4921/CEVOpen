<p>Introduced populations allocated biomass differently than did native populations and showed decreased branch intensity (BI). Plant architectural traits (such as BI) that affect light capture are believed to be vital in determining the degree of self-shading [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and competitive ability for light [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Hence, the decreased BI in the introduced populations is likely to reduce both self-shading and light competition within populations (unpubl. data, X.Y. Pan). These findings could partly explain why invasive plants were often found to form dense and monospecific stands [
