 <italic>philoxeroides</italic>. Meanwhile, introduced populations had similar biomass to the natives in the presence or absence of a specialist insect herbivore. These results partially support the EICA hypothesis which predicts that, in the absence of specialist herbivores, introduced plants should reduce allocation to resistance traits but increase biomass production or competitive ability. On the other hand, lower SSL is predicted to reduce plantsâ€™ ability to capture light [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus the significant decrease in SSL may also be indicative of reduced intraspecific competition for light in introduced populations (unpubl. data, X.Y. Pan).
