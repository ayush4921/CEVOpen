<p>In addition, attempts to explain rapid evolution in invasive species have led to several other hypotheses. A potentially essential but still understudied mechanism is phenotypic plasticity, the property of a genotype to express different phenotypes in different biotic or abiotic environments [

Two types of plasticity that are generally considered to be important for the success of invasive plants are (1) the capacity of plants to alter biomass allocation and functional traits in response to different levels of resource availability, and (2) herbivory tolerance, the capacity of plants to reduce the negative effects of damage on fitness [
