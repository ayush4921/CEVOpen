<p>Here, we addressed the possible evolution of defense traits and tolerance to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic>, and the impact of shade on possible evolution of herbivory tolerance in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic>. We conducted a common garden experiment in the introduced range of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> using ten invasive (USA) and ten native (Argentina) populations at two levels of light availability and in the presence or absence of a specialist insect 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic>. Plant biomass (total biomass and storage biomass), two allocation traits (root/shoot ratio and branch intensity, branches biomass/main stem biomass) and two functional traits (specific stem length and specific leaf area) were measured. These traits are all potentially plastic in response to herbivory and shade.
