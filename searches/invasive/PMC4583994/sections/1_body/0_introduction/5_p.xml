<p>Light is the most important resource for plant performance [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and previous studies have demonstrated that many exotic plants are likely to invade deeply shaded environment and establish denser stands [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is suggested that invasive plants may have evolved to be more shade tolerant [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, little information is available for whether introduced populations have higher shade tolerance than the natives [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, plant responses to herbivores and shading may be in opposition for particular traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous tests have also found light availability affects tolerance to herbivores [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, light availability may affect the evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores in invasive species.
