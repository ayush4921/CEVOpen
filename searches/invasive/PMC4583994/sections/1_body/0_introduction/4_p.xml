<p>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the effects of resource availability on tolerance. The compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH) predicts that herbivory tolerance should be greater in high-resource and low-competition conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Most recently, the limiting resource model (LRM) has been proposed. LRM is more flexible than either the CCH or GRM, because it specifically considers which factors are limiting plant fitness and which resources are affected by particular herbivore [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and then could affect the evolution of anti-herbivore defense [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, we suppose resource availability may also influence the evolution of tolerance in alien invasive plants.
