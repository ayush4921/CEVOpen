<p>We focused on testing the following effects of each trait: 1) significant effects of plant origin could indicate differences between native and introduced ranges; 2) significant effects of origin by shading interaction on biomass would show differences in shade tolerance between plant origins; 3) significant effects of origin by shading interaction on allocation and functional traits would show differences in plasticity to shading between plant origins; 4) significant effects of origin by herbivore interaction on biomass can indicate differences in herbivory tolerance due to plant origin; 5) significant interactions of origin, shading, and herbivory can indicate the difference in effect of light availability on tolerance between native and introduced populations.</p>
