<p>Empirical tests have been strongly biased toward examining the evolution of herbivory resistance rather than tolerance in invasive plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A trade-off between resistance and tolerance has come to light recently [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, introduced populations of exotic plants are expected to have higher tolerance to specialist herbivores [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, comparisons of herbivory tolerance between native and introduced populations of invasive plants have shown conflicting results, some invasive plants have evolved increased tolerance to specialist insects [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; others have showed no differences in tolerance between native and introduced populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While these studies have been focused on the novel biotic condition: release from specialist enemies, invasive species can also experience novel resource availability (e.g. light, water and nutrients) [
 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which may lead to evolution in functional traits, and influence plant responses to herbivory [
