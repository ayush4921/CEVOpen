<p>In this study, we manipulated 
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> (alligator weed) to detect the effect of light availability on tolerance of plants from two geographical origins (native and invasive ranges). As one of the most rapidly spreading plant invaders, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> grows abundantly in habitats ranging from open waterways to shaded sites under dense vegetation in the introduced ranges [

 <xref rid="pone.0139234.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and is reported to be shade tolerant. We have been studying defense against the specialist enemy 
 <italic>Agasicles hygrophila</italic> and competitive ability in invasive 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic>. We have found that one aspect of resistance to stem-boring 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic> is the specific stem length (SSL), calculated as the main stem length divided by the main stem dry weight. We found different genotypes of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>philoxeroides</italic> vary widely in SSL, and genotypes with lower SSL experience much more herbivory (e.g. higher rate of feeding, oviposition and pupation from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hygrophila</italic>) [
