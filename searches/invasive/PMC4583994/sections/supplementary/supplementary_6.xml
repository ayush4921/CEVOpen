  <title>Average of percentage leaf area eaten by 
   <italic>Agasicles hygrophila</italic> on native (Argentina, white) and introduced (USA, black) 
   <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>Estimated marginal means ±1 standard error. P = 0.141. For each seedling we selected all leaves to estimate the magnitude of herbivory. Each of the five leaves was assigned to one of the following categories of damage, based on visual inspection of leaf area removed: 0, no damage; 1, less than 25% damage; 2, from 25% to 50% damage; 3, from 50% to 75% damage; and 4, damage above 75%. The score of all leaves was used to calculate an individual index of herbivory, IH = Σ nC
   <sub>0–4</sub>N
   <sup>−1</sup>; where C is the category of damage, n is the number of leaves in the Cth category, and N is the number of total leaves of each plant.
