<p>We extracted DNA according to Shi et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) from 20 g fresh ragweed leaves collected in Serbia (43.276149, 21.902976; voucher P.Poczai 0012867). Paired-end libraries of 2 × 150 bp were prepared with Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample prep kit and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Raw reads were filtered with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the plastid genome was carried out with the Geneious R10 assembler platform (Kearse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). We annotated the genome using Geneious and in-house scripts. Here, we report the complete chloroplast sequence of 
 <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> to provide resources for taxonomic studies and invasive weed biology.
