 <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> L. (common ragweed) is one of the most prevalent invasive plants. The main concern regarding this plant is its large production of wind dispersed pollen that causes allergy for 15–60% of the European population (Taramarcaz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). One single plant can produce six billion pollen grains and thousands of seeds during its lifecycle (Kazinczi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Besides its major health impact, it is causing serious economical problems for crop yield in agriculture. Yield losses alone were estimated to be €130 million per year for certain countries (Kőmíves et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Ragweed is a plant of concern especially now in the era of warming climate because tests have shown that higher levels of carbon dioxide will greatly increase pollen production, and thus raising the number of people suffering of allergic reactions (Virág et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
