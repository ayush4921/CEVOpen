<p>Using the RAxMLv8.0 (Stamatakis

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) including 16 representative species of the Heliantheae tribe (Asteraceae) and two outgroup species of Apiales (

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and TNT (Goloboff et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Prior to the analysis we used the WinClada command ‘Mop uninformative characters’ to exclude parsimony uninformative characters. This resulted in a matrix with 30,216 characters and due to its small size, we were able to perform analyses using implicit enumeration of the TNT that ensures finding optimal tree(s). Phylogenetic hypothesis obtained by our study supported previous topologies (Panero and Funk
