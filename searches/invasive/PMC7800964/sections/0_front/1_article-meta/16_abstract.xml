 <p>In the current study, we present the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
  <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic>. The genome is 152,223â€‰bp long and consist of 83 protein coding genes, 38 tRNAs, and four rRNAs duplicated in the inverted repeat. Detected large single-copy (LSC) and small single-copy (SSC) regions separated with two inverted repeat regions (IR) of length 25,098. The phylogenetic hypotheses obtained based on the analyses of 18 cp genomes places common ragweed within the tribe Heliantheae of the Asteraceae.
