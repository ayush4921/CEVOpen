 <p>H
  <sub>2</sub>S is a small molecule known to have multiple signaling roles in animals. Recently, evidence shows that H
  <sub>2</sub>S also has signaling functions in plants; however, the role of H
  <sub>2</sub>S in invasive plants is unknown. 
  <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> is a typical invasive species growing along the beaches of southern China. A physiological comparison proves that 
  <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> is highly tolerant to salinity stress compared with the native species 
  <italic>Cyperus malaccensis</italic>. To decipher the mechanism that enables 
  <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> to withstand salinity stress, a chemico-proteomics analysis was performed to examine the salt stress response of the two species; an inhibitor experiment was additionally designed to investigate H
  <sub>2</sub>S signaling on salinity tolerance in 
  <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>. A total of 86 proteins belonging to nine categories were identified and differentially expressed in 
  <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> exposed to salt stress. Moreover, the expression level of enzymes responsible for the H
  <sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis was markedly upregulated, indicating the potential role of H
  <sub>2</sub>S signaling in the plantâ€™s response to salt stress. The results suggested that salt triggered 
  <sc>l</sc>-CD enzyme activity and induced the production of H
  <sub>2</sub>S, therefore upregulating expression of the antioxidants ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which mitigates damage from reactive nitrogen species. Additionally, H
  <sub>2</sub>S reduced the potassium efflux, thereby sustaining intracellular sodium/potassium ion homeostasis and enhancing 
  <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> salt tolerance. These findings indicate that H
  <sub>2</sub>S plays an important role in the adaptation of 
  <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> to saline environments, which provides greater insight into the function of H
  <sub>2</sub>S signaling in the adaptation of an invasive plant species.
