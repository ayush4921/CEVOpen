   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> after exposure to salt stress. Seven-day-old 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl with or without the H
   <sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis inhibitor PAG (2 mM) or scavenger HT (100 μM). After 3 days of treatment, the accumulation of H

   <sup>+</sup> efflux was monitored by the noninjuring technique after the addition of salt (B). The inset shows the mean efflux rates 0–20 min after treatment. Furthermore, the effects of PAG and HT on the MDA content and
