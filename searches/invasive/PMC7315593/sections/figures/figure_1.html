 <caption> Effects of salt stress on the leaf photosynthesis capability and electrolyte leakage. S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis were collected and cultivated in a greenhouse for 7 days, and then treated with 300 mM NaCl. At the indicated time points, the average F v/ F m values (A), electrolyte leakage (B), and MDA content (C) were determined using whole leaves. Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. Means denoted by different letters show significant differences at p &lt; 0.05 according to Tukey’s test. </caption>
