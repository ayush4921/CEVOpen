  <p>Comparing the generation of H

   <sub>2</sub> and O
   <sub>2</sub>
   <sup>–</sup> in 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> induced by salinity. 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl for 7 days. At the indicated time points, leaves were collected for H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> staining [(A), left panel] by DAB, or O
   <sub>2</sub>
   <sup>–</sup> staining (a, right panel) by NBT. The H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> content (B) and O
   <sub>2</sub>
   <sup>–</sup> content (C) were measured. Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments.
