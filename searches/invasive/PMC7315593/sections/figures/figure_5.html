 <caption> Comparing the generation of H 2O 2 and O 2 – in S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis induced by salinity. S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl for 7 days. At the indicated time points, leaves were collected for H 2O 2 staining [(A), left panel] by DAB, or O 2 – staining (a, right panel) by NBT. The H 2O 2 content (B) and O 2 – content (C) were measured. Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. </caption>
