 <caption> Comparing the ion homeostasis and potassium efflux in S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis induced by salinity. S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl for 7 days. The leaves were collected at the indicated time points, and the Na + and K + contents and Na +/K + ratio were measured (A). Time-course analysis of the transient net K + efflux (B) was performed using the noninjuring technique after the addition of salt. The average K extrusion during 20 min of NaCl stress was also determined (C). Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. Means denoted by different letters show significant differences at p &lt; 0.05 according to Tukey’s test. </caption>
