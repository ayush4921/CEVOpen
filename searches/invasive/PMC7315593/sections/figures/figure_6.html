 <caption> Comparing the activities of antioxidant proteins in S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis induced by salinity. S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis were treated with 300 mM NaCl for 7 days. At the indicated time points, S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis leaves were collected and APX activity (A), SOD activity (B), SNO content (C), and GSNOR activity (D) were measured. Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. Means denoted by different letters show significant differences at p &lt; 0.05 according to Tukey’s test. </caption>
