<p>Mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approaches have been used in several aspects of small molecular drug research, including identifying drug targets, verifying drug to target interaction affinity, and selectivity profiling. It has also been used to profile enzyme activity at a systemic level across different samples, becoming an integrated research engine that removes the hurdle of identifying protein targets of biologically active small molecules with unknown modes of action.
