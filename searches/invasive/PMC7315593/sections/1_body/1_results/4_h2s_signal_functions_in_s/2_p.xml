<p>Through the chemico-proteomics comparison between invasive plant 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and native plant 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> induced by salinity stress, we found that salt stress induced higher levels of H
 <sub>2</sub>S and the activity of the responsible enzyme (
 <sc>l</sc>-CD), activities of the activated antioxidant enzymes (APX and SOD), as well as of the enzyme GSNOR in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>. To further understand the potential role of H
 <sub>2</sub>S in sustaining 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salt stress, 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> was pretreated with a H
 <sub>2</sub>S inhibitor and then exposed to salt stress. 
 <sc>dl</sc>-propargylglycine (PAG) inhibits 
 <sc>l</sc>-DES activity and hypotaurine (HT) scavenges H
 <sub>2</sub>S. In this experiment, NaHS was used as the exogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>S donor. Pretreatment of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> with different concentrations of PAG or HT reduced the salt-induced H
 <sub>2</sub>S accumulation (

Thus, these concentrations were used to investigate the role of H
 <sub>2</sub>S signaling in mediating the salt stress response in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>.
