<p>First, the redox status of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> under salt stress with or without PAG or HT pretreatment were compared. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>A, PAG or HT treatment aggravated salt-induced ROS accumulation and suppressed salt-induced antioxidant APX or SOD enzyme activities. These findings agreed with a previous study
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
 </sup> and suggest that salt-induced H
 <sub>2</sub>S is the signal that activates the antioxidant enzyme activity to reduce ROS accumulation during salt stress. Similarly, a NMT analysis showed that PAG or HT pretreatment increased the K
 <sup>+</sup> efflux, resulting in an increase in the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ratio compared with plants not subjected to a PAG or HT pretreatment (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>B). This suggests that suppressing the H
 <sub>2</sub>S signal affected Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> homeostasis in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> under salt stress. PAG or HT pretreatment significantly reduced the 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>v</sub>/
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> ratio and increased the MDA content in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves after 3 days of exposure to salt stress (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>
 </xref>C), in contrast to samples lacking PAG or HT pretreatment. These data suggest that H
 <sub>2</sub>S mediates tolerance to salt stress in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>.
