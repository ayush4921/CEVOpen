 </sup> Samples exposed to different treatments were collected and quickly homogenized in liquid nitrogen, using extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mM NADH, and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4 °C. After centrifuging the homogenates at 3000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were then collected for GSNOR enzyme activity assays. Nanomoles NADH consumed per minute per milligram of protein (e340 6.22 mM
 <sup>–1</sup> cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) represented the GSNOR activity.
