 </sup> The leaf tissue (1 g) exposed to different salt treatments was collected and ground to a fine powder using liquid nitrogen. The sample was vortexed after adding 1.5 mL of cold extraction buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol and 0.2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate]. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000
