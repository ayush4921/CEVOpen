<p>In China, 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> is regarded as an invasive species based on its aggressive growth capability and tolerance to salt stress. However, the mechanism underlying salt stress tolerance in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> was hitherto unknown. In this study, 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> was more tolerant to salt stress than 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> was, and further proteomic analysis showed that a series of proteins associated with sugar signaling, such as spot 14 (sucrose synthase), spot 30 (soluble starch synthase 1), spot 42 (β-amylase), and spot 43 (α-amylase isozyme 2A), were differentially upregulated, suggesting that sugar signaling may mediate the salt stress response in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>. In addition to providing energy, sugar has been reported to act as a signal mediating many physiological processes, such as iron deficiency and plant lifespan.

 </sup> It is possible that the sugar signal regulates intracellular osmotic levels. Other plant hormone-response-related proteins, such as spot 49 (ninja-family protein 8), spot 62 (gibberellin 20 oxidase), spot 63 (S-adenosylmethionine synthase), and spot 109 (auxin-responsive protein SAUR40) were also differentially regulated after exposure to salt stress; several hormone-responsive transcriptional factors, such as spot 23 (transcription factor MYC2), spot 25 (ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-like 3 protein), spot 95 (ethylene-responsive transcription factor 13), and spot 97 (GRF1-interacting factor 3) presented differential accumulation, suggesting the possible role of jasmonic acid, gibberellin, and auxin signaling in response to salt stress in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>. Furthermore, salt stress modulated protein stability through the protein ubiquitination system, as proteins associated with this system, including spot 13 (ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FTSH 9), spot 21 (BTB family PROTEIN 1), spot 80 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2), spot 86 (proteasome subunit alpha type-2), spot 104 (probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase XERICO), and spot 117 (ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S27a), were markedly modulated after exposure to salt stress. Proteins associated with cell autophagy, such as spot 44 (autophagy protein 5) and spot 50 (cysteine protease ATG4), were also reduced by salt stress, possibly through the H
 <sub>2</sub>S signal. A previous study demonstrated that H
 <sub>2</sub>S is the signal that represses cell autophagy in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

 </sup> The proteomic data also showed that proteins related to splicing or epigenetic modification components, such as spot 2 (isoform 5 of nuclear poly(A) polymerase), spot 5 [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase], spot 6 (SWI/SNF complex subunit SWI3C), spot 20 (probable DNA helicase MCM8), spot 27 (U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein PRP4-like protein), and spot 76 (PHD finger protein ALFIN-LIKE), were also differentially expressed after exposure to salt stress, indicating their role in modulating 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salt at the splicing or epigenetic level. These proteomics data suggest that 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> uses multiple strategies to enhance its tolerance to salt stress.
