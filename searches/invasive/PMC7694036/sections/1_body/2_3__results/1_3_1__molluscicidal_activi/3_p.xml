<p>The survival of the adult slugs at low temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00738-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D) showed a larger decrease using lower concentrations of QE than in the first experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00738-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The survival of slugs at 15 °C was significantly higher than the survival at 2 °C and −1 °C (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA: H (1) = 4.07, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04 and H (1) = 6.84, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, respectively). The LC
 <sub>50</sub> for slugs at 2 °C and at −1 °C was half of the LC50 at 15 °C (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00738-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There was no significant difference between slug survival at 2 °C and −1 °C (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA: H (1) = 0.39, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.53). An increase in QE concentration from 20 to 50 g/L did not have a significant effect on the increase in adult slugs’ mortality (
