<p>We observed moderate negative Spearman correlations between QE concentration and survival of adult slugs (r
 <sub>s</sub> = −0.51, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; based on 125 slugs) and between QE concentration and survival of juveniles (r
 <sub>s</sub> = −0.54, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; based on 125 slugs). The survival of juveniles was significantly higher than the survival of adult slugs (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA: H (1) = 4.54, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). The LC
 <sub>50</sub> value for juveniles of slugs show the biggest concentration of toxin that kills 50% of individuals throughout the study (
