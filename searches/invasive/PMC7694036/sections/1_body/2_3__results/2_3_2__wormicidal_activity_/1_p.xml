<p>The effect of saponins from QE on 
 <italic>E. albidus</italic> exposed to five different doses for 14 days at 6 °C and −1 °C is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00738-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The initial concentration of QE of 1 and 2 g/L had no effect on the survival of worms at a favorable temperature (6 °C), but the concentration of 3 g/L immediately showed a lethal effect, with survival decreasing by 4.5 times and was only 25.4 ± 10%. The LC50 of QE on worms at 6 °C was 2.72 ± 0.09 g/L. The low temperature was characterized by a consistent lethal effect, which was enhanced by a saponins concentration of 2 g/L with survival that decreased to 42.1 ± 11.5%. The LC50 of QE on worms at −1 °C was 2.07 ± 0.11. When the worms were exposed to a concentration of 3 g/L, the population was practically destroyed. The survival was only 2.9 ± 2.5%. The LC50 of QE on 
 <italic>E. albidus</italic> at 6 °C was several times lower than on slugs (
