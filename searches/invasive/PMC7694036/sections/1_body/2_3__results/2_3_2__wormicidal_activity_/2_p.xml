<p>We observed strong negative Spearman correlations between QE concentration and survival of 
 <italic>E. albidus</italic> at 6 °C (r
 <sub>s</sub> = −0.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; based on 350 worms) and at −1 °C (r
 <sub>s</sub> = −0.85, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; based on 230 worms). This correlation was stronger than for slugs. In general, the survival of worms at 6 °C was significantly higher than survival at −1 °C (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA: H (1) = 5.7, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02).
