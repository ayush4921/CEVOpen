<p>QE concentrations for worms were 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 g/L. Prior to use, the soil was dried for 24 h at 80 C, sieved through a 2 mm mesh and stored at room temperature until use. In the experiments, the solution of 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> aqueous extract content adjusted to 19% of dry soil weight (pF approximately 2, corresponding to approximately 50% of water holding capacity). These were homogeneously mixed. The soil was stored for one day before further use. The control treatment was distilled water.
