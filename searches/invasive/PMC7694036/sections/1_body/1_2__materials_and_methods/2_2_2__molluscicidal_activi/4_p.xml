<p>Adult and juvenile slugs were exposed by dermal contact for 48 h to cellulose filter paper soaked with QE solution at a temperature of 15 °C (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00738-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The survival rate was measured after 48 h. Adult 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> slugs were placed individually in plastic containers (7 cm diameter, 4.5 cm height) and juvenile slugs were placed in Petri dishes (9 cm diameter, 1.5 cm height) with five individuals in each dish. To assess the impact of temperature on the effectiveness of molluscicide at QE concentrations of 10, 20, and 50 g/L for adult slugs, low-temperature experiments were completed, one at 2 °C and the second at −1 °C according to Slotsbo et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Prior to the low temperature (at 2 °C and −1 °C) experiments, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> slugs were cold acclimated by keeping them for one week at 10 °C, one week at 5 °C, and then for four weeks at 2 °C to induce freeze tolerance. Slugs were fed with carrots, lettuce, and pellets of dog food ad libitum. After acclimation, slugs were exposed to QE solution (of 10, 20, and 50 g/L) for two days at 2 ℃ and the survival rate was assessed. The freezing experiment at −1℃ was performed by removing slugs to clean containers with a water-moistened paper towel. A small piece of ice was added to initiate freezing, and the containers were moved to an incubator at −1 °C. After two days the containers at −1 °C were placed at 2 °C for 24 h to allow thawing. The survival of slugs was checked immediately after thawing.
