<p>Per experimental condition, datasets (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) at survival were obtained. For every dataset pair-wise comparisons were performed between water controls and QE using student 
 <italic>t</italic>-test (for normally distributed data) and the Mann–Whitney U test (for data with non-normal distribution). Each dataset was independently tested with the Kruskal–Wallis test for a comparison of surviving between 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> adults and juveniles, survival of slugs in different temperatures and survival of worms in different temperatures. The internal pair-wise comparisons identified significant differences with a 0.05 significance.
