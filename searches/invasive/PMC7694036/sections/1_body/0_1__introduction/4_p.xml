<p>Slotsbo et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reared slugs in captivity and established that slugs have the ability to survive temperatures around 0 °C and some individuals can survive even at −3 °C for time periods shorter than one day. This gives the idea that extending the time of using molluscicides in the cold periods of late autumn when young slugs are hatching, and in the spring when frosts are a common phenomenon but slugs are active, could be more effective for the control of slugs.
