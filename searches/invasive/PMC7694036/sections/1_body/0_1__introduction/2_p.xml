<p>Because of the negative effects of common molluscicides in humans and other non-target organisms [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], new effective and environmentally friendly control methods are investigated. Some of them as mechanical barriers (diatomaceous earth, hydrated lime, sulfur, fumed silica, wood ash) are quite effective but insufficient in humid weather conditions when soil moisture adversely affects the efficacy of barrier materials [
