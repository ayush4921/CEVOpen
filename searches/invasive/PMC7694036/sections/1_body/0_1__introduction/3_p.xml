<p>Therefore previous studies have shown that saponin-rich plants exhibit strong molluscicidal activity against terrestrial gastropods [

 <xref rid="B15-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to their amphiphilic nature, saponins can enter the cell membrane and cause increased cell permeability, resulting in disordered circulation of water and ions and disruption of membranes [

 <xref rid="B17-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The most recent data showed that saponin products help stimulate the immune response to co-administered antigens and have become increasingly important in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [
