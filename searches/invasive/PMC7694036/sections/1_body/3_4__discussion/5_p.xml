<p>It cannot be excluded that the route of exposure of saponins extract into land molluscs can also have an important effect. The lethal effect of QE was about two times greater on 
 <italic>Deroceras</italic> slugs after oral injections [

 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> (our results, see 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00738-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It should be noted that, in this case, slugs from different families were investigated.
