<p>Our research has revealed that the molluscicidal effect of saponins depends on the age of the molluscs and the temperature of the environment during the treatment. Contrary to the expectation that young slugs would be more sensitive to saponins, the results showed a completely opposite trend; the LC
 <sub>50</sub> value at the same temperature (15 Â°C) was 1.7 times higher for 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> juveniles than adults. In contrast, most of the previous studies on snails [

 <xref rid="B33-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that molluscicidal extracts from plants were more lethal to younger and smaller snails than to adult and larger ones. This tendency has been explained by the bigger energy reserves of adult snails [

 <xref rid="B37-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Sukumaran et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] also found that the juvenile snails appeared less susceptible than the adults to the molluscicidal activity. The reason for this may be that the young stage slugs are highly active and hence more tolerant to different environmental stresses. This indicates that the stronger effect of molluscicides on juvenile or adult molluscs may vary from species to species and exposure type.
