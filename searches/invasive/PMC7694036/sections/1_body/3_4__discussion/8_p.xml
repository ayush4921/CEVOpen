<p>There is a lack of research on how saponins affect soil organisms, and we expected its toxicity to other organisms to be lower than that of other plant extracts because, as reported above, the molluscicidal effect is not the strongest. However, some studies showed that saponins are capable of causing anti-feeding behavior in insects and to reduce their fertility [
 <xref rid="B41-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Dowd et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] exposed 
 <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic> and 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> caterpillars to 1000 ppm (≈1 g/L) 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> (20–35% by saponins content). After 10 days, the weight of the caterpillars was only 72.7% and 51.7% of control weight, respectively. This is a similar effective concentration of saponins as in the experiment with 
 <italic>E. albidus</italic>. However, in the former experiment, the concentration was based on the diet whereas, in the latter experiment, it was based on dry weight of soil. Fischer et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed that QE saponins had an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 150 ppm (≈0.15 g/L) on the plant parasitic nematode 
 <italic>Xiphinema index</italic>. However, these experiments were conducted in a water environment.
