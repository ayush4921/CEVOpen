<p>Comparing the findings of de Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] with our results, the molluscicidal effect of QE aqueous extract on 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> adults does not stand out from the effect of 
 <italic>B. pillosa</italic> aqueous extract on 
 <italic>Subulina octona</italic> (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00738-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, in both cases the plants were different and one case involved a slug of 70–150 mm in length, while 
 <italic>S. octona</italic> is a much smaller snail with a 10–20 mm shell. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> on 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was 68.5 g/L, quite similar to the LC
 <sub>50</sub> (≈51.4 g/L) on 
 <italic>S. octona</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In both experiments, molluscs were exposed by dermal contact.
