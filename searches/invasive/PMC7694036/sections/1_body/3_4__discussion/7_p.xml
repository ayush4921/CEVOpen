<p>Both QE and freezing temperatures have similar sites of action considering that both are somehow affecting the membrane. Cold temperatures make membranes less fluid, and these become homeoviscous as adaptation response [

 <xref rid="B40-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] stated that acclimation to the cold is often associated with an increase in membrane fluidity, which is directly associated with cell survival at low temperatures. The result that adult slugs are more sensitive to poisons at lower temperatures is important for countries with several generations of slugs. It would be insignificant in Eastern Europe as slugs have only one generation and adult slugs die naturally after laying eggs before autumn comes and before lower air temperatures appear [

However, these results suggest that, similar to adult slugs, juveniles also tend to be more sensitive to poisons at lower air temperatures and that they will be killed faster by using lower levels of poison in the autumnâ€“winter time when they hatch from eggs.
