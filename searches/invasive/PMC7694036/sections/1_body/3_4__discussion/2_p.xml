<p>Based on an overview of published data and our results (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00738-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), we can conclude that QE saponins are not the strongest herbal extracts. González-cruz and Martín [
 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] tested 
 <italic>Deroceras reticulatum</italic>, and Chaieb and Tayeb [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] tested 
 <italic>Theba pisana</italic> with different herbal extracts and found that in order to obtain the same lethal effect, it was necessary to use higher doses of saponins from QE than from other plants. Our results have shown that even higher doses of saponins need to be used for the invasive slug 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>. Among the plant extracts containing other compounds, a stronger molluscicidal effect was shown by carvone from caraway seeds, 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic>. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> was 0.75 mL/L (≈ 7.5 g/L) on 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but they used a methanol extract. Comparing these studies with our results, the molluscicidal effect of 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> aqueous extract was up to 12 times lower than the 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> methanol extract. We did not find estimated LC
 <sub>50</sub> values for saponins to other soil animals, but Potter et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-11-00738" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] indicated that a dose of saponins-rich extract from 
 <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> seeds (131.5 g 1.5−2m) was deadly to earthworms (Lumbricidae) but did not affect black cutworms (
 <italic>Agrotis ipsilon</italic>), masked chafer (
 <italic>Cyclocephala</italic> sp.) grubs, Collembola, oribatid mites, mesostigmatid mites, aphids and midge (Chironomidae) larvae.
