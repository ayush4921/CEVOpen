 </sup>, both %SOC and SOC per volume decreased with increasing soil depth across all land cover types. The greatest decline in SOC per volume occurred from 0–15 to the 15–30 cm depths, similar to observation made on the Hawaiian Islands

 </sup>. Nevertheless, in terms of total SOC per ha, our results corroborate other studies in grasslands that show that deeper soils can store substantial amounts of SOC

 </sup>. For example, of the total SOC found in pristine grassland soils, some 59.6% were found between 30 and 100 cm depth. These values closely correspond with Lal et al.

 </sup> estimated that in grasslands the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was some 43% of that in the first meter. The substantial storage of SOC in deeper soils across all land cover types considered in this study underpins the importance of sampling beyond the threshold of 30 cm belowground
