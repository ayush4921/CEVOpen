<p id="Par22">The challenge for sustainable land management in Baringo and other parts of the semi-arid and arid land in Sub-Saharan Africa is to restore ecosystem multifunctionality
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> to cover the needs of the stakeholders benefitting from healthy ecosystems. However, there are potential trade-offs between certain ES and biodiversity, or among ES. Carbon mitigation programs that promote forest cover in tropical grasslands and savannas cannot be assumed to provide net benefits for conservation or the provision of ecosystem multifunctionality

 </sup>. For example,Â Abreu et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> showed that fire suppression in savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado increased carbon stocks but was associated with acute biodiversity loss. Similarly, encroachment of degraded tropical grasslands in Baringo by

 </sup> and negatively affects tourism

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup> and limits access to water points, pasture, croplands and fishing grounds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>
 </sup>. In arid and semi-arid regions, the high water consumption by Prosopis is of particular concern, as it decreases the groundwater recharge and thus seriously affects the water available to households in invaded ecosytems
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>. While 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees may provide pods for livestock feed, they should only be used as a fodder supplement and thus cannot replace the loss of native forage plants
