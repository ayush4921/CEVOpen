<p id="Par12">Our results provide evidence that restoration of degraded grasslands in the semi-arid regions of Baringo County, Kenya, is at least as effective in replenishing SOC pools as encroachment by the invasive 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> tree. Thirty years of grassland restoration increased SOC pool almost to the level of pristine grasslands. In addition, and in contrast to 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> encroachment, grassland restoration also promotes fodder for livestock production, thus avoiding carbon-fodder trade-offs. Recovery of plant species richness requires more time and/or targeted grassland management interventions which promote restoration of the characteristic biodiversity.
