<p id="Par19">In contrast to pristine and restored grasslands, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> encroachment, which occurred in Baringo often in already degraded land, primarily accumulated SOC in the top 30 cm, which represents 65% and 55% of the total SOC in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-high cover and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-low cover plots, respectively. This effect can be explained by the fact that 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> exhibits two rooting systems – the main taproot and a dense network of extensive lateral roots

 </sup>. In mature 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees, the main taproot is associated with a high number of smaller roots at a depth of approximately 1 m
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>, while the lateral roots are concentrated in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile
