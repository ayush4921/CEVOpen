<p id="Par17">The 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-low and the 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-high cover areas had intermediate levels of total SOC stocks which neither differed significantly from those of pristine and restored grasslands nor from those of degraded grasslands. The fact that SOC stocks in pristine and in restored grasslands tended to be even higher than those in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded sites may at least partly be attributed to the fact that grassland soils have organic matter levels at least twice as high as forests because grassland biomes add organic matter to topsoil from both roots and above-ground resulting from annual die back

 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> and 
 <italic>Cenchrus ciliaris</italic>, which were indicative of pristine and restored grasslands, respectively, are known for having deep root systems extending up to 2 m into the soil profile
