<p id="Par30">Five land use/cover types representing common earth cover and distinct land use activities within the study area were identified, namely pristine grasslands, degraded grasslands, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-low (low cover), 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-high (dense cover) and restored grasslands (reference photos in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The choice of these land cover types, their categorization and definitions were based on time, events in history and physical characteristics as informed by expert judgement, literature and field observations. We achieved this through consultations with village leaders, farmers, pastoralists, land-owners and conservationists regarding the happenings and changes in the area since 1950s or before. Reference is made to around 1950s because the region suffered a catastrophic drought – an aftermath of prolonged rainfall failure following the usual seasonal bushfires that occur in savannas and rangelands
