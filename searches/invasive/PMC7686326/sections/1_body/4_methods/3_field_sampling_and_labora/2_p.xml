<p id="Par33">At each selected site, one plot of 15 × 15 m was randomly selected and geo-referenced. Within the pristine and the restored grassland sites, plots were randomly established in areas with contiguous, undisturbed grass cover (i.e. driveways or gullies were excluded) and with a minimum distance of 30 m away from a native tree and 50 m from a
