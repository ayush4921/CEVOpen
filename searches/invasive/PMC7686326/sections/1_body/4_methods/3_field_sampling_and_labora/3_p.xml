 </sup>. In brief, each 15 × 15 m plot was divided into nine 5 × 5 m subplots and samples taken from five out of the nine subplots (the four corner subplots and the centre subplot). One of these five subplots was randomly excluded from sampling herbaceous biomass and fenced against livestock grazing in degraded and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded plots. We did not find significant differences in herbaceous biomass between fenced and unfenced subplots (TEW Linders, unpublished data). To measure soil organic carbon (SOC), a soil pit was dug incrementally in the centre of each of the corner subplots, from which 4 independent soil cores were taken at the following depth increments: 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–100 cm

 </sup>. For bulk density, a soil pit was dug incrementally in the centre subplot, outside of the fenced area if applicable, and three soil cores taken from three different sites of the same soil pit at each of the same depth increment. Species richness was assessed at the plot level. Herbaceous vegetation (anything growing 2 cm above-ground) samples were harvested from a patch area of 25 × 50 cm of each of the four subplots, pooled together per plot, and oven-dried to determine dry weight
