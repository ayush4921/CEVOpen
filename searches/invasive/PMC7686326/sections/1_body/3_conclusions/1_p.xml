<p id="Par25">The importance of managing grasslands to optimise carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation is widely recognised

 </sup>. Our findings provide evidence that grassland degradation depletes SOC stocks to 1 m depth, but that restoration of degraded grasslands has the potential to replenish SOC stocks at a rate higher than targeted by international initiatives such as the ‘4 per 1000′ initiative. Moreover, refilling of the SOC stocks through restoration of grasslands does not come at the expense of the productivity at the herbaceous layer and numerous other ecosystem services necessary to meet the demands of local (agro-)pastoralists and other stakeholders. Encroachment of degraded semi-arid grasslands by

 </sup>. We therefore propose that efforts to reverse land degradation in Baringo and other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa should consider restoration of historical grasslands and their associated ecosystem services and their sustainable embedding in a mosaic of other ecosystems, e.g. shrubland and forests consisting of non-invasive woody species
