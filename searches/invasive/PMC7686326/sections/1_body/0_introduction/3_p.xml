<p id="Par4">In response to the program for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) and the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), afforestation of degraded grasslands has been put forward as a legitimate climate mitigation strategy

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. However, the extent to which afforestation or tree invasions lead to increased soil C stocks depends on prior land use or land cover, climate and the tree species, thus assessments relying on carbon stored from woody plant invasions to balance emissions may be incorrect
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. In fact, the expansion of trees or shrubs into grasslands can also lead to a depletion of valuable soil carbon stocks

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. The emphasis on aboveground C stocks may also be due to the fact that most studies on soil carbon restricted their analyses to surface soils (usually upper 15–30 cm), thereby ignoring the potential of grassland soils to store SOC at greater depth
 <sup>

 </sup>. When deciding on soil carbon management actions, the co-benefits and trade-offs with other ES should be identified and considered to promote ecosystem service multifunctionality
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. Even in cases where encroachment by trees in tropical savannas leads to increased C stocks, it may come at a high cost to biodiversity and other ES
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Considering the potential of healthy grassland soils to store large amounts of C, an alternative climate mitigation strategy would be to restore degraded grasslands and implement sustainable grazing management
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Because grasslands have greater carbon allocation to root systems than forests, restoration of the former may potentially replenish depleted SOC stocks on degraded land as quickly as encroachment by woody species
