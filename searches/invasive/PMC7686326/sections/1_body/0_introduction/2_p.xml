 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, they provide habitat for a substantial diversity of animals and plants and support other ecosystem services (ES), including the regulation and storage of water flows, forage for livestock production, and tourism

 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Yet, grasslands are under severe threat from degradation and conversion to other land uses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, which limits their potential to provide these essential services and functions. Degradation of grass-dominated ecosystems and the concomitant loss of SOC and other ES is particularly prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to a set of interlinked factors, including a growing population, overgrazing, invasion by alien plant species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup> and a lack of appropriate policies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
