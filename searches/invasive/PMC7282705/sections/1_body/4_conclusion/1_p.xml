<p>In this experiment, AM fungus was associated with changes in root traits and increased nutrient uptake for invasive and native plant species via the interconnective mycorrhizal networks. Specifically, a large number of root traits were enhanced including root dry weight, length, surface area, volume, number of tips and branching points, specific root length and volume, root N and P contents for invasive 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> and native 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>; and the root average diameter of both species was decreased. Many of the observed increases were more significant for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> than for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>. In conclusion, based on these findings, we suggest that the invasive plant experienced greater benefits than the native plant in nutrient acquisition and for root traits and root system developments when in association with an AM mycorrhizal network in karst habitats.
