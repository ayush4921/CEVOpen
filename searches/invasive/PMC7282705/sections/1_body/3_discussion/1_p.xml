 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g006">6a–6f</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that AM mycelia can complement plant roots to expand the absorption range from soil to improve plant nutrient [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For instance, AM fungi could obtain N from organic matter and transfer it to host plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and could enhance P uptake for the invasive plant

 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; Huang et al. (2011) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] also discovered that AM fungi facilitated uptake by

 <italic>annua</italic> roots for soil N and P nutrients. These studies indicate that AM fungi play important roles in regulating nutrients of N and P for host plants, including invasive or native species, and our experimental results also verified this by AM fungi enhancing the N and P contents of roots in both species. Besides, AM fungi can promote the root growth of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g004">4</xref> in this experiment, consisting of the root morphology changes and root biomass enhancement of seedlings that promote growth and development via AM fungi as similarly documented by Lü and Wu (2017) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and Liu et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Root morphological plasticity, when associated with AM fungi, may be more substantial in karst habitats with limited nutrients. For example, Yang et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] discovered that inoculation with AM fungi markedly increased the root length, surface area and volume of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic> seedlings in karst soil; Zhang et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] showed that AM fungi significantly enhanced the total root length, surface area and volume of 
 <italic>Cyclobalanopsis glauca</italic> in karst rocky desertification areas. Root morphology can reveal a plant’s ability to absorb nutrients [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and different plant species vary in the plasticity of their root morphology when in association with microorganisms or in response to other factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our results indicated that invasive plants overall exhibited better performance of root traits and nutrients than co-occurring common native plant in karst region. This is consistent with findings of previous studies comparing invasive and native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that root traits and nutrient utilization of invasive plant were greater than native plant in M
 <sup>+</sup> compared with M
 <sup>-</sup>. This is similar to Li et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] suggest that mycorrhizal colonization promoted invasive plants to have greater nutrients uptake and competitiveness than native plants, and Zhang et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] also documented that AM fungi rendered invasive species presenting superior plant traits compared with native species. Together, these results indicated that invasive plant is competitively superior over the co-occurring native plant when with AM fungi.
