Plants will maximize resources use to adapt to competition by regulating productivity and root morphology [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Research showed that increasing the number of root tips can enhance the ability of plants to use soil resources in situ [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and the growth and extension of lateral roots can increase the root length and expand the spatial area where plants can utilize soil resources [

Root diameter size determines the utilization efficiency of plant roots for belowground resources, and the uptake capacity of nutrients and water by the smaller diameter roots is higher than the thicker diameter roots [
