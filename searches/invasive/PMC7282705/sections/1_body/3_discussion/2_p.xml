<p>He and Zhong (2012) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] revealed that root average diameter and number of tips are parameters reflecting root absorption efficiency. However, Fitter et al. (1994) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] argued that fine roots have low input, large surface area and short life, while thicker roots grow fast and have a long life, but has a relatively small surface area, so fine roots have more robust uptake capacity. In this study, AM fungi decreased the root average diameter, and significantly increased the number of root tips of

The greater the specific root length and area, the greater the ability of fine roots to absorb nutrients and water [
