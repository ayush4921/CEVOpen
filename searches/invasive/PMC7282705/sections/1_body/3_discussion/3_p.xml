<p>AM fungi affected plant competition on nutrient uptake [

 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which probably is mediated by mycorrhizal networks among plant species [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g006">6</xref>), which indicates that the epitaxial mycelium of roots can obtain the resources of the competitive compartment outside of the root system to promote the biomass and nutrient accumulation of host plants. AM fungi regulate competition among host plants by reallocating soil resources through mycorrhizal networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Weremijewicz et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that common mycorrhizal networks can amplify competition by preferential mineral nutrient allocation to large host plants, and Awaydul et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that common mycorrhizal networks preferentially transferred mineral nutrients to the invasive species, but inhibited the nutrient uptake of native species. These also explain that the mycorrhizal networks in our study tend to allocate more biomass and nutrients to
