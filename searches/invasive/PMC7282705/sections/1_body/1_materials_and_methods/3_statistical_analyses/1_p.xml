<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 18.0 software. All of the data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance before analysis. Variance analysis was applied to compare differences between M
 <sup>+</sup> and M
 <sup>-</sup> or treatments of Cu, Su and Nu treatments in length, average diameter, surface area, volume, tips and branching points of roots, specific root length, area and volume, and root N and P contents per length, area and volume by the least significant difference (LSD). Three-way ANOVAs were applied for the effects of species origin (

 <italic>annua</italic> (native)), mycorrhizal fungus (M
 <sup>+</sup> vs. M
