<p>A microcosm experiment was set up using devices with three compartments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g001">Fig 1</xref>) in the greenhouse of Forestry College of Guizhou University, Guiyang, China (106°22′ E, 29°49′ N, 1120 m above the sea level). The experimental material was 2 mm thick polypropylene plastic. The device was composed of two planting compartments (Pc) on opposite sides flanking a competition compartment (Cc) in the center. The size of each of the three compartments was about 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm (length × width × height). Five circular holes with a diameter of 5 mm were drilled on a baffle plate separating the planting compartments and the competition compartment. 20μm or 0.45μm nylon meshes were attached to both sides of the baffle plate to form an air gap to prevent nutrient flow exchanges among compartments. Additionally, the 20μm Glomusnylon mesh allows mycelium to pass through, but the plant roots cannot, and the 0.45μm nylon mesh does not allow either mycelium nor plant roots to pass through [
