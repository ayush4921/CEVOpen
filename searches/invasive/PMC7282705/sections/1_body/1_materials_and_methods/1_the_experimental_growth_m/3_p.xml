<p>The plant growing substrate was a mixture of limestone soil and sand by volume ratio of 3:1, which had pH 7.45, total nitrogen 2.27 g. kg
 <sup>-1</sup>, available nitrogen 127.48 mg. kg
 <sup>-1</sup>, total phosphorus 0.90 g. kg
 <sup>-1</sup>, available phosphorus 11.48 mg. kg
 <sup>-1</sup>, total potassium 4.99 g. kg
 <sup>-1</sup> and available potassium 287.30 mg. kg
 <sup>-1</sup>, following the method of measurement of Tan (2005) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The substrate was sterilized with a pressure of 0.14 Mpa and a temperature of 124°C-126°C for one hour before the beginning of the experiment, and the limestone soil was collected from a typical karst habitat near Guiyang city. Seeds of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> were collected from Guanling county of Guizhou province of China, a typical desertification area within a karst ecosystem. In our previous field survey, the 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> has severely invaded the karst area of southwest China and coexists with native 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, and both species are herbaceous plants of 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family and have a similar niche [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The seeds were sterilized with a 10% hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) solution for 10 minutes and repeatedly washed with sterile water three times. Each compartment was filled with 2.5 kg of the sterilized substrate, and five seeds of plants were taken into planting compartments, respectively. 50g of inoculum was added into the planting compartments as M
 <sup>+</sup> treatments. The inoculum had been propagated with 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> for four months, which was sterilized at 0.14 Mpa, at 126 °C for one hour before inoculation with 
 <italic>Glomus etunicatum</italic>. Additionally, M
 <sup>-</sup> treatments received an additional 10 ml of the filtrate by weighing 50g of 
 <italic>Glomus etunicatum</italic> inoculum and by filtering it with ultrapure water, and double-layer filter paper, along with a 50g of autoclaved inoculum was added, in order to ensure the same microflora in M
 <sup>-</sup> and M
 <sup>+</sup> except for the target fungus (
 <italic>Glomus etunicatum</italic>). After ten days of seedling growth, two seedlings were kept in each planting compartment. Each treatment used six replicates. All experimental materials were cultured in a greenhouse for 12 weeks and then were harvested for measurement.
