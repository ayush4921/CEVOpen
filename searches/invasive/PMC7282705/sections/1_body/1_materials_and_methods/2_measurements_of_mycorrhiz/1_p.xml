<p>The determination of mycorrhizal colonization rate adopted methods described by He and Zhong (2012) [

 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> was determined by weighing root material after drying at 80Â°C for constant weight. Plant N was determined by the Kjeldahl method and P was determined by Molybdenum-Antimony colorimetry [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Plant root morphological indices were measured using a root scanning analysis system (STD1600 Epsom USA; WinRhizo Version 410B) to obtain root length, average diameter, surface area, volume, branching points and tips of roots. The specific root length, area and volume were calculated by the root length, area and volume divided by the root dry weight, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The root N and P content per length, area and volume were calculated by the root N and P content divided by the root length, area and volume, respectively.
