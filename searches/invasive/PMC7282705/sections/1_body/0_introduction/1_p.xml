<p>Karst landforms develop from carbonate rock and are widely distributed in southwest China [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This habitat is characterized by fragile ecosystems, exposed rocks, severe soil loss and nutrient deficiencies [

 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and susceptibility to invasive plants. In recent years, some invasive plants such as 
 <italic>Eupatorium adenophorum</italic> have successfully invaded the karst habitat in southwest China and have spread continuously [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], seriously threatening native species diversity and ecological stability. However, it is not clear how alien plants successfully invade the fragile karst habitat at present. One possible factor is that when alien plants invade a new habitat, they escape their specific soil pathogenic microorganisms from their origin, and ultimately gain a competitive advantage [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Harner et al. (2010) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] argued that rhizosphere symbiotic microorganisms can help invasive plants obtain nutrition and can thereby promote the growth of invasive plants. Callaway et al. (2004a; 2004b) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] also believed that soil microorganisms are the essential factor affecting the successful invasion of alien plants, the interaction of invasive plants with soil microorganisms and its feedback plays an important role in competition leading to the replacement of native plants.
