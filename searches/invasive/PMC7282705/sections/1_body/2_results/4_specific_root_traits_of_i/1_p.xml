<p>The species (S) and AM fungus (M) significantly affected the specific root traits of plants (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic>, a significant difference was observed between M
 <sup>+</sup> and M
 <sup>-</sup> (M
 <sup>+</sup> &gt; M
 <sup>-</sup>) in specific root length under the Cu and Su treatments, in specific root area under the Cu, and in specific root volume under the Cu, Su and Nu treatments; for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, there was a significant difference between M
 <sup>+</sup> and M
 <sup>-</sup> (M
 <sup>+</sup> &gt; M
 <sup>-</sup>) in specific root length under the Cu, Su and Nu treatments and in specific root volume under the Su (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g005">Fig 5a–5c</xref>). The nutrient access (N) significantly affected the specific root traits of plants (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic>, there was a significant difference in specific root length among Cu, Su and Nu treatments (Su &gt; Cu &gt; Nu), specific root volume in Cu and Su was significantly greater than in the Nu under M
 <sup>+</sup>; for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, all specific root traits of the Su treatment was significantly higher than in Cu and Nu under M
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g005">Fig 5a–5c</xref>). The interaction of S × M significantly affected specific root area and volume, which indicated invasive plant had better root traits than native plant in M
 <sup>+</sup> compared with M
 <sup>-</sup>; and the interaction of M × N significantly affected specific root volume (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Generally, under M
 <sup>+</sup>, the 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> was significantly greater than the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> in specific root length under the Cu and Su treatments, and in specific root area and volume under the Cu, Su and Nu; under M
 <sup>-</sup>, there was no significant difference in specific root traits between 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> under Cu, Su and Nu treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g005">Fig 5a–5c</xref>). These results indicate that AM fungi can change the specific root traits of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, the promotion of these traits in 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> was more obvious than in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> when both species competed for nutrients in the middle compartment through mycelium.
