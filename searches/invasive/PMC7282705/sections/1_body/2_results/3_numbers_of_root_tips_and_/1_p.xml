<p>The species (S) and AM fungus (M) significantly affected the numbers of root tips and branching points of plants (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A significant difference between M
 <sup>+</sup> and M
 <sup>-</sup> was observed (M
 <sup>+</sup> &gt; M
 <sup>-</sup>) in numbers of root tips and branching points of

 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Under M
 <sup>+</sup>, for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic>, the number of root tips in Cu and Su treatments was significantly higher than in Nu, and the number of branching points in Su was significantly higher than in Cu and Nu; for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, the number of root tips in the Su treatment was significantly greater than in Nu and the number of branching points in the Su was significantly higher than in Cu and Nu; under M
 <sup>-</sup>, there were no significant differences in root tips and branching points of the two species among Cu, Su and Nu treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g004">Fig 4a and 4b</xref>). Interestingly, the interactions of S × M and M × N significantly affected the number of root tips and branching points, which indicated invasive plants had a better performance of roots than native plant in M
 <sup>+</sup> compared with M
 <sup>-</sup> (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Overall, under M
 <sup>+</sup>, the number of root tips and branching points of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> were higher than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> under the Cu, Su and Nu treatments; under M
 <sup>-</sup>, these root indexes of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> was lower than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> under the Cu (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g004">Fig 4a and 4b</xref>). This result indicates that AM fungi can promote the lateral root growth of both species and that the number of root tips and branching points of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> were more significant than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic> when the two species have access to the competition compartment through mycelium.
