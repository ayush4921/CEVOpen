<p>The species (S) and AM fungus (M) significantly affected N and P contents in roots of plants (

 <italic>adenophorum</italic>, a significant difference was observed between M
 <sup>+</sup> and M
 <sup>-</sup> (M
 <sup>+</sup> &gt; M
 <sup>-</sup>) in root N content per length under the Su treatment, in root N content per area and volume under the Cu and Su, and in root P content per length, area and volume under the Cu, Su and Nu treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g006">Fig 6a–6f</xref>). For 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, there was a significant difference between M
 <sup>+</sup> and M
 <sup>-</sup> (M
 <sup>+</sup> &gt; M
 <sup>-</sup>) in root N content per area under the Su and Nu treatments, in root N content per volume under the Su treatment, and in root P per area and volume under the Cu, Su and Nu treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g006">Fig 6c–6f</xref>). The nutrient access (N) significantly affected root N per length and volume and root P per area of plants (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Under M
 <sup>+</sup>, for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic>, root N per length of the Su treatment was significantly greater than the Cu and Nu, the root N per area and volume and root P per length, area and volume of Su treatment were significantly higher than in Nu; for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>, the root N per length and P per area of the Su treatment were significantly greater than Cu and Nu, and the root P per length of the Cu treatment was significantly lower than the Su (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g006">Fig 6a–6f</xref>). Besides, the interactions of S × M and M × N significantly affected plant root P content, which indicated invasive plants had higher P utilization than native plants in M
 <sup>+</sup> compared with M
 <sup>-</sup> (
 <xref rid="pone.0234410.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Generally, under the Cu, under M
 <sup>+</sup>, N and P contents in roots of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> was higher than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>annua</italic>; under M
 <sup>-</sup>, there was no significant difference between the two species in root N and P (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234410.g006">Fig 6a–6f</xref>). It indicates that AM fungi differentially increased the N and P contents in the roots of both species. The absorption capacity of N and P nutrients of the roots of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>adenophorum</italic> was stronger than 
 <italic>A</italic>.
