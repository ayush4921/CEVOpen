 <caption> Root dry weight of invasive E. adenophorum and native A. annua. Abbreviations: M + = Mycorrhizal fungus was used to inoculate seedlings of E. adenophorum and A. annua; M - = Mycorrhizal fungus was not used to inoculate seedlings of E. adenophorum and A. annua; Cu = Competitive utilization nutrient treatment; Su = Single utilization nutrient treatment; Nu = Non-utilization nutrient treatment. Lowercase letters (x, y) indicate significant differences between M + and M - treatments of invasive E. adenophorum and native A. annua at the 0.05 level; lowercase letters (a, b, c) indicate that there are significant differences among Cu, Su and Nu treatments for invasive E. adenophorum and native A. annua at the 0.05 level; Greek alphabet (α, β) indicate that there are significant differences between E. adenophorum and A. annua at the 0.05 level. </caption>
