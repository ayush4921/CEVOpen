 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> genotypes from the three invasive regions grew, on average, a 44% larger total leaf area, a 34% larger shoot, a 27% smaller root, and a 17% larger total dry mass than native genotypes at Control T2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition, invasive genotypes from the three regions did not differ in structural root dry mass from native genotypes but they had, on average, a 49% higher shoot-structural root ratio than native genotypes. Invasive genotypes had, on average, a 26% lower root inulin concentration and 45% lower inulin content that resulted in 28% lower root inulin-structural root ratio than native genotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
