 <italic>vulgaris</italic> have 62%, 77% and 37% higher root inulin content than invasive genotypes at control T1, control T2 and defoliation T2, respectively (TableÂ

 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> genotypes at defoliation T2 was reduced by 14% while in the native genotypes it was reduced by 27%. As for the structural root mass there is no difference between native and invasive genotypes at all the treatments.
