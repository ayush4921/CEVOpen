<p id="Par20">A multiple regression analysis showed that average dry mass (=average total dry mass per population of defoliation T2 minus average total dry root mass of control population T1) increased with the root inulin content of control T1 plants after one month of regrowth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and decreased with the structural root mass of the control T1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).
