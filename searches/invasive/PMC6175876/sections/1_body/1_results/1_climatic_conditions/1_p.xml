 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> populations from the three geographically distinct regions (Australia, Eastern North America and Western North America) were separated from each other and the native region except two samples from Australia and two samples from Western North America were mixed with the native region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also correlated inulin content with mean temperature of the coldest quarter in the areas of the populations where the seeds were sampled. While native and invasive range did not differ in mean temperature of coldest quarter (ANOVA, F
 <sub>1,34</sub> = 0.074, NS), inulin content was not significantly correlated with mean temperature of coldest quarter in the invasive region (r = 0.227, n = 18, NS) and in the native region (r = 0.327, n = 18, NS).
