<p id="Par26">Furthermore, we found that the plant biomass after regrowth, decreased with structural root dry mass (Fig.Â

 </sup>. Therefore a bigger structural root, without a photosynthesizing shoot, consumes a bigger amount of the stored carbohydrates. We found that the size of structural roots is negatively correlated with plant regrowth ability after defoliation. In general, previous studies have considered the ratio between total root and total shoot as an indicator of storage or regrowth

 </sup>. Here we find that a large root does not necessarily translate into better regrowth ability, but that size of the root may even negatively affect plant regrowth after damage. We show that it is crucial to study the root storage and structural components separately rather than associating the entire root with plant regrowth ability.
