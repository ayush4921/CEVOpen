<p id="Par29">In conclusion, in this study we found that invasive 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> genotypes have been selected to evolve increased growth ability and decreased regrowth ability compared to native genotypes, due to the lower investment in root carbohydrate storage. These results support the EICA and the SDH, which contend that due to the absence of adapted specialist herbivores, a net gain is obtained for increasing growth by the invasive plants as they invest less in anti-herbivore defense. It shows that plant regrowth ability after defoliation is strongly correlated with carbohydrate storage in the root while the size of the structural root is negatively correlated with regrowth ability. Additionally, all the studied traits measured in the invasive 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> genotypes from the three geographically distinct regions changed in the same direction suggesting a parallel evolutionary response to the absence of specialist herbivores.
