<p id="Par2">Plant invasions can be considered as large-scale and long-term experiment where major selective forces have changed, and therefore provide an ideal opportunity for ecologists to study evolutionary changes. Upon introduction, the most striking change in the new range is the guild of herbivores attacking the plant. Though still under herbivore pressure by generalist herbivores of the invasive range and occasional specialist herbivores of congeneric plant species, the invasive plant species are freed from their native specialist herbivores

 </sup>. Several studies showed that the amount of damage in the invasive range is smaller than in the native range

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Such a shift to a herbivore guild dominated by generalist herbivores is expected to exert an altered selection on the plants in the invasive range. Since plant defense can be costly

 </sup> and many defense traits are genetically controlled

 </sup>, an evolutionary change is expected to occur in the invasive genotypes that leads to a decrease in investment in anti-herbivore strategies used to deal with the “old” specialist herbivores. The savings in anti-herbivore investment strategies can be reallocated to plant growth, thus increasing the competitive ability of invasive species over the local plant species and allowing higher seed reproduction as proposed in the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) and Shifting Defence Hypothesis (SDH)
