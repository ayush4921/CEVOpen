<p id="Par3">Among plant strategies developed to cope with herbivore pressure, tolerance is an alternative to herbivore deterrence

 </sup>. In contrast to resistance and avoidance, tolerance is the aspect of defense which is most poorly understood in plant-herbivore interactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Herbivore pressure plays a major role in the selection of plants to evolve tolerance. A variety of plants suffer from high levels of mainly specialist herbivory that results in frequent defoliation during their lifetime
 <sup>

 </sup>. The level of tolerance those plants exhibit may vary among sites, reflecting the history of grazing damage, suggesting a strong selection for tolerance

 </sup>. Therefore, in the native range where specialist herbivores are present, the level of tolerance is expected to be higher than in the invasive area where specialist herbivores are absent.
