<p id="Par7">Upon complete defoliation, the root cannot rely on photosynthates from the defoliated shoot while energy is still required to maintain survival of the root cells and functions of the root (e.g. root metabolism and respiration)

 </sup>, complete defoliation leads to an immediate shortage of energy with a surplus of nutrients. At this point, structural root maintenance is competing with plant regrowth for limited energy, since they all draw from the same resource pool. We therefore hypothesize that maintaining a large structural root system is costly and negatively associated with plant regrowth ability.
