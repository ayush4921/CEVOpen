<p id="Par12">In this study, we hypothesized that invasive 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> genotypes have evolved: (1) an increased growth ability, (2) a decreased root carbohydrate storage, and (3) a decreased regrowth ability as a response to a change in the herbivore guild in the introduced range. Furthermore, plant regrowth ability is hypothesized to be positively associated with root carbohydrate storage and negatively associated with structural root mass. We compared growth, regrowth and root carbohydrate storage between native and invasive 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgaris</italic> before and after artificial defoliation. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first studies to focus on the comparison of regrowth ability and root carbohydrate storage between the same plant species from invasive and native ranges. Hence, the results contribute to the critical evaluation of the role of carbohydrate storage and regrowth in evolutionary shifts that mediate invasion success in plants.
