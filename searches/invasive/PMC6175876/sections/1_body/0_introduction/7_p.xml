 </sup>. In order to rule out the effect of climatological changes, we studied a system in which multiple invasive regions that differ in climatological conditions are compared. We expect parallel evolutionary changes in the allocation to growth, carbohydrate storage, and regrowth in each of the different geographical and climatological invasive ranges if the shift in the herbivore guild is the main selective force.
