<p id="Par4">Plant tolerance is considered to be costly because tissue is lost through herbivory. Furthermore, the reserves allocated to tolerance cannot be used for other functions such as survival, growth, or reproduction

 </sup>. Invasive species that have been freed from their specialist herbivores for many generations are an ideal system to study the selective pressures on tolerance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that invasive plants have evolved towards a decreased investment in tolerance and an increased investment in growth.
