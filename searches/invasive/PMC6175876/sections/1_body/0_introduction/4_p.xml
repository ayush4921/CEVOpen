 </sup>. Many plant species have storage organs located in a relatively safe place, such as belowground roots. This allows that they can tolerate tissue loss to herbivory through compensatory regrowth using these stored reserves

 </sup>. The root system is responsible for the supply of water and inorganic nutrients and has been found to be strongly associated with plant regrowth ability
