<p id="Par6">To be able to regrow after foliar herbivory, plants need carbohydrates to regenerate new leaf tissue after defoliation. Root carbohydrate storage has been reported to play an important role in plant regrowth after defoliation

 </sup>. We therefore hypothesize that increased carbohydrate storage leads to increased regrowth ability. Many species rely on having high root/shoot ratios that are speculated to have high levels of storage for regrowth

 </sup>. However, roots have multiple functions: nutrient and water supply for growth, structural maintenance of plants, and the storage of resources. Hence, a large root to shoot ratio may not result from high storage levels only, but could also be a consequence of low nutrient availability
