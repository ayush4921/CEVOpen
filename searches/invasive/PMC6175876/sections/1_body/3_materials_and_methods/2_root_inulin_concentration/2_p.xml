<p id="Par33">Since roots are used for carbohydrate storage, to maintain structure, and for acquiring nutrients and water, we divided the total root dry mass into the carbohydrate storage root dry mass (=root inulin content) and the structural root dry mass (=total root dry mass âˆ’ root inulin content). Additionally, we calculated the root inulin-structural root ratio (=root inulin dry mass in the root/structural root dry mass) and shoot to structural root ratio (=shoot dry mass/structural root dry mass). The plant regrowth ability was estimated as the ratio between the total dry mass of defoliation T2 and the total dry mass of control T2 according to van der Meijden,
