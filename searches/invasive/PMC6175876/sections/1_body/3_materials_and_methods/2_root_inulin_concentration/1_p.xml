 </sup>. The concentration of root inulin was measured as the difference between the free sugar content before hydrolysis and the total sugar content after hydrolysis with inulinase. For each plant, 0.1 g of finely powdered root material was incubated with 4 mL distilled water at 80 °C for 1 hour to determine the free sugars. After centrifugation, 1 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 2 mL of 0.03 M 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). The absorbance of this solution was recorded with a spectrophotometer at 540 nm and the concentration of free sugar was calculated using a calibration curve made with D(−) fructose according to Miller

 </sup>. Another 1 mL of the same sample was hydrolysed with 200 µl of inulinase (Novozym®960, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at 60 °C and the concentration of total sugar was measured as above. The total inulin content (mg) in the root was calculated [=root inulin concentration (mg•g
 <sup>−1</sup>) × root dry mass (g)]. Analysis of the inulin content in the shoot showed that it was less than 10% of that of the root and that it did not differ between native and invasive genotypes (Data not shown).
