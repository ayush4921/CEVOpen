<p id="Par36">We tested the shoot dry mass at T1 (6 motherplants for each population; 3 from defoliation T1 and 3 from control T1), and found significant differences among populations (ANOVA, df = 1, 35; p = 0.02). We therefore used the population average to correlate the initial root inulin content and the structural root dry mass at the moment of defoliation with the net gain in dry mass one month after regrowth. A multiple regression analysis was conducted using the average dry mass increase per population (=average total dry mass per population in the defoliation T2- average root dry mass per population in the defoliation T1) as the dependent variable and the average total inulin content and the average structural root dry mass from each population at defoliation T2 as independent variables.</p>
