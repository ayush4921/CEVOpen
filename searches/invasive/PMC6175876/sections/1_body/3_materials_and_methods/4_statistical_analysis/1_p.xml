<p id="Par35">As the main interest of this study was to find the differences among the native and three invasive regions (Australia, West and Eastern North America), a nested ANOVA with region as a fixed factor and population nested within region as a random factor combined with Tukey HSD post-hoc test were performed for all the measured traits in all the three treatments. Normality of the residuals was tested with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To obtain normality, shoot-structural root ratio and root storage-structural root ratio were log transformed. Furthermore, homogeneity of variance in the ANOVA was tested with Leveneâ€™s test and in all cases this test was non-significant.</p>
