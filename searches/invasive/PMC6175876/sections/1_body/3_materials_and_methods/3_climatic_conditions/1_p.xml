<p id="Par34">To examine the difference in the local climate among the four geographic regions (Europe, Australia, Western and Eastern North America), all the available 19 bioclimatic variables (ca 1950–2000) were downloaded from the World Clim dataset (

A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed with the SIMCA-P software (v.11.0, Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) to classify all sampled populations based on the 19 bioclimatic variables. The scaling method for the PCA was unit-variance.
