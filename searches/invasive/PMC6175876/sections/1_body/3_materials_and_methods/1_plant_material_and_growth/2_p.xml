<p id="Par31">Subsequently, plants from control T2 and defoliation T2 were allowed to grow for a further 4 weeks (from T1 to T2) till their final harvest after which their dry mass was determined. The samples were dried as described previously and the dry mass of shoots and roots were determined. Except for control T0, the total leaf area of each plant from the other three treatments was measured at harvest using a portable leaf area meter (LI-3100, LICOR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Two invasive plants from control T1, 2 invasive and 4 native plants from defoliation T2 and two native plants from control T2 were dead during the experiment and were not harvested.</p>
