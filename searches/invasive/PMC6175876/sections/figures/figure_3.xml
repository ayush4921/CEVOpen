  <p>The difference in regrowth ability among invasive populations from three geographic regions (Aus = Australia, ENA = Eastern North America and WNA = Western North America) and native populations from Europe. Values are means ± SE. Letters indicate significant difference s between regions with a Tukey HSD post-hoc test of a nested ANOVA with region as factor and population nested within region (F
   <sub>1,3</sub> = 7.198, p (Region) = 0.001, F
   <sub>1,32</sub> = 1.247, p (Population) = 0.223).
