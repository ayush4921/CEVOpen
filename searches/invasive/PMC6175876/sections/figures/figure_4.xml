  <p>Scatter-plots of the average dry mass increased per population from the defoliation treatment after regrowth against the average root inulin content (
   <bold>a</bold>) and the average structural root dry mass (
   <bold>b</bold>) of the population at the moment of defoliation (control T1). Open dots indicate native populations and filled dots indicate invasive populations. Average plant dry mass increase = total dry mass of plants in the defoliation T2- total dry mass of plants in the defoliation T1 (Multiple regression, n = 36, R
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.404 full model, total inulin, t = 4.194, p &lt; 0.001; structural root dry mass t = −2.810, p = 0.008). Structural root dry mass is the difference between total root dry mass and root inulin content.
