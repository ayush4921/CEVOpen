  <p>Total dry mass of Jacobaea vulgaris among invasive populations from three geographic regions (Australia, Eastern North America and Western North America) and native populations from Europe at control T0, T1, and T2 and at the defoliation treatment T1 and T2. Solid lines represent the control treatment and dashed lines represent the defoliation treatment. Defoliation T1 is the root dry mass of control T1. Letters indicate significant differences among regions with a Tukey HSD post-hoc test of a nested ANOVA with region as factor and population nested within region, NS = P (region) is not significant.</p>
