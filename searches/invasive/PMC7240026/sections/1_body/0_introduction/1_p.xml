<p>Cytological, morphological (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Celarier, 1958</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Doggett, 1976</xref>), and molecular data (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 1995</xref>) suggest that tetraploid 
 <italic>Sorghum halepense</italic> (2n = 40) arose as a naturally occurring hybrid between 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> (2n = 20), an annual, polytypic African species which includes cultivated sorghum; and 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic> (2n = 20), a perennial southeast Asian native of moist habitats. While a firm estimate of its antiquity is lacking, 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic> is thought to have shared ancestry with 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> ∼1–2 million years ago (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Feltus et al., 2004</xref>), roughly circumscribing the maximum age of 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic>. Occasionally used as forage and even food (seed/flour), 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> has spread in post-Columbian times from its hypothesized west Asian center of origin across much of Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Its establishment in the U.S. is probably typical of its spread to other continents, being introduced intentionally as a prospective forage and unintentionally as a contaminant of seedlots (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">McWhorter, 1971</xref>). However, while sorghum largely remained confined to cultivation, 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> readily naturalized and has spread across much of North America, both to agricultural and non-agricultural habitats (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sezen et al., 2016</xref>) – suggesting capabilities for adaptation well beyond those of sorghum.
