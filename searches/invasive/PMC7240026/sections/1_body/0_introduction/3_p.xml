<p>Here, we integrate several diverse data types to elucidate the evolution of 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic>, its invasiveness as exemplified by rapid spread across the United States in post-Columbian times, and the roles of polyploidy and interspecific hybridity in distinctive features of its growth and development. As the first surviving polyploid in its lineage in âˆ¼96 million years (

 <italic>S. halepense</italic> may also open new doors to sorghum improvement, with synergy between gene duplication and interspecific hybridity nurturing the evolution of genes with new or modified functions (
