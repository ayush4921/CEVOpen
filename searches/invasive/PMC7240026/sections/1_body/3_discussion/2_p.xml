<p>Several lines of evidence point to a richness of DNA-level variation in 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic>, including an abundance of novel coding sequences, much richer diversity of neutral DNA markers than its progenitors, and novel gene expression patterns exemplified by rhizome-enriched expression of some alleles from its non-rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> progenitor. The spread of invasive taxa is much more rapid than migration in native taxa, and may require more genetic variation to sustain (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2002</xref>). Although there is somewhat less variation near the invasion front than the center of its US distribution (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sezen et al., 2016</xref>), rich 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> diversity may support its projected 200â€“600 km northward spread in the coming century (
