<p>Rich genetic variation in 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> offers not only challenges but also opportunities. Long under selection for weediness-related attributes that enhance its competitiveness with crops, some US 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> genotypes have transitioned to non-agricultural niches (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sezen et al., 2016</xref>) and may also experience selection favoring alleles that could improve sorghum and other crops, e.g., for cold tolerance, rapid vegetative development and flowering, disease and pest resistance, and ratooning (a new growth cycle from the stubble of the prior one). 
 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> can routinely serve as the pollen parent of triploid and tetraploid (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Warwick and Black, 1983</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Liang, 1988</xref>) and under some circumstances diploid (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dweikat, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2017</xref>), interspecific hybrids with 
 <italic>Sh</italic>, offering the opportunity to test 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> alleles in sorghum.
