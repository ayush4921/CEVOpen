 <italic>S. halepense</italic> such as endophytic nitrogen fixation (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2013</xref>), if transferred to sorghum, could help to narrow a ‘yield gap’ reflected by 1961–2012 yield gains in the U.S. of only 61% for sorghum versus 323% for maize

 </sup>. Likewise, its perenniality may have resulted in selection for ‘durable’ biotic stress resistance mechanisms that are absent from, but of importance to the improvement of, sorghum and other crops.
