<p>Synergy between gene duplication and interspecific hybridity may add an important element to the classical notion that polyploids adapt better than their diploid progenitors to environmental extremes (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Ohno, 1970</xref>) such as we report, permitting a nascent polyploid to adapt to environments beyond the reach of its progenitors. Hybridity preserves novel alleles such as many recruited into

 <italic>S. bicolor</italic>, putatively contributing to the transgressive rhizome growth and ability of
