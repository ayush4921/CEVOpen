<p>While âˆ¼80% of annotated sorghum genes are expressed in 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> rhizomes, many alleles with striking enrichment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of expression more closely resemble the sequences of the non-rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> progenitor than rhizomatous 
 <italic>Sp</italic>. By laser capture microdissection, we collected meristems and compared transcripts from buds induced to develop as rhizomes or leafy shoots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), respectively obtaining 163,264,254 and 152,162,240 Illumina Hiseq reads, of which 67.7% (110,492,577) and 67.2% (102,194,352) could be anchored to 27,566 and 27,183 sorghum gene models. About 1% (262) of genes showed differential expression (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) between rhizome buds (168 enriched) and shoot buds (94: 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Appreciable recruitment of alleles from non-rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> to rhizome-enriched expression is indicated by 44 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> versus only 23 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic> derived transcripts with at least two SNPs supporting these origins and no contradictory SNPs (other differentially expressed genes are ambiguous based on these criteria).
