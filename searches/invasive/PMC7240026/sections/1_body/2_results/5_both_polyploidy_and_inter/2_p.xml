<p>Consistent with rhizomes being âˆ¼70% of the mass of a Johnsongrass plant (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oyer et al., 1959</xref>), genes highly expressed in rhizome buds were enriched for diverse functions associated with rapid cell division (Kinesins, ATP binding, and microtubule related: 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) and maturation. Cellulose synthase, Sb06g016760, was the most rhizome enriched gene, also implicated in rapid cell growth. Shoot-bud enriched genes were over-represented in three gene ontology (GO) categories associated with cell recognition (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), perhaps in preparation for new biotic interactions after emergence from the soil. The most shoot-enriched genes were (a) glutathione 
 <italic>S</italic>-transferase (Sb09g000860), catalyzing conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic substrates for detoxification; (b) a glycoside hydrolase (Sb08g007610), suggesting cell wall loosening during the rhizome-to-shoot transition; and (c) a member of the major facilitator superfamily (Sb06g033080, MFS: Interpro IPR005828) of transmembrane single-polypeptide secondary carriers implicated in control of sorghum seed size (

Intriguing differentially expressed genes located within likelihood intervals of rhizome related quantitative trait loci (QTLs, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) include an auxilin/cyclin G-associated kinase (Sb03g028900), tandemly duplicated ethylene responsive transcription factors (Sb07g006195, Sb07g006200), and a Ca2 + /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, EF-Hand protein superfamily gene (Sb09g022960).
