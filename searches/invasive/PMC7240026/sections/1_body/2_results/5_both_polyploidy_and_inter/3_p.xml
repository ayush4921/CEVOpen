<p>Both polyploidy and interspecific hybridity appear to contribute to the ‘mosaic’ nature of rhizome gene expression, with overexpression of some homoeologs from rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic> and others from non-rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). For example, different calmodulin family members have evolved specificity to rhizome buds (e.g., Sb10g027610, the second-most rhizome specific gene) and shoot buds (Sb06g023700). Tandem duplicated ethylene responsive transcription factors within a rhizome-related QTL are both overexpressed in 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> rhizome buds, although the sequence of Sb07g006195 closely resembles 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic> (5 of 6 SNPs matching) and adjacent Sb07g006200 is identical to 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> (6 of 6 SNPs). The 
 <italic>Teosinte-branched 1</italic> growth repressor gene implicated in apical dominance of maize shoots has two family members with enriched expression in rhizome buds (Sb01g010690, Sb04g026970), ironically both completely matching the non-rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> progenitor sequences (4 of 4, and 2 of 2 SNPs).
