<p>More extensive rhizome growth than its rhizomatous diploid progenitor is also related to the ability of

 <sub>2</sub> families selected for rhizome growth in Bogart GA, single 3 m rows were tested for 15 months (2014-5) at the ICRISAT research station in Samanko, Mali (12.5° N, −7.9° W). A total of 45 (47% of) families contained one or more plants that survived the dry season of 8 month duration with zero rainfall. A logistic regression model (see section “Materials and Methods”) showed that for each 1 cm increase in rhizome spread from the crown based on Bogart GA trials, the probability of surviving the Malian dry season increased ∼3%. Factors other than rhizomes are also important to perenniality – lines surviving the tropical dry season were only randomly associated with those surviving the mild 2014-15 temperate winter in Bogart, GA (24 of 54 lines, 44%), survivors of the harsh 2013-14 winter being more closely associated with dry season survival but too few in overall number to be conclusive (5 of 6, 83%).
