<p>Rhizomatousness is closely related to the ability of 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> to overwinter in the temperate United States. In the Bogart, GA field trial, 139 (58.9% of) 
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> progeny showed regrowth after overwintering, while there was no survival of 
 <italic>SbxSp</italic> in 2012-3 or in two additional years. Moreover, in 
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> BC
 <sub>1</sub>F
 <sub>1</sub>-derived BC
 <sub>1</sub>F
 <sub>2</sub> families (
 <italic>n</italic> = 246) grown in 3 m plots with two replications following conventional sorghum recommendations, those with rhizomes had significantly higher frequencies of survival than those lacking rhizomes (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The advantage of rhizomes was observed both in harsh winters (2013-14, with five periods below 20 F, reaching a low of 5.8 F

  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref>
 </sup>) and mild winters (2014-15, with only two periods below 20 F, reaching a low of 10.2 F) in Bogart GA. Survival in Salina, KS among replica plots of the same BC
 <sub>1</sub>F
 <sub>2</sub> families was too low to evaluate statistically.
