<p>Rhizomes, subterranean stems that can comprise 70% of its dry weight (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oyer et al., 1959</xref>), are a key link between morphology and ecology of 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic>. Rhizome growth of polyploid 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> transgresses that of its rhizomatous diploid progenitor, 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic>. We conducted a field trial in Bogart, GA (33.9° N) during 2012-3 of widely spaced (1 m between plants and rows) tetraploid F2 progeny from a cross between 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> BTx623 and 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> Gypsum 9E (
 <italic>SbxSh</italic>); side by side with plots of 161 diploid recombinant inbred lines from a cross between BTx623 and 
 <italic>S. propinquum</italic> (
 <italic>SbxSp</italic>; 5 plants per line, spaced 0.3 m between plants and 1 m between rows and plots) (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> progeny had a higher frequency of rhizome-derived shoots emerging from the soil (37.6%), larger average number of rhizomes producing above-ground shoots (0.77), and greater distance of rhizome-derived shoots from the crown (11.97 cm) than 
 <italic>SbxSp</italic> (30%, 0.32, 7.5). Rhizome number showed heritabilities of 0.077 (F
 <sub>3</sub>–F
 <sub>2</sub> regression) and 0.34 (variance component analysis of BC
 <sub>1</sub>F
 <sub>2</sub> families) in 
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> and 0.44 in 
 <italic>SbxSp</italic> (by variance component analysis).
