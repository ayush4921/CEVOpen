<p>While some apparently novel alleles in the draft genome (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) may reflect intraspecific polymorphism, a remarkable 67.1% of CDS polymorphisms differentiate 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> from representatives of both putative progenitor species and the outgroup 
 <italic>S. timorense</italic> (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, pattern 1). The functional impact of these non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed by comparison to an evolutionary conservation profile of amino acids from orthologous genes in a panel of diverse plant species, calculating a ‘functional impact score’ using a modified entropy function (

 <italic>S. halepense</italic> genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). SNPs causing premature protein translation termination (5981 in 4459 genes) are most abundant, followed by loss of stop codons (2521 in 2016 genes) and loss of translation initiation site (236 in 227 genes). These functionally important mutations are significantly enriched in plasma membrane genes with kinase activity, suggesting changes in environmental sensing and associated intracellular processes such as cell differentiation and metabolism (
