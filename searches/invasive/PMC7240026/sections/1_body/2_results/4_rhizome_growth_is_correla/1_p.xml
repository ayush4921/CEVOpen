<p>Curiously, rhizome growth is correlated negatively with that of other vegetative organs but positively with reproductive growth. Across four environments (Bogart GA and Salina KS, 2013 and 2014), early flowering is correlated with reduced aboveground vegetative biomass (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.26 to −0.62, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but increased rhizome growth (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.17 to 0.30, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in tetraploid 
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> progeny. Because rhizomes are a vegetative organ, our 
 <italic>a priori</italic> expectation was that increased vegetative biomass aboveground would be correlated with increased rhizome growth. However, we measured rhizome growth primarily based on counting above-ground shoots derived from rhizomes. In another rhizomatous grass (
 <italic>Agropyron repens</italic>), rhizome axillary buds experience apical dominance until anthesis, being suppressed by auxins (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Leakey et al., 1975</xref>). By excising 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> rhizomes from the plant, we found that axillary buds consistently develop as vertical shoots and not as rhizomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). So, once flowering of the primary stalk is initiated, a rhizomatous plant permits the development of additional ramets – which in principle should be able to exert apical dominance themselves. Moreover, our observation that these new buds invariably become ramets and not rhizomes raises questions about their additional dependence on a mobile ‘florigen’ such as that translocated to the plant apex (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sachs, 1865</xref>). There may be much to be learned about nature of signaling among ramets at different developmental stages that are interconnected by rhizomes.
