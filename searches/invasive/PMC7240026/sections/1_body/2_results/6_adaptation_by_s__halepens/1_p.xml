<p>Introgression is suggested in a general sense by 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> enriched allele composition of the 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> draft genome (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and for specific genes by 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> SNP distribution patterns matching the 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> reference genome of an elite breeding line (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2009</xref>), but differing from both several wild 
 <italic>S. bicolors</italic> and each of two outgroups (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, patterns 2–3). Seven ‘hotspots’ for introgression of sorghum alleles in five geographically diverse US 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> populations (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Morrell et al., 2005</xref>), show non-random correspondence with published sorghum QTLs (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) conferring variation in rhizome growth, seed size, and lutein content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). While sorghum lacks rhizomes and has large seeds, rhizome growth-related alleles masked in domesticated sorghum genotypes by a lack of rhizomes may be unmasked in interspecific crosses with rhizomatous 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic>.
