<p>Within the lutein QTL likelihood intervals, and homozygous in the Gypsum 9E (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), are also loss of function mutations in Sb01g013520, 9-
 <italic>cis</italic> epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. This enzyme cleaves xanthophylls to xanthoxin, a precursor of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2003</xref>) that plays a central role in regulating plant tissue quiescence. Also in the lutein QTL likelihood intervals are non-synonymous SNPs inferred to have striking functional effects (see section “Materials and Methods”) on Sb02g026600, a cytochrome P450 performing a key step of ABA catabolism (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2004</xref>). A hypothesis for investigation is whether modified alleles at these loci degrade ABA to release 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> seeds from dormancy early and/or increase seedling vigor under cold conditions.
