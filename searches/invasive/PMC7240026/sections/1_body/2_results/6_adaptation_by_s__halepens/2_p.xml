<p>Particularly intriguing among 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> introgression hotspots are those that correspond with 3 of 4 QTL likelihood intervals spanning 4.9% of the genome that account for variation in seed content of the carotenoid lutein (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 2008</xref>) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0026, 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Sorghum leaf photosynthetic capacity is susceptible to damage under low-temperature (&lt;10 C) but high-light conditions when electron transport exceeds the capacity of carbon fixation to utilize available energy (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Rowley, 1971</xref>). Such conditions are infrequent in the tropics where 
 <italic>Sorghum</italic> originated but common in the temperate springtime. Spring regrowth of 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> starts about 4 weeks before cultivated sorghum is seeded at 38.7° N (Gypsum, KS, where Gypsum 9 was collected). Xanthophyll carotenoids such as lutein are most abundant in plant leaves, modulating light energy and performing non-photochemical quenching of excited ‘triplet’ chlorophyll which is overproduced at very high light levels during photosynthesis (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Demmig-Adams and Adams, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Taiz and Zeiger, 2006</xref>). Ironically, Sb01g030050 (
 <italic>Lut1</italic>; KO:K09837) and Sb01g048860 (
 <italic>crtZ</italic>; KO:K15746) related to lutein biosynthesis, are close to the only lutein QTL not near an introgression hotspot (on chromosome 1).
