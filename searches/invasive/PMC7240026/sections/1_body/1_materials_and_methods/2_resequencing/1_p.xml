From each accession, 76-bp paired-end reads were aligned to the 
 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> reference genome (v1.4) using BWA version 0.5.9 (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Multiple-sample SNP calling was performed using the mpileup program in the samtools package and bcftools (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Reads with mapping quality score &gt; = 25 and base quality &gt; = 20 are used for SNP calling. Raw SNPs are further filtered according to read depth distribution to avoid paralog contamination and low coverage regions. Each accessionâ€™s genotype is calculated using maximum likelihood estimation using reads with coverage between 4 and 30X. The genotype with the largest likelihood is assigned to each individual. SNPs with allele frequency &gt; = 0.01 are used for downstream analysis.
