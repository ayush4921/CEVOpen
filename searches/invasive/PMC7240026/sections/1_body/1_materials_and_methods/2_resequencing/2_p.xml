<p>As tandem genes are often recently derived and share high sequence similarity, they can complicate short read alignment and introduce ‘false SNPs’ from paralogs. To address this, the coverage of genomic reads (not including transcriptome data) was examined for every tandem gene in the sorghum genome. The average coverage of the whole genome across the 27 genomes studied is about 553X. There were 31 tandem genes with more than twice the genome coverage (1100X), of which 7 have coverage more than 2500X (ranging up to 7500X). A total of 14 of the 31 high coverage tandem genes have SNPs called, and were removed from further analysis.</p>
