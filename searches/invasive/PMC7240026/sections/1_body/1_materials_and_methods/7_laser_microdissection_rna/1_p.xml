<p>LM RNA-seq was used to compare transcript accumulation in the shoot apices of buds induced to develop as either secondary rhizomes or leafy shoots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The meristem plus two youngest leaf primordia were microdissected from transverse sections. Two replicates of each meristem type were collected, with 5 meristems per replicate. LM, RNA extraction and amplification, cDNA library preparation and Illumina sequencing were performed as described (
