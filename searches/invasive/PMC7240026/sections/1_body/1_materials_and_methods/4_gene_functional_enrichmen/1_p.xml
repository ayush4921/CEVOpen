<p>Arabidopsis GO-slim gene annotation was used for function enrichment analysis. GO-slim terms are assigned to sorghum genes based on sequence similarity inferred from best blastp hit. Binomial distribution based on the proportion of a GO-slim term among all annotated genes in the sorghum genome is used as the null distribution. Test significance threshold is defined as
