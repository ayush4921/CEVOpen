<p>Survival of cold (temperate) or dry (Mali) seasons was based on single plants (
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> F2), or at least some survival within progeny rows of about 5 (
 <italic>SbxSp</italic> RILs) or 10 plants (
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> BC1F2; F3). Methods for determining rhizome numbers and distances from the originating crown are as cited (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2015</xref>). Flowering time was based on the average number of days from planting to flowering of either single plants (
 <italic>SbxSh</italic> F2) or the first five plants in a plot, and vegetative biomass was determined at the end of the growing season (after frost) by harvesting all tissue &gt;2 cm above the ground for entire plots, separating inflorescences from vegetative tissues, drying to stable mass, and determining dry tissue mass. Heritabilities were calculated from F
 <sub>2</sub>â€“F
 <sub>3</sub> regression (
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> x 
 <italic>S. halepense</italic> F
 <sub>2</sub>), or variance component analysis [
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> x

 <sub>1</sub>F
 <sub>2</sub>;
