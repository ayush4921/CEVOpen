 <caption> Excising primary rhizome tips induces Sorghum halepense axillary bud growth. Buds on rhizomes attached to the parent shoot (large green arrows) develop as secondary rhizomes (above), whereas buds on excised rhizomes develop as leafy shoots (below). Mechanical excision ensured the identity and equivalent developmental staging of shoot apices selected for transcriptional profiling. </caption>
