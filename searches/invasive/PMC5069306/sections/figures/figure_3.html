 <caption> TEM micrographs of the lateral nectary of B. orientalis: a Epidermal cell with slight outward projections of the homogenous cuticle lining outer wall. In granular cytoplasm occur mitochondria, ER profiles and plastids with small, partly hydrolyzed starch grain. Scale bar = 2 μm. b Epidermal cells and subepidermal secretory parenchyma cells with large nuclei, small vacuoles and starchless plastids. Scale bar = 5 μm. c Cells of the nectar-producing parenchyma with numerous mitochondria aligned along a cell wall. Scale bar = 1 μm. d Details of epidermal and subepidermal nectary parenchyma cells. Short profiles of ER and few plastids within secretory parenchyma cells are present. Scale bar = 2 μm. e Numerous plastids with starch grains within cells located deeply in secretory parenchyma. Scale bar = 5 μm. f Sieve tube element and companion cell with mitochondria at the base of secretory parenchyma. Scale bar = 2 μm </caption>
