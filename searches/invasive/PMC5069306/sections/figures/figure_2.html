 <caption> Light micrographs of sections through the lateral nectary of B. orientalis: a Confluence of lateral and median nectaries at their bases ( arrows) in a flower sectioned transversely and then stained with methylene blue-Azur B. Scale bar = 200 μm. b Section of nectary showing intensely stained cytoplasm of epidermis and secretory parenchyma cells, and phloem strands ( arrows) at the base of the secretory gland; staining with methylene blue-Azur B. Scale bar = 100 μm. c Sieve tube elements ( arrows) next to the base of nectary; staining with methylene blue-Azur B. Scale bar = 50 μm. d Staining with PAS revealing the presence of numerous small starch grains ( arrows) in secretory parenchyma cells, mainly found in the deeper layers of this tissue. Scale bar = 20 μm. e Nectary epidermis with open modified stomata, note substomatal spaces ( asterisks). Longitudinal section stained with methylene blue-Azur B. The stoma on the right is sectioned obliquely. Scale bar = 50 μm. f Cuticle on the surface of nectary epidermis fluoresces with auramine O. Scale bar = 50 μm. g Autofluorescence of chlorophyll in subepidermal parenchyma when exposed to UV light. Scale bar = 100 μm </caption>
