 <caption> View of the flower ( a) and scanning electron micrographs ( b– f) of the floral nectaries of Bunias orientalis: a Flower devoid of part of perianth and stamens, showing the position of a green nectarium. Note nectar glistening on the nectarium surface. Scale bar = 500 μm. b Floral base after removal of perianth and stamens with lateral and median nectaries. Lateral nectary encircles short stamen. Scale bar = 200 μm. c Floral nectaries from above; note a narrow band of nectarial tissue ( arrow) connecting lateral nectary to adjacent median one. Scale bar = 100 μm. d– e Mature and immature (far right of Fig. 1d) modified stomata ( double arrows) placed on the same level as other epidermal cells. Note distinctly striated surface of nectary epidermis. Scale bars = 20 μm. f Mature stoma demonstrating pore occlusion. Scale bar = 5 μm </caption>
