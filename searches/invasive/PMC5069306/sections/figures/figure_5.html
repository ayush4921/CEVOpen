 <caption> TEM micrographs of epidermal and secretory parenchyma cells of the median nectary of B. orientalis: a Epidermal cells showing granular cytoplasm with vacuoles and mitochondria. Note thick outer cell wall without projections, covered with a relatively smooth cuticle layer. b Epidermal cell and subepidermal secretory parenchyma cells with mitochondria, small vacuoles and plastids, note large intercellular space between epidermal and secretory parenchyma cell. c Secreting parenchyma cell walls with plasmodesmata ( arrows). d Secretory cell with vacuoles containing fibrillar material. Also numerous mitochondria, large nucleus and starchless plastids or plastids with partly hydrolyzed starch grains. Scale bars = 2 μm.
