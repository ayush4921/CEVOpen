<p>One of very aggressive invaders is the Turkish cabbage, 
 <italic>Bunias orientalis</italic> L. (Brassicaceae: tribe Buniadeae). It is believed that this species bears a threat to native flora due to its high colonization rates and ability to form dominant stands (Dietz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>; Hochkirch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the presence of introduced plants may be beneficial (Bjerknes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>; Bartomeus et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>) as they may contribute to a higher food diversity and thus increase pollinator species richness or abundance (Hochkirch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>). According to Sch√ºrkens and Chittka (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2001</xref>), nectar production in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers is relatively low, but as a result of extremely high flower display, this species may be a valuable food source for visiting insects and hence compete for pollinators with native flora and depress the pollinator visits to other plants (Hochkirch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>).
