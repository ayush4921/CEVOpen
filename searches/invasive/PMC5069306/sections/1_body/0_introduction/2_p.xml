<p>Location, morphology and structure of the floral nectaries have been described for numerous plant species, and nectary traits are considered highly diverse in angiosperms since those structures appeared independently in many taxa (Vogel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1997</xref>; Fahn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>). Moreover, the relative location of nectaries within a flower is under pressure to maximize relations with pollinators (Nepi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>) and hence to ensure the deposition of pollen on the stigma by pollinators.
