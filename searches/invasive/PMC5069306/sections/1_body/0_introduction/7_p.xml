<p>Understanding various reproductive traits of invasive species may contribute to the design of eradication or control programmes. The reproductive success, i.e. seed setting, in the alien species often depends on the activity of the flower visitors, which is affected also by nectar availability. Thus, providing information about nectar production in the invader flowers might be useful in estimation of chances of controlling its spread. For now, a description of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> nectaries is incomplete and data on floral nectar characteristics are lacking. Our aims are to examine (i) the anatomy and ultrastructure of the floral nectaries and (ii) nectar production and carbohydrate composition, with emphasis on possible changes in nectar composition between individual plants. The present study is performed in the framework of a research programme on the reproductive biology of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> in the invaded areas.
