<p>Although the nectaries and attractiveness of floral nectar to potential pollinators in many crucifers, including economically important species, have been extensively studied (e.g. Pierre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1999</xref>; Kołtowski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2002</xref>; Masierowska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>; Denisow 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>, Masierowska and Piętka 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>), the data on the nectary structure and nectar production in invasive Brassicacean taxa are scarce.
