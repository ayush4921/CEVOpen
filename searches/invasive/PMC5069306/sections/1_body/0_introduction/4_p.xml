<p>According to Fahn (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2003</xref>). As reported by LÃ¼ttge (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2013</xref>), the photosynthetic capacity of green nectaries is of the same order of magnitude as that of leaves, and photosynthesis in these glands can potentially provide sugars and reduction equivalents for the redox cycle of nectar. Green nectaries occur in many plant species. Also, floral nectaries in the Brassicaceae consist of parenchyma with chloroplasts (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>). The origin of nectar carbohydrates can impact on nectar volume, carbohydrate concentration and composition, which directly influence the activity and type of floral insect visitors, and thus play an important role in the reproductive success of a flower (Heil
