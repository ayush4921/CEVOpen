<p>The flowers of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> contained relatively small amounts of nectar, but their energetic reward was equivalent to other species pollinated by short-tongued bees. The amount of 0.3 mg sugar per flower may be typical for short-tongued bees (Cruden and Hermann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1983</xref>). In fact, Knuth (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1908</xref>) recorded small and medium-sized flies and bees as visitors to 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers. Also, Schürkens and Chittka (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2001</xref>) and Denisow (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>) pointed out that the most common visitors to 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> were short-tongued bumblebees (
 <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> and 
 <italic>Bombus lapidarius</italic>), honeybees (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) and small mining bees (
 <italic>Andrena</italic> sp.), even though pollination syndromes would categorize this flower as fly-pollinated. Since populations of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> include closely spaced plants displaying abundant flowers (Denisow 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>), it is not surprising that medium-sized bees and flies also foraged actively on the flowers. Floral display has been proposed to play a major role for attractiveness of other invasive plants (Vanparys et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2008</xref>).
