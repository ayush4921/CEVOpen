<p>The phenotypic generalization of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers, including accessible nectaries and rewards, welcomes an array of more or less specialist insect visitors. Although the production of nectar by a single flower is low, the abundant floral display of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> plants as well as its occurrence in dense patches makes this species a very attractive nectar source. The impact that such mass flowering stands of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> make on the fitness of native plant species deserves further studies.
