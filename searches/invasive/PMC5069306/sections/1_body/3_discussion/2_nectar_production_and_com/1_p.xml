<p>Flowers of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> appear to be entomophilous because of their visually attractive petals, abundant pollen and presence of active nectaries. Insect pollination is important for reproductive success, i.e. seed setting, in crucifers. Even species considered as autogamous or partly autogamous benefit from insect visits; therefore, the presence of a floral reward such as nectar in their flowers is important (e.g. Williams

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1981</xref>; Masierowska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>). Nectar secretion in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers started when petals opened, with beginning of pollen shedding and lasted until petals wilted. The arrangement of floral organs makes nectar accessible for different groups of insects. In this study, the quantities of nectar produced by flowers as well as amounts of sugars secreted in nectar were relatively low. Total nectar carbohydrates production per ten 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers averaged 0.3 mg. It was about 10× and 20× lower compared to values obtained for flowers of cultivated crucifers, i.e. 
 <italic>Sinapis alba</italic> (Masierowska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>) or 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (Kołtowski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2002</xref>), respectively, but 3-fold higher than the amount of nectar sugar per flower in another brassicacean invasive species, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (Cruden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>). Mean sugar concentration of nectar, which was 28 %, was in the range reported for other crucifers (Free 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1993</xref> and references herein). These findings support the conclusion of Schürkens and Chittka (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2001</xref>) about relatively low nectar productivity in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers. According to these authors, in this species, the amount of nectar sugar flower
