<p>In this study, significant differences between individual plants both for glucose and fructose content in nectar as well for glucose/fructose ratio were stated. However, glucose/fructose ratios always exceeded 1 and nectar was considered as hexose-dominant. The large interplant differences in total nectar-sugar production per flower within species are well known (Cruden and Hermann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1983</xref>), and nectar characteristic can be affected by various factors (as was discussed earlier) at different levels of plant organization. In the Brassicaceae, Davis et al. (
