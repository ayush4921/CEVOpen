<p>To conclude, floral nectaries in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> exhibit a number of homogenous traits to nectaries described in other representatives of the Brassicaceae. The similarities include the location and number of secretory glands in a flower, photosynthetic type of nectaries consisting of epidermis, glandular tissue and phloem alone, cuticle ornamentation, inequality in secretory activity as well as vascularisation between lateral and median glands, an eccrine mechanism of nectar secretion and nectar release through the nectary stomata. Furthermore, the sugar composition of nectar (hexose-dominant) is very common along brassicacean taxa.
