<p>Nectar yield and quantity of sugars secreted in nectar differed substantially between vegetation seasons. Many variables can affect nectar parameters, including abiotic factors, e.g. habitat, humidity, temperature, solar radiation or CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (see Nicolson and Thornburg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2007</xref>) or biotic factors such as the presence of microbial communities (Herrera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). In our study, nectar yield and quantity of sugars were impaired during warm and dry weather conditions with air temperature approx. 1–2 °C higher and precipitation lower 50–60 % than in the long term. Furthermore, nectar volume, sugar concentration and carbohydrate composition are also related to the structural and physiological attributes of a plant itself (Shuel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1955</xref>) and its flowers (Galetto and Bernardello 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>). The nectar sugar quantity within plants of the same crucifer species can easily vary even more than 2 times (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>).
