<p>The apical part of lateral nectaries of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> was covered by a thick layer of cuticle with very distinct striation, especially in the neighbourhood of nectary stomata. The cuticle with clear and deep ornamentation favours the longer retention of nectar on the surface of the nectary and protects secretion against drying (Nagy TÃ³th et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2000</xref>). Epidermis of median glands of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> was smooth and completely lacked nectary stomata. Similarly, not a single modified stoma was found in the median nectaries of 
 <italic>S. loeselii</italic> flowers (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>). Moreover, no nectar droplet was observed on the petal claw opposite these nectaries. The differences in cuticle ornamentation between lateral and median glands of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> are consistent with the earlier reports on another brassicacean species 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1994</xref>; Baum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>).
