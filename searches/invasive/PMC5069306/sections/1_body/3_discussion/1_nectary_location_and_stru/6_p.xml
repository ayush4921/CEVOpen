<p>The receptacular nectaries of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> were supplied solely by phloem strands, and an inequality in phloem vascularization between lateral and median glands was observed, which is in accordance with the other Brassicaceae studied previously (see Frei 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1955</xref>; Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref> and references herein). According to Frey-Wyssling (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1955</xref>) and Fahn (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1979b</xref>), there is a positive correlation between the amount of sugars in nectar and the amount of phloem elements supplying the nectaries. This correlation seems to be true for the species examined in this study, as the phloem elements are well developed in lateral glands. A remarkable feature of companion cells of phloem in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> nectaries is a lack of cell wall ingrowths. According to Davis et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>), wall ingrowths were absent in companion cells of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> nectaries, but these cells may still function as transfer cells. They may play an important role in the unloading of phloem sap and passing pre-nectar constituents to secretory parenchyma cells and intercellular spaces next to them. The intercellular spaces are more or less conspicuous, but always are present among cells of this tissue.
