<p>Flowers of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> possess median and lateral pair of nectaries, situated between sepals and stamens, in the region of filament bases. In general, their topography and number are similar to that reported by Appel and Al-Shehbaz (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>) and Al-Shehbaz (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>) for the genus 
 <italic>Bunias</italic> and typical for members of the Brassicaceae family (e.g. Clemente Muñoz and Hernández Bermejo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1978</xref>; Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>; Deng and Hu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>, Masierowska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>). In contrast, Knuth (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1908</xref>) reported that 
 <italic>Bunias</italic> flowers possessed only two nectaries placed on inner sides of short stamens, which could indicate the presence only of lateral glands and a total lack of median glands. Absence of median nectaries was not confirmed in the present study.
