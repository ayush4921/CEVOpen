<p>In floral nectaries of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic>, mitochondria occurred in great numbers whereas ER cisternae and dictyosomes, though present, were not abundant. Moreover, mitochondria were grouped along cell walls. This ultrastructural evidence suggests that an eccrine mechanism of nectar secretion, dependent on energy for active transport of sugars across cell membranes (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>; Razem and Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1999</xref>; Wist and Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2006</xref>), operates here. An active transmembrane transport of nectar sugar molecules was characteristic of nectar secretory cells in another crucifer species, 
 <italic>Barbarea vulgaris</italic> (Kotayeva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</xref>). A granulocrine secretory mechanism involving reverse pinocytosis of secretory vesicles is less likely because of paucity of endoplasmic reticulum and dictyosomes in cytoplasm when compared to other nectaries (Kronestedt-Robards and Robards 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1991</xref>; Fahn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>). However, dicyosomes were present in secretory parenchyma of lateral nectaries so their involvement in a granulocrine process cannot be excluded. Similar conclusions were drawn for the floral nectaries of 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>) as well as for that of 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> (Wist and Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2006</xref>). However, according to Matheson et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2006</xref>), dictyosomes are involved in the production of polysaccharides rather than the sugar components of nectar.
