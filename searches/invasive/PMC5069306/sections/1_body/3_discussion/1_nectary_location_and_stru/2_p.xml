<p>The nectarium of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> is intermediate between two nectary types: the lateral and median nectary type (in which lateral and median glands are separate) and the annular nectary type (in which both nectaries are fused) sensu Deng and Hu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>). In examined flowers, nectarial tissue of laterals partly enclosed each filament of the short stamens and a ridge of tissue connected lateral glands to median glands. Moreover, differences in the size of nectarial glands were noted; lateral nectaries were larger than median ones. Unification of nectariferous tissue and very prominent lateral glands may account for Knuthâ€™s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1908</xref>) report of two nectaries per flower. The present results are in agreement with Appel and Al-Shehbaz (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>) and Al-Shehbaz (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>). According to these authors, lateral nectaries in 
 <italic>Bunias</italic> L. are annular or semi-annular and median glands are often confluent with laterals. Connections of nectarial tissue at both lateral and median positions occur in other brassicacean species, even if the borders between individual glands can be defined, e.g. 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>) or 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Baum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>), and unification of lateral and median glands into the annular type is considered as an evolutionary advanced trait within the Brassicaceae (Deng and Hu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>).
