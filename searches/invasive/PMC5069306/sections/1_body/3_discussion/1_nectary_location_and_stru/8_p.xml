<p>Nectar exudation in lateral nectaries is achieved through nectary stomata. The nectary stomata are modified, losing the capacity to close completely (Davis and Gunning 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1992</xref>). Nectar release through the nectary stomata is the most typical mode observed in many crucifers (Deng and Hu

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2000</xref>), the location of nectary stomata could be related to the adaptation of a species to its environment. The position of the stomata mainly at the level of the gland epidermal cells might indicate the occurrence of mesomorphic features in the studied species.
