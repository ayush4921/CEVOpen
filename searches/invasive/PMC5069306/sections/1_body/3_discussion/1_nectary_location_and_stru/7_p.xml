<p>Intercellular spaces located mainly in the distal part of nectaries, especially close to the epidermis, relatively thin cellulosic cell walls and the presence of plasmodesmata between nectariferous cells and between these and the epidermal cells, indicate both the apoplastic and symplastic pathway of pre-nectar and nectar movement. The models for the movement of pre-nectar along apoplast or symplast within secretory tissue and the subsequent secretion of nectar have been proposed by several researches (e.g. Kronestedt-Robards and Robards
