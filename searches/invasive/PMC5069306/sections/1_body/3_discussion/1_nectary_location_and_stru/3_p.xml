<p>The nectar-producing tissue of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> has a general structure comparable with that of many other brassicacean species (see Deng and Hu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>; Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref> and references herein). The green glands of this species represent the type of photosynthetic nectaries consisting of epidermis, glandular tissue and phloem alone supplying lateral glands only.
