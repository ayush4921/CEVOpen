<p>Under field conditions, it was not observable if, in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers, nectar is produced by the lateral nectaries or by the medians as well. The lack of modified stomata and absence of phloem entering the median glands indicate that nectar originates from the lateral nectaries only. However, some activity of the median nectaries cannot be totally excluded as plastids with partly hydrolyzed starch grains were present within their secreting parenchyma cells. The differences in photosynthetic and secretory activity of lateral and median nectaries in 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flowers deserve further investigation under controlled laboratory conditions.
