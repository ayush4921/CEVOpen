<p>Nectar carbohydrate composition was analysed in spring 2012. A total of 15 nectar samples were taken from unvisited flowers randomly chosen on five different plant individuals—three samples per individual. Each sample contained nectar from 10 to 15 flowers. Nectar was collected using wicks (8 × 15 mm) of Whatman No. 1 filter paper (McKenna and Thomson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1988</xref>). Next, the nectar-laden wicks were pinned, air-dried and stored at −20 °C. Before analysis, wicks were thawed to room temperature. Then, to recover nectar from the filter paper, they were placed in 0.6 ml distilled water in Eppendorf centrifuge tubes and spun for 0.5 h at 10,000 (rpm) at 15 °C. The analysis of nectar carbohydrates was carried out using the HPLC technique. Following filtration of the sample using a sterile syringe filter (0.45 μm pore size), 0.3 ml per sample was analysed by a Gilson HPLC apparatus equipped with Knauer’s RI 
 <italic>K-</italic>2300 refractometric detector. Carbohydrates were separated using an Aminex HPX - 87H column (300 mm long, 7.8 mm i.d.) coupled with a Bio-Rad guard column (30 mm long, 4.6 mm i.d.). Elution of carbohydrates was carried out using a mobile phase comprising 30 mM sulphuric acid (0.5 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup>) at a column temperature of 42 °C. The contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose were determined and expressed as a percentage of total sugars.
