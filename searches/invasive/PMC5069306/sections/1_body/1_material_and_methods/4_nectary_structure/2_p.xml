<p>For LM examination, semi-thin sections of nectaries were prepared. Floral material was fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; 0.1 M) for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes in phosphate buffer. Then, it was treated with 1 % osmium tetraoxide solution at 0 °C for 1.5 h and washed three times in distilled water. After dehydration in a graded ethanol series, the samples were infiltrated in a medium grade LR White acrylic resin (Sigma-Aldrich). Following polymerization at 60 °C, sections were cut by a Reichert Ultracut-S ultramicrotome and a glass knife at a thickness of 0.7–0.9 μm. For general histology, semi-thin sections were stained with 1 % (
