<p>In 2012, the structure of floral nectaries was studied in nectar-bearing flowers at the 2nd day of anthesis. The distribution of secretory glands in fresh flowers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) was investigated under an Olympus SZX12 stereoscopic microscope. Then, the nectaries were prepared for investigations by means of light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
