<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for data on nectar characteristics and nectar tissues measurements and are presented as mean values ± SD (standard deviation). For glucose, fructose and sucrose content in nectar, coefficient of variation (CV) was computed. The differences in nectar amount, nectar concentration and nectar sugar quantity per flower between years of study were subjected to separate one-way ANOVAs. Additionally, the differences in the mean values of nectar carbohydrate composition (glucose and fructose) between individual plants were analysed. When significant differences were detected, post hoc comparison was made by means of the HSD Tukey test. The level of statistical significance required to measure differences between the means for all analyses was 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05. All data analyses were performed using STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., Kraków, Poland) software.
