<p>Nectar production was studied during a peak of flowering, i.e. in late May. In order to assess flower longevity and period of nectar production, flower buds (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20 per year) were randomly chosen and tagged just before opening and their development and presence of nectar were observed. Nectar production was investigated by covering whole plants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10–15 per year) that had flowers in the bud stage, with tulle isolators (mesh size &lt; 1 mm). Plants were kept bagged until nectar sampling. Two-day flowers were collected from isolated plants between 09:00 and 10:00 and transported immediately into the laboratory. Then, the nectar amount (in mg) produced in an individual flower was measured using Jabłoński’s pippetes (Jabłoński 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2002</xref>) and a WPS-36 analytical balance (RADWAG, Radom, Poland). Each year of a study, nectar samples were taken on three dates in 3–5 replications. A single sample contained nectar collected from 5 to 10 flowers. Nectar sugar concentration (% wt/ total wt) was measured using a RL-4 refractometer (PZO, Warszawa Poland). Then, nectar amount and sugar concentration of nectar were used to calculate the total sugar amount (in mg) secreted in nectar per 10 flowers.
