<p>Each lateral nectary consisted of a single-layered epidermis and 11–18 layers of subepidermal nectariferous parenchyma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). The epidermis was composed of small cells (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). They contained a large, centrally located nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>) and were highly vacuolated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). The relatively thick outer walls of the epidermal cells were covered by a distinct cuticle, which stained intensely with auramine O (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Examination under TEM revealed slight outward projections of the cuticle overlying epidermal cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Subepidermal nectariferous parenchyma cells had very thin cellulosic cell walls and contained intense staining cytoplasm and centrally positioned nuclei (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). Several small vacuoles, traversed by cytoplasmic strands, were present. Treatment with PAS revealed numerous starch-containing plastids which were located mostly in the deeper layers of the nectary parenchyma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Additionally, autofluorescence of the chlorophyll was observed in nectary parenchyma cells, whereas it was almost completely lacking in the epidermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Plasmodesmatal connections between nectary parenchyma cells were observed infrequently. Intercellular spaces were located especially close to the epidermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The nectaries were supplied by phloem alone (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Sieve tube elements of variable number and dimensions and associated companion cells were constantly detected in the nectariferous tissue. Depending on the location of phloem, discrete bundles or numerous strands of sieve tube elements were observed. However, multiple sieve tubes elements penetrated only to a depth of one to three cell layers of the nectary parenchyma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>).
