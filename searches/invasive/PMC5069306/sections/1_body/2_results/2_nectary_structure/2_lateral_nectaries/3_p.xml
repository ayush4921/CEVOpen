<p>Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that secretory cells contained numerous ribosomes, resulting in highly granular appearance of the cytoplasm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–f</xref>). Plastids without or with very few partly hydrolyzed starch grains were observed both in the epidermis and in the subepidermal layer of secretory parenchyma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>). In contrast, in the deeper layers of nectary parenchyma, numerous plastids with starch grains were noted (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>). Dictyosomes and cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum were observed very rarely in the secretory cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>). Numerous mitochondria were present in the nectariferous cells, being aligned along cell walls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Intercellular spaces were infrequent towards the nectary base and were relatively small (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, e</xref>). Radial wall plasmodesmatal connections between adjacent epidermal cells were not observed. However, plasmodesmata were infrequently present both between epidermal and subepidermal nectary parenchyma cells and between neighbouring parenchyma cells. Out of 18 sections examined here, 3 plasmodesmata were found. The sieve elements had parietal cytoplasm with very few organelles. The neighbouring companion cells contained small vacuoles, numerous mitochondria and ribosomes. In addition, wall ingrowths neither in the nectariferous nor in the companion cells were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).
