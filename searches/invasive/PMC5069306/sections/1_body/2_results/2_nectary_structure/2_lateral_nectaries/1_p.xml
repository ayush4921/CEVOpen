<p>The lateral nectaries were semiannular, wedge-shaped with two or three shallow furrows dividing the gland into 3–4 lobes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–c</xref>). The apical part of the nectary was covered with a striate cuticle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d–f</xref>) while in the lower parts of the secretory glands the surface of the epidermis was relatively smooth. Nectar was released through modified stomata. The nectariferous tissue bore both mature and immature solitary stomata which occurred predominantly atop the upper surface of the lobes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Stomata were placed at the same level as other epidermal cells of the nectary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). They lacked subsidiary cells, and the cells adjoining to guard cells did not differ from other epidermal cells; thus, stomata may be considered anomocytic. Most of the stomatal apertures were wide open and were lined by well-formed cuticular ledges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). The pores of guard cells of the modified stomata were lined by relatively thick cell wall with distinct cuticular beaks and a small substomatal space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The remnants of secreted material, presumably derived from the crystallization of the nectar, were observed on the surface of stomata and adjacent epidermal cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). Occasionally, a complete occlusion of the apertures of the modified stomata was also observed.
