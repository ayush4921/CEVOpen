<p>The median nectaries consisted of a single layer of epidermal cells and 6–10 layers of subepidermal secretory parenchyma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). The epidermal cells and nectariferous parenchyma cells were slightly larger when compared to those in laterals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Epidermal cells had large nuclei, several plastids with starch grains, and in contrast to nectary parenchyma cells, they were highly vacuolated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The outer cell walls were covered with a smooth cuticle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Parenchyma cells contained large nuclei and numerous plastids with starch grains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). Their cytoplasm stained intensely with methylene blue-Azur B solution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The median nectaries were not directly vascularized; however, the vascular bundles that supply the sepals run at its basal part (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>).
