<p>TEM observations revealed numerous ribosomes and mitochondria in the cytoplasm of the nectariferous cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, d</xref>). Plastids with one or two partly hydrolyzed starch grains were observed in secretory cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>) whereas ER cisternae and dictyosomes were lacking. The small vacuoles containing osmophilic fibrillar material were numerous (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Plasmodesmata were observed between secretory parenchyma cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Intercellular spaces were small but not absent and were located in the distal region of the median nectary, especially close to the epidermis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).
