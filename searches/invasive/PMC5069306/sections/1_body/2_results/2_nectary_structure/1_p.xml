<p>The flowers of 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> have four green nectaries (two lateral and two median) placed at the base of the ovary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–b</xref>). Lateral nectaries are surrounded by the filaments of two petals and one short stamen, while medians are located outside the filaments of two long stamens. Narrow bands of nectarial tissue connecting lateral nectaries to adjacent median ones were observed (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As a result, medians were often confluent with laterals. Both types of the nectaries differed in terms of their morphology and anatomy (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
