<p>The data concerning nectar production are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The amount of nectar produced per 10 flowers varied widely from 0.2 to 3.7 mg and averaged 1.1 mg. Statistical analysis showed that the nectar amount demonstrated a significant year effect (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2, 30</sub> = 40.489, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In 2009, flowers of investigated species produced 7.8× and 3.4× more nectar than in 2007 and 2012, respectively. The nectar concentration was moderate and ranged between 12.0 and 36.0 %. No significant year effect on the nectar sugar concentration (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2, 30</sub> = 0.418, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.665) was detected. The total mass of sugar in nectar per 10 flowers differed significantly between the years of study (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2, 30</sub> = 48.796, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). The relationship was similar to that stated for the nectar quantity. The highest mean total mass of sugar in nectar was produced in 2009 and reached 0.9 mg/10 flowers. These differences were caused by weather conditions. Hotter temperatures and shortage of precipitation in 2007 and 2012, as compared with 2009, impaired nectar yield and sugar production.
