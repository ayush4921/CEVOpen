<p>Life span of a free-pollinated 
 <italic>B. orientalis</italic> flower was approximately 1.8 to 3.2 days (2.2 days on average). Nectar release began with the opening of the flower, along with the start of pollen presentation (i.e. when at least one anther opened) and lasted to the end of anthesis (i.e. when perianth began to wilt). The floral nectar was produced by nectaries situated adjacent to the stamen filament bases and was accumulated between filaments (Fig.
