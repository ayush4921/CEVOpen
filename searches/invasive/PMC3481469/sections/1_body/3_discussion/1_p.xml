 <italic>Salbia lotanalis</italic> has already been recognized as a potential biological control agent due its high reproductive capacity and impact on young plants (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27">Morais et al. 2010b</xref>). The constant presence of 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> in the field under a range of climatic conditions indicates that this lepidopteran may establish well in new areas if introduced as a classical biocontrol agent against 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic>, since natural enemies that are frequent in the native range are likely to become frequent in the introduced environment (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38">Sheppard 2002</xref>). The host specificity study demonstrated that 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>lotanalis</italic> could feed on the leaves of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>hirta</italic>. Additionally, its caterpillars were not found in other species in the field. Although this species may attack 
 <italic>C</italic>. hirta in the new range, this does not hinder its introduction as a biocontrol agent for 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic>, because 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>hirta</italic> is also a major invasive outside the neotropics (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39">Wester and Wood 1977</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24">Medeiros et al. 1997</xref>). In case 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>lotanalis</italic> attacks 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic> in the Pacific islands this would be regarded as highly beneficial.
