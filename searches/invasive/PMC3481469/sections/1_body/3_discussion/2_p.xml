<p>A closely related leaf roller, 
 <italic>Salbia haemorrhoidalis</italic> was used in successful programs for the biological control of 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> in South Africa. This species showed good establishment and distribution in this country, as well as high population densities (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr01">Baars 2003</xref>). Another great advantage of employing 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>lotanalis</italic> as a biocontrol agent is that it can be easily reared under laboratory conditions, with high population growth rates (Morais et al. 2010).
