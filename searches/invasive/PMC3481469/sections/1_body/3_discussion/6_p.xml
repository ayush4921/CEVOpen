 <italic>Pleuroprucha rudimentaria</italic> is also a potential biocontrol agent for 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic>. Fruit production decreased about 40% in the flowering period of 2005 in Viçosa and Dionísio possibly owing to this insect's attack. Furthermore, an 
 <italic>ad hoc</italic> observation of a severe attack was observed in Viçosa in 2006 (Morais, personal observations). 
 <italic>Pleuroprucha rudimentaria</italic> is reported to occur in Costa Rica, Peru, Jamaica, and Venezuela, but there is no information about its host specificity (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr06">BLDS 2010</xref>). During the field evaluations, no caterpillars of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>rudimentaria</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cardinata</italic> were found attacking others plant species. Therefore, it would be worth conducting additional host— specificity tests for these species.
