<p>Considering the difficulty and high cost of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> control by chemical or mechanical removal (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr08">Burnett et al. 2007</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18">Hester et al. 2010</xref>), the introduction of effective biocontrol agents is regarded as necessary to reduce the population density of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> in Tahiti and Hawaii. Therefore, the traits of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>lotanalis</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>inscita</italic>, such as host specificity, high population growth rate, high rate of damage to the plants, relatively easy massâ€”rearing under laboratory conditions, and occurrence in the field throughout the year indicate that these lepidopterans can become good classical biocontrol agents against 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic>. Furthermore, if 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cardinata</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>rudimentaria</italic> have a sufficient degree of host specificity demonstrated in future tests, these caterpillars could also be considered for use as biocontrol agents.
