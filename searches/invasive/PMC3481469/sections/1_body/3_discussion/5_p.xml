 <italic>Carposina cardinata</italic> is an important fruit borer of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic>. Attacks of this lepidopteran can reduce seed fruit production. Studies have verified that herbivores of reproductive structures can be very effective weed biocontrol agents because they can reduce recruitment to the seedling stage of the populations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr05">Bellows and Headrick 1999</xref>). A similar 
 <italic>Carposina</italic>, 
 <italic>C. bullata</italic> Meyrick, was used as a biocontrol agent of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>hirta</italic> in Hawaii, where it established and became very effective. This species feeds internally in the flower buds and is specific to the 
 <italic>Miconia</italic> and 
 <italic>Clidemia</italic> and the damage to the flowers of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>hirta</italic> prevents seed production (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30">Nakahara et al. 1992</xref>). The major difficulty in the introduction of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>bullata</italic> was obtaining sufficient numbers of individuals to be released because no mass—rearing method was developed (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13">Culliney and Nagamine 2000</xref>). Here, we verified that 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cardinata</italic> could be reared in the laboratory during the fruiting period of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> and a great number of adults could be obtained. Another example of 
 <italic>Carposina</italic> used in control of weed is the seed—moth, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>autologa</italic> introduced in South Africa to control a serious invasive plant 
 <italic>Hakea sericea</italic>, a small tree Australian origin (
