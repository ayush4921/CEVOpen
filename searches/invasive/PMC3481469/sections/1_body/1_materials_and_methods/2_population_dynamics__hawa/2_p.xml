<p>Seeds were collected in Hawaii and germinated in a box with sand. When the seedlings were at a height of 30â€”40 cm, they were transplanted into the ground at Guaraciaba the experimental area next to 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> plants that grew naturally. Seedlings were arranged in a row with 2 m spacing between the plants. From September 2005 to February 2006, the natural attacks on these seedlings by caterpillars were also assessed during the site visits. Evaluations were made until February 2006 because after this time, the seedlings did not establish in the field due to defoliation by ants (
 <italic>Atta</italic> spp.).
