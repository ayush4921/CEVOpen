<p>During the population peaks of Lepidoptera, 10 caterpillars of each species were collected in the field and brought to the laboratory to verify the emergence of parasitoids. These caterpillars were maintained in a rearing room with a light regime of 12:12 L:D, 26 ±2 °C air temperature, and 70 ±10% relative humidity. The defoliator caterpillars were placed in plastic bags (40 ×50 cm) with leaves of M

 <italic>M. calvescens.</italic> The bags, pots, and cages that contained the caterpillars were maintained in a rearing room until the caterpillars pupated. The number of parasitized caterpillars and the number of emerged adult parasitoids of each Caterpillar were counted every day. The adult parasitoids were collected and forwarded to Dr. Maria Angélica Penteado-Dias for species identification.
