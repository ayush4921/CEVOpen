<p>The seeds of the Melastomataceae species were extracted from fresh fruits of trees located in the field where the evaluations were performed. The seeds of the Hawaiian biotype of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> were collected in Hawaii. The seeds were germinated in a box with sand. After about three months, when seedlings were 10–20 cm tall, they were transplanted to 5 L pots with soil. When the seedlings were 70–100 cm tall, four seedlings of each Melastomataceae species were put in a wooden cage (0.5 ×1.0 ×1.2 m), enclosed in organza and infested with five 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> caterpillars of the third instar. The caterpillars were reared in rooms similar to that described above. The instar of the caterpillars, their survival and the damage they caused to the seedlings were recorded daily.
