<p>Caterpillars of 
 <italic>P. rudimentaria</italic> were reared in wooden cages (0.5 ×0.5 ×0.5 m) and enclosed in organza with 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> inflorescences. The inflorescences were collected in the field and maintained with their peduncle immersed in glass bottles containing 100 mL of water. 20 caterpillars of the same instar and four inflorescences were put in each cage. The inflorescences were changed every five days. Pupae were separated by sex according to characters described by Butt and Cantu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr09">1962</xref>) and placed into plastic pots with wet vermiculite. The emerged adults were transferred to wooden cages (same characters described above) with four 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> inflorescences. 10 pairs of 
 <italic>P. rudimentaria</italic> were placed in each cage, and they were fed with a 10% honey solution. After the eggs hatched, caterpillars were transferred to new 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> inflorescences and reared as mentioned above.
