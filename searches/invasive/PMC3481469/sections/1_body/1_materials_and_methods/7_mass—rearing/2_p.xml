<p>Emerged adults were transferred to a wooden cage (0.5 ×1.0 ×1.2 m) and enclosed in organza with a young 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> plant (0.8–1.0 m high). 10 pairs were placed inside each cage and fed with a 10% honey solution. After the eggs hatched, the caterpillars were transferred with a fine brush to leaves of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic>, which were put inside plastic bags (40 ×50 cm) and maintained in a rearing room, following the same procedures mentioned above.
