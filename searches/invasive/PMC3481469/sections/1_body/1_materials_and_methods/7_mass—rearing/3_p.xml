 <italic>Miconia calvescens</italic> fruits attacked by 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cardinata</italic> were collected in the field and put in into transparent 2 L plastic pots (14 cm diameter, 14 cm height). Each pot received about 80 g of fruit. The pots were capped with organza and their bottoms were covered with paper for absorbing the dampness of the fruits. When the fruits began to rot, the caterpillars were removed and transferred to pots containing fresh fruits. As caterpillars attained the pupa stage outside the fruits, the pupae could be seen and removed from the pots. The pupae were separated by sex according to characters described by Butt and Cantu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr09">1962</xref>) and placed into plastic pots with wet vermiculite. The emerged adults were transferred to pots containing mature fruits of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic>. 10 pairs of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cardinata</italic> were put in each pot, and they were fed with a 10% honey solution. Emerged caterpillars from these pots were reared as mentioned above.
