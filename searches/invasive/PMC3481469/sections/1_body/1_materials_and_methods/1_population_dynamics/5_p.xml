<p>Each evaluation involved the randomised sampling of ten 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> plants, each one with a height of 1–7 m and a basal trunk diameter of 6–15 mm. For each plant, the number of Lepidoptera was counted in the main stem, six secondary branches, six inflorescences, and six infructescences. Leaves and buds from the secondary branches were examined. Six infrutescences were also brought to the laboratory to determinate whether Lepidoptera larvae were present inside the fruits. During the evaluations, the organ that each Lepidoptera attacked and the type and level of the damage caused by each species were recorded.
