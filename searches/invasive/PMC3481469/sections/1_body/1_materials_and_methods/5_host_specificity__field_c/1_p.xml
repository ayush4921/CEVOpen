<p>During the evaluations, all vegetation in the 2 m radius of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> sampled during the population dynamics experiment was also observed to check whether the Lepidoptera species had attacked other plant species. Among the species found close to 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic>, other Melastomataceae were found. The most common were as follows: 
 <italic>Clidemia capitellata</italic> (
 <italic>Bonpl</italic>.) D. Don., 
 <italic>Clidemia hirta</italic> (L.) Don, 
 <italic>Leandra lacunosa Cogn, Miconia albicans</italic> (Sw.) Triana, 
 <italic>M. mendoncaei</italic> Cogn., 
 <italic>Miconia ibaguensis</italic> (Bonpl.), and 
 <italic>Ossala confertiflora</italic> (DC). Organs of these species were carried to the laboratory to determinate whether Lepidoptera larvae were present inside.
