 <italic>Salbia lotanalis, D</italic>. 
 <italic>inscita,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. leucocyma</italic> can be reared throughout the year under laboratory conditions. As 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> trees maintain a large number of leaves throughout the year, the caterpillars of these species have plenty of food throughout the year. Furthermore, 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> leaves stayed in good condition for a week when they were kept in the plastic bags. 
 <italic>Salbia lotanalis</italic> was the easiest to rear in the laboratory because of its shorter life cycle (about 70–100 days), high reproductive rate (∼90 eggs/female), and low mortality rate (more than 70% of individuals reached the adult stage). The life cycles of 
 <italic>D. inscita</italic> and of 
 <italic>A. leucocyma</italic> are longer, lasting 150–200 and 100–120 days, respectively. The reproductive rate of both these species is smaller (about 30 eggs/female).
