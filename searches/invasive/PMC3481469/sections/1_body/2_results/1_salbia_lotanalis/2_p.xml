<p>The density of 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> was higher in Dionísio and Guaraciaba than Viçosa. In Dionísio, population peaks occurred from January to April 2002 and from May to October 2004. In Guaraciaba, 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> caterpillars were found throughout the whole evaluation period, with population peaks from June to September 2005. In Viçosa, 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> caterpillars were found occasionally and at a low density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02_01">Figure 2A</xref>). During population peaks, the damage caused by these caterpillars to 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> plants was high, amounting to 50% defoliation. In these periods, some 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> seedlings (Brazilian biotype) died due the high levels of defoliation by this leaf roller.
