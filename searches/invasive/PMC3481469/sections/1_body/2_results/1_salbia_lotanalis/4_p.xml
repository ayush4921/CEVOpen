<p>Nearly 10% 
 <italic>of S. lotanalis</italic> caterpillars brought from the field were parasitized. Three parasitoid species were found: two Hymenoptera [
 <italic>Apanteles</italic> sp. (Braconidae) and 
 <italic>Pediobius</italic> sp. (Eulophidae)] and a Diptera (Tachinidae). 
 <italic>Apanteles</italic> sp. larvae emerged from the last instar of 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> and pupated outside the caterpillars. The pupae of this braconid are white, and about 20–30 larvae emerged from each caterpillar. Pupae of Tachinidae were also found in the last instar of 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic>. The pupae of this Diptera are brown, and about 6–10 pupae emerged in each caterpillar. Three 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> pupae were also parasitized by Conura sp. (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae) in October 2004.
