<p>In the field, 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> caterpillars were not found on other plants species, including the other Melastomataceae assessed (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01_01">Table 1</xref>). However, a similar species, 
 <italic>Ategumia matutinalis</italic> Guen√©e, was observed attacking 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic>. 
 <italic>Ategumia matutinalis</italic> caterpillars are very similar to 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic>, with similar wing color patterns as adults (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01_01">Figure 1D</xref>). In host specificity tests, 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> caterpillars were able to develop through to pupation on both 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic> and the Hawaiian biotype of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic>. In other Melastomataceae, no damage by caterpillars was verified, and they died of starvation (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01_01">Table 1</xref>).
