 <italic>Salbia lotanalis</italic> is a leaf roller. Its caterpillars roll leaves longitudinally, forming tubes where they feed and eventually pupate. One caterpillar is able to destroy an entire leaf, causing its abscission. Adults are small brown moths with yellowish patterns on the wings and caterpillars are green with black patterns on the body (
