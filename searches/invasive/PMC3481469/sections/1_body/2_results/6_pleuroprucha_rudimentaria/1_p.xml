 <italic>Pleuroprucha rudimentaria</italic> caterpillars feed on flowers. These caterpillars are brown, with white stripes and a distinctive 
 <italic>looping walk</italic> (
 <italic>Figure 1J</italic>—
 <italic>L</italic>). This species was found only in Viçosa and Guaraciaba. In Viçosa, caterpillars attacked 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> from April to June 2005 and in December 2005. In Guaraciaba, they were present from May to September 2005 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03_01">Figure 3B</xref>). During these population peaks, about 40% of inflorescences were completely stripped by this caterpillar species, and the fruit production of the 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>calvescens</italic> plants was extremely low. No 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>rudimentaria</italic> caterpillars brought to the laboratory were parasitized. This caterpillar was not found in other plant species, including the other Melastomataceae assessed (
