<p>About 30% of the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>leucocyma</italic> caterpillars brought from the field were parasitized by Hymenoptera (
 <italic>Apanteles</italic> sp. (Braconidae)). Many 
 <italic>A. leucocyma</italic> caterpillars found in the field had dark coloration, indicating that they were parasitized. Caterpillars of this Lepidoptera were not found in the other plant species assessed (
