 <italic>Carposina cardinata</italic> is a fruit borer of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> and is found only in Guaraciaba. Its caterpillars are beige and in the last instar they measure about 3 mm long. Adults are micro moths, bright gray, and measure about 5 mm (
 <italic>Figure 1H</italic>â€”
 <italic>I</italic>). They live inside fruits and feed on the flesh and seeds, causing severe damage. One to five caterpillars were found in each 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> fruit. 
 <italic>Carposina cardinata</italic> caterpillars were found in Guaraciaba in 2005, from March to September, which corresponded to the period of 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> fruit production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03_01">Figure 3A</xref>). No parasitized caterpillars were found. During this period, the following Melastomataceae were also in their fruiting periods: 
 <italic>C. capitellata, C. hirta, L. lacunosa</italic>, 
 <italic>M. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>M. mendoncaie</italic>, 
 <italic>M. ibaguenscens</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. confertiflora</italic>. However, no 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>cardinata</italic> was found in the fruits of any of these species (
