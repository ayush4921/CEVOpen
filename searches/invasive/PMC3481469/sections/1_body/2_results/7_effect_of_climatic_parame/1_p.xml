<p>There was a significant canonical correlation between the density of each Lepidopteran associated with 
 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> and climatic parameters (Wilks' Lambda = 0.35, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 2.72, df 
 <sub>num/den</sub>= 35/335, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Five canonical axes were generated, out of which only the first two were significant at 5% probability and explained 86% of the correlation. According to the first canonical axis, among the Lepidoptera, 
 <italic>S. lotanalis</italic> was the most influenced by the climatic parameters (r = -0.89), and according to the second axis, 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>inscita</italic> (r = 0.86) was the most influenced by the climatic parameters. The climatic parameters that most affected the Lepidoptera density were the maximum (r = 0.75) and average (r = 0.79) air temperature according to the first axis, and the minimum air temperature (0.57) according to the second axis (
