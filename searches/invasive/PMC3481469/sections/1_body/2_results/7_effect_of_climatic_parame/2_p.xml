<p>There was a positive Pearson correlation among the minimum, maximum, and average air temperatures and the population density of

 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>inscita</italic> were observed Dionísio, where air temperatures were higher (28.6, 19.6, 23.2 °C maximum, average, and minimum air temperatures, respectively) than Viçosa (27.2, 15.1, 20.1 °C maximum, average, and minimum air temperatures, respectively) and Guaraciaba (22.9, 16.3, 16.3 °C maximum, average, and minimum air temperatures, respectively) (

 <italic>lotanalis</italic> was more frequent in Guaraciaba, where the temperatures were lowest. In addition the population peaks of this caterpillar occurred in colder months (
