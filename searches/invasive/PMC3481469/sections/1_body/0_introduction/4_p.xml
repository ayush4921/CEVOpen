<p>Several species of Lepidoptera have been extensively used in the biological control of invasive plants (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr07">Boughton and Pemberton 2009</xref>), and others have been considered as potential agents (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15">Dhileepan et al. 2007</xref>). The major case of success was the introduction of 
 <italic>Cactoblastis cactorum</italic> Bergroth (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), a species native to Argentina that was introduced throughout the world for control of weedy 
 <italic>Opuntia</italic> spp. (Caryophyllales: Cactaceae) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35">Pettey 1948</xref>). Among the main arthropod groups used in the biological control programs of weeds (Acarina, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Thysanoptera), Lepidoptera were the fastest dispersers (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34">Paynter and Bellgard 2011</xref>). The natural dispersal ability of a new agent is a limiting factor for success of biological control of weeds.
