<p>In fact, establishment and spread are two distinct issues in biological control programs of weeds. The population dynamics of an agent post—introduction can be influenced by factors such as climate (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31">Nissen et al 1995</xref>). Crawley (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11">1986</xref>) found that 44% of the failures of weed control by biological agents are to due the non-adaptation of these organisms to climate conditions in the country of introduction. Surveys of abundance of possible biocontrol agent can be used to improve understanding of the climate effects on the agent and of its establishment in new areas (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40">Zalucki and van Klinken 2006</xref>). According to Paynter and Bellgard (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34">2011</xref>), the knowledge about parameters of a biocontrol agent, prior to its introduction (agent voltinism, parasitoid diversity in the native range, habitat, fecundity, taxon and life—style category) could be used to predict if it will establish and disperse in a new environment.
