 <italic>Miconia calvescens</italic> DC. (Myrtales: Melastomataceae) is a severe weed found in rainforest ecosystems on oceanic islands (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24">Medeiros et al. 1997</xref>), and is classified among the one hundred worst invasive species around the world (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22">Lowe et al. 2000</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29">Murphy et al. 2008</xref>). 
 <italic>Miconia calvescens</italic> is native to Central and South America and was introduced as an ornamental plant in French Polynesia, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and Australia (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24">Medeiros et al. 1997</xref>). On the Hawaiian and Tahitian Islands, the problems caused by the invasion of this weed are more serious, and many areas have become extensive monospecific stands of this plant (

 <italic>M. calvescens</italic> is more recent, but it has been classified as a major threat to the native biodiversity in the country (
