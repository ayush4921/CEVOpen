 <caption> Modelled global potential distribution of Bemisia tabaci s.l. under a composite scenario of natural rainfall and irrigation (Kriticos et al. 64 ). Outlying location records in northern China are thought to represent populations that overwinter in glasshouses in areas that are otherwise unsuitably cold for population persistence of B. tabaci MEAM1. The climate data is the CM30 1995H V2 dataset 65 . Map produced using ArcMap 10.6 (ESRI, Redlands, Ca., esri.com). </caption>
