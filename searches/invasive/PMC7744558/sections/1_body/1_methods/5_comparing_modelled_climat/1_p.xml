<p id="Par25">In order to further assess if the CLIMEX model fitted to 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 could be of use for understanding 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA climate suitability, we analysed the relationship between the EI values and observed 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> abundance data collected from cassava fields in East and southern Africa. Cassava fields were surveyed in seven regions across Uganda, Tanzania, and Malawi (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The first survey took place in September 2015 and the second survey took place in April 2016. In each region, we selected up to 10 fields of a known cassava variety to survey. Categories of adult 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> abundance on the top five leaves of 30 plants per field were recorded (0, 1–9, 10–99, 100–200, &gt; 200). For this analysis, only the presence or absence of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> adults was used. 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> adults collected here were presumed to be 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA (with samples collected to later confirm identity using molecular techniques).
