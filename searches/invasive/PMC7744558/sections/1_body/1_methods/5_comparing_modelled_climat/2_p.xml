<p id="Par26">The geocoded locations for the cassava fields were spatially intersected with CLIMEX results for East Africa. A logistic model was fitted in R (using the glm function with a binomial link) to the probability of presence of one or more whiteflies on a cassava plant as a function of CLIMEX EI. We ran the CLIMEX model using a 30-year climate average dataset centred on 1995 using the CRU data described above. The intent in comparing the modelled climate suitability with abundance data was to discern the patterns of agreement, rather than to be able to use modelled climate suitability to predict abundance with any great precision.</p>
