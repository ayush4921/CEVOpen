 </sup> we firstly aggregated the field counts to the grid of 121 climate cells covering Uganda used for the CLIMEX modelling. A linear mixed effects model fit by REML was used to model the relationship between modelled EI values in each cell and log (count + 1) for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in cassava fields and to check for consistency in this relationship through time.
