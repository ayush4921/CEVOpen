<p id="Par23">A comprehensive set of data on the field abundance of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) in Uganda was published recently
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>. This dataset includes field survey data collected from 2004 to 2017 with a gap for 2016, with 7Â 627 field summaries across 96 districts. While the survey effort changed in intensity and spatial pattern from year to year, it remains the most useful dataset of its kind. The field data show a clear pattern of invasion of CBSD into cassava fields in Uganda through this period, and these invasion dynamics confound any relationship between prevalence of CBSD and climate suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> sensu lato.
