<p id="Par20">Ten pairs (10 female and 10 male whiteflies) were introduced onto a cassava plant in an LL container. The LL container with the introduced whiteflies was left at room temperature (25 °C) for 24 h in the insectary at 14:10 light and darkness, at a relative humidity of 60%. After 24 h of feeding and ovipositing, all the adult whiteflies were removed from the cassava plant in the LL container and the number of eggs laid was recorded. Cassava plants in the LL containers were maintained at room temperature in the insectary for another 9 days and on the tenth day the numbers of emerged nymphs on each leaf were recorded. After recording the number of emerged nymphs, plants in the LL containers were transferred to A1000 growth chambers (Conviron Europe limited, UK) set at a given temperature treatment, 14:10 light and darkness, relative humidity of 60% for 5 days. On day 16, cassava plants in the LL containers were removed from the A1000 growth chambers and maintained at room temperature 25 °C in the insectary. Cassava plants in the LL containers were monitored every 2 days for emerged adults. The number of emerged male and female progenies were recorded, and the emerged whiteflies removed from the plant.</p>
