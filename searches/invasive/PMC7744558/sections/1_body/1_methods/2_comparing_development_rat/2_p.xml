<p id="Par19">Six temperature treatments: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C which were constant for day and night were used in the experiment. Each treatment was replicated five times across five cassava plants of cultivar Ebwanateraka, each in a Lock and Lock (LL) container. In some cases, one or two replicates out of the five failed, and hence reliable data was only obtained for three or four replicates for such treatments. The cassava cultivar Ebwanateraka was used because it was the predominant variety grown by farmers before the cassava mosaic disease pandemic in the early 1990s
