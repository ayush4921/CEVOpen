<p id="Par18">In order to assess whether the CLIMEX model parameters fitted for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 were relevant for modelling the climate suitability for SSA 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, we assessed the development rates of three 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA taxa [identified as SSA1-SG1, SSA1-SG2 and SSA2 based on their partial mtCO1 sequences in line with Legg et al.

 </sup> subgroupings] as a function of temperature under laboratory conditions. Until recently, the known geographical range of SSA taxa was scant due to limited molecular biological assays of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in Sub-Saharan Africa

 </sup>. Furthermore, their distribution is likely to be complicated by inter-specific competition from within the 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> complex, and the importance of crop hosts as a likely range-discriminating factor between these species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>
 </sup>. A consequence of this is that we are unable to reliably infer any stress parameters for these taxa based on their geographical distribution. On the other hand, the soil moisture parameters are strongly associated with the hosts, and factors such as the minimum soil moisture for growth are closely associated with the permanent wilting point, which does not vary much between species. The SSA1-SG1 and SSA1-SG2 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> colonies used in this study were established from 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> collected from Kayingo, Uganda in February 2016. The SSA2 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> colony used in this study was established from 
 <italic>B.Â tabaci</italic> collected from Kiboga, Uganda in August 2013.
