<p id="Par16">For the Compare Locations model a 30-year average of monthly climate data from 1981 to 2010 was derived from the time series dataset. We calculated the 30-year average from the abovementioned minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation. We then calculated relative humidity at 9:00 and 15:00 h by (1) calculating saturated vapour pressure at these times using the Magnus equation (Eqs. 4, 5 and 6, Kriticos et al.

 </sup>); (2) obtaining relative humidity by dividing vapour pressure by saturated vapour pressure (Eq. 1, Kriticos et al.

 </sup>); and (3) averaging 30-years by month. The minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity were collated into an Sqlite database for use in CLIMEX Compare Locations.
