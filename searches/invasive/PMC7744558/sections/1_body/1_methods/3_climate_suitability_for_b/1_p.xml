 </sup>. We used the R statistics package

 </sup> to fit linear time trend models at each spatial grid point to estimate the average annual change in EI, GI
 <sub>A</sub>, TI and MI across the 39 years in the series. At each point, standardised effect sizes (t value) for this annual change were plotted spatially, as were the 95% lower and upper confidence intervals for the annual change.
