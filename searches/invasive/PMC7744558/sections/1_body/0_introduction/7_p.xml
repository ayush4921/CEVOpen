 </sup>. The baseline model does not fit the distribution training data very well, with significant omission in the USA (north of Florida), parts of Africa (North Sudan and western Tanzania) and throughout equatorial parts of South-Eastern Asia (Indonesia and the Philippines). There also appear to be modelling artefacts in the results for South America, Africa and Australia, with a patchwork pattern of modelled suitability suggesting model over-fitting or the use of inappropriate covariates. The modelled unsuitability in Angola, Zambia, Botswana and Namibia is doubtful given the climatic similarity to regions such as northeastern Australia where 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> has been recorded frequently. The inclusion of the northern Chinese records in the training dataset suggests a misunderstanding of the difference between “field-caught records” and evidence of establishment. In this case, the records are likely populations that over-wintered in glasshouses and were then subsequently caught in the field. Curiously, the inclusion of these northern Chinese records stretched the MaxEnt model to include these regions as climatically suitable, but it did not result in areas elsewhere with similar climates being identified as similarly suitable (i.e., central western USA). These features and the poor fit to the training data does not inspire confidence in this model. In the face of such deficiencies, the relatively high AUC scores (~ 0.89) underscores concerns regarding the use of this statistic to evaluate bioclimatic models
