 </sup>. CLIMEX models benefit from the modeller being able to cross-validate parameters and results across three different knowledge domains: distribution data, phenological observations, and experimental observations of development and survival under laboratory or field conditions. This cross-validation process typically reveals errors and interpretation issues in distribution data (e.g., geocoding errors and the effects of human climate-modifying habitat factors such as irrigation and glasshouses) and helps ensure that included model components and parameters are biologically plausible. A new development in CLIMEX Version 4 is the ability to run the Compare Locations model on a monthly time series climate database, providing the first opportunity to simulate and visualise the seasonal and inter-annual spatio-temporal patterns of climate suitability.
