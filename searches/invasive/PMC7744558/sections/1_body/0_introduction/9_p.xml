  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. This model was fitted to describe the relative climate suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 using long-term climate averages from 1981 to 2010, centred on 1995
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>. The resulting climate suitability model indicated that the potential distribution of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 included all of the known distribution records for all of the members of the 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> complex, including the known distribution of the SSA species and the area within which the cassava disease epidemics had been observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There is a large degree of similarity in ecophysiological parameters between different species within the 
 <italic>B.</italic> 
 <italic>tabaci</italic> complex (e.g. temperature-dependent development rates)

 </sup>. The geographical distribution of the different species within the complex includes regions of range overlap (e.g., MED and MEAM1 in northern China, and SSA taxa in Eastern and Central Africa), and also more discrete clustering. This suggests that the fundamental niche of these cryptic species may have a large degree of overlap, and their realised niches reflect differences in biotic factors such as the distribution of hosts and natural enemies, interspecific competition and interactions with plant diseases

 </sup>. The range boundaries for a given taxa tend to reflect spatial demographic processes, and competitive advantage can be conferred by even slight differences in ecophysiological performance
