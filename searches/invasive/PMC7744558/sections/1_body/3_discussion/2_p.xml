<p id="Par38">The Ugandan time-series data shows both a statistically consistent relationship between 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> abundance and modelled climate suitability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and an increasing suitability trend across time. The apparent increasing climate suitability for SSA 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in parts of East and Central Africa across the 39 years of the study (including the 13 years of the Ugandan dataset) accords with the reported increased prevalence of both

 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, in combination with increased use of cassava varieties that support 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> species, and changes to cropping systems that provide additional host plant resources

 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in this area between 1994 and 2009
