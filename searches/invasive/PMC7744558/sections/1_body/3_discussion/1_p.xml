<p id="Par37">Both the field and laboratory studies support the application of the CLIMEX model originally fitted to development data and field distribution records for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 to examine the historical change in climate suitability for the 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA species. This lack of variation in the fitted model parameters between the different 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> species is perhaps not so surprising. Members of the complex are often found to have sympatric ranges. 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> MED and MEAM1 frequently coexist
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>
 </sup>, and in East Africa the SSA taxa frequently co-occur
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. It is likely that the non-climatic ecological factors such as host relations (e.g.,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>
 </sup>) provide bases for niche differentiation within the 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> species complex.
