<p id="Par43">The statistically significant trend of improving climate suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in the cassava disease pandemic area in East and Central Africa, centred mainly on Uganda appears to be mostly driven by increasing temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). At some sites at the centre of the recent cassava disease epidemics (e.g. Luweero, Uganda and Mwanza, Tanzania), decreasing rainfall also contributed to the increasing favourability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> via the increase in the Moisture Index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). This accords with the general perception of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> having a preference for hot, dry conditions
