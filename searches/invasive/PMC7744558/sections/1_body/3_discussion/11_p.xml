<p id="Par47">The newly available Compare Locations/Years tool in CLIMEX Version 4, coupled with gridded time series climatic data allowed us to explore the effects of climate variability on this important agricultural pest system. It enabled us to look not only at the resultant trends, but also to identify which components of climate were driving these trends. Linking climate dynamics to a process-oriented niche model is potentially an important mechanism for exploring trends in global change biology. The process-oriented nature of CLIMEX, combined with time series climatic data, lends it to serving a useful role in climate change attribution in many biological systems.</p>
