<p id="Par42">In attributing the 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> abundance and cassava disease changes to climatic changes we also need to consider other potential explanations and confounding effects. As observed by McQuaid et al.

 </sup>, the movement of diseased cassava material can play an important role in the spread of a disease, especially over longer distances. However, the subsequent maintenance of an epidemic relies upon either a local cycling of the disease or constant re-introduction of diseased plant material. While farmers may spread diseased material locally, this is likely a small effect. Conversely, there is compelling evidence that 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> plays a strong role in spreading the viruses within the landscape and maintaining epidemics
