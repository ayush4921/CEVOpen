<p id="Par44">Where there were trends toward decreased suitability (e.g., in sub-coastal Tanzania and northern Kenya, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,c) the decreases also appear to be associated with decreasing rainfall. However, these predominantly rangeland areas were already poorly suited for cropping due to inadequate rainfall and became even drier and less suitable for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> during the period of this study. In East Africa, the trends in increasing climatic suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> appear to be correlated with the increase in reported prevalence of SSA
