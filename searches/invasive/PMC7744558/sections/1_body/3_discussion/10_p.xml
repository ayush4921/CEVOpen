<p id="Par46">The sustained trend in climatic suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in parts of East and Central Africa suggests that a similarly sustained effort will be required to develop and maintain cassava varieties that are resistant to current and emerging strains of cassava diseases. Otherwise, the contribution of cassava production toward African and global food security will likely be compromised. Clearly, such plant breeding initiatives need to be paralleled with efforts to control

 </sup> to estimate the economically appropriate amount to invest in perpetuity in developing and maintaining resistance to wheat stem rust (
 <italic>Puccinia graminis</italic>) might be applied to the protection of cassava production from arboviruses. Instead of framing this problem as a battle to be won—a project with a start and end date—it can be framed as a perpetual investment stream to develop cassava varieties that are resistant to the contemporary challenges from the evolving patho-system.
