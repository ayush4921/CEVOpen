<p id="Par45">Given the apparent increasing climate suitability trend for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in parts of East and Southern Africa, we might expect that there could be more generations of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and greater survival rates, and hence abundance. African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMV) prevalence is related to the density of whiteflies

 </sup>, so we might reasonably expect that the increasing climatic suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> could translate into greater disease prevalence. While Jeremiah et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> did not find a positive correlation between 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> abundance and incidence of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), based on epidemiological theory we might also expect that increasing 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> density would have a proportionally greater effect on the levels of cassava diseases with relatively poor transmission rates (e.g. CBSD) compared with those with high transmission rates (e.g. CMD or ACMV) because the latter would saturate at lower density levels of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>. Logically, because transmission rates are observed on a per-insect basis, higher insect density results in higher plant infection rates, up to the point where the availability of uninfected hosts becomes limiting.
