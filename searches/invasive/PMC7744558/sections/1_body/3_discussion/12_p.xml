<p id="Par48">Our modelling identified that East and Southern Africa includes areas that are highly climatically suitable for

 <italic>,</italic> and that this suitability has been increasing for many years in certain regions, highlighting an additional potential biosecurity and food security threat for the region. At present, the native 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA species already pose a significant threat to cassava production, and there are other related whitefly species also present in cassava fields. The role that native African whitefly species play in terms of transmission of a large diversity of cassava viruses is sometimes unclear. Africa’s notoriously porous land borders

 </sup> make it difficult to control the spread of invasive species and emerging infectious diseases. West African cassava production is greater than that in East Africa. If Cassava brown streak virus disease or Ugandan cassava brown streak virus were to be introduced to West Africa, for example via the movement of infected cassava cuttings, the threat to cassava production there could be even greater than that observed in East Africa if a suitable whitefly vector is either already present, or invades that area. Clarifying the ability of West African whiteflies to transmit CBSV and UCBSV, may help define a range of strategies to manage these disease risks to cassava production in this region.
