<p id="Par36">There is considerable spatio-temporal variation in the modelled climate suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 in eastern Africa at the inter-annual scale (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Despite this variability, there has been a significant trend in climate suitability throughout much of Eastern Africa during the 39 years from 1979 to 2017 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). For each cell there were 38 degrees of freedom. Throughout this period, there has been a slight decrease in climate suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in lower-lying coastal regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), though apart from an area in Mozambique, only a few isolated areas appear to have experienced a statistically significant decrease in suitability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). Conversely, there has been an increase in suitability throughout a large portion of the area, which is most pronounced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and western parts of Tanzania and Kenya (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,b). These trends are apparent in both the EI and the GI
 <sub>A</sub> results against a backdrop of interannual variation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a,b). Exploring the temporal data in more detail for selected locations reveals that most of the increase in suitability is due to increasing temperature suitability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c) and decreases in the EI are due to decreasing soil moisture suitability and drought stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). At Luweero and Mwanza, in the centre of the cassava disease epidemic zone, climatic conditions for both temperature and soil moisture improved through this period.
