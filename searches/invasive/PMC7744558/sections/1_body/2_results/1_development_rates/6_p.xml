<p id="Par32">The shortest development time for all taxa occurred between 25 and 30 °C, but the maximum temperature for optimum development was left at 32 °C because we are modelling the suite of SSA 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> taxa and one of them displayed optimum development at 30 °C, and the next higher temperature was 35 °C. The maximum temperature for development was set at 42 °C, which is marginally above the maximum experimental temperatures, at which all four SSA taxa were capable of completing development. The development time did increase dramatically after 35 °C, especially for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA2. 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> SSA1-SG1 and 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA1-SG2 each had similar, and relatively short, development times across all the temperatures assessed. The soil moisture response parameters mostly reflect the niche requirements for crop hosts, with a wet stress consideration in relation to the sensitivity of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> to rainfall

 </sup>. We can therefore feel confident in using the previously developed CLIMEX model to adequately simulate climate suitability for the SSA taxa.
