<p id="Par33">Globally, the potential distribution for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 extends throughout the tropics, sub-tropics, and warm temperate climates, with marginal suitability in the Mediterranean region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Location records in temperate locations highlight its potential for recurrent invasion from glasshouses, which allow overwintering. The climate suitability for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> MEAM1 in eastern Africa modelled using long-term average climate is quite high in the north west (Uganda) and South-East (coastal Tanzania) of the study area, with a moderate depression in Central Tanzania (Fig.
