<p id="Par35">The field abundance patterns (probability of presence of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> on a cassava plant) displays a sigmoid pattern with respect to modelled EI at each site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). There were pronounced differences in prevalence of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> SSA adults between sites at moderate EI values, perhaps reflecting non-climatic influences on population abundance of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> such as crop type, age of the cassava, crop types used across each landscape, natural enemies, competition with other herbivores, and insecticide use.
