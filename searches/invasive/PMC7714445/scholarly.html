ABSTRACT</div> <p>The process of protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the initial and decisive step in the biosynthesis of all secretory proteins and many soluble organelle proteins. In this process, the Sec61 complex is the protein-conducting channel for transport. In this study, we identified and characterized the Î² subunit of the Sec61 complex in <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (MoSec61Î²). Compared with the wild-type strain Guy11, the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant exhibited highly branched mycelial morphology, reduced conidiation, high sensitivity to cell wall integrity stress, severely reduced virulence to rice and barley, and restricted biotrophic invasion. The turgor pressure of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was notably reduced, which affected the function of appressoria. Moreover, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was also sensitive to oxidative stress and exhibited a reduced ability to overcome plant immunity. Further examination demonstrated that MoSec61Î² affected the normal secretion of the apoplastic effectors Bas4 and Slp1. In addition, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> upregulated the level of ER-phagy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the importance of the roles played by MoSec61Î² in the fungal development and pathogenesis of <i>M. oryzae</i>.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is the most important pathogen infecting rice, wheat, and other grass species[<a href="#cit0001">1</a>]. <i>M. oryzae</i> infection begins after the conidia are spread by wind or dew drops to the host surface. Under proper conditions, the conidium germinates and forms a polarized germ tube. Next, the tip of the germ tube differentiates into a dome-shaped infection structure called the appressorium [<a href="#cit0002">2</a>]. Appressorium development is accompanied by energy recycling in which the nucleus, glycogen and lipid droplets in the conidia are degraded by autophagy or transported to the appressorium [<a href="#cit0003">3</a>]. After the appressorium matures, it forms a penetration peg to rupture the cuticle of the host through glycerol-derived hydrostatic pressure. Subsequently, the filamentous primary invasive hyphae (IH) extend inside the cell and develop into the bulbous secondary invasive hyphae for transcellular infection. Colonization by invasive hyphae results in the appearance of necrotic lesions. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1.</span></a></div>   <p>MoSec61Î² is involved in hyphal growth, asexual reproduction, cell wall integrity, and pathogenicity.

Signiï¬cant differences between the mutant and wild-type strains, as estimated by Duncanâs test: **P &amp;lt; 0.01, *P &amp;lt; 0.05</p>   </div> <p /> <p>To respond to pathogen stimulation and invasion, plants have evolved an advanced and complex immune system that is sensitive to stimuli from the outside environment [<a href="#cit0004">4</a>]. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leads to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) [<a href="#cit0005">5</a>]. Furthermore, when PTI is no longer protective of plants, resistance (R) proteins recognize pathogen-derived effectors and initiate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<a href="#cit0006">6</a>]. The two immune processes share common defense responses, including an outburst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), secretion of antimicrobial compounds, and reinforcement of plant cell walls [<a href="#cit0007">7</a>]. In addition to the plantâs immune response, there is also evidence that pathogens interfere with plant immunity. Two bio-structures are formed where pathogens secrete effectors in response to plant immunity. Host-derived extrainvasive hyphal membranes (EIHM) are formed to enfold biotrophic IH [<a href="#cit0008">8</a>], and host membrane-rich structures called biotrophic interfacial complexes (BIC) are formed focally at the periphery of invasive hyphae during biotrophic invasion [<a href="#cit0009">9</a>]. Additionally, apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors, two distinct effector secretion systems, have been identified in <i>M. oryzae</i> [<a href="#cit0010">10</a>]. Apoplastic effectors are associated with host plants before cytoplasmic effectors and partly decide the outcome of the interaction between pathogens and plants [<a href="#cit0011">11</a>]. The apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1 are dispersed in the extracellular compartment formed by EIHM and the IH membrane to indirectly act on host plant cells through signal transduction [<a href="#cit0007">7</a>,<a href="#cit0012">12</a>]. The apoplastic effectors are secreted via the conserved ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-to-Golgi secretion pathway. Conventional protein secretion is the transport route of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (GA) and subsequently through secretory vesicles or secretory particles into the plasma membrane (PM) [<a href="#cit0013">13</a>]. Conversely, the function of cytoplasmic effectors is to impair the normal physiological metabolism inside plant cells [<a href="#cit0014">14</a>]. Pwl2 is a classical cytoplasmic effector that preferentially accumulates in BIC after being secreted from IH and subsequently enters the plant host cell [<a href="#cit0015">15</a>]. The delivery of cytoplasmic effectors is mediated by the exocyst complex, which is essential for establishing epithelial polarity, morphogenesis, and homeostasis [<a href="#cit0010">10</a>,<a href="#cit0016">16</a>].</p> <p>The Sec61 complex is a membrane channel on the ER that is involved in the translocation of newly synthesized precursor polypeptides into the ER lumen or on the ER membrane [<a href="#cit0017">17</a>]. Sec61 is a highly conserved multisubunit protein complex that consists of three subunits, Sec61Î±, Sec61Î², and Sec61Î³, in eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, the core proteins are Sec61, Sbh1, and Sss1. The Î± subunit forms the pore channel through which a polypeptide chain passes [<a href="#cit0018">18</a>], whereas the Î³ subunit stabilizes the protein translocation [<a href="#cit0019">19</a>]. Unlike Sec61Î± and Sec61Î³, whose functions have been thoroughly investigated, the function of the Î²-subunit is still under study. At present, it is known that Sec61Î² (Sbh1 and Sbh2) is not necessary for the functional integrity of Sec61 in yeast, although it does promote the process of protein translocation [<a href="#cit0020">20</a>]. In contrast to the results obtained in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Sec61Î² has been determined to be essential for the embryogenesis of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> [<a href="#cit0021">21</a>]. In addition, a study on barley resistance suggested that Sec61Î² is required for plant susceptibility to powdery mildew [<a href="#cit0022">22</a>]. However, although studies have highlighted the importance of Sec61Î², the mechanism by which this protein functions has not been elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, the functions of the Sec61 complex in plant pathogenic fungi have not been studied to date.</p> <p>In this study, we identified the beta subunit of Sec61 in <i>M. oryzae</i>, designated MoSec61Î². Deletion of <i>MoSEC61Î²</i> was associated with abnormal polarized hyphal growth, reduced conidiation and appressorium turgor pressure, defects in cell wall integrity, attenuated utilization of glycogen and lipid droplets, and weak virulence to rice and barley. Furthermore, penetration assays revealed that the ability to form penetration pegs was impaired in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. Although a small number of penetration pegs are formed successfully, the IH still fails to colonize adjacent cells because it no longer has the capacity to eliminate the host ROS. Meanwhile, high expression level of pathogenicity-related gene <i>PR1a</i> in leaves of Î<i>Mosec61Î²-</i>challenged rice, and weak capacity in degrading callose of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> suggested the essential role of MoSec61Î² in overcoming plant defense responses. Additionally, the distribution of the apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1 were disrupted in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, indicating the important role played by <i>MoSEC61Î²</i> in ER-to-Golgi transport. Also, the deletion of MoSec61Î² leads to more intense ER-phagy. In conclusion, we demonstrate the biological function of the Î² subunit of the Sec61 complex in <i>M. oryzae</i> and provide new evidence for ER-mediated ER-phagy and apoplastic effector secretion in plant pathogenic fungi.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

We termed MGG_03644 as <i>MoSEC61Î²</i>. MoSec61Î² is predicted to encode 144 amino acids (aa) and spans the membrane once (85â103 aa), with the N-terminus being in the cytosol. Then, the biological functions of MoSec61Î² were explored using target gene replacement. In addition, the full-length genomic copy of <i>MoSEC61Î²</i> was reintroduced into Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> for genetic complementation analysis, and we named the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i>.</p> <p>The growth rate of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> is lower than that of the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(a,c)</a>). Microscopic observation showed that the pear-shaped conidia of Guy11, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, or <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> were distributed in a concentric axis at the top of the fascicular conidiophore (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(b)</a>). However, statistical analysis showed that the number of conidia produced by Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was clearly decreased. Compared to the wild-type strain, the sporulation in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was decreased to half of that in Guy11 (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(d)</a>). Additionally, compared with the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i>, the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mycelia produced more apical and subapical branches, and the wild-type Guy11 and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> maintained the vertical growth of mycelium without sub-top branches (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(e)</a>). To clearly observe the morphology of hyphae, we stained the mycelia of Guy11, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> using calcofluor white (CFW). The mycelia of wild-type Guy11 and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> were straight, and the cell intervals were largely equidistant (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(f)</a>). In contrast, the interval of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mycelia had irregular branches, and the spacing interval of each cell was shorter than that of Guy11 and was not evenly spaced (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(f)</a>). MoSec61Î² was determined to be involved in the morphogenesis and separation of vegetative mycelia.</p> <p>To identify the role of MoSec61Î² in cell wall integrity, we monitored the effects of various cell wall perturbing agents on the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant. Mycelial growth was measured on MM plates supplemented with CFW, Congo red (CR) and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), compounds known to cause cell wall stress. As shown in <a href="#f0001">Figure 1(g)</a>, the sensitivity of the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant to CFW and Congo red was significantly different from that of both the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i>. The growth inhibition rates of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> to CFW and Congo red were significantly different from those of Guy11 and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> (Fig. S2). These results indicated that the loss of MoSec61Î² affects cell wall integrity.</p> <p>To investigate whether MoSec61Î² is related to the virulence of <i>M. oryzae</i>, two susceptible hosts, rice (CO-39) and barley (ZJ-8), were employed for the assessment of the pathogenicity of strains. After inoculation on barley leaves with conidia suspension (5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> conidia/ml) for 4 days, the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> caused yellow and brown lesions with rotten plant tissues, while inoculation with Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> resulted in tiny lesions (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(h)</a>). Similarly, when inoculated onto barley leaves with mycelium plugs, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> also caused weaker disease lesions compared to the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> (Fig. S3). When sprayed onto 21-day rice seedlings with conidia suspension (5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> conidia/ml), Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> caused small necrotic flecks, while the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> caused typical spindle-like, gray centered blast lesions and many merged lesions (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(i)</a>). The disease lesion areas in 5-cm-long infected leaves caused by Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> (10.23 Â± 1.23%) were significantly smaller than those caused by the wild-type Guy11 (51.30 Â± 4.87%) and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> (49.75 Â± 1.96%) 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1(j)</a>).

However, there were no significant differences in conidia germination, appressorium formation, or appressorium morphology among Guy11, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> (Table S1, Fig. S4). Then, we performed penetration assays on barley leaves. Few appressoria of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> could form penetration pegs (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2(a,b)</a>). Additionally, the appressorial penetration rate of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> on barley leaves was significantly decreased compared to that of the wild-type and complementation strains (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2(a)</a>). At 48 hpi (hours post-inoculation), the appressorial penetration rate of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was approximately half of that in the wild-type and complementation strains <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2(c)</a>). At 72 hpi, more than 90% of Guy11 appressoria penetrated barley cells. However, only 30% of the appressoria of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> penetrated barley cells (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2(c)</a>). Further observation showed that Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> displayed defects in IH extension. At 48 hpi, nearly 50% of IH in the wild-type and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> strains showed transcellular infection, and less than 10% IH of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> invaded neighboring cells (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2(d)</a>). At 72 hpi, more than 80% of IH in the wild-type and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> strains colonized other cells, but only 10% of IH in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> expanded into adjacent cells (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2(d)</a>).

MoSec61Î² affects turgor pressure in appressoria and mobilization of glycogen and lipid droplets from conidia to appressoria</div> <p>The process of penetration mediated by the appressorium requires a large amount of inner turgor pressure, which can enable the appressorium to produce adequate mechanical strength and facilitate rupture of the host cuticle with narrow-penetration hyphae [<a href="#cit0023">23</a>]. As described previously, most of the appressoria of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> cannot form penetration pegs, and we investigated if the appressorium turgor pressure of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was impaired. Specifically, we performed an incipient cytorrhysis assay to measure the turgor pressure exerted by mature appressoria. In this assay, a 0.5â1.5 M concentration of glycerol solution was applied to examine the collapse rate of appressoria. Under treatment with 1 M glycerol, approximately 30% of 24 h appressoria of the wild-type strain and the complementation strain <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> collapsed. However, 60% of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> collapsed with this treatment (<a href="#f0003">Figure 3(a,b)</a>). With the increase of glycerol concentration to 1.5 M, the collapse rate of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> appressoria increased to nearly 90% and was higher than that of the wild-type and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> strains (<a href="#f0003">Figure 3(b)</a>). It was concluded that the turgor pressure of the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> appressoria was decreased compared with that of the wild-type strain.</p> <p>The glycerol in appressoria is primarily produced by the transfer and utilization of glycogen and lipids in conidia. To investigate the glycogen distribution and lipid turnover of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, we employed potassium iodide to stain glycogen and employed Nile red to stain lipids during appressorium development. From 0 to 4 h in the preliminary stage of appressorium development on a hydrophobic surface, abundant lipids were seen in conidia and appressoria of Guy11 and Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> (<a href="#f0003">Figure 3(c)</a>). At 8 hpi, more than 60% lipids in conidia of the wild-type Guy11 and Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> strains were transported to appressoria. At 24 hpi, a significantly higher proportion of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> conidia contained lipids (<a href="#f0003">Figure 3(d)</a>). Compared to Guy11, more than 60% of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> appressoria contained lipids at 16 and 24 hpi (<a href="#f0003">Figure 3(e)</a>). Similarly, the distribution of glycogen exhibited the same pattern as lipids in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, as shown in <a href="#f0003">Figure 3(fâh)</a>. The above results indicate that <i>MoSEC61Î²</i> is required for lipid droplets and glycogen mobilization from conidia to appressoria.</p> </div> <div class="abilitytoscavengehostrosisreducedinÎmosec61Î²" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><i>Ability to scavenge host ROS is reduced in Î</i>Mosec61Î²</div> <p>When plants are attacked by pathogens, the plant cells generate massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inhibit or directly kill invading pathogens [<a href="#cit0024">24</a>]. We hypothesize that the reason Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> IH failed to colonize adjacent cells was related to its abnormal ability to scavenge ROS. To confirm this possibility, we determined the ability of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> to resist redox stress. The mycelial plugs of Guy11, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, and <i>Mosec61Î²c</i> were inoculated onto CM supplemented with the oxidative stress agent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5 mM) (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(a)</a>). The growth inhibition rate of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was significantly higher than that of Guy11 (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(b)</a>). This result indicates that the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant is more sensitive to oxidative stress than the wild-type strain.</p> <p>Then, 3,3Ê¹-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was used to capture hydrogen peroxide (one type of ROS) produced in the infected barley leaves. At 38 hpi, Guy11 was able to invade the surface cells and was observed to expand to the surrounding cells, and no obvious ROS were dyed. In contrast, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> IH was confined in the first cell and surrounded by obvious reddish-brown dyed ROS (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(c)</a>). Similar results were obtained when the strains were incubated on a rice sheath (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(d)</a>). There was an abundant accumulation of dark brown granules among IH of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> (67.88 Â± 1.50%) in rice cells. However, few brown granules (19.78 Â± 0.19%) were observed in the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(e)</a>). The dark brown granules indicated the immune response of rice, further demonstrating that the capacity of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> to scavenge host ROS was reduced.</p> <p>Furthermore, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) was applied to the rice sheath to determine whether ROS accumulation is the primary factor causing IH defects. Under normal conditions (without DPI), less than 10% of the appressoria of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> penetrated into adjacent cells at 48 h, but more than 50% of the wild-type appressoria successfully developed IH in the neighboring cells. Under the condition of 0.2 Î¼M DPI treatment, the extension of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> IH to adjacent cells increased threefold at 48 h. However, there were no obvious changes in the wild-type strain (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(f)</a>). These data confirmed that the attenuated biotrophic growth of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was due to host ROS accumulation.</p> </div> <div class="Îmosec61Î²isdefectiveinovercomingplantdefenseresponses" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><i>Î</i>Mosec61Î² <i>is defective in overcoming plant defense responses</i></div> <p>To further confirm that the defects of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> in infectious growth were caused by the failure to resist the immunity of plants, we used pathogens to infect heat-killed plant cells (<a href="#f0005">Figure 5(a)</a>). The penetration assay was carried out with rice leaf sheaths incubated at 75Â°C for 25 min before inoculation. After 48 hpi, almost all of the appressoria formed by the wild type (98.24 Â± 1.04%) and Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> (96.73 Â± 0.97%) penetrated the epidermal cells of rice leaf sheaths (<a href="#f0005">Figure 5(c)</a>). In addition, it is obvious that the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> IH are no longer confined in the first cell, and the percentage of IH extending to the neighboring cells is greatly increased. There was no significant difference compared with the wild-type Guy11 (90.14 Â± 2.30%) and the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant (89.63 Â± 2.10%) (<a href="#f0005">Figure 5(d)</a>). We reperformed the penetration assays with heat-killed onion epidermal cells, and similar infectious patterns were observed in the wild-type and Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> strains (<a href="#f0005">Figure 5(b)</a>).</p> <p>Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins have been used as markers of plant defense responses. In order to further investigate whether the plant defense genes were stimulated by infection with Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>, the expression patterns of <i>PBZ1</i> and <i>PR1a</i> genes were analyzed through quantitative RT-PCR. <i>PBZ1</i>, a probenazole-inducible gene from rice, triggers non-race specific resistance in rice plants against rice blast fungus [<a href="#cit0025">25</a>]. <i>PR1a</i> is one of the PR proteins, which accumulates after blast fungus infection in rice [<a href="#cit0026">26</a>]. The expression level of <i>PBZ1</i> was up-regulated in leaves of blast-fungus-challenged rice at 24 hpi, 32 hpi, and 48 hpi, whereas there were no obvious differences in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> or Guy11-challenged rice leaves (Fig. S5a). In contrast, the expression level of <i>PR1a</i> in leaves of Î<i>Mosec61Î²-</i>challenged rice was higher than that in leaves of Guy11-challenged rice at 24 hpi and 48 hpi (Fig. S5B). The expression level of <i>PR1a</i> in leaves of Î<i>Mosec61Î²-</i>challenged rice at 24 hpi was 4 folds as high as that in leaves of Guy11-challenged rice (Fig. S5b). The induction of plant defense responses in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>-challenged rice may contribute to the retardation of IH development.</p> <p>Callose, a Î²-1,3-glucanase induced by plant defense responses, provides chemical defenses at the cellular sites of attack [<a href="#cit0027">27</a>]. To investigate the induction of callose by infection of the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant and the wild-type Guy11 respectively, we observed the accumulation of callose deposits at the cell wall crossing sites around IH using aniline blue staining. As shown in <a href="#f0006">Figure 6(a)</a>, the number of the callose deposits around the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> IH was significantly more than that around the Guy11 IH at 32 dpi. Treatment of DPI decreased the number of the callose deposits around the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> IH (<a href="#f0006">Figure 6(a,b)</a>). Meanwhile, the expression levels of 3 callose synthase-encoding genes (<i>OsGSL1, OsGSL3, OsGSL5</i>) were investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. The expression level of <i>OsGSL1</i> reached the peak at 32 hpi in the leaves of Î<i>Mosec61Î²-</i>challenged rice, and it was 20 folds as high as that in the leaves of wild-type Guy11-challenged rice. In addition, the expression of <i>OsGSL3</i> and <i>OsGSL5</i> genes was also slightly induced in leaves of the Î<i>Mosec61Î²-</i>challenged rice, with higher induction levels as compared to those in leaves of the Guy11-challenged rice at 32 hpi (<a href="#f0006">Figure 6(c)</a>). These data indicated that Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was defective in overcoming plant defense responses because of its weak capacity in degrading callose. The above results suggested that MoSec61Î² is necessary for overcoming plant defense responses.</p> </div> <div class="Îmosec61Î²partiallydisruptsthelocalizationoftheapoplasticeffectorsbas4andslp1" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><i>Î</i>Mosec61Î² <i>partially disrupts the localization of the apoplastic effectors Bas4 and Slp1</i></div> <p>To assess whether the MoSec61Î² protein is involved in the secretion of effectors, we performed live cell imaging of biotrophic invasion by transformants expressing the cytoplasmic effector fusion protein Pwl2-GFP and the apoplastic effector fusion protein Bas4-mCherry, Slp-GFP. During the early infection stage at 48 hpi, Pwl2-GFP localized to a single punctate BIC in the wild-type Guy11 and the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant (<a href="#f0007">Figure 7(a)</a>), indicating that secretion of cytoplasmic effectors was not impaired in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. In wild-type Guy11, the Bas4-mCherry fusion protein outlines the IH and occupies an inner layer of the BIC. In contrast, the localization of Bas4-mCherry for the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant was partially disrupted, while localization of the Pwl2-GFP fusion appeared to be normal. Localization patterns of Bas4-mCherry in the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant could be further divided into two types, as shown in <a href="#f0007">Figure 7(b)</a>. With type 1, the fluorescence of Bas4-mCherry (32%) was uniformly wrapped the IH and was located in EIHM, which is the same as with the wild-type strain. In type 2, the localization of Bas4-mCherry could not be correctly accumulated in EIHM (68%). In contrast, nearly all randomly imaged infection sites of the wild-type strain showed the type 1 pattern (<a href="#f0007">Figure 7(c)</a>, Bas4-mCherry). Similar results were observed in apoplastic effector Slp1 (<a href="#f0007">Figure 7(c)</a>, Slp1-GFP). About 98% of Slp1-GFP could trace out IH and locate in EIHM in the wild-type Guy11. In contrast, two types of Slp1-GFP localization patterns were also observed in the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant, type 1 (~ 40% of Slp1-GFP could be correctly accumulated in EIHM) and type2 (~ 60% could not be correctly accumulated in EIHM) (<a href="#f0007">Figure 7</a>, Slp1-GFP). These results confirmed that the localization patterns of Bas4-mCherry and Slp1-GFP were seriously impaired in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. As previously described, MoSec61Î² is an ER transmembrane protein, and its deletion may cause abnormal secretion of effector proteins.

Autophagic cell death and macroautophagy were not impaired in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. Interestingly, we unexpectedly observed that the growth of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> is sensitive to ER stress under the ER stress factors tunicamycin (TUNI) or dithiothreitol (DTT) (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(a)</a>). Under treatment with 0.5 Î¼g/mL TUNI, the growth inhibition rate of the wild-type strain was significantly lower than that of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. Similarly, under 5.0 mM DTT treatment, the growth inhibition rate showed the same differences between the wild-type and Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> strains (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(b)</a>). The growth of the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> strain was inhibited by ER stress factors.</p> <p>In response to ER stress, ER-mediated autophagy (ER-phagy) occurs to maintain the normal function of the ER. Therefore, we hypothesized that ER-phagy of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> is impaired under ER stress. MoSec63-GFP is an integral ER membrane protein. It has been reported that 5 Î¼M DTT can induce MoSec63-GFP cleavage, consistent with the activation of selective autophagy by ER stress. We constructed the MoSec63-GFP fluorescent vector and transformed it into the wild-type Guy11 strain and the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> mutant strain. Under the induction of DTT, the expression of GFP differed significantly between Guy11 and Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(c)</a>). At 0 h, there was little free GFP in Guy11 and more free GFP in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. At 4 h, the amount of GFP-containing fragments was substantially enhanced in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> compared with Guy11 (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(c)</a>). These results indicate that the absence of MoSec61Î² stimulates ER-mediated autophagy.</p> </div> </div> <div class="discussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p>In eukaryotic cells, protein translocation can occur co- or post-translationally, depending on the hydrophobicity of the precursor protein. These mechanisms require the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex for transmembrane transport [<a href="#cit0028">28</a>]. In this study, we reported the biofunctions of Sec61Î² in <i>M. oryzae</i>. By homology alignment, we found only one gene encoding the Sec61Î² protein in rice blast fungus, MGG_03644, and we named that gene <i>MoSEC61Î²</i>. Loss of <i>MoSEC61Î²</i> had no apparent influence on conidial germination or appressorium formation but showed significant pathogenesis defects. During infection, Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> showed restricted IH and caused a host ROS burst that induced rice innate immunity because of impaired effector secretion.</p> <p>Although Sec61Î² has not been studied in other plant pathogenic fungi, the maintenance function of ER under stress has been widely researched. As an essential organelle in cells, the ER keeps continuous renovation to maintain its function and integrity when faced with changes in the external and internal environment [<a href="#cit0029">29</a>]. The ER performs quality control through the unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to the upregulation of chaperone, decrease of protein synthesis and reverse transport of misfolded protein to the cytosol for degradation [<a href="#cit0030">30</a>]. In <i>M. oryzae</i>, a double knockout strain for ERAD (ER-associated degradation, ERAD) genes, Î<i>Mohrd</i>Î<i>Moder1</i>, lost its pathogenicity. Compared with the wild-type strain, Î<i>Mohrd</i>Î<i>Moder1</i> shows an unfolded protein response under normal conditions, and the secretion of pathogenic effector proteins is affected [<a href="#cit0031">31</a>]. Another study found that ERQC (ER glycoprotein folding quality control) components, such as Sgls1, Gls2, and Gtb1, were N-glycosylated and were involved in the process of mycelial growth, conidiation, and invasive hyphal growth in host cells [<a href="#cit0032">32</a>]. Similarly, the ER chaperone protein Lhs1 is also involved in rice infection in the blast fungus. The UPR target genes, including <i>SIL1, KAR2, PDI1</i>, and <i>SCJ1</i>, are upregulated, and the function and secretion of AVR-Pita in Î<i>lhs1</i> are impaired [<a href="#cit0033">33</a>]. All these results indicate the importance of ER homeostasis for protein secretion and pathogenicity of rice blast.</p> <p>During plant-pathogen interactions, pathogens produce effectors to resist and escape the immune response of plants. Our results found that loss of <i>MoSEC61Î²</i> impacts the localization of the apoplastic effectors Bas4 and Slp1 and thus faces a strong plant immune response, including defects in ROS scavenging and callose degradation, and high expression of <i>PR1a</i>. Accordingly, in heat-killed plant cells, the growth of the invasive hypha of Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> was not affected. This result is in keeping with the fact that the secretion of apoplastic effectors is transported via the ER-to-Golgi pathway. We thus conclude that unlike in yeast, where Sec61Î² is not necessary, in <i>M. oryzae</i>, the Î² subunit is necessary for the transposon function of the Sec61 complex. A previous study also suggested other roles played by Sec61Î² in addition to its function as a component of the translocon. In yeast, Sec61Î² was found to interact with Sec4p and the exocyst complex component, including Sec8p and Sec15p [<a href="#cit0034">34</a>]. It is well-known that the transport of cytoplasmic effectors is mediated by the exocyst complex. Loss of the exocyst components Exo70 and Sec5 causes defects in proper secretion of the cytoplasmic effector Pwl2 [<a href="#cit0010">10</a>]. We therefore investigated whether the loss of MoSec61Î² in <i>M. oryzae</i> would also influence the ability of exocysts and ultimately affect the function of cytoplasmic effectors. We observed the localization of Pwl2 during Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> invasion and found similar localization of Pwl2 between the Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> and wild-type strains. These results showed that the Î² subunit is necessary for the transposon function of the Sec61 complex and that the absence of Sec61Î² did not affect the normal function of exocysts in the rice blast fungus.</p> <p>In addition to the defects observed during the infection process, we also found that the mutant exhibited deficiencies in its ability to infect the host. Although Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> forms appressoria with normal morphology, the turgor pressure of the appressoria is generally low and cannot successfully penetrate the host surface. The maturation of the appressorium requires the mediation of core autophagy. Autophagy helps the appressorium to produce glycerol and turgor pressure by transporting and degrading inclusions inside the conidia (mainly glycogen and lipid droplets) [<a href="#cit0035">35</a>]. In our experiments, we also found that the normal degradation of glycogen and lipid droplets in the mutant was inhibited, suggesting dysregulated autophagy. However, both the nuclear degradation and GFP-MoAtg8 degradation tests indicated that autophagy can occur normally in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>.</p> <p>As the channel connecting the ER to the cytoplasm, Sec61 also plays a role in ERAD, mediating the secretion of misfolding proteins in the ER back into the cytoplasm [<a href="#cit0036">36</a>]. It is possible that the dysfunction of the Sec61 complex inhibits the ERAD process, thereby causing the accumulation of misfolding proteins. In fact, except for ERAD, which degrades proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ER also employs the specified autophagy ER-phagy to maintain its inner balance [<a href="#cit0037">37</a>]. Therefore, we utilized the ER membrane protein Sec63-GFP to monitor the ER-phagy level inside Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. Our results showed that under normal conditions, Sec63 is expressed at a higher level in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i>. After 4 h of treatment with DTT to induce ER stress, the degradation of Sec63-GFP was also more significant, indicating a higher level of ER-phagy in Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> than in the wild-type Guy11 strain. We hypothesized that Î<i>Mosec61Î²</i> requires a stronger level of ER-mediated autophagy to compensate for the restriction of ERAD.</p> <p>In summary, our results reveal that MoSec61Î² is necessary for the vegetative growth, asexual development, appressorium penetration, plant immunity evasion and pathogenesis of rice blast fungus. MoSec61Î² plays pivotal roles in turgor pressure by influencing the mobilization and degradation of glycogen and lipids. Deletion of MoSec61Î² and <i>M. oryzae</i> is deficient in overcoming plant defense responses. MoSec61Î² controls pathogenicity via the secretion of the apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1. In addition, MoSec61Î² is involved in ER-phagy in response to ER stress.</p> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
