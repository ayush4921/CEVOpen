In this process, the Sec61 complex is the protein-conducting channel for transport. In this study, we identified and characterized the &#x003b2; subunit of the Sec61 complex in <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (MoSec61&#x003b2;). Compared with the wild-type strain Guy11, the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> mutant exhibited highly branched mycelial morphology, reduced conidiation, high sensitivity to cell wall integrity stress, severely reduced virulence to rice and barley, and restricted biotrophic invasion. The turgor pressure of &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> was notably reduced, which affected the function of appressoria. Moreover, &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> was also sensitive to oxidative stress and exhibited a reduced ability to overcome plant immunity. Further examination demonstrated that MoSec61&#x003b2; affected the normal secretion of the apoplastic effectors Bas4 and Slp1. In addition, &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> upregulated the level of ER-phagy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the importance of the roles played by MoSec61&#x003b2; in the fungal development and pathogenesis of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Sec61&#x003b2;</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>plant immunity</kwd><kwd>ER-phagy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001" disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is the most important pathogen infecting rice, wheat, and other grass species[<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection begins after the conidia are spread by wind or dew drops to the host surface. Under proper conditions, the conidium germinates and forms a polarized germ tube. Next, the tip of the germ tube differentiates into a dome-shaped infection structure called the appressorium [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Appressorium development is accompanied by energy recycling in which the nucleus, glycogen and lipid droplets in the conidia are degraded by autophagy or transported to the appressorium [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. After the appressorium matures, it forms a penetration peg to rupture the cuticle of the host through glycerol-derived hydrostatic pressure. Subsequently, the filamentous primary invasive hyphae (IH) extend inside the cell and develop into the bulbous secondary invasive hyphae for transcellular infection. Colonization by invasive hyphae results in the appearance of necrotic lesions.<fig id="f0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>MoSec61&#x003b2; is involved in hyphal growth, asexual reproduction, cell wall integrity, and pathogenicity.

Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leads to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, when PTI is no longer protective of plants, resistance (R) proteins recognize pathogen-derived effectors and initiate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The two immune processes share common defense responses, including an outburst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), secretion of antimicrobial compounds, and reinforcement of plant cell walls [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition to the plant&#x02019;s immune response, there is also evidence that pathogens interfere with plant immunity. Two bio-structures are formed where pathogens secrete effectors in response to plant immunity. Host-derived extrainvasive hyphal membranes (EIHM) are formed to enfold biotrophic IH [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and host membrane-rich structures called biotrophic interfacial complexes (BIC) are formed focally at the periphery of invasive hyphae during biotrophic invasion [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors, two distinct effector secretion systems, have been identified in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Apoplastic effectors are associated with host plants before cytoplasmic effectors and partly decide the outcome of the interaction between pathogens and plants [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1 are dispersed in the extracellular compartment formed by EIHM and the IH membrane to indirectly act on host plant cells through signal transduction [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The apoplastic effectors are secreted via the conserved ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-to-Golgi secretion pathway. Conventional protein secretion is the transport route of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (GA) and subsequently through secretory vesicles or secretory particles into the plasma membrane (PM) [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Conversely, the function of cytoplasmic effectors is to impair the normal physiological metabolism inside plant cells [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Pwl2 is a classical cytoplasmic effector that preferentially accumulates in BIC after being secreted from IH and subsequently enters the plant host cell [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The delivery of cytoplasmic effectors is mediated by the exocyst complex, which is essential for establishing epithelial polarity, morphogenesis, and homeostasis [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The Sec61 complex is a membrane channel on the ER that is involved in the translocation of newly synthesized precursor polypeptides into the ER lumen or on the ER membrane [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sec61 is a highly conserved multisubunit protein complex that consists of three subunits, Sec61&#x003b1;, Sec61&#x003b2;, and Sec61&#x003b3;, in eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, the core proteins are Sec61, Sbh1, and Sss1. The &#x003b1; subunit forms the pore channel through which a polypeptide chain passes [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas the &#x003b3; subunit stabilizes the protein translocation [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unlike Sec61&#x003b1; and Sec61&#x003b3;, whose functions have been thoroughly investigated, the function of the &#x003b2;-subunit is still under study. At present, it is known that Sec61&#x003b2; (Sbh1 and Sbh2) is not necessary for the functional integrity of Sec61 in yeast, although it does promote the process of protein translocation [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast to the results obtained in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Sec61&#x003b2; has been determined to be essential for the embryogenesis of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, a study on barley resistance suggested that Sec61&#x003b2; is required for plant susceptibility to powdery mildew [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, although studies have highlighted the importance of Sec61&#x003b2;, the mechanism by which this protein functions has not been elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, the functions of the Sec61 complex in plant pathogenic fungi have not been studied to date.</p><p>In this study, we identified the beta subunit of Sec61 in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, designated MoSec61&#x003b2;. Deletion of <italic>MoSEC61&#x003b2;</italic> was associated with abnormal polarized hyphal growth, reduced conidiation and appressorium turgor pressure, defects in cell wall integrity, attenuated utilization of glycogen and lipid droplets, and weak virulence to rice and barley. Furthermore, penetration assays revealed that the ability to form penetration pegs was impaired in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>. Although a small number of penetration pegs are formed successfully, the IH still fails to colonize adjacent cells because it no longer has the capacity to eliminate the host ROS. Meanwhile, high expression level of pathogenicity-related gene <italic>PR1a</italic> in leaves of &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;-</italic>challenged rice, and weak capacity in degrading callose of &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> suggested the essential role of MoSec61&#x003b2; in overcoming plant defense responses. Additionally, the distribution of the apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1 were disrupted in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>, indicating the important role played by <italic>MoSEC61&#x003b2;</italic> in ER-to-Golgi transport. Also, the deletion of MoSec61&#x003b2; leads to more intense ER-phagy. In conclusion, we demonstrate the biological function of the &#x003b2; subunit of the Sec61 complex in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and provide new evidence for ER-mediated ER-phagy and apoplastic effector secretion in plant pathogenic fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s0002" disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-s2001" disp-level="2"><title><italic>MoSec61&#x003b2; is essential for conidiogenesis, polarized hyphal growth, cell wall integrity, and virulence of</italic> M. oryzae</title><p>Sequence alignment analysis showed that MGG_03644 shared 48.72% and 57.83% identity with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sbh1p and Sbh2p, respectively (Fig. S1).

During the early infection stage at 48 hpi, Pwl2-GFP localized to a single punctate BIC in the wild-type Guy11 and the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(a)</xref>), indicating that secretion of cytoplasmic effectors was not impaired in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>. In wild-type Guy11, the Bas4-mCherry fusion protein outlines the IH and occupies an inner layer of the BIC. In contrast, the localization of Bas4-mCherry for the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> mutant was partially disrupted, while localization of the Pwl2-GFP fusion appeared to be normal. Localization patterns of Bas4-mCherry in the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> mutant could be further divided into two types, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(b)</xref>. With type 1, the fluorescence of Bas4-mCherry (32%) was uniformly wrapped the IH and was located in EIHM, which is the same as with the wild-type strain. In type 2, the localization of Bas4-mCherry could not be correctly accumulated in EIHM (68%). In contrast, nearly all randomly imaged infection sites of the wild-type strain showed the type 1 pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(c)</xref>, Bas4-mCherry). Similar results were observed in apoplastic effector Slp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(c)</xref>, Slp1-GFP). About 98% of Slp1-GFP could trace out IH and locate in EIHM in the wild-type Guy11. In contrast, two types of Slp1-GFP localization patterns were also observed in the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> mutant, type 1 (~ 40% of Slp1-GFP could be correctly accumulated in EIHM) and type2 (~ 60% could not be correctly accumulated in EIHM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>, Slp1-GFP). These results confirmed that the localization patterns of Bas4-mCherry and Slp1-GFP were seriously impaired in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>. As previously described, MoSec61&#x003b2; is an ER transmembrane protein, and its deletion may cause abnormal secretion of effector proteins. These results indicate that proper localization of apoplastic effectors in EIHM depends in part on MoSec61&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2007" disp-level="2"><title>MoSec61&#x003b2; negatively regulates ER-phagy</title><p>In our study, &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> exhibited defects similar to those of the atg-deficient mutants, such as reduced turgor pressure, retarded utilization of lipids and glycogen, and reduced virulence. However, neither conidia nuclei degradation nor GFP-MoAtg8 degradation under nutritional deprivation conditions showed the dysregulated autophagy process (Fig. S6, S7). Autophagic cell death and macroautophagy were not impaired in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>. Interestingly, we unexpectedly observed that the growth of &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> is sensitive to ER stress under the ER stress factors tunicamycin (TUNI) or dithiothreitol (DTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(a)</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that ER-phagy of &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> is impaired under ER stress. MoSec63-GFP is an integral ER membrane protein. It has been reported that 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M DTT can induce MoSec63-GFP cleavage, consistent with the activation of selective autophagy by ER stress. We constructed the MoSec63-GFP fluorescent vector and transformed it into the wild-type Guy11 strain and the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> mutant strain.

These results indicate that the absence of MoSec61&#x003b2; stimulates ER-mediated autophagy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0003" disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, protein translocation can occur co- or post-translationally, depending on the hydrophobicity of the precursor protein. These mechanisms require the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex for transmembrane transport [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, we reported the biofunctions of Sec61&#x003b2; in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. By homology alignment, we found only one gene encoding the Sec61&#x003b2; protein in rice blast fungus, MGG_03644, and we named that gene <italic>MoSEC61&#x003b2;</italic>. Loss of <italic>MoSEC61&#x003b2;</italic> had no apparent influence on conidial germination or appressorium formation but showed significant pathogenesis defects. During infection, &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> showed restricted IH and caused a host ROS burst that induced rice innate immunity because of impaired effector secretion.</p><p>Although Sec61&#x003b2; has not been studied in other plant pathogenic fungi, the maintenance function of ER under stress has been widely researched. As an essential organelle in cells, the ER keeps continuous renovation to maintain its function and integrity when faced with changes in the external and internal environment [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ER performs quality control through the unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to the upregulation of chaperone, decrease of protein synthesis and reverse transport of misfolded protein to the cytosol for degradation [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, a double knockout strain for ERAD (ER-associated degradation, ERAD) genes, &#x00394;<italic>Mohrd</italic>&#x00394;<italic>Moder1</italic>, lost its pathogenicity. Compared with the wild-type strain, &#x00394;<italic>Mohrd</italic>&#x00394;<italic>Moder1</italic> shows an unfolded protein response under normal conditions, and the secretion of pathogenic effector proteins is affected [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another study found that ERQC (ER glycoprotein folding quality control) components, such as Sgls1, Gls2, and Gtb1, were N-glycosylated and were involved in the process of mycelial growth, conidiation, and invasive hyphal growth in host cells [<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, the ER chaperone protein Lhs1 is also involved in rice infection in the blast fungus. The UPR target genes, including <italic>SIL1, KAR2, PDI1</italic>, and <italic>SCJ1</italic>, are upregulated, and the function and secretion of AVR-Pita in &#x00394;<italic>lhs1</italic> are impaired [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. All these results indicate the importance of ER homeostasis for protein secretion and pathogenicity of rice blast.</p><p>During plant-pathogen interactions, pathogens produce effectors to resist and escape the immune response of plants. Our results found that loss of <italic>MoSEC61&#x003b2;</italic> impacts the localization of the apoplastic effectors Bas4 and Slp1 and thus faces a strong plant immune response, including defects in ROS scavenging and callose degradation, and high expression of <italic>PR1a</italic>. Accordingly, in heat-killed plant cells, the growth of the invasive hypha of &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> was not affected. This result is in keeping with the fact that the secretion of apoplastic effectors is transported via the ER-to-Golgi pathway. We thus conclude that unlike in yeast, where Sec61&#x003b2; is not necessary, in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, the &#x003b2; subunit is necessary for the transposon function of the Sec61 complex. A previous study also suggested other roles played by Sec61&#x003b2; in addition to its function as a component of the translocon. In yeast, Sec61&#x003b2; was found to interact with Sec4p and the exocyst complex component, including Sec8p and Sec15p [<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is well-known that the transport of cytoplasmic effectors is mediated by the exocyst complex. Loss of the exocyst components Exo70 and Sec5 causes defects in proper secretion of the cytoplasmic effector Pwl2 [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether the loss of MoSec61&#x003b2; in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> would also influence the ability of exocysts and ultimately affect the function of cytoplasmic effectors. We observed the localization of Pwl2 during &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> invasion and found similar localization of Pwl2 between the &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> and wild-type strains. These results showed that the &#x003b2; subunit is necessary for the transposon function of the Sec61 complex and that the absence of Sec61&#x003b2; did not affect the normal function of exocysts in the rice blast fungus.</p><p>In addition to the defects observed during the infection process, we also found that the mutant exhibited deficiencies in its ability to infect the host. Although &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> forms appressoria with normal morphology, the turgor pressure of the appressoria is generally low and cannot successfully penetrate the host surface. The maturation of the appressorium requires the mediation of core autophagy. Autophagy helps the appressorium to produce glycerol and turgor pressure by transporting and degrading inclusions inside the conidia (mainly glycogen and lipid droplets) [<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our experiments, we also found that the normal degradation of glycogen and lipid droplets in the mutant was inhibited, suggesting dysregulated autophagy. However, both the nuclear degradation and GFP-MoAtg8 degradation tests indicated that autophagy can occur normally in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>.</p><p>As the channel connecting the ER to the cytoplasm, Sec61 also plays a role in ERAD, mediating the secretion of misfolding proteins in the ER back into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is possible that the dysfunction of the Sec61 complex inhibits the ERAD process, thereby causing the accumulation of misfolding proteins. In fact, except for ERAD, which degrades proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ER also employs the specified autophagy ER-phagy to maintain its inner balance [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, we utilized the ER membrane protein Sec63-GFP to monitor the ER-phagy level inside &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>. Our results showed that under normal conditions, Sec63 is expressed at a higher level in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic>. After 4&#x000a0;h of treatment with DTT to induce ER stress, the degradation of Sec63-GFP was also more significant, indicating a higher level of ER-phagy in &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> than in the wild-type Guy11 strain. We hypothesized that &#x00394;<italic>Mosec61&#x003b2;</italic> requires a stronger level of ER-mediated autophagy to compensate for the restriction of ERAD.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal that MoSec61&#x003b2; is necessary for the vegetative growth, asexual development, appressorium penetration, plant immunity evasion and pathogenesis of rice blast fungus. MoSec61&#x003b2; plays pivotal roles in turgor pressure by influencing the mobilization and degradation of glycogen and lipids. Deletion of MoSec61&#x003b2; and <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is deficient in overcoming plant defense responses. MoSec61&#x003b2; controls pathogenicity via the secretion of the apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1.
