<p>In this study, we identified the beta subunit of Sec61 in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, designated MoSec61β. Deletion of 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic> was associated with abnormal polarized hyphal growth, reduced conidiation and appressorium turgor pressure, defects in cell wall integrity, attenuated utilization of glycogen and lipid droplets, and weak virulence to rice and barley. Furthermore, penetration assays revealed that the ability to form penetration pegs was impaired in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. Although a small number of penetration pegs are formed successfully, the IH still fails to colonize adjacent cells because it no longer has the capacity to eliminate the host ROS. Meanwhile, high expression level of pathogenicity-related gene 
 <italic>PR1a</italic> in leaves of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β-</italic>challenged rice, and weak capacity in degrading callose of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> suggested the essential role of MoSec61β in overcoming plant defense responses. Additionally, the distribution of the apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1 were disrupted in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, indicating the important role played by 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic> in ER-to-Golgi transport. Also, the deletion of MoSec61β leads to more intense ER-phagy. In conclusion, we demonstrate the biological function of the β subunit of the Sec61 complex in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and provide new evidence for ER-mediated ER-phagy and apoplastic effector secretion in plant pathogenic fungi.
