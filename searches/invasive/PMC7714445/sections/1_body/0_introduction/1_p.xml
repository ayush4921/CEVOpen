 <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is the most important pathogen infecting rice, wheat, and other grass species[
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infection begins after the conidia are spread by wind or dew drops to the host surface. Under proper conditions, the conidium germinates and forms a polarized germ tube. Next, the tip of the germ tube differentiates into a dome-shaped infection structure called the appressorium [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Appressorium development is accompanied by energy recycling in which the nucleus, glycogen and lipid droplets in the conidia are degraded by autophagy or transported to the appressorium [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. After the appressorium matures, it forms a penetration peg to rupture the cuticle of the host through glycerol-derived hydrostatic pressure. Subsequently, the filamentous primary invasive hyphae (IH) extend inside the cell and develop into the bulbous secondary invasive hyphae for transcellular infection. Colonization by invasive hyphae results in the appearance of necrotic lesions.
