<p>The Sec61 complex is a membrane channel on the ER that is involved in the translocation of newly synthesized precursor polypeptides into the ER lumen or on the ER membrane [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sec61 is a highly conserved multisubunit protein complex that consists of three subunits, Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ, in eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, the core proteins are Sec61, Sbh1, and Sss1. The α subunit forms the pore channel through which a polypeptide chain passes [
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas the γ subunit stabilizes the protein translocation [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unlike Sec61α and Sec61γ, whose functions have been thoroughly investigated, the function of the β-subunit is still under study. At present, it is known that Sec61β (Sbh1 and Sbh2) is not necessary for the functional integrity of Sec61 in yeast, although it does promote the process of protein translocation [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast to the results obtained in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Sec61β has been determined to be essential for the embryogenesis of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, a study on barley resistance suggested that Sec61β is required for plant susceptibility to powdery mildew [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, although studies have highlighted the importance of Sec61β, the mechanism by which this protein functions has not been elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, the functions of the Sec61 complex in plant pathogenic fungi have not been studied to date.
