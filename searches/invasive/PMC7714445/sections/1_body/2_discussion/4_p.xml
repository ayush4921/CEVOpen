<p>In addition to the defects observed during the infection process, we also found that the mutant exhibited deficiencies in its ability to infect the host. Although Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> forms appressoria with normal morphology, the turgor pressure of the appressoria is generally low and cannot successfully penetrate the host surface. The maturation of the appressorium requires the mediation of core autophagy. Autophagy helps the appressorium to produce glycerol and turgor pressure by transporting and degrading inclusions inside the conidia (mainly glycogen and lipid droplets) [

In our experiments, we also found that the normal degradation of glycogen and lipid droplets in the mutant was inhibited, suggesting dysregulated autophagy. However, both the nuclear degradation and GFP-MoAtg8 degradation tests indicated that autophagy can occur normally in Δ
