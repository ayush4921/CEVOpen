<p>In eukaryotic cells, protein translocation can occur co- or post-translationally, depending on the hydrophobicity of the precursor protein. These mechanisms require the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex for transmembrane transport [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, we reported the biofunctions of Sec61β in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. By homology alignment, we found only one gene encoding the Sec61β protein in rice blast fungus, MGG_03644, and we named that gene 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic>. Loss of 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic> had no apparent influence on conidial germination or appressorium formation but showed significant pathogenesis defects. During infection, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> showed restricted IH and caused a host ROS burst that induced rice innate immunity because of impaired effector secretion.
