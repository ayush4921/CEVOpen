<p>In summary, our results reveal that MoSec61β is necessary for the vegetative growth, asexual development, appressorium penetration, plant immunity evasion and pathogenesis of rice blast fungus. MoSec61β plays pivotal roles in turgor pressure by influencing the mobilization and degradation of glycogen and lipids. Deletion of MoSec61β and 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is deficient in overcoming plant defense responses. MoSec61β controls pathogenicity via the secretion of the apoplastic effector Bas4 and Slp1. In addition, MoSec61β is involved in ER-phagy in response to ER stress.
