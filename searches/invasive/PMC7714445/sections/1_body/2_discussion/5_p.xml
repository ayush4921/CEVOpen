<p>As the channel connecting the ER to the cytoplasm, Sec61 also plays a role in ERAD, mediating the secretion of misfolding proteins in the ER back into the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is possible that the dysfunction of the Sec61 complex inhibits the ERAD process, thereby causing the accumulation of misfolding proteins. In fact, except for ERAD, which degrades proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ER also employs the specified autophagy ER-phagy to maintain its inner balance [
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, we utilized the ER membrane protein Sec63-GFP to monitor the ER-phagy level inside Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. Our results showed that under normal conditions, Sec63 is expressed at a higher level in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. After 4 h of treatment with DTT to induce ER stress, the degradation of Sec63-GFP was also more significant, indicating a higher level of ER-phagy in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> than in the wild-type Guy11 strain. We hypothesized that Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> requires a stronger level of ER-mediated autophagy to compensate for the restriction of ERAD.
