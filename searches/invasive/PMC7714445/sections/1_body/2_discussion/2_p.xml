<p>Although Sec61β has not been studied in other plant pathogenic fungi, the maintenance function of ER under stress has been widely researched. As an essential organelle in cells, the ER keeps continuous renovation to maintain its function and integrity when faced with changes in the external and internal environment [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ER performs quality control through the unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to the upregulation of chaperone, decrease of protein synthesis and reverse transport of misfolded protein to the cytosol for degradation [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, a double knockout strain for ERAD (ER-associated degradation, ERAD) genes, Δ
 <italic>Mohrd</italic>Δ
 <italic>Moder1</italic>, lost its pathogenicity. Compared with the wild-type strain, Δ
 <italic>Mohrd</italic>Δ
 <italic>Moder1</italic> shows an unfolded protein response under normal conditions, and the secretion of pathogenic effector proteins is affected [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another study found that ERQC (ER glycoprotein folding quality control) components, such as Sgls1, Gls2, and Gtb1, were N-glycosylated and were involved in the process of mycelial growth, conidiation, and invasive hyphal growth in host cells [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, the ER chaperone protein Lhs1 is also involved in rice infection in the blast fungus. The UPR target genes, including 
 <italic>SIL1, KAR2, PDI1</italic>, and 
 <italic>SCJ1</italic>, are upregulated, and the function and secretion of AVR-Pita in Δ
 <italic>lhs1</italic> are impaired [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. All these results indicate the importance of ER homeostasis for protein secretion and pathogenicity of rice blast.
