<p>The fresh spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) was injected into the leaf sheath by a disposable syringe (without bubbles). The leaf-sheath tube filled with spore suspension was cultured in an incubator at 25°C with a light cycle of 16 h and darkness of 8 h. Then, the transparent thin layer of the leaf sheath was carefully cut off with a blade, and the surface of the leaf sheath in contact with the spores was turned upward to make a slide of the leaf sheath for fluorescence microscope observation. The experiment was repeated three times.
