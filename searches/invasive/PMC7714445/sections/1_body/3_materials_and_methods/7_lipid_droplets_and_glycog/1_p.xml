<p>Tricyclazole (1 μL of 10 μg/mL to inhibit the formation of melanin of the attached cells and reduce the influence on the experimental observation) was added to 1 mL (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) spore suspension. Drops (20 μL) of the spore suspension were inoculated on a hydrophobic membrane at 25°C in the dark and moisturized for 0 h, 8 h, 16 h, and 24 h, respectively. The water was carefully removed and replaced with an equal volume of a Nile red staining solution. After 30 min of incubation in Nile red staining solution, the transport and degradation of red lipid droplets were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Similarly, glycogen was stained in I
 <sub>2</sub>/KI solution for 1 min. The experiment was repeated 3 times, and 200 conidia were counted for each treatment.
