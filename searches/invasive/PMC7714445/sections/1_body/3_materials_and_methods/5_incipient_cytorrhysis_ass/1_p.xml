<p>Incipient cytorrhysis assays were used to determine the appressorium turgor [
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In a humid environment, drops (20 μL) of conidial suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) were incubated on plastic coverslips for 24 h. After that step, the water was carefully removed and replaced with an equal volume of a glycerol solution with a concentration ranging from 0.5 M to 1.5 M. After 1 min of incubation in glycerol solution, the number of appressoria that had collapsed was recorded. The experiments were repeated three times, and more than 200 appressoria were observed each time.
