<p>Fresh plant leaves (0.4 g) which inoculated with spore suspension were ground to powder with liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, Japan) according to manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcription of total RNA was carried out using PrimeScrip
 <sup>TM</sup> RT regent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan). The qRT-PCR was then performed using TB Green® Premix EX Taq
 <sup>TM</sup> (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa, Japan) to analyze the expression level of plant defense-related genes (
 <italic>PR1a, PBZ1</italic>) and callose synthase-encoding genes (
 <italic>OsGSL1, OsGSL3, OsGSL5</italic>).
