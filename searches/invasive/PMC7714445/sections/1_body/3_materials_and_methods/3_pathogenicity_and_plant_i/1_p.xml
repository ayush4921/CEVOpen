<p>Two-week-old seedlings of rice (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cv CO-39) were used in plant infection assays. Conidia harvested from 8-day-old growth on CM plates were resuspended in 0.2% (w/v) gelatin solution for a concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL. The suspension was sprayed evenly onto rice leaves using an artist’s airbrush (Badger Co., Franklin Park, Illinois). The inoculated plants were placed in a dew chamber at 25°C for 48 h in the dark and then transferred to a growth chamber with a cycle of 16 h of light and 8 h of dark using fluorescent lights. The plants were examined for lesions 7 days after inoculation. Disease severity was rated with the scale developed.
