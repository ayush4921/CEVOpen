<p>The 
 <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> strain Guy11 and derivative transformants were cultured on complete medium (CM) in a growth chamber at 25 or 28°C with a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Target gene replacement method was used to generate null mutants (Fig. S8, Table S2). For the oxidative stress test, the strains were cultured on CM media with 5.0 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and cultured in dark at 28°C. For cell wall integrity tests, the strains were cultured on minimal medium (MM) medium supplemented with 0.0025% SDS, 100 μg/mL CFW and 50 μg/mL CR in dark at 28°C. For ER stress tests, the strains were cultured on MM with 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (TUNI) and 5.0 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and cultured under a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle at 25°C.
