<p>Sterilized coverslips were inserted obliquely on the CM solid medium, a suitable amount of mycelium was picked with a toothpick and inoculated onto the CM plates with coverslips, and strains were cultured in a constant temperature incubator at 25°C under 16 h light and 8 h dark. When the aerial hyphae of the strain grew to the middle of the cover glass, the cover glass was gently extracted from the CM plate and placed under a microscope to observe the polarity growth of the strain. CFW solution was added dropwise to the coverslip with aerial hyphae, and after staining for 5 min, it was placed under a fluorescence microscope for observation and photograph recording. The experiment was repeated three times.</p>
