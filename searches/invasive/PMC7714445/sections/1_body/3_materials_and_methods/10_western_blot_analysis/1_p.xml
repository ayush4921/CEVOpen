<p>For Sec63-GFP and cleaved GFP assays, the Sec63-GFP vector was transformed into the Guy11 and mutant strains using ATMT. The Sec63-GFP-expressing strains were grown in CM medium for 7 days and then shifted to nitrogen starvation (SD-N) medium with 5 μM DDT for 4 h to induce ER-phagy. Total proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes for Western blot analysis. Sec63-GFP was detected with a primary anti-GFP antibody (GFP-Tag Rabbit mAb, Huabio, Hangzhou, China) and a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). GAPDH antibodies (Huabio, Hangzhou, China) were used to conﬁrm equal protein loading of each strain.</p>
