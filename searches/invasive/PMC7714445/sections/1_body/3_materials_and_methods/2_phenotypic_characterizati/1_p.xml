<p>For fungal growth and conidiation assays, a 6 × 6 mm mycelium plug of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains was inoculated on complete medium (CM) under the conditions of 25°C, 16 h light/8 h dark for 8 days. The diameter was measured after 8 days. Conidiation was detected by the strains grown for 8 days. The spores were washed with 3 mL water, filtered and diluted to 2 mL. The number of conidia was determined by a counter. To measure conidial germination and appressorium formation, 20 μL of spore suspension (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia/mL) was dropped onto plastic coverslips and incubated at 22°C. Conidial germination and appressorium formation were observed for 4–24 h hpi. To observe conidiophore development of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains, vegetative hyphae inside the medium were sliced into thin pieces, and the pieces were cultured under 16 h light/8 h dark for 24 h at 25°C [
