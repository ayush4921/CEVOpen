<p>The process of penetration mediated by the appressorium requires a large amount of inner turgor pressure, which can enable the appressorium to produce adequate mechanical strength and facilitate rupture of the host cuticle with narrow-penetration hyphae [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As described previously, most of the appressoria of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> cannot form penetration pegs, and we investigated if the appressorium turgor pressure of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was impaired. Specifically, we performed an incipient cytorrhysis assay to measure the turgor pressure exerted by mature appressoria. In this assay, a 0.5–1.5 M concentration of glycerol solution was applied to examine the collapse rate of appressoria. Under treatment with 1 M glycerol, approximately 30% of 24 h appressoria of the wild-type strain and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> collapsed. However, 60% of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> collapsed with this treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(a,b)</xref>). With the increase of glycerol concentration to 1.5 M, the collapse rate of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> appressoria increased to nearly 90% and was higher than that of the wild-type and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(b)</xref>). It was concluded that the turgor pressure of the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> appressoria was decreased compared with that of the wild-type strain.
