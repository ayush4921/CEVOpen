<p>The glycerol in appressoria is primarily produced by the transfer and utilization of glycogen and lipids in conidia. To investigate the glycogen distribution and lipid turnover of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, we employed potassium iodide to stain glycogen and employed Nile red to stain lipids during appressorium development. From 0 to 4 h in the preliminary stage of appressorium development on a hydrophobic surface, abundant lipids were seen in conidia and appressoria of Guy11 and Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(c)</xref>). At 8 hpi, more than 60% lipids in conidia of the wild-type Guy11 and Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> strains were transported to appressoria. At 24 hpi, a significantly higher proportion of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> conidia contained lipids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(d)</xref>). Compared to Guy11, more than 60% of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> appressoria contained lipids at 16 and 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(e)</xref>). Similarly, the distribution of glycogen exhibited the same pattern as lipids in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3(f–h)</xref>. The above results indicate that 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic> is required for lipid droplets and glycogen mobilization from conidia to appressoria.
