<p>In our study, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> exhibited defects similar to those of the atg-deficient mutants, such as reduced turgor pressure, retarded utilization of lipids and glycogen, and reduced virulence. However, neither conidia nuclei degradation nor GFP-MoAtg8 degradation under nutritional deprivation conditions showed the dysregulated autophagy process (Fig. S6, S7). Autophagic cell death and macroautophagy were not impaired in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. Interestingly, we unexpectedly observed that the growth of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> is sensitive to ER stress under the ER stress factors tunicamycin (TUNI) or dithiothreitol (DTT) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(a)</xref>). Under treatment with 0.5 μg/mL TUNI, the growth inhibition rate of the wild-type strain was significantly lower than that of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. Similarly, under 5.0 mM DTT treatment, the growth inhibition rate showed the same differences between the wild-type and Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> strains (

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> strain was inhibited by ER stress factors.
