<p>In response to ER stress, ER-mediated autophagy (ER-phagy) occurs to maintain the normal function of the ER. Therefore, we hypothesized that ER-phagy of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> is impaired under ER stress. MoSec63-GFP is an integral ER membrane protein. It has been reported that 5 μM DTT can induce MoSec63-GFP cleavage, consistent with the activation of selective autophagy by ER stress. We constructed the MoSec63-GFP fluorescent vector and transformed it into the wild-type Guy11 strain and the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant strain. Under the induction of DTT, the expression of GFP differed significantly between Guy11 and Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(c)</xref>). At 0 h, there was little free GFP in Guy11 and more free GFP in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. At 4 h, the amount of GFP-containing fragments was substantially enhanced in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> compared with Guy11 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(c)</xref>). These results indicate that the absence of MoSec61β stimulates ER-mediated autophagy.
