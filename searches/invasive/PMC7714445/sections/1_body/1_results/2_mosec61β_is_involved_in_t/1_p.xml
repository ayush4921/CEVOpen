<p>To determine the reasons for the reduced virulence of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, we first analyzed conidium germination and appressorium formation. However, there were no significant differences in conidia germination, appressorium formation, or appressorium morphology among Guy11, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> (Table S1, Fig. S4). Then, we performed penetration assays on barley leaves. Few appressoria of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> could form penetration pegs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a,b)</xref>). Additionally, the appressorial penetration rate of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> on barley leaves was significantly decreased compared to that of the wild-type and complementation strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(a)</xref>). At 48 hpi (hours post-inoculation), the appressorial penetration rate of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was approximately half of that in the wild-type and complementation strains 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(c)</xref>). At 72 hpi, more than 90% of Guy11 appressoria penetrated barley cells. However, only 30% of the appressoria of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> penetrated barley cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(c)</xref>). Further observation showed that Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> displayed defects in IH extension. At 48 hpi, nearly 50% of IH in the wild-type and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> strains showed transcellular infection, and less than 10% IH of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> invaded neighboring cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(d)</xref>). At 72 hpi, more than 80% of IH in the wild-type and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> strains colonized other cells, but only 10% of IH in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> expanded into adjacent cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(d)</xref>). These data demonstrated that the infection and IH extension of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> are notably impaired.
