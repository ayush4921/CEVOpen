<p>Sequence alignment analysis showed that MGG_03644 shared 48.72% and 57.83% identity with 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sbh1p and Sbh2p, respectively (Fig. S1). We termed MGG_03644 as 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic>. MoSec61β is predicted to encode 144 amino acids (aa) and spans the membrane once (85–103 aa), with the N-terminus being in the cytosol. Then, the biological functions of MoSec61β were explored using target gene replacement. In addition, the full-length genomic copy of 
 <italic>MoSEC61β</italic> was reintroduced into Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> for genetic complementation analysis, and we named the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic>.
