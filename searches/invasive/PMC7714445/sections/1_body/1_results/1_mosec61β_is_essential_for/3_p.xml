<p>To identify the role of MoSec61β in cell wall integrity, we monitored the effects of various cell wall perturbing agents on the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant. Mycelial growth was measured on MM plates supplemented with CFW, Congo red (CR) and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), compounds known to cause cell wall stress. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(g)</xref>, the sensitivity of the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant to CFW and Congo red was significantly different from that of both the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic>. The growth inhibition rates of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> to CFW and Congo red were significantly different from those of Guy11 and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> (Fig. S2). These results indicated that the loss of MoSec61β affects cell wall integrity.
