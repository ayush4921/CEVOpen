<p>To investigate whether MoSec61β is related to the virulence of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, two susceptible hosts, rice (CO-39) and barley (ZJ-8), were employed for the assessment of the pathogenicity of strains. After inoculation on barley leaves with conidia suspension (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia/ml) for 4 days, the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> caused yellow and brown lesions with rotten plant tissues, while inoculation with Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> resulted in tiny lesions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(h)</xref>). Similarly, when inoculated onto barley leaves with mycelium plugs, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> also caused weaker disease lesions compared to the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> (Fig. S3). When sprayed onto 21-day rice seedlings with conidia suspension (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> conidia/ml), Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> caused small necrotic flecks, while the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> caused typical spindle-like, gray centered blast lesions and many merged lesions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(i)</xref>). The disease lesion areas in 5-cm-long infected leaves caused by Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> (10.23 ± 1.23%) were significantly smaller than those caused by the wild-type Guy11 (51.30 ± 4.87%) and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> (49.75 ± 1.96%) 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(j)</xref>). Thus, MoSec61β was observed to play an important role in pathogenicity.
