<p>The growth rate of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> is lower than that of the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a,c)</xref>). Microscopic observation showed that the pear-shaped conidia of Guy11, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, or 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> were distributed in a concentric axis at the top of the fascicular conidiophore (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(b)</xref>). However, statistical analysis showed that the number of conidia produced by Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was clearly decreased. Compared to the wild-type strain, the sporulation in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was decreased to half of that in Guy11 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(d)</xref>). Additionally, compared with the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic>, the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mycelia produced more apical and subapical branches, and the wild-type Guy11 and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> maintained the vertical growth of mycelium without sub-top branches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(e)</xref>). To clearly observe the morphology of hyphae, we stained the mycelia of Guy11, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> using calcofluor white (CFW). The mycelia of wild-type Guy11 and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> were straight, and the cell intervals were largely equidistant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(f)</xref>). In contrast, the interval of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mycelia had irregular branches, and the spacing interval of each cell was shorter than that of Guy11 and was not evenly spaced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(f)</xref>). MoSec61β was determined to be involved in the morphogenesis and separation of vegetative mycelia.
