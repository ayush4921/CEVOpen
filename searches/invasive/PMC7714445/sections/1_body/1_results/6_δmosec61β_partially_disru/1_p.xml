<p>To assess whether the MoSec61β protein is involved in the secretion of effectors, we performed live cell imaging of biotrophic invasion by transformants expressing the cytoplasmic effector fusion protein Pwl2-GFP and the apoplastic effector fusion protein Bas4-mCherry, Slp-GFP. During the early infection stage at 48 hpi, Pwl2-GFP localized to a single punctate BIC in the wild-type Guy11 and the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(a)</xref>), indicating that secretion of cytoplasmic effectors was not impaired in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. In wild-type Guy11, the Bas4-mCherry fusion protein outlines the IH and occupies an inner layer of the BIC. In contrast, the localization of Bas4-mCherry for the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant was partially disrupted, while localization of the Pwl2-GFP fusion appeared to be normal. Localization patterns of Bas4-mCherry in the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant could be further divided into two types, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(b)</xref>. With type 1, the fluorescence of Bas4-mCherry (32%) was uniformly wrapped the IH and was located in EIHM, which is the same as with the wild-type strain. In type 2, the localization of Bas4-mCherry could not be correctly accumulated in EIHM (68%). In contrast, nearly all randomly imaged infection sites of the wild-type strain showed the type 1 pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(c)</xref>, Bas4-mCherry). Similar results were observed in apoplastic effector Slp1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7(c)</xref>, Slp1-GFP). About 98% of Slp1-GFP could trace out IH and locate in EIHM in the wild-type Guy11. In contrast, two types of Slp1-GFP localization patterns were also observed in the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant, type 1 (~ 40% of Slp1-GFP could be correctly accumulated in EIHM) and type2 (~ 60% could not be correctly accumulated in EIHM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Figure 7</xref>, Slp1-GFP). These results confirmed that the localization patterns of Bas4-mCherry and Slp1-GFP were seriously impaired in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. As previously described, MoSec61β is an ER transmembrane protein, and its deletion may cause abnormal secretion of effector proteins. These results indicate that proper localization of apoplastic effectors in EIHM depends in part on MoSec61β.
