<p>To further confirm that the defects of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> in infectious growth were caused by the failure to resist the immunity of plants, we used pathogens to infect heat-killed plant cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The penetration assay was carried out with rice leaf sheaths incubated at 75°C for 25 min before inoculation. After 48 hpi, almost all of the appressoria formed by the wild type (98.24 ± 1.04%) and Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> (96.73 ± 0.97%) penetrated the epidermal cells of rice leaf sheaths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(c)</xref>). In addition, it is obvious that the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> IH are no longer confined in the first cell, and the percentage of IH extending to the neighboring cells is greatly increased. There was no significant difference compared with the wild-type Guy11 (90.14 ± 2.30%) and the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant (89.63 ± 2.10%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5(d)</xref>). We reperformed the penetration assays with heat-killed onion epidermal cells, and similar infectious patterns were observed in the wild-type and Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> strains (
