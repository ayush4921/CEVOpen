<p>Callose, a β-1,3-glucanase induced by plant defense responses, provides chemical defenses at the cellular sites of attack [
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To investigate the induction of callose by infection of the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant and the wild-type Guy11 respectively, we observed the accumulation of callose deposits at the cell wall crossing sites around IH using aniline blue staining. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6(a)</xref>, the number of the callose deposits around the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> IH was significantly more than that around the Guy11 IH at 32 dpi. Treatment of DPI decreased the number of the callose deposits around the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> IH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6(a,b)</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression levels of 3 callose synthase-encoding genes (
 <italic>OsGSL1, OsGSL3, OsGSL5</italic>) were investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. The expression level of 
 <italic>OsGSL1</italic> reached the peak at 32 hpi in the leaves of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β-</italic>challenged rice, and it was 20 folds as high as that in the leaves of wild-type Guy11-challenged rice. In addition, the expression of 
 <italic>OsGSL3</italic> and 
 <italic>OsGSL5</italic> genes was also slightly induced in leaves of the Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β-</italic>challenged rice, with higher induction levels as compared to those in leaves of the Guy11-challenged rice at 32 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6(c)</xref>). These data indicated that Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was defective in overcoming plant defense responses because of its weak capacity in degrading callose. The above results suggested that MoSec61β is necessary for overcoming plant defense responses.
