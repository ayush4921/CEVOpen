<p>Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins have been used as markers of plant defense responses. In order to further investigate whether the plant defense genes were stimulated by infection with Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, the expression patterns of 
 <italic>PBZ1</italic> and 
 <italic>PR1a</italic> genes were analyzed through quantitative RT-PCR. 
 <italic>PBZ1</italic>, a probenazole-inducible gene from rice, triggers non-race specific resistance in rice plants against rice blast fungus [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 
 <italic>PR1a</italic> is one of the PR proteins, which accumulates after blast fungus infection in rice [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The expression level of 
 <italic>PBZ1</italic> was up-regulated in leaves of blast-fungus-challenged rice at 24 hpi, 32 hpi, and 48 hpi, whereas there were no obvious differences in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> or Guy11-challenged rice leaves (Fig. S5a). In contrast, the expression level of 
 <italic>PR1a</italic> in leaves of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β-</italic>challenged rice was higher than that in leaves of Guy11-challenged rice at 24 hpi and 48 hpi (Fig. S5B). The expression level of 
 <italic>PR1a</italic> in leaves of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β-</italic>challenged rice at 24 hpi was 4 folds as high as that in leaves of Guy11-challenged rice (Fig. S5b). The induction of plant defense responses in Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>-challenged rice may contribute to the retardation of IH development.
