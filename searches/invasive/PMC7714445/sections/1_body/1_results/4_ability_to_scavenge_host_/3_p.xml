<p>Furthermore, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) was applied to the rice sheath to determine whether ROS accumulation is the primary factor causing IH defects. Under normal conditions (without DPI), less than 10% of the appressoria of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> penetrated into adjacent cells at 48 h, but more than 50% of the wild-type appressoria successfully developed IH in the neighboring cells. Under the condition of 0.2 μM DPI treatment, the extension of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> IH to adjacent cells increased threefold at 48 h. However, there were no obvious changes in the wild-type strain (

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was due to host ROS accumulation.
