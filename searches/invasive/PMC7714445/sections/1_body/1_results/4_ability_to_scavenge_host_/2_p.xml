<p>Then, 3,3ʹ-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was used to capture hydrogen peroxide (one type of ROS) produced in the infected barley leaves. At 38 hpi, Guy11 was able to invade the surface cells and was observed to expand to the surrounding cells, and no obvious ROS were dyed. In contrast, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> IH was confined in the first cell and surrounded by obvious reddish-brown dyed ROS (

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> (67.88 ± 1.50%) in rice cells. However, few brown granules (19.78 ± 0.19%) were observed in the wild-type Guy11 and the complementation strain (

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> to scavenge host ROS was reduced.
