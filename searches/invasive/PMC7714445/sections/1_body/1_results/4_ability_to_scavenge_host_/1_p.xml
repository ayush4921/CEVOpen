<p>When plants are attacked by pathogens, the plant cells generate massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inhibit or directly kill invading pathogens [

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> IH failed to colonize adjacent cells was related to its abnormal ability to scavenge ROS. To confirm this possibility, we determined the ability of Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> to resist redox stress. The mycelial plugs of Guy11, Δ
 <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mosec61βc</italic> were inoculated onto CM supplemented with the oxidative stress agent H

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> was significantly higher than that of Guy11 (

 <italic>Mosec61β</italic> mutant is more sensitive to oxidative stress than the wild-type strain.
