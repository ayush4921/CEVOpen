  <p>Penetration assays with heat-killed rice leaf sheaths and onion epidermis. (a) Conidia solution was inoculated into normal or heat-treated leaf sheaths, and infection was observed after 48 hpi. Bar = 20 μm. Black arrows point to IH. White arrows point to IH, which was expanded in adjacent cells. (b) Conidia solution was inoculated into normal or heat-treated onion epidermal cells, and infection was observed after 48 hpi. Bar = 20 μm. Black arrows point to IH. White arrows point to IH, which was expanded in adjacent cells. (c) Statistical analysis of the infection rate of the appressoria of the 
   <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains in leaf sheaths at 48 hpi. (d) The percentage of invasive hyphae extended to adjacent cells in normal or heat-treated leaf sheaths at 48 hpi. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Significant differences compared with the wild-type strain were estimated by Duncan’s test: **P &lt; 0.01, *P &lt; 0.05
