  <p>Responses of 
   <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains to ER stress. (a) Mycelial colonies of Guy11, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c cultured on MM media containing 0.5 μg/mL TUNI and 5.0 mM DTT at 25°C with a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle for 8 days. (b) Growth inhibition rate of mycelial colonies on 0.5 μg/mL TUNI and 5.0 mM DTT. (c) ER-phagy of Sec63-GFP in Guy11 and Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>. Total proteins were extracted from the Sec63-GFP expressed strains exposed to nitrogen starvation conditions with 5 μM DDT for 0 and 4 h. Full-length Sec63-GFP and free GFP were detected using GFP antibodies as described in the Materials and Methods. The extent of ER-phagy was estimated by calculating the amount of free GFP compared with the total amount of intact Sec63-GFP and free GFP. Quantitative analysis of the individual bands was performed using ImageJ software. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Signiﬁcant differences between the mutant and wild-type strains, as estimated by Duncan’s test: **P &lt; 0.01, *P &lt; 0.05
