  <p>(a) Collapse of appressoria at 0.5 M glycerol. 5 Bar = 20 μm. (b) A 0.5–1.5 molar concentration of glycerol solution was applied to examine the collapse rate of appressoria in Guy11, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c. Arrows indicate the collapsed appressoria. (c) Cellular distribution of lipid droplets during appressorium development. Samples were stained with Nile red and observed with UV epiﬂuorescence. The lipid droplets show a red signal ﬂuorescence. Bar = 20 μm. (d) The percentage of conidia containing lipid droplets during appressorial development. (e) The percentage of appressoria containing lipid droplets. (f) Cellular distribution of glycogen during appressorium development. Bar = 20 μm. Samples were stained with KI/I
   <sub>2</sub> solution at the indicated time phase. The glycogen appears as dark brown deposits. (g) The percentage of conidia containing glycogen. (h) The percentage of appressoria containing glycogen during appressorium development. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Significant differences compared with the wild-type strain were estimated by Duncan’s test: **P &lt; 0.01, *P &lt; 0.05
