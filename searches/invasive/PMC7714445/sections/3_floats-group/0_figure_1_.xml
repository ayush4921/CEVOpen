  <p>MoSec61β is involved in hyphal growth, asexual reproduction, cell wall integrity, and pathogenicity. (a) Growth of Guy11, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c on CM plates. Strains were inoculated on CM plates for 8 days. (b) Conidiophores of wild-type, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c. Bar = 50 μm. (c) Mycelial diameters of the wild-type, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c strains. (d) Conidiation of Guy11, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c. (e) Morphology of vegetative hyphae of Guy11, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c on cover glass. Bar = 50 μm. (f) Vegetative hyphae of wild-type, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c stained with CFW. White arrows point to the septa. Bar = 20 μm. (g) Strains were incubated on MM plates supplemented with various stress inducers at 25°C for 7 days. Growth of strains in media supplemented with 0.0025% SDS, 100 μg/mL CFW, and 50 μg/mL Congo red (CR). (h) Pathogenicity on barley leaves. Twenty microliters conidial drops (5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> mL
   <sup>−1</sup>) were inoculated on barley leaves. Photographs were taken after 4 dpi. (i) Pathogenicity of rice seedlings. Conidia (5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> mL
   <sup>−1</sup>) were sprayed on 21-day-old rice seedlings. Photographs were taken after 7 dpi. (j) Disease score assays for Guy11, Δ
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mosec61β</italic>c. The proportion of lesion areas in 5-cm leaves was measured by Photoshop CS6. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Signiﬁcant differences between the mutant and wild-type strains, as estimated by Duncan’s test: **P &lt; 0.01, *P &lt; 0.05
