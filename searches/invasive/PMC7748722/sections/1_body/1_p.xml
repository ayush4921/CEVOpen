<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> were obtained from the Urumqi County, Urumqi, Xinjiang Province of China (87°46′E, 43°49′N) with voucher specimen deposited at the Xinjiang Agricultural University Herbarium (XN2019092603). After DNA extraction, high-throughput DNA sequencing (pair-end 150 bp) was conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq platform (Illumina, CA, USA) at Genepioneer Biotechnologies Inc., Nanjing, China. Approximately 5.0 Gb of sequence data were generated and used for the assembly of cp genome with SPAdes (Bankevich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The assembled genome was annotated using CpGAVAS (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The cp genome of 
 <italic>Solanum demissum</italic> (NC_041552.1) was included as the initial reference. The annotated genomic sequence has been submitted to GenBank with the accession number MN635796.
