 <italic>Solanum rostratum</italic> (Solanaceae) is an annual herb native to Mexico and considered as an invasive plant in Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia with a high reproductive ability, strong seed dispersal ability, and efficient seed germination ability (Lin and Tan

Now, the species has spread across almost all regions of Northern China including Liaoning, Jilin, Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia (Wei et al.
