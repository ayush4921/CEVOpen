<p>The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> which contained a typical conserved quadripartite structure, with a LSC region of 86,281 bp, a SSC region of 18,442 bp, and a pair of IRs regions of 25,418 bp, was 155,559 bp in length. The total GC content of whole genome, LSC, SSC, and IRa/IRb regions was 35.87, 31.91, 43.07, and 43.07%, respectively. A total of 130 genes were identified, including 85 protein-coding, 37 transfer RNA, and eight ribosome RNA genes. Among these genes, 19 genes (trnK-UUU, rps16, trnG-UCC, atpF, rpoC1, trnL-UAA, trnV-UAC, rps12, petB, petD, rpl16, rpl2 × 2, ndhB × 2, rps12, trnI-GAU × 2, trnA-UGC × 2, and ndhA) contained a single intron and two genes (ycf3 and clpP) contained two introns.
