<p id="Par8">In the present study, we compared microhabitat use, foraging substrates, prey choice, prey attack rate and foraging success of Small Tree Finches and Warbler Finches in three different habitat conditions that varied in the degree of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> invasion and the length of time since the last herbicide application. We hypothesized that food availability would be lower in areas where herbicides had been recently applied, since manual and chemical control of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> altered the vegetation structure and reduced plant biomass. Thus, we predicted a lower prey attack rate and foraging success in the recently controlled area. Furthermore, we assumed that prey attack rate and foraging success in different microhabitats (e.g. near ground, understory, canopy) would differ between invaded and managed sites and this difference would be most pronounced in the understory of the recently controlled area.
