<p id="Par7">Sampling arthropod abundance may not be the most accurate way to assess food availability for insectivorous birds because arthropods differ in mobility, crypsis and palatability (Sherry

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1988</xref>; Hutto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1990</xref>). In combination, these factors will influence the prey availability that birds are actually experiencing. Thus, it may be more effective to measure bird behaviours that reflect prey availability (Hutto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1990</xref>; Lovette and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1995</xref>). Prey attack rate has been suggested and used as appropriated measure by several authors (Hutto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1990</xref>; Lovette and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1995</xref>; Olsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>; Oyugi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>). However, in extractive foraging, birds are searching for hidden food, which makes it difficult to distinguish between search manoeuvres and prey attacks. Therefore, prey attack rates do not necessarily reflect prey availability. Foraging success (number of food items consumed per time) could be a more accurate measure for food availability. However, measuring foraging success is often not feasible, if birds are observed from a distance. The Small Tree Finch and the Warbler Finch are partly extractive foragers and can be observed from a very close distance. Therefore, we used both, prey attack rate, measured as foraging techniques performed per foraging time, and foraging success, measured as foraging items ingested per foraging time as an index for food availability and abundance.
