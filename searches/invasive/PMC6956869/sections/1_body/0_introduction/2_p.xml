<p id="Par5">Bird counts between 1997 and 2010 on Santa Cruz Island, the island with the highest population of humans in Galápagos, revealed that six out of nine investigated passerines had declined significantly (Dvorak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>). The most dramatic decline was observed in the insectivorous Warbler Finch (
 <italic>Certhidea olivacea</italic>), which is the smallest of the Darwin’s Finches. From 1997 to 2010, its population on Santa Cruz Island decreased by 45% in the humid native forest (
 <italic>Scalesia</italic> forest) and by 85% in the agricultural zone. The closely related sympatric Small Tree Finch (
 <italic>Camarhynchus parvulus</italic>) has shown a population decline since 2005 (Cimadom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). We investigated the breeding success of both species in the 
 <italic>Scalesia</italic> forest, which is the area with the highest density of arboreal Darwin’s Finches, and found that both species suffered from high brood loss due to the invasive parasitic fly 
 <italic>Philornis downsi</italic> (Cimadom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). The larval stage of this obligate bird parasite develops in birds’ nests and sucks blood from the nestlings (Dudaniec and Kleindorfer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>; Fessl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; O’Connor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">b</xref>). Parasitism by 
 <italic>P. downsi</italic> has probably caused population declines of several Darwin’s Finch species (Fessl et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010a</xref>,
