<p id="Par23">Prey could be identified in 326 out of 612 first foraging observations. For Small Tree Finches, animals were the food source in 34% of the observations (
 <italic>n</italic> = 133) and for Warbler Finches in 96% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 193). Main animal prey types for Small Tree Finches and Warbler finches were ‘other arthropods’, ‘caterpillars’ and ‘moth’ (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Plant food resources of Small Tree Finches were more diverse than of Warbler Finches. They used ‘nectar’ of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> (73%), 
 <italic>C. auriculatum</italic> (18%) and 
 <italic>Passiflora sp.</italic> (9%), ‘fruit’ of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> (58%) and 
 <italic>C. auriculatum</italic> (42%). Small Tree Finches also collected the ‘seed’ of seed stems of 
 <italic>S. pedunculata</italic> (64%), as well as the seeds of various herb species (24%) and seeds from the ground (12%). The only plant food source of the Warbler Finch was ‘nectar’ of
