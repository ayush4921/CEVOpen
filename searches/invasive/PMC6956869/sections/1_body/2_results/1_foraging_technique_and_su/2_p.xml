<p id="Par20">‘Dead leaf’ was the substrate used most frequently by both species (Small Tree Finch: 43%; Warbler Finch: 36%, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and they almost exclusively foraged on dead leaves of the endemic 
 <italic>S. pedunculata</italic> tree (Small Tree Finch: 96%; Warbler Finch: 85%). Small Tree Finches additionally used ‘
 <italic>Scalesia</italic> seed’, ‘herb’, 
 <italic>‘C. auriculatum</italic>’ and ‘soil’. Other important substrates for Warbler Finches were ‘leaf’, ‘moss’, ‘twig’, ‘bark’ and ‘
