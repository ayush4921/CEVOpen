<p id="Par27">For the Small Tree Finch, habitat condition, microhabitat and the interaction term all proved to have a significant effect on its foraging success (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Foraging success in the understory of the ‘long-term management’ area was more than twice as high as in the canopy of the same area and also in the understory of the two other habitat conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Remarkably none of these effects remained significant, when only considering animal food (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The foraging success of the Warbler Finch was significantly higher in the understory than in the canopy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), but it was not affected by habitat conditions or the interaction term habitat condition × microhabitat (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).
