<p id="Par26">In both species prey attack rate was neither affected by habitat conditions nor by microhabitat or the interaction term habitat condition × microhabitat (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). However, when only considering animal food, microhabitat proved to significantly affect prey attack rate of Small Tree Finches with a generally higher rate in the canopy layer (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
