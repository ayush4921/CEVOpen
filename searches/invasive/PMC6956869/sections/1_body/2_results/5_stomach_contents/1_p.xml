<p id="Par28">For both Darwin’s Finch species, ‘caterpillars’ was the most abundant arthropod category. Furthermore, we found a high number of ‘seeds’, ‘stones’ and beetles of the family Curculionidae in the stomachs of Small Tree Finch chicks, whilst Warbler Finch chicks had many ‘invertebrate eggs’ in their stomachs. Small Tree Finch chicks were additionally fed with ‘beetles’, ‘spiders’, ‘ants’ and ‘cicadas’ and Warbler Finch chicks with ‘ants’, ‘spiders’, ‘moths’, ‘beetles’ and ‘cicadas’. The mean number of ‘seeds’, ‘stones’ and ‘invertebrate eggs’, along with the mean number of the most common arthropod taxa found in the stomachs of dead chicks, are depicted in Fig.
