<p id="Par30">Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find a lower prey attack rate or lower foraging success in either bird species in the ‘recently controlled’ area compared to the other areas. One possible explanation for this result is that both species foraged mainly in the canopy, which is the microhabitat least affected by the control measures of the Galápagos National Park Directorate. The main foraging technique used by both species in the canopy was ‘probe’, applied to the substrates ‘dead leaf’ and ‘moss’. 
 <italic>Scalesia</italic> trees provide several suitable microhabitats for a variety of insects, such as dead leaves remaining attached to branches, moss and bark. Attached dead leaves play an important role for several Neotropical insectivorous birds with foraging techniques adapted to utilise this particular feeding niche (Remsen and Parker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>; Canaday 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>). However, the search for arthropods hidden in curled dead leaves comes at a high trial and error cost, resulting in a higher prey attack rate but not higher foraging success in the canopy. In line with this, the prey attack rate of Small Tree Finches was higher in the canopy than in the understory, but the foraging success was similar in both vegetation strata. Nonetheless, foraging in the canopy may be more profitable because attached dead leaves often contain large and soft prey items like caterpillars and orthopterans with a high energy and protein content, which is important during chick rearing (Remsen and Parker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>; Rosenberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1997</xref>; Sutherland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). A qualitative search revealed that during daytime, many spiders, beetles, caterpillars and orthopterans hide in dead 
 <italic>Scalesia</italic> leaves still attached to the branches.
