<p id="Par34">Our study suggests that the invasive 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> provides a new foraging substrate and food resources (‘nectar’ and ‘fruit’), especially for the Small Tree Finch. The incorporation of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> into the species’ diet in less than two decades is another example of the flexibility of Darwin’s Finches in exploiting newly available food sources (Tebbich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>; Christensen and Kleindorfer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). It is known that bird-flower visitation and seed dispersal networks can lead to an accelerated spread of introduced species and if so, this could be a key factor in such species becoming invasive (Richardson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>; Bartuszevige and Gorchov 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Traveset et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). As 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> flowers and fruits are also part of the diet of other Darwin’s Finches and other land birds (Jewell and Buddenhagen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>; Heleno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>), the birds can be considered as vectors for the spread of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic>.
