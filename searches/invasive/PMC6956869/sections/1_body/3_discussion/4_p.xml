<p id="Par32">Both the invasion of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> and the management of invasive plants influenced microhabitat use, foraging substrate and prey choice of the two Darwin’s Finch species in this study. 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> and other introduced plant species were frequently used as substrates and food sources in the ‘invaded’ area. In this area, Warbler Finches used the microhabitat understory significantly more often than in the ‘long-term management’ area. A reason for this may be that in the ‘long-term management’ area, the understory had been reduced to a few native shrubs and herbaceous species. Additionally, GNPD rangers had removed dead plant structures from this area and structures which were used by Warbler Finches as foraging substrate in the ‘recently controlled’ area. The microhabitat use of Small Tree Finches did not differ among the three habitat conditions, probably because overall they were more frequent users of the canopy.
