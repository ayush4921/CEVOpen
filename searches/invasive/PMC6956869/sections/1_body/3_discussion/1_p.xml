<p id="Par29">The foraging success of Small Tree Finches was twice as high in the understory of the ‘long-term management’ area than in the understory of the ‘recently controlled’ and ‘invaded’ areas. The foraging success of the Small Tree Finch in the understory of the ‘long-term management’ area was also twice as high as in the canopy of the same area. However, this effect disappeared when animal food was considered only. A possible explanation could be that across all three habitat conditions, the ‘long-term management’ area represented the most natural
