<p id="Par33">The invasion of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> influenced the diet of both studied species. In the ‘invaded’ area, the composition of plants used as food differed significantly from the other two habitat conditions, whilst arthropod prey types were similar in all habitat conditions. In our study, Small Tree Finches foraged ‘nectar’ and ‘fruit’ more often in the ‘invaded’ area than in the other habitat conditions. In ‘recently controlled’ and ‘long-term management’ areas ‘seed’ from 
 <italic>S. pedunculata</italic> was the most important plant food source. Small Tree Finches were observed consuming plant food twice as often in the present study (66% of the foraging observations) than reported in Tebbich et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>; 33% of the observations). Tebbich et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>) conducted their survey from 1995 to 1998, prior to the invasion of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic>, so at that time ‘nectar’ and ‘fruit’ from this species were not available.
