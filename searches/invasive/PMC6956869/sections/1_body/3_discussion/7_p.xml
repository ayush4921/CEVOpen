<p id="Par35">This study has revealed novel data about foraging techniques, substrates, prey items, use of microhabitats and foraging success of arboreal Darwin’s Finches. However, prey attack rate and foraging success measured by items attacked or ingested per time does not give a direct measure of prey quality. This would require the collection and analysis of plant food sources and arthropods in the three habitat conditions. A study investigating food availability must be based on a detailed analysis of the foraging ecology of the target species (Hutto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1990</xref>; Johnson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>). The present study indicates that the most important substrates used by both Darwin’s Finch species are dead and green leaves in the canopy, moss on tree trunks and the understory in general; hence these structures should be targeted for future arthropod sampling. Field observations suggested that moths and caterpillars were the most frequent prey items and thus they should receive specific attention. However, the analysis of stomach contents of dead chicks showed that not all prey types had been recorded during the field observations. While analysis of stomach contents confirmed caterpillars as the most abundant invertebrate prey type, ‘ants’, ‘beetles’, ‘cicadas’, ‘invertebrate eggs’ and ‘spiders’ were also found, although they were rarely recorded as prey in the field. Future studies investigating the foraging ecology of arboreal Darwin’s Finches should also consider these taxa for arthropod sampling. Another limitation of our study is that data cover only the wet, breeding season when food is more abundant (Tebbich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>). It is possible that the harsher conditions of the dry season present the real bottleneck in food abundance, which could potentially influence the survival of fledglings differentially in ‘invaded’, ‘recently controlled’ and ‘long-term management’ areas.
