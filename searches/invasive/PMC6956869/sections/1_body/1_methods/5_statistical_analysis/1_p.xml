<p id="Par18">We used chi-square tests to test for differences in foraging technique, substrate, microhabitat use and prey types among the three different habitat conditions. When tests indicated significant effects, we subsequently calculated pair-wise comparisons between habitat conditions and applied a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing. Since both Darwin’s Finch species rarely used the ground, we excluded this microhabitat from the statistical analysis. In the Warbler Finch we rarely observed the use of plant food and thus we excluded plant food sources from the statistical analysis for this species. If cell frequencies were below 10, Yates’ continuity correction was calculated. All tests were two-tailed with an alpha level of 0.05. We calculated generalized linear models (GLMs; with normal error distribution and log link function) to evaluate the effects of habitat conditions, microhabitat and the interaction term habitat conditions × microhabitat on the prey attack rate and foraging success, respectively, of both Small Tree Finch and Warbler Finch using Statistica version 7.1 software (StatSoft, Inc. 1984–2005). For the Small Tree Finch, we calculated models using values for prey attack rate and foraging success based on all consumed food and considering only animal food. GLMs evaluating effects on prey attack rate and foraging success of the Warbler Finch only considered animal food.</p>
