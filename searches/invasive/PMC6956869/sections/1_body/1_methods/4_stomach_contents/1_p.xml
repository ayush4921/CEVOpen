<p id="Par17">Since nestling diets may differ from adult diets and small prey items can often not be identified in foraging observations but in stomach contents, we analyzed stomachs of dead chicks. These were collected from unsuccessful nests of both Darwin’s Finch species. Dead chicks were transferred to the lab and individually stored in 70% alcohol (Small Tree Finch: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 26; Warbler Finch: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 16). The stomach was excised, cut open, the content placed into a petri dish and then dried for at least 10 min and identified using a stereomicroscope. Stomach contents were categorized as ‘stones’, ‘seeds’, ‘invertebrate eggs’, ‘ants’, ‘beetles’, ‘caterpillars’, ‘moths’, ‘cicadas’ and ‘spiders’. ‘Stones’, ‘seeds’ and ‘invertebrate eggs’ were counted. To estimate the number of insects, we used the number of heads, pairs of mandibles or other bigger chitin structures. Since parts of insects may be missing, the results for arthropods are descriptive only. Unidentified material was not quantified and was excluded from the results.
