<p id="Par16">To measure the prey attack rate and foraging success, we followed individual birds and recorded all foraging events on a tape recorder with an integrated stopwatch (Olympus Digital Voice Recorder VN-712PC) during a continuous focal observation (Small Tree Finch: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 150; Warbler Finch: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 191). Following Lovette and Holmes (1997) we defined prey attack rate as the number of performed foraging techniques per minute foraging time and foraging success as the number of food items (arthropods and plants) ingested per minute foraging time. Observations began with the first foraging event of the focal individual and ended when the bird switched microhabitat or flew out of sight. Since Darwin’s Finches sometimes combine foraging with short singing and preening bouts, observations did not end when birds briefly engaged in other behaviours. However, when birds clearly stopped foraging and engaged in other behavioural activities that lasted longer than several seconds observation stopped. Thus, foraging time corresponds to length of observation in which birds predominantly foraged. Observed foraging bouts were between 13 to 703 s long (median 157 s). The vegetation density is much higher in heavily invaded habitat condition than in the recently controlled and in the long-term managed areas, which may affect observability. However, the duration of foraging bouts did not differ significantly among the three habitat conditions (Kruskal–Wallis test; Small Tree Finch: 
 <italic>H</italic> = 1.57, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.455; Warbler Finch: 
 <italic>H</italic> = 3.37, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.186, Online Resource Table S1). Additionally, the duration of foraging bouts did not differ significantly between the two microhabitats analysed (Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test, Small Tree Finch: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 2016.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.161; Warbler Finch: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 4410.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.211, Online Resource Table S2).
