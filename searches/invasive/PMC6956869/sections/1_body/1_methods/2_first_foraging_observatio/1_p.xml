<p id="Par12">We monitored the foraging behaviour of the more generalist Small Tree Finch and the insectivorous Warbler Finch during their breeding season from January–April 2014 in the three habitat conditions, following the classification system of Remsen and Robinson (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1990</xref>) and Tebbich et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>). To access the study area, a 50 × 50 m grid trail system was cut into the dense invaded understory vegetation by GNPD rangers. Observations were carried out from 06:30 to 12:30 a.m. The first time that an observed bird was seen foraging, is referred to as ‘first foraging observation’. We used first foraging observations to collect data on foraging substrate, foraging technique, foraging height, microhabitat (ground, understory up to 3.5 m and canopy above 3.5 m) and prey type (Small Tree Finch: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 248; Warbler Finch: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 364). To minimize the possibility of repeated observations of the same bird individual during a day, we used trails to explore different areas in the three habitat conditions. However, except in the case of banded birds, it was not possible to exclude the possibility of individuals entering the data set more than once.
