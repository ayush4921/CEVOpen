<p id="Par10">We conducted foraging observations in three study areas with different 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> management regimes (=habitat conditions): (1) an area heavily invaded by 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> and other introduced plant species, which had not been subjected to any control measures (referred to as ‘invaded’, 8 ha), (2) an area in which invasive plant species had been manually removed and subsequently treated with herbicides six months prior to data collection (referred to as ‘recently controlled’, 3.2 ha) and (3) an area in which the initial manual and chemical control of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> (and other invasive plant species) had been followed up by localized herbicide applications on the invasive species’ regrowth since 2010 (referred to as ‘long-term management’, 6.7 ha). The long-term management measures in this area resulted in an open understory.
