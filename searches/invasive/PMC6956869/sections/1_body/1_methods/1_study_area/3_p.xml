<p id="Par11">The manual and chemical control of 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> consisted of the GNPD cutting down the plants with machetes and a subsequent herbicide application (mixture of glyphosate and COMBO© = picloram and metsulfuron-methyl) on the re-grown shoots. These control measures led to the removal of almost the entire understory, with dead 
 <italic>R. niveus</italic> branches and other dead plant structures left in the ‘recently controlled’ areas.
