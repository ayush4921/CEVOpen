  <p>Differences in 8 traits (a–h) between naturalized and invasive congeneric pairs from Australia's pool of introduced species (number of total pairs differs for each trait: [a–h] 56, 44, 56, 21, 35, 35, and 35 respectively; frequency, number of cogeneric pairs; central dashed line, no difference in traits between naturalized and invasive species; *, significant results at α = 0.05). For example, there are 5 congeneric pairs for which the difference in SLA between naturalized and invasive congeneric pairs is −100. The number is negative for the 5 pairs because naturalized species have larger SLA than invasive species.</p>
