<p>The breadth of mean annual temperatures and precipitation encountered in the native range and the number of biomes occupied were all greater for invasive species than for their naturalized counterparts. However, biome occupancy was significantly correlated with temperature breadth (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.57; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), precipitation breadth (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.37; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and SLA (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.37; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Precipitation breadth was also correlated with leaf area (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.26; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).
