<p>Six of the 8 traits of naturalized and invasive species differed significantly, independent of residence time and phylogeny (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). That is, with these 2 factors held relatively constant, paired 
 <italic>t</italic> tests revealed differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in 3 functional traits (flowering duration, maximum height, SLA) and all 3 range characteristics (precipitation and temperature breadth, biome occupancy) between naturalized and invasive plants (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> &amp; Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). In addition, the 5 functional traits examined were not significantly correlated (i.e., flowering duration, leaf size, maximum height, seed mass, SLA) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). Trait differences followed hypothesized patterns: flowering duration was longer (invasive mean: 5.54 months, naturalized mean: 4.86 months), maximum height was greater (invasive mean: 5.50 m, naturalized mean: 4.3 m), and SLA larger (invasive mean: 192.11 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/g, naturalized mean: 150.07 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/g) on average in invasive species than in naturalized species (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> &amp; Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Although not significant, mean leaf size was larger for invasive species relative to naturalized species as hypothesized; however, there was no trend toward smaller seed mass in invaders relative to naturalized plants (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).
