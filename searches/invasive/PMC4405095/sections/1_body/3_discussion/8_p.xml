<p>Biome occupancy, however, was significantly correlated with annual temperature and rainfall breadth (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>); therefore, these range characteristics are not fully independent measures of the ecological tolerance of species. In any practical application of our results to WRA protocols, it may be necessary to test which of rainfall, temperature, or biome breadth is the most substantial driver of differences between naturalized and invasive species in particular genera or families for which permission to import is being sought.
