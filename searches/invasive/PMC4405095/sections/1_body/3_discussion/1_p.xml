<p>Our results show that naturalized and invasive plants exhibit differences in key functional traits and range characteristics when residence time and phylogeny are held relatively constant. Six traits (SLA, height, flowering duration, rainfall breadth, temperature breadth, biome occupancy) were associated with invasion success in a large, continental pool of introduced plants in Australia. Our results highlight the value of integrating multiple factors that affect speciesâ€™ progression along the invasion continuum (e.g., residence time, phylogeny, traits, and biogeographic range) into a single analysis. We advocate for the inclusion of the quantitative traits associated with invasion success we identified into WRA protocols to improve their predictive accuracy.</p>
