<p>We found no evidence that seed mass or leaf size differed significantly between these naturalized and invasive species in Australia. One potential reason for a lack of difference in seed size between naturalized and invasive species may be our a priori decision to include only species pairs with the same growth form. Results of previous studies that show seed mass differences between invaders and other introduced or native species and do not account for growth form a priori may simply reflect the tendency for annual, herbaceous species to have both small seeds and to be overrepresented in the invasive species pool. Annual herbs typically trade off investment in high reproductive output in a single season against individual seed size, which leads to large numbers of small seeds (Smith &amp; Fretwell 
 <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). This high fecundity, coupled with a rapid life cycle, makes annual herbs one of the most common growth forms in lists of successful invaders both nationally (Reichard &amp; Hamilton 
 <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) and globally (Kolar &amp; Lodge 
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). However, results of previous studies that show small seed size as a correlate of invasiveness without accounting for growth form are likely to reflect the abundance of herbaceous annuals in exotic floras, rather than ecologically meaningful differences in seed mass. Indeed, in a global study of seed characteristics of native and invasive species, Mason et al. (
 <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) found no difference in seed mass between these 2 groups once growth form was taken into account.
