<p>Identifying which traits effectively separate naturalized plants from invaders is an important goal for improving various forms of WRA. Preborder WRA protocols aim to prevent the introduction of potentially problematic species from foreign locations. Screening typically involves the use of a standardized set of questions on the biology and invasive behavior of the species for which permission to import is being sought, as well as an assessment of the match between the climate in the native range of the species and of the recipient region (Pheloung

However, WRA systems do not typically ask about key quantitative traits that have been implicated in invasion success in previous studies (e.g., specific leaf area [SLA]) (Grotkopp &amp; Rejm√°nek
