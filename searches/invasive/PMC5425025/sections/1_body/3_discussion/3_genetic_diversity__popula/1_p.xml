<p>Genetic diversity within population was similar in North America (the native range) and in Europe, but genetic differentiation among populations (

 <sub>ST</sub>) was greater in the invasive range. A similar trend had also been observed previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This difference in 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> values may arise simply because only a small area of the native range was sampled (five American populations) in our study and in [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This pattern is also consistent with a scenario involving multiple introduction events, as previously proposed [

 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Rare alleles initially present in American populations may have shifted to high frequencies in different European populations after invasion and local demographic expansion [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The maintenance of high levels of genetic diversity within invasive populations, a trend opposite to that found in many other biological invasions processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], can be attributed to high numbers of introduced seeds in multiple events [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], high gene flow and possibly genetic admixture among introduced populations [
