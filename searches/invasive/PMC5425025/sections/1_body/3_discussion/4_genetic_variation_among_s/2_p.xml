 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>psilostachya</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>tenuifolia</italic> are perennial species that reproduce both sexually and clonally [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Although these species are of less concern than the annual 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>trifida</italic>, being less widespread and invasive, our SSR markers will be useful for assessing vegetative 
 <italic>versus</italic> sexual reproduction, as well as for identifying colonization sources and relatedness among populations. However, given that several ploidy levels were reported in these species [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we recommend that ploidy is carefully checked before markers developed from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> are transferred to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>psilostachya</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>tenuifolia</italic>. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>trifida</italic> is a noxious annual weed, very widespread in its native area [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and introduced in several European countries including, for instance, France, Italy, Slovenia and Serbia [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Despite the potential threat set by this species on both human health and agriculture, population genetics studies are still lacking. Given its distant relation to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> and the low success rate of markers transferability, we recommend that additional SSR markers are specifically developed for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>trifida</italic>.
