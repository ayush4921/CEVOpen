<p>Next-generation sequencing technologies have considerably facilitated the development of SSRs for non-model organisms. Until recently, the method of choice was 454 sequencing of enriched gDNA libraries. 454 sequencing generates relatively long reads, which facilitates the design of primers within the regions flanking SSRs. However, the more recent Illumina sequencing technique provides much higher numbers of reads at a lower cost, and can now generate paired reads of 2Ã—250 bp or longer [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here, we implemented a rigorous initial quality filtering of reads. Further, we merged Illumina paired-end reads and kept only long-enough sequences, which facilitated primer design. A similar amplification success of potentially amplifiable loci was obtained from Illumina and from 454 data. This, together with the Illumina technology yielding one to two orders of magnitude more reads than 454, highlights Illumina as the currently most efficient sequencing technology for developing SSRs, provided reads are carefully checked for quality and paired-end reads are merged.
