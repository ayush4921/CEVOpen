<p>All markers developed were highly polymorphic in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic>. As compared to gSSRs, EST-SSRs are expected to be less polymorphic and more prone to the influence of selective processes: divergent selection may increase the estimation of genetic differentiation among populations at these loci, while purifying or balancing selection may have the opposite effect [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, allelic richness and expected heterozygosity were similar between the two kinds of markers, while genetic differentiation was slightly lower for EST-SSRs. Most EST-SSRs were tri-nucleotide repeats, for which length polymorphism does not result in any frameshift in the coding sequence. No influence of selection could be detected for any of the EST-SSRs analysed. The high level of polymorphism observed at both non-genic and genic locations in the genome of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> likely reflects very large effective population sizes in a plant species known to have recently undergone a demographic expansion both in its native range [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and in invasive ranges [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, a large variation for life traits is known in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> [
