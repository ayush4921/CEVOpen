<p>One undesirable counterpart of high nucleotide polymorphism is the presence of null alleles resulting from mutations at primer binding sites. Here, null alleles were observed for both gSSRs and EST-SSRs, with overall estimated frequencies of about 10%. This is consistent with a literature survey indicating that null alleles frequencies are often below 20% but can in some cases range from 40% to 75% [

Analyzing progenies in French populations provided direct evidence for the presence of null alleles, but no evidence for selfing or biparental inbreeding. Our results were consistent with a previous study of invasive populations from China [

 <sub>IS</sub> values were observed in a small minority of populations from Europe but in the majority of populations from the native range. As any evolution of the mating system towards loss of selfing during invasion seems unlikely, it remains to be investigated whether this might be due to a different functioning of the populations in the two ranges, with populations from the native range showing some Wahlund effect [
