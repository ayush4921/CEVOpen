<p>The genus 
 <italic>Ambrosia</italic> in the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family includes at least 51 species collectively known as “ragweeds” and mainly distributed in North America [

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> is an annual herb mostly known as a successful invasive and a highly allergenic plant causing severe rhinitis and asthma [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has been introduced in Europe in the 19
 <sup>th</sup> century by the import of contaminated grain and forage [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> has colonized different types of habitats such as railways, riversides and wastelands, as well as cultivated fields where it is now a noxious weed competing with several summer crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To investigate the population genetic structure in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic>, reliable and polymorphic molecular markers are needed. To date, only a few gSSR markers have been developed from French 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These few gSSRs were used to assess the population genetic structure and patterns of colonization across continental and regional scales in Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and China [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, most of the gSSR markers available showed PCR amplification failures and excess homozygote genotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Excess homozygosity can be caused by the presence of null alleles resulting from mutations at primer binding sites that preclude PCR amplification. Alternatively, excess homozygosity has sometimes been interpreted as evidence for partial selfing in a mostly outcrossing species. This issue was highly debated in several SSR-based population genetics studies conducted on 
 <italic>A</italic>.
