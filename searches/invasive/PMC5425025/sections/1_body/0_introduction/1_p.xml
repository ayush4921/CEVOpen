<p>Inferring recent demographic history and contemporary evolutionary processes are major goals in the field of population genetics. Climate change, human disturbances of natural habitats and human-aided dispersal can cause dramatic shifts in the distributions of natural species, and biological invasions are increasingly prevalent worldwide. Analyzing the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of native and introduced populations of an invasive species allows recovering pathways of invasion and identifying founding events and/or admixture events among invasive populations. All these processes affect the demographic success and future expansion of the invasive species and determine its potential for adaption to new environmental conditions. Their understanding is invaluable for devising appropriate management strategies [
