<p>Large sets of genomic SSRs and EST-SSRs were developed and validated in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic>, providing useful new resources for genetic studies of this highly noxious invasive weed. All markers were highly polymorphic. EST-SSRs revealed as many alleles as gSSRs and yielded similar genetic diversity estimates. The genetic patterns revealed for a set of American and European populations confirmed results from previous studies by showing a high within-population genetic diversity in both the native and invasive ranges. A geographical gradient of genetic variation in Europe was consistent with at least two major colonization events in Western and Eastern Europe, respectively. Secondary founding events were identified, especially in Central Europe. In addition, we settled a former controversy by demonstrating that inbreeding observed within populations is attributable mostly to the presence of null alleles rather than to selfing. Last, most SSRs were transferable to three other 
 <italic>Ambrosia</italic> species. These SSRs can readily be used for studying key aspects of the biology and population dynamics of the two species most closely related to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> (
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>psilostachya</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>tenuifolia</italic>).
