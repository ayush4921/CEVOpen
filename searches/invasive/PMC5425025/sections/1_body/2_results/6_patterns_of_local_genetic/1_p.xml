<p>Populationâ€“specific F
 <sub>ST</sub> values were best explained by the model that included latitude as a linear explanatory factor (posterior probability: 0.66) in comparison to the null model with no explanatory factor (posterior probability: 0.28) or the model including longitude (posterior probability: 0.04). Population-specific F
 <sub>ST</sub> values increased with latitude (

While there was no linear relationship with longitude, a non-linear pattern was revealed with populations from Central Europe (Italy: BES-I and Germany: HOR-G, DOM-G) and two populations located in the western (89-P10) and eastern (TAT-H) parts of the range showing elevated F
 <sub>ST</sub> values (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g004">4</xref>). Increased genetic divergence may be due to recent founder events for these populations. However, no significant signatures of recent bottlenecks were detected based on the Wilcoxon test for expected heterozygosity excess in any of the studied populations.
