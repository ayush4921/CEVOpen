<p>Thirty-six maternal progenies sampled from six French populations were analysed with five gSSRs to estimate mating system parameters. In addition, direct evidence for the presence of null alleles was sought by considering the progenies from maternal plants apparently homozygous at one locus. If a null allele was present, the maternal plant would actually be heterozygous (i.e., carrying one null allele and one detectable allele). Its progeny would thus contain some plants apparently homozygous for alleles different from the maternal one, but actually carrying one maternal null allele and one paternal detectable allele. Evidence for the presence of null alleles was obtained for all five markers. Depending on the marker considered, from 25% (3 out of 12) to 35% (8 out of 23) of the progenies from plants scored as homozygotes contained non-matching genotypes. Mating system parameters were estimated after excluding these progenies. The maternal inbreeding coefficient was non-significant (F = 0). Multi-locus outcrossing rates (tm) were high and not significantly lower than 1 in all populations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t004">Table 4</xref>). The rates of mating between related individuals (tm-ts) were not significant. Paternity correlations (rp) were weak and only significant for two populations. These results suggested complete outcrossing for
