<p>We compared patterns of genetic diversity between the native range (North America) and the invasive range (Europe). Allelic richness within population and mean expected heterozygosity within population were slightly higher in North America than in Europe (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t005">Table 5</xref>). However, for both parameters, the difference between the two ranges was not significant (Wilcoxon test p-values: 0.100 and 0.173 for allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, respectively). The inbreeding coefficient estimated taking null alleles into account was significantly higher than zero in only seven populations: four of the five North-American populations and three of the eleven European populations (
