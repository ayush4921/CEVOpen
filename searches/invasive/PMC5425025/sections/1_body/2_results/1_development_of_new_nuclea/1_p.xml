<p>Sequencing results, filtering and success rates of microsatellite loci development are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t002">Table 2</xref>. Most 454 reads were eliminated because of insufficient length, while most Illumina reads were eliminated because paired-end reads could not be merged. As expected, the proportion of quality reads containing a SSR motif was much higher among the 454 reads obtained from an enriched gDNA library (24%) than among the Illumina reads obtained from raw gDNA (0.3%) or among the transcriptome 454 reads (0.1%). The low rate of SSR motifs obtained from Illumina sequencing of raw gDNA was more than compensated for by the high amount of reads generated and this method allowed the identification of ten times more potentially amplifiable loci than 454 sequencing of enriched gDNA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t002">Table 2</xref>). The distribution of motif length was very similar between the two methods used to develop gSSRs: on average the di- tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides accounted for 40.2%, 48.7%, 7.5%, 2.5% and 1% of gSSRs, respectively. By contrast, most EST-SSRs were tri-nucleotides (81.6%), and di-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides accounted for 11.1%, 7%, 0.2% and 0% of EST-SSRs, respectively. Success rate of PCR amplification were quite similar among SSR sets, yielding 67 gSSRs (GenBank accession number KX867678—KX867743) and 41 EST-SSRs (GenBank accession number KX867744-KX867785) with consistent amplification in
