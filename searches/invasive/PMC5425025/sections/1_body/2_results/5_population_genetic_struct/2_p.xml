<p>Structure analyses were also performed separately using gSSR data only or EST-SSR data only. The most likely numbers of genetic clusters among the 16 populations were four (

Overall, the same patterns were observed for both datasets, i.e., variation in cluster membership probabilities among populations and a west-east gradient of genetic variation across Europe.
