<p>The posterior likelihood generated by Structure increased continuously with 
 <italic>K</italic>, whereas the Evanno method (49) suggested that the most likely number of genetic clusters was six (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0176197.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). From 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2, a west-east gradient of genetic variation was observed across Europe, showing that Central and Eastern European populations are different from Western European populations, and similar to the Northern American populations studied. At 
 <italic>K</italic> = 6, a more detailed genetic structuring was revealed mainly within Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Most of the additional clusters were very specific to one or two populations (cluster 1: HOR-G, cluster 2: 89-P10, cluster 3: TAT-H, cluster 6: BES-I and DOM-G, Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g004">4</xref>). The two main genetic clusters (clusters 4 and 5, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g004">Fig 4</xref>) were frequent in the western and south-eastern part of the invasive range, respectively, but only the first one (cluster 4) was observed at high frequencies in the native range.
