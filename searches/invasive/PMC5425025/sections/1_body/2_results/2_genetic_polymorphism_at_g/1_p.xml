 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0176197.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). SSR86 showed less genetic differentiation (F
 <sub>ST</sub> = 0.014) than other markers, but a very high within-population genetic diversity (Hs = 0.776), suggesting balancing selection at or near the locus. This locus was therefore discarded for further analyses.
