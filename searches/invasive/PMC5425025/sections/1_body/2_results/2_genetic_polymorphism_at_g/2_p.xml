<p>All 26 retained loci were polymorphic and revealed high levels of genetic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t003">Table 3</xref>). The frequencies of null alleles estimated over all populations ranged between 0.06 and 0.19 and were on average similar between gSSRs and EST-SSRs (0.11; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t003">Table 3</xref>). Allelic richness per locus and population, calculated based on a minimum sample size of eight individuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g002">Fig 2</xref>), was slightly lower for EST-SSRs than for gSSRs (4.438 
 <italic>versus</italic> 4.748) but the difference was not significant (Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.778) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176197.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The mean expected heterozygosity within populations was high (0.635 for gSSRs and 0.625 for EST-SSRs) and not significantly different between the two types of markers (Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.778). The mean genetic differentiation F
 <sub>ST</sub> was 0.072 for gSSRs and 0.058 for EST-SSRs (difference significant, Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.045).
