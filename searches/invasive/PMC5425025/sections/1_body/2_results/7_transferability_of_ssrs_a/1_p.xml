<p>Cross-species transferability was tested for 31 gSSRs and 32 EST-SSRs. Among these markers, 32.2%, 54.8% and 67.7% of gSSRs and 46.9%, 75% and 81.2% of EST-SSRs gave consistent amplification and clear electrophoretic migration patterns in

 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t003">Table 3</xref>), three gSSRs (SSR17, SSR26 and SSR73) and five EST-SSRs (EST-SSR13, EST-SSR61, EST-SSR69, EST-SSR111 and EST-SSR123) were scorable in all three other species. Relationships among species were visualised by a PCA based on data at these eight markers (
