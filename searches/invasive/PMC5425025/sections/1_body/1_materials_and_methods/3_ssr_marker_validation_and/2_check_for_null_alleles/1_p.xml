<p>MicroChecker 2.2.0.3 was used to check for the presence of null alleles and scoring errors due to stuttering and large allele dropout for each marker in each 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> population [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The markers showing the overall lowest occurrence of null alleles and stuttering were retained for further analyses. Frequencies of null alleles at the retained loci in each population were estimated using INEST 2.1 [
