<p>Genetic divergence is likely to vary across populations because of differences in population effective sizes and local migration rates. This is especially the case when recent founder effects have occurred, such as during range expansions. Patterns of genetic divergence were estimated for the invasive range (Europe) by calculating population-specific

 <sub>ST</sub> values, and two models that used either latitude or longitude as explanatory variables. In addition to the study of genetic divergence patterns, we investigated the signature of recent bottleneck events using the Wilcoxon test for excess expected heterozygosity implemented in INEST2.1 and based on the method of Cornuet and Luikart [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Analyses were run with the Two-Phase Mutation (TPM) model with default settings.
