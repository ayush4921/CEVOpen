<p>Population structure was assessed using Structure 2.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The admixture model and correlated allele frequencies between populations were selected as specified [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to determine the number of genetic clusters (
 <italic>K</italic>) best fitting the data. The length of the burn-in period was 100,000 runs followed by 500,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Ten iterations were performed for each value of 
 <italic>K</italic> from 1 to 15. 
 <italic>K</italic> was determined graphically based on log likelihood values as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] using the web-based program Structure Harvester [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, the Î”K method [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] was used to determine the best value of 
 <italic>K</italic>. Finally, Clumpp 1.1.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and R 3.1.2 were used to produce graphical outputs for the inferred population structure.
