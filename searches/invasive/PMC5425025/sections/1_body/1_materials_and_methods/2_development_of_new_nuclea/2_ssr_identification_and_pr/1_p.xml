<p>SSRs were identified with QDD version 3.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Only 2- to 6-nucleotides motifs were considered. The minimum repeat unit was set to eight for di-nucleotides, six for tri-nucleotides, and five for longer motifs. Expected amplicon sizes were constrained to a 100–300 bp range. Primer pairs were thoroughly tested for clear, stable amplification on 12

 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> individuals from three populations (one French population from the Rhône Valley, the German population DOM and the American population KEN). PCRs were performed in 10-μL as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cycling parameters consisted in a first denaturation step (2 min at 95°C) followed by 39 cycles of 5 s at 95°C, 10 s at 60°C and 30 s at 72°C. Amplicons were visualised by electrophoresing five microliters of PCRs on 3% (wt/vol) agarose gels run for 25 min at 100V in Tris-Borate EDTA buffer.
