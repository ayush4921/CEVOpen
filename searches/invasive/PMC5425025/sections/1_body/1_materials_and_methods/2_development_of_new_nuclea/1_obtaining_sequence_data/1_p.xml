<p>For the SSR-enriched gDNA library approach, total gDNA from 8 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> individuals was isolated using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA) and processed by GenoScreen, (Lille, France). A SSR enriched DNA library was obtained as described in [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, total DNA was mechanically fragmented and enriched for AG, AC, AAC, AAG, AGG, ACG, ACAT and ATCT repeat motifs. Enriched fragments were subsequently amplified. Amplicons were sequenced on a 454 GS FLX Titanium system (454 Life Sciences, Branford, USA) following manufacturerâ€™s protocols.
