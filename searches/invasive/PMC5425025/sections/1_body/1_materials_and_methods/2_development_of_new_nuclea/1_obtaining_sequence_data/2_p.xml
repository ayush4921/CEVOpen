<p>For the Illumina gDNA sequencing approach, total gDNA from one 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> individual was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA). Sequencing was performed at GENTYANE (INRA, Clermont-Ferrand, France). An Illumina paired-end shotgun library was prepared by shearing 2 Î¼g DNA using a Covaris M220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, USA) and following the standard Illumina TruSeq DNA Library Kit protocol (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Sequencing was conducted on the Illumina MiSeq with 250 bp paired-end reads.
