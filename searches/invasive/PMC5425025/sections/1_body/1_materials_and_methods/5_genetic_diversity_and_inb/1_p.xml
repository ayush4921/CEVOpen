<p>The allelic richness per locus and per population using a rarefaction method (

 <sub>S</sub>) and the genetic differentiation (

 <sub>ST</sub> values was based on 1000 bootstrap resampling over loci. Inbreeding coefficient (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>IS</sub>) were estimated with INEST 2.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0176197.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] using a Bayesian procedure robust to the presence of null alleles. To assess the statistical significance of inbreeding we compared the model with inbreeding with the random mating model (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>IS</sub> = 0) based on the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). Genetic diversity and differentiation parameters for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> were calculated over all populations, over North American populations and over European populations.
