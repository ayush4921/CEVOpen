<p>The mating system of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>artemisiifolia</italic> was investigated using five gSSR markers (SSR10, SSR17, SSR47, SSR71 and SSR73) in six additional French populations sampled in 2014 and located within a few kilometres around population GEN13.03 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176197.t001">Table 1</xref>). These gSSR markers showed less null alleles than others. Leaf tissue and mature seeds were collected on six to eight mother-plants per population. Eight to 16 progeny-plants per mother-plant were genotyped, yielding a total of 614 individuals. MLTR [
