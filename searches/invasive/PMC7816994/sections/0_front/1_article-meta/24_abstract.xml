  <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L. is an interesting example of how one plant species can be considered invasive or useful depending on its environment. In the past this tree species was planted for decorative purposes and for wood in Poland. For many years it was recommended in poor and degraded habitats because it facilitated late-successional plant species. The aim of this study was to verify if black locust can still be regarded as a resistant tree species in urban greenery. The health condition of old tree specimens growing along streets and in parks was compared. The occurrence of pests and pathogens on

  <italic>pseudoacacia</italic> trees was assessed and the content of mineral elements in leaves was examined. The research results showed that the health of black locust trees growing in the urban environment in Polish cities, especially along streets (in comparison to park sites), deteriorated significantly due to the interaction of harmful biotic and abiotic factors. Increased level of toxic metals (Fe, Zn, Pb, Mn and Cd) in plant tissues and the accumulation of pests and pathogens negatively influenced the health of
