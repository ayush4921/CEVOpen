<p>Black locust is usually considered to exhibit low susceptibility to diseases and pests because as an introduced species it probably has very few natural predators in Europe [

Because some pathogens and pests develop well when temperature is low and humidity is high, while for others high temperature and low humidity are prerequisites, it seems obvious that climate warming may cause unexpected changes in their populations. Consequently, the health of their host plants will be affected [
