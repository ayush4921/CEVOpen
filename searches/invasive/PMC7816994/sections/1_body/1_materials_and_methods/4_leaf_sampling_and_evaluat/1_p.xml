<p>In order to evaluate the threat of infestation of the 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudoacacia</italic> trees with harmful fauna and pathogenic fungi, ten specimens were selected in the park and street sites in each city. Between 2017 and 2018, from early May to late September samples of 10 compound leaves were collected from each of 60 trees (in total 600 leaves were assessed twice a month). Leaves from each tree in each site (10 compound leaves per tree) were collected randomly: samples from 2–5 branches on different sides and at different heights (1–3 m) in the crown; single leaves collected from different places on the branches (top and middle).The samples were taken to a laboratory, where the leaves were analysed. Fungal pathogens were identified on each leaf based on disease symptoms and typical morphological traits. The cause of damage was identified based on developmental stages or symptoms of pest feeding. Damage caused by biting species of insects (mines and bitten holes) were counted on each leaf. For piercing-sucking species of insects, specimens were counted. Next, the number of specimens of a given insect species and the damage they caused and disease symptoms caused by fungal pathogens were summed up for each tree (sum from 10 leaves).
