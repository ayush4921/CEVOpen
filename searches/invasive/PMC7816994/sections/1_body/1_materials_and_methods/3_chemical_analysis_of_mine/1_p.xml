<p>In late July 2018, 20 leaves were collected from each tree in each site: random samples from 2–5 branches on different sides and at different heights (1–3 m) in the crown, with single leaves collected from different places on the branches (top and middle). The leaves were analysed chemically to assess the influence of the environment on the quality of the plants. First, dust and other impurities were mechanically removed from the leaf surface. Next, the samples were pre-dried at a temperature of 50°C and ground in a mixer. In order to assay the total content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na the plant material was digested in concentrated sulphuric acid with hydrogen peroxide. To analyse the total Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb content the plant material was digested in a mixture of concentrated (ultrapure) nitric and perchloric acids (analytically pure) at a 3:1 ratio. After digestion the following assays were made: the total N content was assayed with the micro-Kjeldahl procedure; the P content was analysed with spectrophotometric methods; the concentrations of K, Ca, and Na were measured by means of flame photometry; and Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd content were measured by means of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry [

The accuracy of the measurements of heavy metals was tested by analysis of reference material certified by the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), Belgium. The chemical composition of the leaves was analysed separately for each tree.
