 <p>We conducted a comparative study examining phenotype expression of invasive, noninvasive alien, and native 
  <italic>Bidens</italic> species under fertilization and competition treatment. While invasive 
  <italic>B. frondosa</italic> exhibited higher plasticity than other species, the plasticity of functional traits does not likely contribute to the invasive success. The dispersal efficiency of 
  <italic>B. frondosa</italic> is expected to be lower than that of other 
  <italic>Bidens</italic> species, suggesting that long‐distance dispersal is likely not a critical factor in determining invasive success.
