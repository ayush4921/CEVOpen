<p>We counted the number of inflorescences as a proxy of fecundity, because many fruits fell onto the ground during the experiment. 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species produce morphologically distinctive achenes at the center and periphery of the capitulum (Brändel, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Disk achenes tend to be larger and disperse more readily than ray achenes (Rocha, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). We randomly selected more than two achenes from the central area of the capitulum of each plant individual and photographed them using a stereomicroscope. Images were analyzed using Digimizer software to measure the length of the pappi and the cross‐sectional areas of the achenes. Achenes with broken pappi were excluded from the image analysis, and morphological characteristics were analyzed for a total of 250 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> achenes, 290 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> achenes, and 140 
 <italic>B. Pilosa</italic> achenes.
