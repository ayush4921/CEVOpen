<p>Achenes of 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species were sterilized using 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, carefully scarified twice with a razor blade, and maintained in Petri dishes with wet filter paper in June 2016. After cold treatment at 4°C for 2 weeks, achenes were allowed to germinate in a customized walk‐in chamber under a 12‐hr light/dark photoperiod at 23°C. Individual seedlings were planted in flats containing commercial soil medium (ShinSung Mineral Co. Ltd.) and grown under the same conditions present during germination. After one month of growth, plants were transplanted into plastic pots (21.5 cm × 21.4 cm × 15.5 cm) filled with 50% commercial saprolite and 50% soil medium on August 25, 2016. The plants were maintained in a common garden at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (35°13′28.47″ N, 126°50′36.81″ E). According to the Korean Meteorological Administration, the temperature during the 2016 summer season was the second hottest since 1973, and precipitation was around half of the ten‐year average. To prevent transplant shock and the abrupt death of plants, plants were watered every other day for one month.
