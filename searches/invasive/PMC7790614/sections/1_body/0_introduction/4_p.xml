<p>Traits associated with resource capture ability are highly plastic to environmental conditions, particularly resource availability (Davidson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Invasive plants tend to exhibit higher phenotypic plasticity than noninvasive plants, contributing to their establishment in novel environments and competition with existing vegetation (Davidson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Given the ecological significance of plasticity in invasive success, phenotypic plasticity to anthropogenic environmental change is of particular interest for the prediction of the future dynamics of plant invasion. Human activities continue to increase disturbance and eutrophication in terrestrial habitats, both of which are thought to facilitate the invasion of alien plant species (Chytrý et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Jauni et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Disturbance removes competing species, consequently decreasing biotic interactions between species while increasing soil nutrient availability. Though plant responses to nutrient availability are widely studied, little information is available on phenotypic plasticity to environmental disturbance (Gioria &amp; Osborne, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
