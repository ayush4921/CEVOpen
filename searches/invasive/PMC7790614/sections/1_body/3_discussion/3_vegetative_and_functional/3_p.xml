<p>Due to the higher plasticity, 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> had more massive biomass after six weeks of growth and a greater final height than native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic>. Thus, the higher plasticity of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> regarding biomass and height likely confers a competitive advantage over native 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> (van Kleunen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Notably, differences in the biomass and final stature were more manifest when plants were grown without competition, indicating that the role of plasticity of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> would be of importance in disturbed habitats without other competing species.
