  <title>Variance partitioning of the microbial phyla across coastal zone according to environmental and spatial parameters.</title>
  <p>The top 10 microbial phyla are ranked from the most to the least abundant. The explained variance corresponds to the sum of the adjusted R2 values of the significant parameters within the contextual groups (soil properties, land-use type, spatial descriptors, above-ground plants, interactions between soil properties and land use type). The threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.01. Missing values indicate that no variable of the related group was retained in the model.</p>
