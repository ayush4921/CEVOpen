<p>Soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured 
 <italic>in situ</italic> using a digital soil acidity meter and a digital soil EC tester. Standard methods were adopted to measure soil physicochemical properties. Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using potassium dichromate heating oxidation-volumetric method, total nitrogen (TN) was measured using the Kjeldahl method, available nitrogen (AN) was measured using the alkali-hydrolyzed distilling method, total phosphorus (TP) was measured using NaOH digestion Mo-Sb colorimetry methods, available phosphorus (AP) was measured using the Olsen method, total potassium (TK) and available potassium (AK) were extracted with HF-HNO3-HClO4 and ammonium acetate, respectively, and determined using flame photometry. Invaded and uninvaded plots were compared using t-test for dependent samples. Shannon's diversity index (H’ = ∑PilnPi), relative abundance of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> and relative richness were used to calculate plant community diversity in each plot. Principal coordinate of neighbor matrices (PCNM) vectors with the PCNM package was used to derive spatial variables from geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) [

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. PCNM can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. Forward-selected procedures were used to select subsets of above-ground plants, soil physicochemical properties and PCNM variables in the PACKFOR package. These variables were then subjected to variation partitioning using the VEGAN package. Variation partitioning could assess the amounts of bacteria variation explained together by the environment and space, or by one component whilst the other component is controlled [
