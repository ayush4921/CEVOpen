<p>Soil DNA extraction and PCR amplification of microbial DNA was extracted using HiPure Soil DNA Kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The 16S rDNA V3-V4 region of the ribosomal RNA gene were amplified by PCR, with 95°C for 2 min, followed by 27 cycles at 98°C for 10 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 68°C for 10 min. During this process, 341F: 
 <monospace>CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG</monospace> and 806R: 
 <monospace>GGACTACHVGGGTATCTAAT</monospace> primers were used, where the barcode was an eight-base sequence unique to each sample. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate in a 50 μL mixture containing 5 μL of 10 × KOD Buffer, 5 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1.5 μL of each primer (5 μM), 1 μL of KOD Polymerase, and 100 ng of template DNA.
