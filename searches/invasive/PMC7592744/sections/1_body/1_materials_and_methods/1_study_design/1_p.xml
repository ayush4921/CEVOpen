<p>Sampling was undertaken along a 5 km of coastline in south Guangdong, China, in October 2018. The total length of coastline in Guangdong Province is 4114 km. Annual mean temperature in the study region is 21.2–23.3°C, annual mean sunshine hours is 1730–2320 hrs, and annual mean precipitation is 1341.0–2382.8 mm. In order to examine the effects of

 <italic>alba</italic> invasion, the coastline ecosystem was divided into three study regions: east, central and west coastline. Land-use type along the coastal areas was classified as farmland, forest, orchard, wasteland and waterfront. Each land-use type was examined in triplicate in the three study regions (

Soil samples were homogenized from five cores (samples from the top 10 cm) randomly collected in each sample site. In total, 90 soil samples were collected for this study. The number of individuals of all plant species were calculated in all quadrats. The relative abundance of

 <italic>alba</italic> in the invaded soil quadrats was calculated as the ratio of the number of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> individuals to the number of individuals of all plant species. Soil collected from the study sites were classified as latosolic red soil and yellow soil [
