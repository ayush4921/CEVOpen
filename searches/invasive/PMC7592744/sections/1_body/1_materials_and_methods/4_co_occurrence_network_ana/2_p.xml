<p>Modules were detected using the greedy modularity optimization method, and connectivity was determined based on within module connectivity (Zi) and among module connectivity (Pi) of each node. Common network properties in complex community systems include scale-free, small-world and hierarchy [

According to the simplified criteria, all species can be divided into four groups: peripherals (Zi &lt;2.5 and Pi &lt;0.62), connectors (Pi &gt;0.62), module hubs (Zi &gt;2.5) and network hubs (Zi &gt;2.5 and Pi &gt;0.62). From an ecological perspective, peripherals can be considered as specialists (always linked to nodes within their own modules) while module hubs and connectors are suggested as generalists (highly connected to numerous nodes in their own modules or to other modules) and network hubs as super generalists (acting as both module hub and connector) [
