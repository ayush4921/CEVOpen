<p>Variance partitioning analysis was undertaken to quantify the contribution of spatial distance (PCNM variables), above-ground plants, soil properties and land-use to bacterial community variation. By using a forward selection procedure, five environmental variables (pH, TOC, EC, TK and AK), three PCNM variables and the relative abundance of

 <italic>alba</italic> were selected as explanatory variables. All variables explained 32% of the variation of bacterial communities (

The effect of total environment (soil properties and land-use type) variables explained 24% of variation of the bacterial community. In contrast, the total explained variance in phyla ranged from 7.4% (Bacteroidetes) to 39% (Nitrospirae). For 10 phyla, the influence of selection by soil properties, spatial distance and land-use type were stronger than the relative abundance of invasive plants. Soil properties were the main factors in the process of selection for Acidobacteria (24.4%) and Firmicutes (25%), and land-use type was the main factor for Actinobacteria (5%). Based on phylum results (
