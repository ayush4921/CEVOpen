<p>As highlighted by Barberan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], co-occurrence network analysis may provide insights into the structure of microbial communities positively or negatively correlated due to niche overlap, niche partitioning, phylogenetic similarity, mutualistic relationships or resource competition. In order to estimate bacteria coexistence under different land-use types, co-occurrence networks were established for both invaded and uninvaded soil by

The number of total links in uninvaded soil was 266% higher than that in invaded soil. The average connectivity (avgK) was higher in uninvaded soil (7.335) while it decreased in invaded soil (3.315), which indicating high numbers of neighbors per node in the uninvaded soil network. A network hub is important to the coherence of both the network and its own module [

In our study, the most prominent keystone taxa in invaded networks were members of OTU 57 (phylum: Acidobacteria; class: Acidobacteria; order: Acidobacteriales), two nodes were identified as connectors in the invaded network (OTU 170 and OTU 259, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi phylum, respectively), and one node was identified as a connector in the uninvaded network (OTU 210; phylum: Firmicutes, class: Bacilli, order: Bacillales) (
