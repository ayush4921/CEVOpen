<p>Relationships between sample size and OTUs numbers, identified using a rarefaction curve (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238478.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicated that OTUs numbers sharply increased with sample size. No significant difference in alpha diversity was recorded between invaded and uninvaded soil in all five land-use types (

 <italic>alba</italic> invasion significantly decreased beta diversity in the forest and orchard land-use types; results for the waterfront land-use type were opposite. According to NMDS results, the composition of the bacteria community significantly differed among the five land-use types (PERMANOVA test: R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.189, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria, recorded as being common bacterial phyla in soils globally. Excluding unidentified sequences, a total of six phyla were recorded, accounting for 84% of total sequences. Invasion therefore increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in all five land-use types. The change of main bacteria was most obvious in the waterfront land-use, especially for Firmicutes which increased to 17% in uninvaded soil.
