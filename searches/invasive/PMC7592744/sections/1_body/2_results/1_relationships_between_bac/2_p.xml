<p>Factors influencing bacterial community composition in the coastline soil were identified using redundancy analysis (RDA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238478.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The first component (RDA1) explained 38.8% of variation and the second component (RDA2) only explained 30.7% of variation. Based on these results and vector length, the most important soil chemical environmental variable was pH (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.62, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), with AK (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.5, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and N: P (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.43, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) also recording a strong effect on driving the microbiome in coastline soil. Total phosphorus and soil pH recorded a negative correlation with the majority of the dominant phyla, and other soil properties recorded a positive correlation with bacteria abundance. For example, a higher abundance of Gemmatimonadetes and Planctomycetes recorded a strong positive correlation with the Shannonâ€™s diversity of above-ground vegetation and TOC. In contrast, only Actinobacteria abundance recorded a strong positive correlation with the relative abundance of
