 <italic>alba</italic> invasion was associated with changes in soil physicochemical properties in the different land-use types, notably pH in forest soil (t = 2.1, df = 16, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05), soil moisture content in farmland soil (t = -2.3, df = 16, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), soil electrical conductivity in farmland soil (t = -2.5, df = 16, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), total phosphorous in wasteland soil (t = 2.8, df = 16, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and total potassium in waterfront soil (t = 1.8, df = 16, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08). Land-use type was negatively correlated with bacteria alpha diversity whilst soil pH and soil EC were positively correlated with microbial phylogenetic diversity. Soil available potassium was negatively correlated with Shannon and phylogenetic diversity, and soil available nitrogen recorded a positive correlation (
