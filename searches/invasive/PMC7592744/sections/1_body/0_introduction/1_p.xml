<p>In conjunction with increasing levels of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>, anthropogenic land-use change and pollution, plant invasion is a key driver of ongoing global change and a major threat to biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Compared to native plants, invasive plants are characterized as having higher net primary productivity and litter input, thereby reducing growth, fitness and abundance of native species, as well as decreasing diversity of native plant communities [
