 <italic>Bidens alba</italic> (formerly 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>pilosa</italic> L.) is an invasive plant species mainly occurring in the subtropics and tropics; this species is recorded to have an extensive range in central and southern China [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that

 <italic>alba</italic> invasion can modify soil microbial community composition, probably creating a favorable soil environment for self-benefit [

 <italic>alba</italic> mainly presets in agricultural and disturbed areas through strong mutualism by a unique soil-plant feedback. Although invasion processes and control strategies have been examined [

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], interactions between invasion plants and soil microbes encountered in different land-use types are not fully understood. Due to the size of microorganisms and their high dispersal capacity, they generally connect with each other to develop complex networks within an ecological niche [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Exploring co-occurrence patterns between soil microorganisms can help to identify potential biotic interactions and habitat affinities [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Co-occurrence networks have been used to examine broad medical and ecological consequences, such as forest management, immunological processes in gut microbiota, agriculture practices and precipitation changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Co-occurrence networks with structural equation modeling were used by Mamet et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to predict the evolution of microbial networks and keystone OTUs during smooth brome (
 <italic>Bromus inermis</italic>) invasion in Canada. However, the responses of microbial networks to the invasion of alien species are still unclear. Therefore, comparing bacterial networks between invaded and uninvaded soil is important to advance research on keystone taxa.
