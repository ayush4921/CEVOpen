<p>In our study, physicochemical properties and soil bacterial community responses (i.e., composition, function and the bacterial network) to 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> invasion in coastal ecosystems are examined, as well as associations with above-ground vegetation diversity. We hypothesize that: 1) physicochemical properties and soil bacterial diversity will vary with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> invasion among different land-use types; and 2) interactions between bacteria members will increase during the invasion process.
