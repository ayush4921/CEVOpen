<p>In addition to bacterial diversity and community composition shifts, bacterial community network structure and their associations with environmental properties were also altered by the invasion of

 <italic>alba</italic>. Overall, numbers of total nodes and total links were higher in uninvaded soil, as well as network connectivity and average cluster coefficients. Our results suggest that, compared to microorganisms from invaded soil (total nodes 260, total links 431), microorganisms in uninvaded coastal soil (total nodes 313, total links 1148) have stronger relationships with each other and higher influences amongst networks. During invasion, interactions between bacteria members will decrease, this being contrary to our second hypothesis. This conclusion indicates that more bacteria members were functionally interacting in uninvaded soil [

Within soil modules, a small number of module hubs (i.e. nodes highly connected within a module) and connectors (i.e. nodes linking different modules together) were identified. In our study, Acidobacteriales may function as a keystone taxa for
