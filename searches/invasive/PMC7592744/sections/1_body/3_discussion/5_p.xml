<p>The influence of spatial distance on microbial assemblages plays an important role in biogeographic research. Variation partitioning analysis quantified the contribution of spatial distance and environmental variables to bacterial community variation. A high proportion of the variation of bacterial communities can therefore be explained by a combination of environmental variables, indicating that environmental selection is a major process in coastal microbial assemblages. In addition, environmental variables solely contribute more to variation than spatial variables (PCNM variables), suggesting that heterogeneous habitat of the different land-use types plays an important role in structuring bacterial communities in the coastal zone. The identification of ten phyla that were mainly influenced by environmental selection verifies that environmental selection has a greater effect than distance. As there is no single biotic or abiotic factor that does not change in determining the composition of the soil bacteria,

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], the impact of plants in our study may also be masked by interactions between soil properties, land-use type and spatial distance. As previously mentioned, Firmicutes has a high rate of dispersal and soil colonization, a factor that may be associated with the high enrichment of invasion plants [
