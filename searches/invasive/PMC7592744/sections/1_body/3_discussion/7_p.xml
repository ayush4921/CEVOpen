<p>Interactions between soil physicochemical properties and land-use explain the higher variance for Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae than other phyla (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238478.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Generalists in the network could link with both members within their own module and those belonging to other modules [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results in our study show that high percentage of super generalists (Acidobacteriales) and 50% generalists belongs to Acidobacteria, which appears mostly in magnetite and quartz as Yang et al. recorded [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, Acidobacteria could decompose litter as soil saprophytes, affecting nitrogen cycling and remineralization [
