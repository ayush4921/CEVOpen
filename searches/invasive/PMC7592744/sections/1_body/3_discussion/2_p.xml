<p>Anthropogenic activities have been recorded to alter land-use patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and the degree of human disturbance on soil has been recorded to gradually increase from farmland to forest. Bacterial communities in forest soil therefore often exhibit a different structure between invaded and uninvaded soil. For example, results from our investigation indicated that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> invasion reduced the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in forest soil and increased its abundance in other land-use types. This result may be due to Alphaproteobacteria undergoing weak soil perturbation and providing habitats rich in organic matter.
