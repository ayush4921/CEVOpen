<p>The effects of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> invasion on soil bacterial community composition and physicochemical properties have been widely discussed [

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although invasion of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> did not significantly affect bacterial Î± diversity, obvious differences in soil bacterial community composition were recorded between invaded and uninvaded areas across different land-use types in southern China. This finding supported our first hypothesis. Specifically, a higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were observed in invaded soil compared with uninvaded soil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238478.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This bacterial community composition may be explained by the different functions of microorganisms. For example, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes can successfully colonize new environments by dispersal via aerosolized soil dust [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Resistant physiological stages have also been formed by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria to allow them to survive in hostile environments [

 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, the main course for changes and differences of bacterial community composition between invaded and uninvaded soil may be due to the selective assembly of the bacterial community [
 <xref rid="pone.0238478.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Presumably, invasion by 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> tends to alter the community structure of bacteria rather than diversity, thereby facilitating further invasion processes [
