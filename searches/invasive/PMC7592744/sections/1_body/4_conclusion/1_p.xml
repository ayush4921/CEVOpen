<p>By examining the effects of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> invasion along the coastline in southern China, our results indicated that, although 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> did not cause a change of alpha diversity of soil bacteria, it did cause a significant change in beta diversity in forest and waterfront land-use types. This finding indicates that there land-use types may be seriously affected due to plant invasion. Furthermore, the combination of occurrence network analysis, land-use type and soil prosperities may drive keystone taxa in 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>alba</italic> invasion. By consideration of dynamic changes in the network, our understanding of invasion processes will be advanced.
