<p>This study demonstrated the power of RS for label-free, non-invasive, and non-destructive detection and identification of ND, PD, and KD, as well as salinity stresses on rice plants. Our results showed that in early stages (D2), these stresses could be predicted with high accuracy and identified with only 1 s of spectral acquisition. Our results also demonstrated that RS could be used to reveal changes in the scaffold molecules of plants that are associated with nutrient deficiencies and salinity stresses. These spectroscopic changes can facilitate the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Considering the high sensitivity of RS for the diagnostics of biotic stresses on plants (
