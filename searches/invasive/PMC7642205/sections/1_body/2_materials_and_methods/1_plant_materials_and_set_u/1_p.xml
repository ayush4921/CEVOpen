<p>Presidio, a high yielding rice variety with good grain quality, was used for this study (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Pre-germinated rice seeds were transplanted into circular cutouts made in Styrofoam lined with mesh, according to the previously described method (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Razzaque et al., 2017</xref>). For the first 24 h, these seeds were placed in distilled water. Afterward, Yoshida solution (solution composition is described in the SI) (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 1976</xref>) was used for all six groups, and then the germinating seeds were grown to an age/size suitable for the experiment. Two replications with 30 seeds per replication were used for the study. After 11 days, the seedlings were maintained in Yoshida solution with all macro and micro nutrients for the control group, while seedlings in each of the stress groups {Nitrogen deficient (ND), phosphorus deficient (PD), potassium deficient (KD), medium salt stress [80 mM NaCl (80 mM)], and high salt stress [120 mM NaCl (120 mM)]} were placed in their respective stressor solutions at pH 5.0, which was adjusted daily. Spectral acquisitions, as well as height and chlorophyll measurements, were taken at days 2 (D2), 4 (D4), 6 (D6), 8 (D8), 11 (D11), and 13 (D13) after introduction to stress. Growth and measurements were completed in a growth chamber that maintained relative humidity of 55% under 12 h/12 h (day/night) and temperature at 29°C/26°C (day/night).
