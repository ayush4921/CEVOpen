<p>Raman spectra were collected with a hand-held Resolve Agilent spectrometer equipped with an 830-nm laser source. The following experimental parameters were used for all collected spectra: 1 s acquisition time, 495 mW power, and baseline spectral subtraction by device software. Previously reported experimental results demonstrated absence of photodegradation of plant material at these experimental conditions (
