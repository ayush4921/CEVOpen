<p>PLS_Toolbox (Eigenvector Research Inc.) was used for statistical analyses of the collected Raman spectra. All imported spectra were scaled to unit variance to give all spectral regions equal importance. The first derivative was taken from Raman spectra with a filter width of 45 and polynomial order 2; spectra were median centered. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to determine the number of significant components and identify spectral regions that best explained separation between the classes. Analyzed spectra, containing wavenumbers 350–2000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, were used to build PLS-DA models that are discussed in the manuscript.
