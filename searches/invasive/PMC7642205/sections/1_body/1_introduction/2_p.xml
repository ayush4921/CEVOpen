<p>Despite the benefits, confirmatory identification of nutrient deficiencies and salinity stress is a challenging task. Currently, many chromatographic and colorimetric procedures are available for nutrient analysis in both plants and soil. For example, total nitrogen can be determined by nitrate extraction from plant samples using a 1 M KCl solution (

High temperature combustion, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (ICP) offer more advanced approaches for plant nutrient analyses. However, all these methods are destructive, as well as time- and labor-consuming. They also require samples be shipped to analytical laboratories and the use of dangerous chemicals, which makes these analyses expensive and toxic.
