<p>Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-invasive and non-destructive technique that can be used to probe the structure of samples (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Farber et al., 2019a</xref>). It is based on inelastic light scattering by molecules that are being excited to higher vibrational or rotational states. Our group has developed techniques to use RS for confirmatory diagnostics of fungal diseases on corn, wheat, and sorghum (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Farber and Kurouski, 2018</xref>). We also showed that RS could be used to detect viral diseases of wheat and rose, as well as the presence of bacteria that cause Huanglongbing (HLB or citrus greening) on citrus trees (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2019a</xref>,b). This diagnostic approach is based on the detection of pathogen-induced changes in the structure and composition of plant molecules. Such changes are unique for each pathogenic species. Thus, RS has species-level sensitivity in pathogen diagnostics.
