<p>This work evaluates whether abiotic stresses can be detected and identified using RS. We grew rice (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) in hydroponic conditions with induced N, P, and K deficiencies as well as low and high salinity stresses. Using a hand-held Raman spectrometer, we collected spectra from the leaves of rice plants before and after inducing these abiotic stresses. In parallel, we made height and chlorophyll measurements, which are often performed in both plant biology and plant breeding to determine progress in plant vegetation and detect possible nutrient deficiencies.
