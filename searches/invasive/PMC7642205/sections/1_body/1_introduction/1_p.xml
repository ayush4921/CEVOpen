<p>Plants experience a wide range of environmental stresses that inhibit growth and reduce their ability to carry out normal cellular functions (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Farber et al., 2019a</xref>). These stresses can have abiotic and biotic origins. Biotic stresses can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These pests significantly affect the maturation of crops, reducing their productivity, and they can ultimately destroy entire agricultural ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2009</xref>). Significant losses of crop yield can also be caused by different abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, and nutrient deficiency (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2017</xref>). Soil salinity is a global problem, especially in numerous developing countries. High osmotic pressure under salinity stress in the soil prevents water and mineral uptake by plants, which drastically reduces crop yields and, ultimately, the productivity in the high salinity areas. Nitrogen (N) deficiency results in impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis, which leads to poor plant growth and leaf chlorosis (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2005</xref>). Potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies also cause reduced plant growth as well as brown tips on leaves. Timely detection and identification of these nutrient deficiencies can be used for a site- and dose-specific administration of fertilizers that will mitigate losses associated with these deficiencies (
