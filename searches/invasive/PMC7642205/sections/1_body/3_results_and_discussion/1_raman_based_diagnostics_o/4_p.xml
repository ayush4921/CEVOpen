<p>A decrease in the intensity of carotenoid vibrations suggests a decrease in the concentration of carotenoids upon ND. RNA sequencing of ND rice seedling roots indicated activation of the 
 <italic>PSY3</italic> gene, which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh et al., 2018</xref>). ABA is synthesized from carotenoids and functions as a plant signaling molecule upon various abiotic stresses (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Welsch et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a decrease in the carotenoids upon ND could be partially attributed by their conversion into signaling molecules that are synthesized by plants as a stress response.
