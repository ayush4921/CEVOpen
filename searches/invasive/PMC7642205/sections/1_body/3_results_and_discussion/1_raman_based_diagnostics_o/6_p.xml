<p>Our results demonstrated that ND, PD, and KD could be predicted as early as D2, with 84.6% on average. The most accurate predictions were made for ND (93.9%), whereas the least accurate predictions were made for KD (79.6%). The average accuracy of diagnostics increased at D4 (96.9%), thereafter remaining above 90% (90.7% at D6, 98.1% at D8, and 93.5% at D11) (
