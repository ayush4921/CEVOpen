This chemical group is present in virtually all biological molecules in plants, making it unbiased by condition and effective for normalization. The normalized spectra of healthy, PD, and KD samples exhibited very similar profiles, with only small spectral changes. However, Raman spectra collected from ND exhibited a decrease in the intensities of vibrational bands that could be assigned to pectin, cellulose, xylan, aliphatic vibrations, and carotenoids as well as an increase in the intensity of phenylpropanoid vibration.
