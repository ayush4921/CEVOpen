<p>We observed a significant difference in the chlorophyll content of ND plants and other groups at D4. However, only a slightly different decrease was observed in the chlorophyll content of the PD and KD groups at the same time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, at D6, all test groups exhibited a decrease in chlorophyll content relative to the control group rice. However, this decrease was not specific to a particular nutrient deficiency until D8. At this time point, ND plants had the lowest chlorophyll counts, followed by PD, KD, and the control plants. At D11, the trend was slightly different: ND had the lowest chlorophyll counts, followed by KD, PD, and the control plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we suggest that chlorophyll density can be used to differentiate ND from PD and KD with high confidence only at D8. Carotenoids also have multiple roles in photosynthesis, including photochemical and non-photochemical processes (
