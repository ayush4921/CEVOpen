<p>Spectra collected from leaves of healthy rice plants exhibited vibrational bands that could be assigned to pectin (747 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), cellulose (915, 1048, 1068, 1115, and 1155 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), xylan (1184 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), carotenoids (1000, 1525, and 1545 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), phenylpropanoids (∼1600 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), protein (1674 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>), and aliphatic vibrations (1218, 1288, 1326, 1382, 1440, and 1488 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Spectra collected from ND, PD, and KD plants exhibited lower intensities of vibrational bands that originated from pectin, cellulose, xylan, aliphatic vibrations, and carotenoids, relative to the corresponding bands in the spectra of healthy rice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These changes suggest that N, P, and K deficiencies can be associated with a decrease in the pectin, cellulose, xylan, and carotenoid content in rice. Although we did not observe substantial changes in the intensity of amide I bands in the spectra collected from PD and KD rice, the intensity of this band was substantially lower in spectra collected from the leaves of ND rice. This finding suggests a decrease in the protein content of leaves associated with ND. This might be explained by one of the key roles of N in plants: N is the central element of all proteins, enzymes, and nucleic acids (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Novoa and Loomis, 1981</xref>). Lastly, we found that spectra collected from ND plants exhibited an increase in the 1604 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> band, which can be assigned to phenylpropanoids, whereas plants with PD and KD did not exhibit this spectral change. This suggests that ND in rice is associated with an increase in the phenylpropanoids content. We also found a small spectral shift of this band when comparing spectra collected from healthy (1605 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) and ND (1602 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) rice. This spectral shift indicates a change in the chemical composition of phenylpropanoids occurs in ND plants. It should be noted that this band shift was not evident in the spectra collected from PD and KD plants.
