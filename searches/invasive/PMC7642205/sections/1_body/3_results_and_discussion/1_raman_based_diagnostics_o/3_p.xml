<p>An increase in the intensity of phenylpropanoids revealed by RS in ND plants might be partially explained by an increase in the concentration of 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl and coniferyl alcohols, the precursors of H- and G-lignins. This assumption is based on the results of chromatographic analyses of rice plants made by 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chishaki and Horiguchi (1997)</xref>. These researchers observed more than a fourfold increase in 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric and ferulic acids upon ND in rice leaves. However, carboxylic groups have distinct vibrational bands around 1700 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2020b</xref>), which were not observed in the collected Raman spectra of ND plants. Also, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric and ferulic acids contain a second vibrational band in this spectra region around 1630 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, which was not observed in the spectra collected from ND plants. This experimental evidence suggests that an observed increase in the concentration of phenylpropanoids upon ND is unlikely to be associated with an increase in the concentration of 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric and ferulic acids. HPLC-MS analysis of biochemical changes in rice upon ND reported by Steward and co-workers suggests that an increase in the concentration of phenylpropanoids can be due to an increased concentration of kaempherol, quercetin and its derivative isorhamnetin (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2001</xref>). Spectroscopic analysis of these compounds reported by Jurasekova and co-authors indicate that quercetin’s phenolic vibrational band was at 1610 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, whereas kaempherol’s phenolic vibrational band was at 1604 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jurasekova et al., 2006</xref>). It should be noted that we observed a blue shift of the phenolic band upon the development of N deficiency by plants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Based on this experimental evidence, we can conclude that the observed increase in phenolic band is likely to be assigned to the increased concentration of kaempherol in rice leaves.
