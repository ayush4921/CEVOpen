<p>Next, we evaluated the impact of these nutrient changes on plant height and chlorophyll content at D2, D4, D6, D8, and D11. With regard to plant height, ND and PD could be differentiated among other groups at D6 and D8. However, at D11, the only notable difference in plant height was for ND, which was the shortest group (
