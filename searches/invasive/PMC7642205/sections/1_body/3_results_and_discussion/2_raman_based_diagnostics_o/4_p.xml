<p>Rice exposed to both medium and high salinity stresses did not show substantial differences in the chlorophyll content at D2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). However, differences were observed at D4 and D6 among the control plants and those plants experiencing medium salinity stress. However, plants were in poor condition due to high salinity stress at these time points (D4 and D6), which prevented determination of the chlorophyll content from this group of plants (
