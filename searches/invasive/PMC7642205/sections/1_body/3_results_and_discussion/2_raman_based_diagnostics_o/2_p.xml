<p>At the same time, normalized spectra did not reveal substantial spectral changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that salt stress causes very small transformations in the scaffold molecules of rice. We used PLSD-DA to determine whether such small changes could be used for confirmatory diagnostics of medium and high salinity stresses. Our results showed that as early as D2, RS could determine salinity stress with an average accurate identification of 91.7% (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As expected, high salinity stress caused more substantial changes in the plant, which was reflected by higher prediction accuracy (94.5%) relative to medium salinity (89.0%) stress. The average prediction accuracy of both medium and high salinity stresses at D4 was 82.5%; at D6, the accuracy was 96.0% for the medium salinity stress. It should be noted that plants exposed to high salinity were found nearly scorched by D6; therefore, no Raman measurements were taken from their leaves.
