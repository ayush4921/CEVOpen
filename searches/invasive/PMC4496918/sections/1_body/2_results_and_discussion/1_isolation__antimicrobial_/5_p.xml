<p>There are a few reports of endophytic fungi and biological activities from other 
 <italic>Opuntia</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However other than for a preliminary survey of endophytic fungi from Australian samples of 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> there are hardly any studies reporting the isolation procedures along with the identification of endophytic fungi and associated biological activities from 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore to the best of our knowledge this is the first investigation to report the antibacterial activities of fungal endophytes of 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> invasive plant.
