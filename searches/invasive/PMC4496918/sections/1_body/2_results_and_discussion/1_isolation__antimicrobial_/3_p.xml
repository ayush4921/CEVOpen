<p>The two endophytic fungi I1 and I2 were identified as 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. respectively. Endophytic 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> showed the highest colonization in the cladodes of 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> while the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. isolated from the pistil of the flowers showed the major biological activity. The isolation of bioactive compounds was carried out for the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. only.
