<p>Some endophytic fungi have specific growth requirements and some species are not adapted to grow and sporulate in artificial culture media. Sometimes the fast growing fungal species outcompete the slower growing species [

Therefore use of several media with different nutrient aspects may probably be an advantage in isolating a large number of endophytic fungi including the cryptic species from the plant tissue. In this study four of the fungi were isolated in PDA medium while three and two were isolated in SYP and YPD media, respectively. Of the two most active fungi, I1 was isolated from both SYP and YPD media while I2 was isolated from SYP medium. This media specific isolation indicates that endophytic fungi look for specific nutrient needs or less competitive medium in order to spread their growth from the natural source to another.
