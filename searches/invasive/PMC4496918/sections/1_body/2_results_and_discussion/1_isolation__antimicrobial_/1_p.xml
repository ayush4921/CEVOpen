<p>In total eight endophytic fungi, six from cladodes and two from flowers, were isolated from 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic>. The results of the antimicrobial tests of the ethyl acetate extracts of laboratory cultures of the eight fungi are listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Only one fungus, I8, was completely inactive. Three fungi, I4, I5, and I7 were active against only one organism tested while I3 and I6 were active against two test organisms. Most promising activities were shown by I1 and I2 which were active against three microorganisms each. None of the isolated endophytes were active against
