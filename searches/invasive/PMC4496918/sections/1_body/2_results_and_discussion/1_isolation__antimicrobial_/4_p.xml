<p>The 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. had a white puffy mycelium with a peach colour pigment that secreted into the medium within seven to ten days of culture growth while 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> produced black spores in a concentric ring pattern on PDA medium (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). According to DNA sequence data and blast results obtained, these fungi showed 99 % identity to previously reported 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. (GQ505759.1) and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> (JN561274.1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition on the basis of 18S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence; internal transcribed spacer 1, 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, and internal transcribed spacer 2, complete sequence and 28S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence, the major active fungi isolated in the current study were assigned to 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>.
