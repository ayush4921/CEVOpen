<p>In the context of these host/fungal relationships, compared to native plants, the production of the secondary metabolite equisetin by the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. isolated from the internal tissues of 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic>, may well enhance the competitive ability of this plant against microorganisms and perhaps increase its adaptability to withstand the harsh and biotic stress factors in its arid environment.
