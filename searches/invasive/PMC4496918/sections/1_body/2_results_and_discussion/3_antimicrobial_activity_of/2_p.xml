<p>Previous research has reported that invasive plants’ competitive ability is enhanced by the production of secondary metabolites [

 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Alford 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] have shown that secondary metabolites released from invasive plants directly inhibit seed germination of native plants while indirectly promoting the growth of invaders through the influence of nutrient cycling. Similarly Shipunov 
 <italic>et al</italic>. has mentioned that in the host’s invaded range endophytes can increase the competitiveness of the host by producing metabolites inhibitory to evolutionarily native plants [

 <italic>et al</italic>. [
