<p>Large scale extraction of the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. with ethyl acetate gave 1 g of crude extract. Bioassay guided isolation of 400 mg of the crude extract resulted in the isolation of 2 mg of the active compound. The active component gave a [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion with m/z 374 in the low-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrum. Analysis of 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data along with 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, ROESY) data revealed that the structure of the active compound matches that of the known tetramic acid derivative, equisetin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] with a molecular formula of C
 <sub>22</sub>H
 <sub>31</sub>NO
 <sub>4</sub> which was consistent with a molecular weight of 373 daltons as seen in the ESIMS. A comparison of 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR values obtained in the present study for equisetin with those reported in the literature is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of equisetin are illustrated in Fig.
