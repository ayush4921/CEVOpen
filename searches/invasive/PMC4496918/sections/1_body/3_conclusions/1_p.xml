<p>This is the first study to describe the isolation and antibacterial activities of endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic>, an invasive plant from an arid zone ecosystem. The investigation has revealed that 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> harbors several endophytic fungi which are capable of producing antimicrobial substances with selective antibacterial activities. The endophytic 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. exhibited promising activity and the principal antimicrobial substance produced by this fungus proved to be the known secondary metabolite, equisetin. By producing such biologically active compounds, the endophytic fungal population may be assisting the host to successfully withstand stressful conditions and play a role in what can only be described as the successful spread of 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> to the detriment of the native plants in the area. The findings of this study also suggests that endophytes from harsh and competitive environments have potential to be a productive source for the discovery of useful drug leads for innovative and improved pharmaceuticals.
