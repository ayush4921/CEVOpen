<p>In this context, the objective of our study is to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> and to access for the potential production of bioactive secondary metabolites that may serve as leads for novel drug discovery. The current article reports the isolation of endophytic fungi from the invasive plant 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> from a Sri Lankan arid zone, the antimicrobial properties of the organic extracts obtained, the bioassay-guided isolation and structure elucidation of the principal antimicrobial secondary metabolite along with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) observed against a number of pathogenic micro-organisms.
