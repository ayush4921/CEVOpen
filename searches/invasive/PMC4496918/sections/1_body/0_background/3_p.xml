<p>Invasive plants are non-native plants introduced to a specific area and have a tendency to spread causing harm to the native biodiversity with consequent damage to the human economy and/or human health [

 <italic>Opuntia dillenii</italic> is a plant in the Cactaceae family introduced to Sri Lanka in the mid nineteenth century and has now become a well-established invasive plant in the Bundala National Park, a RAMSAR wetland site, in the South-Eastern arid zone of Sri Lanka, and is considered to be a national threat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> has become highly competitive over the native plants in the area and has thus successfully adapted to both the abiotic and biotic stress conditions of the harsh environment. Since tolerance to biotic stress has been correlated with endophytic fungal natural products, it is likely that 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> would be a rich source of endophytic fungi producing chemically diverse and biologically active secondary metabolites enhancing the host allelopathic effects and also providing protection against phytopathogenic microbes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, investigations into the endophyte status of invasive plants in arid zone ecosystems, the secondary metabolites produced and the antimicrobial activities of these metabolites are limited. Therefore the antibacterial producing potential of endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> collected in an unique ecological niche appeared to be an attractive target of investigation.
