<p>Endophytic fungi are a diverse group of microorganisms that thrive asymptomatically in the healthy tissues of the host. Many of these endophytes are known to biosynthesis a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites that may assist the host in protection and survival against pathogenic and insect attacks, stress tolerance and disease resistance [
