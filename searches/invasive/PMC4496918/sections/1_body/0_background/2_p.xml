<p>The arid zone ecosystem in South-East Sri Lanka is a small area extending only 20–35 Km inland to the north of Hambantota [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The area is characterized by limited rainfall of less than 1250 mm per year and mean annual temperatures of 27–30 °C with 5–7 months per year with a little or no rain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A combination of dry sandy soils of high salinity and dry winds has made this environment unique and harsh when compared to other ecosystems in Sri Lanka. This area is mainly dominated by sedges, grasses, thorny shrubs including cactus species. Trees are less common in this arid zone ecosystem [
