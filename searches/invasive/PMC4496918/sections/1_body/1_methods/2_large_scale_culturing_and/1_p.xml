<p>Endophytic fungus that exhibited promising antimicrobial activity was cultured in 200 medium size Petri dishes (100 × 20 mm) of PDA for 17 days at room temperature. At the end of the incubation period the fungus together with the medium were cut into small pieces and immersed in 1 L of ethyl acetate for 48 hours and subsequently filtered through cotton wool. The extraction with ethyl acetate was repeated thrice. The filtrates were combined and the organic solvent evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature. The resulting crude extract was weighed and screened for antimicrobial activity at 50 μg per disc to confirm the activity.</p>
