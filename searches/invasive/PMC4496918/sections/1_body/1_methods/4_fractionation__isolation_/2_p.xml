<p>The structure elucidation of the isolated compound resulted from analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectral (MS) data obtained. 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C and 2D NMR data sets were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE 600-MHz spectrometer with a 5Â mm cryoprobe with deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide, (DMSO-
