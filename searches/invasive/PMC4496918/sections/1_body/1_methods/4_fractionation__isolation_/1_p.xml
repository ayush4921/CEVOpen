<p>The principal bioactive component from the complex mixture of the crude extract of the major bioactive fungus, was obtained by bioassay guided chromatography. The crude extract (400 mg) was first fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 size exclusion column chromatography (3 × 115 cm) with methanol as eluent. The resulting fractions were combined according to the thin layer chromatography (TLC) profiles and the combined fractions were tested for antimicrobial activity using bioautography. The most active fraction (60 mg) was chromatographed on normal phase silica (3 × 20 cm column) with step-gradient elution (methanol : dichloromethane 1 : 99 to methanol). Finally the resulting bioactive fraction was purified by C
 <sub>18</sub> reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a semi-preparative column (0.94 × 25 cm) with 13:7 acetonitrile/(0.05 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/water) as eluent to give 2 mg of pure compound.
