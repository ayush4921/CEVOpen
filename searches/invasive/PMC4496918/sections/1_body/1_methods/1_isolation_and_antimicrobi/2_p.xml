<p>Prior to isolation of endophytes the plant material was surface sterilized. The cladodes and flowers were washed thoroughly with water for 10 and 3 minutes respectively, immersed in 70 % ethanol for 1–2 minute, 5.25 % Sodium hypochlorite for 2–5 minutes and again 70 % ethanol for 30–60 seconds [

To finish, the surface sterilized plant parts were washed with sterilized distilled water and allowed to dry inside a laminar flow cabinet. Small pieces of tissue were cut from the surface sterilized plant material and placed on dishes with potato dextrose agar (PDA), starch yeast peptone agar (SYP), yeast peptone dextrose agar (YPD), malt agar (ME) and malt peptone dextrose agar (MEA) media. The endophytic fungi that immerged from the tissues were transferred on to new PDA dishes and sequential sub culturing was done until pure cultures were obtained. Each pure fungal culture was grown on five freshly prepared PDA dishes and after 14–21 days depending on the growth of the fungus, the mycelium plus the medium was cut into small pieces and extracted with 200 mL of ethyl acetate for 24 hours. The ethyl acetate was filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure.
