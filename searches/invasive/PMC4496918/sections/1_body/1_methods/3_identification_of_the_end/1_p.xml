<p>Colony morphological features of the two endophytic fungi with the most promising antimicrobial activity were recorded. Following this fungal DNA was extracted in the laboratory using a published protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The extracted DNA was subjected to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4. Amplified DNA was sequenced and it was compared with existing DNA sequences in NCBI GenBank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to identify the fungi. PCR and DNA sequencing was done commercially.
