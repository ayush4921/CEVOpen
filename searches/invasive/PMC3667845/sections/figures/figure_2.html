 <caption> Effect of defoliation and competition on the net photosynthetic rate (a), light use efficiency (b) and water use efficiency (c) of invasive Mikania micrantha. Values are means Â±standard deviation. The different lowercase and uppercase letters indicate significant differences ( p&lt;0.05) among the different intensities of defoliation of invasive Mikania micrantha growing with and without native competitor, respectively. * indicates significant differences ( p&lt;0.05) between the treatments with or without competitor. </caption>
