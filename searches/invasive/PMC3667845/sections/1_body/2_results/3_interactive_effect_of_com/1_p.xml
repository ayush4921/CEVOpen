<p>Both competition and defoliation significantly reduced the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> compared to the plants of the species grown without competition and defoliation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The TP
 <sub>true</sub> values were all significantly higher than the TP
 <sub>pred</sub> values, regardless of the intensity with which 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was defoliated, indicating an antagonistic interactive effect between competition and defoliation on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The two-way ANOVAs results showed that the defoliation Ã— competition interaction had a significant effect on all of the growth and physiological traits of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (
