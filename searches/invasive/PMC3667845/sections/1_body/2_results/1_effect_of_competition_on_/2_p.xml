<p>In terms of the above-ground biomass, the defoliation response values of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> were all less than 0 and decreased with increasing defoliation intensities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating a negative effect of defoliation on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, regardless of the presence of competition: the more leaves that were removed, the more the above-ground biomass was decreased. However, the response values to the defoliation intensity of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing with native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> were all significantly higher than those of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing alone, particularly at 75% defoliation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating a compensatory growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to defoliation was induced by the growth of native 
 <italic>Coix</italic>.
