<p>Defoliation significantly decreased the above- and below-ground and total biomass of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing alone, whereas 25% and 75% defoliation had no significant effect on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing with native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> except for the below-ground biomass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Defoliation intensities from 50% to 100% significantly reduced the root/shoot ratio of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> when growing alone, whereas 25% and 50% defoliation significantly increased the ratio of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing with native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Defoliation significantly decreased the light use efficiency and water use efficiency, yet only 100% defoliation significantly decreased the net photosynthetic rate of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Defoliation intensities of 25% and 75% significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate and light use efficiency while 75% defoliation significantly increased the water use efficiency of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing with native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The two-way ANOVAs results showed that defoliation had a significant effect on all of the growth and physiological traits of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (
