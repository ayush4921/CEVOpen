<p>Based on the above-ground biomass, the competition response values of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> at 0% and 50% defoliation were less than 0, whereas those at 25%, 75% and 100% defoliation were more than 0, indicating that competition had a negative effect on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> at 0% and 50% defoliation but had a positive effect on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> at 25%, 75% and 100% defoliation. The competition response values of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> at different defoliation intensities were higher than those without defoliation, particularly at 75% (
