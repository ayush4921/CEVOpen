<p>Competition significantly decreased the above- and below-ground and total biomass of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> at 0% defoliation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). When 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was treated with 25%, 50% and 100% defoliation, competition had no effect on its growth; in contrast, competition significantly increased growth when 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was treated with 75% defoliation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Competition significantly decreased the root/shoot ratio at 0% defoliation and significantly increased the root/shoot ratio at 50% defoliation but had no effect at 25%, 75% and 100% defoliation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Competition significantly decreased the net photosynthetic rate, light use efficiency and water use efficiency at 0% defoliation, whereas 75% defoliation resulted in a similar net photosynthetic rate and a greater water use efficiency; 25%, 75% and 100% defoliation increased the light use efficiency, with a statistical significance at 100% defoliation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062608-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The two-way ANOVAs results showed that competition had a significant effect on the root/shoot ratio, net photosynthetic rate, light use efficiency and water use efficiency (
