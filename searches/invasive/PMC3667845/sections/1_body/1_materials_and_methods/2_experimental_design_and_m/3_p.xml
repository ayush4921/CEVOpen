<p>After four weeks from the date of the first defoliation, a second defoliation at different levels was conducted on the newly emerging leaves. The physiological responses of plants to defoliation have received considerable attention and are considered a potential mechanism of the compensatory growth response to defoliation 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Vanderklein1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. After three weeks from the date of the second defoliation, the net photosynthetic rate (P

 <italic>Mikania</italic> plants were measured using a portable photosynthesis and transpiration system (LCA-4, Analytical Development Co. Ltd, Hoddesdon, UK) on the terminal leaflet of the third mature leaf from the top of the plant. The measurements were performed between 9∶00 and 11∶00 am under light intensity of 1400 μmol m
