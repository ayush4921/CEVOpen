<p>We conducted our pot experiment in the village of Dengshuiling, southeast of Dongguan City (E 113°31′ −114°15′; N 22°39′−23°09′), Guangdong Province, China. The area has a marine subtropical climate, with a mean annual precipitation of 1819.9 mm, mean annual temperature of 23.1°C and mean annual sunshine time of 1873.7 hr. The zonal vegetation is subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest codominated by 
 <italic>Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Paederia scandens</italic> and 
 <italic>Pharbitis nil. Mikania</italic> began to invade this area in the early 1990 s and spread extensively in shrublands and old fields.
