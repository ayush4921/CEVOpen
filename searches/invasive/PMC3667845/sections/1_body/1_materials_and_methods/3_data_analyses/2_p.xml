<p>Two-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were used to analyse the factorial effect of the defoliation intensities (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%) and competition (with or without) on the growth of the invasive plant, with defoliation and competition as the main factors. One-way ANOVAs were used to analyse the effect of defoliation on the growth of the invasive plant with or without the competitor. In the ANOVAs, the response indices were log-transformed and the other indices were log-transformed only when the assumption of homoscedasticity of the indices was not met. The homogeneity of the variance was evaluated using Levene's test. Statistical significance was taken at p&lt;0.05.</p>
