<p>To investigate the effects of herbivory and competition on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> in more detail, we calculated four response indices for the above-ground biomass of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>: defoliation responses (DR = with defoliation/without defoliation) and competition responses (CR = with competition/without competition 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Schdler1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This calculation is based on a null model that competition and herbivory do not interact and respond multiplicatively on a linear scale. If DR or CR = 1, there would be no effect of competition or herbivory on plant growth. If DR or CR &lt;1, there would be a negative effect; If DR or CR&gt;1, there would be a positive effect. We also calculated TR
 <sub>pred</sub> (DR × CR) to indicate the simple multiplicative effects of competition and herbivory together on plant growth and TR
 <sub>true</sub> (with defoliation and competition/without defoliation and competition) to indicate the observed combined effect of both competition and herbivory 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Schdler1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. If TR
 <sub>pred</sub> &gt; TR
 <sub>true</sub>, there would be a synergistic interaction between competition and herbivory; If TR
 <sub>pred</sub> &lt; TR
 <sub>true</sub>, there would be an antagonistic interaction. If TR
 <sub>pred</sub> = TR
 <sub>true</sub>, there would be no interaction.
