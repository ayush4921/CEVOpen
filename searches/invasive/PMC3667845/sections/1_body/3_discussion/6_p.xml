<p>Although artificial defoliation has been widely used to mimic the effect of truly herbivory on plants

 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, there are undeniably significant differences between defoliation and herbivory 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Lehtila1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Artificial defoliation can only mimic the effect of the loss of leaf area which decreased the ability of plants to intercept light 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Trumble1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> but not the effect in responding to the physiological and chemical interactions (e.g., due to nutrient supply) between herbivores and plants. In spite of some pitfalls, artificial defoliation has been used more often in herbivory research than real herbivores for easily and precisely controlling, targeted effect and efficient experimental designs 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Trumble1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. And there were only a few cases (as low as 3%) with the outcomes where artificial and natural damage had opposite effects on plants. The biological control agent of

 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, so the defoliation can at least partially mimic the effect of the loss of leaf area caused by the biological control agent.
