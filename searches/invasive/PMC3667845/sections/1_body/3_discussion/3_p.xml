<p>Although the mechanism underling the compensatory growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> that is induced by the competition is unknown, the underground network between the roots of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> mediated by mycorrhizae might be a possible mechanism. Although it is still unknown why defoliation can induce a potential transfer of nutrients between a plant and a neighbouring plant, evidence using stable isotopes verified that defoliation could change the underground nitrogen flow 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Ayres1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and that carbon could be transferred via mycorrhizae from native neighbouring plants to the invasive plant 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Carey1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> is a mycorrhizal plant 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Charoenpakdee1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and the soil in the 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> community is rich in fungi 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It has also been verified that native neighbours are capable of enhancing compensatory growth of invasive plants to defoliation in the presence of soil fungi 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Callaway1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Callaway2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Further atention should be paid to the underground mechanism.
