<p>It has been commonly verified that plants may compensate for tissue losses due to defoliation, resulting in increased growth relative to non-defoliated plants

 <xref rid="pone.0062608-McNaughton2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Different from these conclusions, in this study, defoliation had a negative effect on the growth of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing alone: growth declined with increasing defoliation intensities. However, the negative effect of defoliation may be modified by competition. The response values to different defoliation intensities tested on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing with native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> were all significantly higher than those of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> growing alone, indicating a compensatory growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> induced by competition in response to defoliation, particularly at 75% defoliation. This result indicates that native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> could help invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> be more vigorous after defoliation.
