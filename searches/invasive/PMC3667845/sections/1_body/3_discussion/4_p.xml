<p>The successfully invasive plants are always strong competitors of the native plant species, however, native plants has been verified as a major force in the resistance of exotic invasions

 <italic>Coix</italic> did significantly decrease the growth of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> because of the limited resources. However, the negative effect of competition on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> may be modified by defoliation. The response values of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to competition increased at each defoliation intensity, indicating a release from native competitor 
 <italic>Coix</italic> induced by defoliation, particularly at 75% defoliation. The release of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> from competition that can be induced by defoliation could increase the number of invasive plants and allow the domination of niche spaces to the detriment of native species 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Tilman1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, perhaps facilitating the invasiveness of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and helping to shape the structure and dynamics of the invaded communities.
