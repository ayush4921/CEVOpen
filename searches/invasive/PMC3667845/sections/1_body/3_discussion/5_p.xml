<p>Plants have the ability to (at least partially) compensate for herbivory only above a certain threshold level of damage 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Ruiz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and this threshold can differ among plant species. Yu et al. found that invasive 
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> can only rapidly recover from 50% defoliation 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Similarly, in the present study, when the native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> was present, 75% defoliation induced the compensatory growth of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. Many morphological and physiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the compensatory growth that follows herbivory or defoliation 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-BallinaGmez1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, such as the increased allocation of substrates from the roots to shoots 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Dyer1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and the increased photosynthetic rate of the regrowing tissue 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Delting1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In our study, 75% defoliation decreased the root/shoot ratio and significantly increased net photosynthetic rate, light use efficiency and water use efficiency. The resources stored in the roots were shifted to the shoots, significantly reducing the root/shoot ratio 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Barton2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Barton found that 
 <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic> (Plantaginaceae) seedlings were plastic in their resource allocation between the shoots and roots, resulting in compensatory growth 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Barton2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. This type of strong compensatory growth due to phenotypic plasticity and the physiological acclimation of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was maximised at 75% defoliation.
