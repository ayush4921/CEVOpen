<p>Both competition and herbivory by native species could affect the invasiveness of introduced species and often limit the success of invasive species in a recipient community 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, the compensatory growth responses of plants after herbivory damage can alleviate the potential deleterious effects of herbivory and can have a positive impact on the fitness of plants 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-McNaughton1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, intensifying the negative impact on the native neighbour and releasing the invasive species from competition 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Callaway3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Walling and Zabinski have found that the competitive ability of invasive 
 <italic>Centaurea maculosa</italic> to outgrow native plants was intensified by the compensatory growth produced by defoliation, which resulted in a greater capture of resources 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Walling1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our study, just as we predicted, the effect of the interaction between competition and defoliation on the growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was less than their individual effects, indicating an antagonism. Similar antagonistic effects have also been found in invasive 
 <italic>Centaurea melitensis</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Callaway1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <italic>Centaurea solstitialis</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Callaway2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and 
 <italic>Poa annua</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Schdler1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the present study, the antagonistic interactive effect of defoliation and competition from native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> on invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and the consequent compensatory growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> might be one of the possible mechanisms why host-specific biological control agents could not successfully control invasive plants in an invaded community.
