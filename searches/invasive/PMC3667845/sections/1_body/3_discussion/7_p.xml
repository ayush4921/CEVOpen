<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that natural herbivory might not necessarily be safely used as a potential agent to control invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> in the field because of the induced compensatory growth of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by native 
 <italic>Coix</italic>. Further studies should consider the interactions at the intertrophic and multitrophic levels in invaded communities as well as among more factors including, e.g., nutrient supply which seems difficult to investigate with simulated herbivore, whereby the ecological risk of the releasing of the biological control agents can be comprehensively evaluated.
