 <italic>Actinote thalia pyrrha</italic> (Fabricius), a natural enemy in the native range of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, is currently being introduced to India 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Desmierdechenon1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and China 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> to control 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. 
 <italic>A. thalia pyrrha</italic> is verified as a potential agent of biological control, as the insect consumes all of the young leaves and stems of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The results of our research could provide information for the management of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and also for the application of natural enemies to control invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>.
