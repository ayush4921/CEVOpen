 <italic>Coix lacryma-jobi</italic> (Poaceae) (hereafter referred to as 
 <italic>Coix</italic>) is a native annual grass, commonly occurring in the communities that are subject to invasion by 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. We conducted an experiment in which invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was growing with native 
 <italic>Coix</italic> and was treated with defoliation-mimicking herbivory to examine the interactive effect between herbivory and competition on invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. We predicted that an antagonistic interaction between herbivory and competition from native species would enhance the performance of the invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and release it from competition. In particular, we addressed the following questions: 1) Can competition from the native neighbouring 
 <italic>Coix</italic> affect the response of the invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to defoliation? 2) Can defoliation affect the impact of competition on the invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and release it from competition? 3) Is the interaction between defoliation and competition antagonistic?
