<p>Moreover, the extent to which plants respond to herbivory might be dependent on the intensity of herbivory 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Puettmann1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Puettmann and Saunders found that the compensatory growth of 
 <italic>Pinus strobes</italic> seedlings varied with the competitive conditions and clipping intensity 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Puettmann1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Accordingly, we also aimed to address the following question: 4) Does the intensity of defoliation affect the interactive effect? In this study, some physiological traits of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> were also measured to explore the mechanical responses to the interaction between defoliation and competition.
