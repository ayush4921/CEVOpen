<p>Invasive plants pose severe threats to biological diversity and ecosystems 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Mack1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and many methods have been used to control invasive plants. Biological control, i.e., using natural enemies to control invasion success, has received much attention 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Vil1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and has been highly successfully used to control noxious weeds, such as 
 <italic>Senecio jacobaea</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and 
 <italic>Ageratina riparia</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Barton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Biological control, being effective and having a low cost and relatively high environmental safety, has been widely accepted 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-MllerSchrer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, many natural enemies have recently been verified as being inefficient in biologically controlling invasive plants in the invaded communities 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-DrayJR1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0062608-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, even though the host-specific agents were efficient in pot experiments. Thus, exploring the mechanism underlying this phenomenon would be important and useful in developing future biological controls of invasive species.
