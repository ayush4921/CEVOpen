 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> during the period September to December 2019. In our survey the unit of analysis was the household and the household head or his/her representative was the respondent. A complete list of 909 households from the four villages (Sikles, Parche, Khilang and Tangting) in the Upper Madi watershed was first collected from the election commission of Nepal. Sample size of 278 households was calculated out of 909 households by using the formula proposed by 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> to provide a statistically significant sample from the target population of the study area [
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our sample represents approximately 31% of the total households in the study area. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to randomly select 278 households from the household list. We had contacted 278 householders and all of them had responded, most of the respondents were household heads and some were representatives of the households where the heads were absent. Face to face interviews were conducted with household heads (or their representatives) using a structured questionnaire containing both closed and open-ended questions 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To check for clarity and understanding of the survey questions, 10 households were pre-tested

 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> were used to quantify the local perceptions of climate change and perceived impacts on NTFP ecosystem services. The quantitative data obtained from household surveys were analyzed using SPSS and Microsoft Excel to obtain descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages of responses. The Dictionary of Nepalese Plant Names 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> was used to identify the botanical and common English names of most plant species as local common names collected from household survey were in the Gurung language.
