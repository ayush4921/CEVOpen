<p>The weaker competitive effect of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> on other species in history soil occurred despite suppression of mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal colonization in soils with 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>) was reduced by levels comparable to that observed in the field (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Barto et al., 2011</xref>), with concomitant reductions in competitor plant growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, competitor species were still better able to resist competition from 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in soils with a history of the invader than control soils. Though we cannot separate the individual effects of nutrient depletion and reduced mycorrhizal colonization on the outcome of competition in the present study, we note that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was suppressed in the soil history treatment at a level that was more than three times the average level of suppression across all competitor species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). Because 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is nonmycorrhizal, the strong negative effect of growth in conspecific soil on its biomass was most likely caused by lower nutrients. We suggest, therefore, that the most likely explanation for weaker competitive ability of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in history soils is that the negative effect of nutrient depletion on 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was stronger than the negative effect of suppressing mycorrhizal colonization on competitor species. 
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. (2012)</xref> also observed weak effects of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> soil history on the biomass of competitor species. The observation that competition was weaker overall in history soil is also consistent with the hypothesis that when plant growth is suppressed by environmental stress or low fertility, limited overall demand for resource uptake reduces the strength of competition (
