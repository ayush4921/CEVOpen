<p>Our results indicate that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is a strong competitor against a range of common mycorrhizal grassland, old field and forest species in soils which had no previous history with its conspecifics, but contrary to expectation, this competitive advantage weakens in soil with a history of conspecific growth. In uninvaded control soil, for example, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> suppressed the biomass of a majority of competitor plant species by an average effect size that exceeded 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, the suppression of competitor speciesâ€™ biomass by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was weaker in history soil, with an effect size that was less than half of that observed in control soil. Moreover, 70% of species responded negatively to the presence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in control soil, but only 26% of species responded negatively in conspecific history soil. Because the soil history treatment reduced plant available nutrients in soil and reduced mycorrhizal colonization of roots, differences in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> competitive ability between treatments could be caused by these factors acting independently or in combination. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the competitive ability of newly introduced 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is sufficient to displace competitor species in previously uninvaded sites in the short term, but modification of the soil environment by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> may not enhance its competitive ability.
