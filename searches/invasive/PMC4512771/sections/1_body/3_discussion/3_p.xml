<p>Our findings imply that the negative effect of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> on mycorrhizal fungi as a mechanism of competition during invasion may be weaker than previously expected. Though this interpretation is supported by weaker competition in the 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history soil, where colonization of roots by AM fungi was reduced, it is tentative for two reasons. First, we did not quantify AM fungal colonization of roots for all competitor species, and it is possible that these effects were not the same in unmeasured species. Second, though the reduction in AM fungal colonization of roots is consistent with the presence of fungal inhibiting secondary chemicals produced by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, we did not directly quantify the concentration of these compounds in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history soil. Though secondary chemicals produced by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> likely reduced fungal populations during the 5 month soil conditioning period (
