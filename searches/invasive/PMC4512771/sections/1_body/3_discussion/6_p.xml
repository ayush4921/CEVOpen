<p>Functional trait variation, beyond that associated with growth form, did not predict either the ability of competitor species to resist suppression by, or their ability to suppress, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>. When growth form was included in multiple regressions between traits and competitive response or competitive effect, no significant relationships were found, regardless of soil treatment (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4">Table 4</xref>). There was also limited trait plasticity in response to 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history in soil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>), despite strong effects on plant biomass. These findings are consistent with those of 
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2010)</xref>, who also reported weak relationships between trait values and competitive ability. The inability to detect specific relationships between traits and competitive ability could be caused by the possibility that competitive ability depends on combinations of several traits or traits that were not measured (
 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Wardle et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), or because functionally alternate strategies, such as efficient resource acquisition or resource storage, can result in similar competitive abilities (
