<p>Our findings have implications for recent hypotheses about how competitive response and competitive effect should be correlated across environments (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Keddy, Twolan-Strutt &amp; Wisheu, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Keddy et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, competitive response is expected to be context specific, varying with resource availability or other ecological and environmental factors, and is not expected to be correlated across environments. By contrast, competitive effect is expected to be a general property of a species, such that it is positively correlated across environments (
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Our results are generally consistent with these predictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6</xref>), but the relationship between competitive effect in control and history soils was weaker than (i.e., 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.12, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6B</xref>) found in other studies (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Keddy, Twolan-Strutt &amp; Wisheu, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Keddy et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Observing such context dependency in the competitive effect of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was not unique to our study. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Smith &amp; Reynolds (2014)</xref> found that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> could suppress other species under high light conditions, but had much weaker effects in the shade. Our findings suggest the ability of competitor species to either resist suppression by, or suppress, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> cannot be confidently predicted from one ecological context to another.
