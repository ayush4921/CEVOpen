<p>We hypothesized that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>â€™s strong competitive ability is caused by the capacity to deplete limiting resources to levels lower than resident species, as expected from resource competition theory (

 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Bever et al., 2010</xref>). However, simulated nutrient depletion of soils by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> more strongly suppressed its own growth relative to competitor species. The ability of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> to suppress other species may therefore be caused by other traits, such as fast growth rate and high allocation to leaf area (

 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Engelhardt &amp; Anderson, 2011</xref>). The tendency for decomposing 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> leaf litter to increase soil nutrient availability in the years following successful invasion (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al., 2008</xref>) also suggests that this species has evolved to compete effectively at high, rather than low, soil resources. In addition, we note that our experiment simulates competition between first year individuals of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> and competitor species. In the field, competition also takes place between spring flowering 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> plants that have over wintered as rosettes and newly germinating plants of competitor species, which can further advantage 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Herold et al., 2011</xref>). The observation that nutrient depletion caused by conspecifics reduces individual plant performance, however, corroborates previous findings that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> experiences relatively strong intra-specific competition (

 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Leicht-Young, Pavlovic &amp; Adams, 2012</xref>), which would limit the net reproductive rate of established populations. The possibility of nutrient-limitation mediated density-dependent population regulation is consistent with recent demographic analyses showing that in situations where other biotic factors such as herbivory are excluded, established 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> populations decline towards extinction (
