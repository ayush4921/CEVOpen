<p>To determine whether morphological and physiological traits could explain the ability of competitive species to either resist suppression by, or suppress 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, we measured aboveground traits on all plant species in the absence of competition in both soil treatments. We measured leaf chlorophyll concentration and photosynthetic efficiency of up to 6 individuals from each species in each soil treatment at 5 and 9 weeks growth. Height at 5 weeks on these individuals was recorded as the vertical distance from the soil surface to the tip of the tallest leaf. We measured chlorophyll concentration on the three youngest fully expanded leaves per plant using a portable chlorophyll meter (SPAD 502; Minolta Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey, USA), and calculated an average value per plant. We measured photosynthetic efficiency as instantaneous fluorescence yield under saturating light conditions (1,500 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>), a measure of the light use efficiency of photosystem II (
