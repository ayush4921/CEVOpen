<p>To assess the magnitude and variation in the ability of competitor species to influence 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> aboveground biomass, and whether this species effect was influenced by soil history, we used a two-way ANOVA with competitor species identity, soil history and their interaction as factors. To test whether growth with a competitor species suppressed the biomass of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in each soil treatment, we used planned orthogonal 1-df contrasts to compare the biomass of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> grown alone relative to its growth (i) with each competitor, (ii) with each growth form in aggregate, and (iii) across all competitor species in aggregate. The effect of soil treatment on fungal colonization of roots was determined with a two-way ANOVA with soil and species as factors. The statistical significance of soil treatment on fungal colonization for each species was determined by comparing 95% confidence intervals for overlap. The effect of growth form and soil treatment on plant traits was tested with a two-way ANOVA using species means for each trait as the replicate. Differences among growth forms were determined by comparing the 95% confidence intervals for each growth form for overlap following a significant main effect. All ANOVAs and 1-df contrasts were done with SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
