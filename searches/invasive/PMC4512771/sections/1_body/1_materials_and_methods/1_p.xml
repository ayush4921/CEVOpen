<p>To examine competitive interactions between resident species and 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, we grew 27 target species with and without the presence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>). Competitor species included forest trees, forest understory herbs, old field herbs and grasses that are commonly found in areas typically invaded by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in southern Ontario (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Biswas et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> seeds were bulk collected from the Wild Goose Woods, a mixed hardwood forest in the University of Guelph Arboretum (43°32′N, 80°12′W) in July 2009. 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> can be found in dense patches along the periphery of the forest throughout this site. Seeds for each competitor species were harvested within the Guelph Arboretum as well as purchased from suppliers (Acorus Restoration, Walsingham, Ontario, Canada; Angelgrove Seed Company, Harbour Grace, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada; Ontario Tree Seed Facility, Angus, Ontario, Canada; Richter’s Herbs, Goodwood, Ontario, Canada (
