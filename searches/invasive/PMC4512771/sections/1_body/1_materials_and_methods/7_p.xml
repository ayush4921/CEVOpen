<p>To determine if root traits co-varied with competitive ability, we grew 5 replicates of all plant species in a separate experiment in a sterilized mixture of 2/3 silica sand and 1/3 topsoil for 35 days. Root architecture could not be measured in the main experiment because roots could not be effectively separated from the higher organic matter containing field soil, and because roots were becoming pot bound by the time of harvest. The shorter growing period and silica sand-topsoil mixture prevented plant roots from becoming pot bound and facilitated the harvest of intact root systems. Plants were grown individually in 650 mL pots (D40 R; Stuewe and Sons Inc., Tangent, Oregon, USA). At harvest, roots were cleaned and preserved in 50% ethanol. For analysis, roots were stained with 0.05% Toluidine Blue O to improve the visibility of fine roots, spread out in water to minimize overlap and photographed with a high resolution (6,400 dpi) scanner (Epson V700; Epson Canada Limited, Markham, Ontario, Canada). Root images were analyzed with WinRhizo software (version 2009a; Regent Instruments 2009, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada) using the automatic pixel classification setting to assess the length and average root diameter of each root system. After scanning, roots were dried at 60 Â°C for 48 h and weighed. In addition to average root diameter, we also calculated specific root length (SRL), or the ratio of root length to root mass, which is indicative of the amount of surface area available for nutrient absorption (
