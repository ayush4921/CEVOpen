<p>To quantify variation in the ability of competitor species to either resist suppression by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> or suppress 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, we calculated two indices of competition. The ability of a competitor species to resist suppression is defined as competitive response (CR, 
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), and was quantified as ln (biomass under competition/biomass alone). The ability of each competitor species to suppress 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is defined as competitive effect (CE, 
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Gaudet &amp; Keddy, 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), and was quantified as â€“ln (
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass under competition/
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass alone). When calculated this way, greater values reflect stronger competitive ability.
