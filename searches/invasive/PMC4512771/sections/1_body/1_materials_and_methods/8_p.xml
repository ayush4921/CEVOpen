<p>To assess the magnitude and variation in resistance of competitor species to 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> competition and whether the magnitude of resistance is influenced by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> soil history, we analyzed aboveground biomass of competitor species with a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with competition, soil history and competitor species identity and all interactions as factors. Planned orthogonal single degree of freedom (1-df) contrasts were used to determine whether each competitor species biomass differed between competition treatments within each soil history treatment. We also used 1-df contrasts to test whether growth forms (trees, forbs, grasses) differed as a whole between competition treatments in each soil history treatment.
