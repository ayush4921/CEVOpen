<p>To determine if 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> soil history suppressed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, we harvested the roots of a subset of competitor species when grown alone in both history and control soil. To quantify root colonization by AM fungi, we selected eight species that represented the range of growth forms in the experiment. Root cell contents were cleared with potassium hydroxide and AM fungi were stained with Chlorazol black E (
