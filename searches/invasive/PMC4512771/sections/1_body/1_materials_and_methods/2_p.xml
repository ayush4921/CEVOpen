<p>To simulate a soil environment that 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is likely to encounter upon invasion, we grew plants in a forest soil without a history of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>. In November 2009, soil was collected to a depth of 30 cm from a mixed deciduous forest dominated by 
 <italic>Acer saccharum</italic> in the Koffler Scientific Reserve (44°03′N, 79°29′W, Newmarket, ON). Prior to soil collection, live aboveground vegetation and macro-organic matter (leaves and twigs) were removed. Soil was sieved onsite to remove roots and stones and placed into 30, 35L tubs (60.7 cm long × 40.4 cm wide × 22.1 cm deep; Roughneck Storage Box #2214; Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, USA). Tubs had holes drilled in the bottom to facilitate drainage. Soils were stored at 4 °C prior to the beginning of experiments. To experimentally create a treatment where the presence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> has modified the soil, we grew 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> plants in half of the field collected soil (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Callaway et al., 2008</xref>). The remaining soil was left intact in the tubs. To create the 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> soil history treatment, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> seeds were cold stratified at 4 °C for 120 days on moist filter paper placed inside 10 cm diameter parafilm sealed petri dishes. In January 2010, 100 germinating 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> seeds were transplanted into each of 15 randomly selected tubs. After 6 weeks, seedlings were thinned to a density of 80 plants/m
 <sup>2</sup>, which approximates the upper end of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> density in field populations (
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Meekins &amp; McCarthy, 2002</xref>). Tubs containing 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> seedlings and those containing intact control soil were randomly arranged on the greenhouse bench and watered to maintain field capacity. Germinating seedlings from other species were periodically removed from all tubs. 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> plants were harvested 5 months after germination to simulate the approximate active growing season for first year rosettes of this species in southern Ontario and to allow roots to fully explore the soil in the tubs. At harvest, the aboveground portion of plants was removed and discarded, and soil was sieved to remove roots and homogenized within each soil treatment.
