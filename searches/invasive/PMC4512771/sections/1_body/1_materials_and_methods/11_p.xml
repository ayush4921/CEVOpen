<p>To determine whether morphological and physiological traits of competitor plants were associated with competitive ability, we used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) multiple regression, with competitive ability (either CR or CE) as the dependent variable and traits as independent variables. Growth form of plants was used as a covariate in the analysis. Because root traits were assessed in a different experiment, multiple regression analyses were run separately for aboveground and belowground traits. To analyze data, we used the time calibrated phylogenetic tree from

 <xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">Webb, Ackerly &amp; Kembel, 2008</xref>), pruned to include the competitor species. In PGLS regression, the phylogenetic variance–covariance matrix is incorporated into the calculation of coefficients (
