<p>The average biomass of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in competition was not significantly different from its average biomass when grown alone in either soil treatment (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>history</sub> = 0.284, 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>control</sub> = 0.602; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> biomass varied in response to competition with different competitor species (significant species effect, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). In most cases, these species effects were not consistent between control and history soils (significant species Ã— soil history interaction, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3">Table 3</xref>). For example, relative to its biomass when alone, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> was significantly smaller in competition with 
 <italic>H. matronalis, B. inermis, E. canadensis, E. riparius</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. virginicus</italic> in control soil but significantly smaller in competition with 
 <italic>Q. macrocarpa, H. matronalis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. canadensis</italic> in history soil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). In some cases, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass was higher when grown with a competitor species than when grown alone. This response occurred with 
 <italic>P. strobus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> in control soil and 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> in history soil. 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass response to competition also varied with growth form, and this effect differed between soil treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>, insets). In control soil, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass was 27% higher (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.041) when grown with trees than when grown alone, 43% lower (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) when grown with grasses than when grown alone, and not influenced by forbs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.61). In history soil, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> biomass was not affected by competition with trees (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.96) or forbs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.38), but was 62% lower (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.033) when grown with grasses than when grown alone.
