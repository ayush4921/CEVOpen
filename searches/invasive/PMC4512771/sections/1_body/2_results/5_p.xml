<p>Morphological and physiological traits of competitor plants grown alone differed among growth forms, but were not generally affected by growing in soil with a history of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). Quantum yield of photosystem II [Y(II)] measured at week 5 was significantly higher in herbs and grasses relative to trees. In week 9, Y(II) was significantly higher in herbs compared to grasses and trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The quantum yield of photosystem II did not differ between soil treatments in week 5, but was lower in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history soil than control soil in week 9. Chlorophyll concentration in week 5 was significantly higher in herbs and grasses than trees, but did not differ among growth forms in week 9, and did not differ between soil history treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5B</xref>). At week 5, grasses were significantly taller than trees and herbs, but height was not influenced by soil history treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Trees had significantly larger root diameter than either herbs or grasses, which did not differ significantly from each other. Trees also had significantly lower SRL than herbs, whereas grasses had intermediate SRL that did not differ significantly from that of trees or herbs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5D</xref> and
