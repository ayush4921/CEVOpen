<p>The average aboveground biomass of competitor species was reduced by the presence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> compared to when they were grown alone (significant competition main effect, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2">Table 2</xref>). However, competition was weaker in soil with a history of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> relative to control soil (significant soil history × competition interaction, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). The average biomass of competitor species was reduced by 59% in control soil compared to 27% in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history soil. The influence of soil history on competition also varied among species (significant species × soil history × competition interaction, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, the aboveground biomass of 19 species (70%; 13/18 native, 6/9 introduced) was suppressed by competition in control soil whereas only 7 species (26%; 4/18 native, 3/9 introduced) were suppressed by competition in 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history soil. On a growth form basis, trees (−38%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01), forbs (−62%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.000001) and grasses (−56%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.000001) were all suppressed by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in control soil, whereas the biomass of forbs (−32%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.000001) and grasses (−14%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), but not trees (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.228), was significantly reduced by competition in the 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> history soil (
