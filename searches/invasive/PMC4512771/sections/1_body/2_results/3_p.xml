<p>On average, competitor species grown alone in soil with a history of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> were 15% smaller than plants grown in control soil (

 <sub>1,261</sub> = 21.991,

 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> soil history (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>26,261</sub> = 3.042, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.000003), though a majority showed no significant difference between treatments. Significant negative effects of soil history were found for 
 <italic>Q. macrocarpa</italic> (−37%,

 <italic>H. matronalis</italic> (−29%,

 <italic>P. virgatum</italic> (−33%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.000001). The strongest negative response to soil history was observed for 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>, whose biomass was 56% lower in soil in which it had been previously planted than in control soil (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).
