<p>To test the hypothesis that nutrient depletion in the first year of an invasion enhances the competitive ability of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> against resident mycorrhizal plant species in subsequent years, we grew 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> with and without multiple competitor species in forest soil that had either been left intact or previously planted with 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>. This latter treatment simulates a reduction in soil nutrient availability because 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is expected to take up resources during growth. However, the experiment does not strictly mimic the entire process of invasion in the field because the high decomposability of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> leaves is expected to return nutrients to soil in the longer term (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al., 2008</xref>). The experimental design nonetheless allows us to address whether the competitive ability of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> can be influenced by changes in overall resource availability. Because 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> occurs in a wide variety of habitats, including old fields, road sides, forest edges and forest understories (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Cavers, Heagy &amp; Kokron, 1979</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Stinson &amp; Seidler, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Smith &amp; Reynolds, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Biswas et al., 2015</xref>), we quantified competition between 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> and 27 native and non-native mycorrhizal competitor species that represent these different habitats (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Cavers, Heagy &amp; Kokron, 1979</xref>). We predicted that soil nutrient reduction and the potential for inhibition of mycorrhizal fungi by previous growth of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> in soil (‘history soil’) inhibits the growth of mycorrhizal plant species. As a result, 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> should more strongly suppress the growth of, and resist growth suppression by, competitor species in the history soil treatment than in control soil. We predicted that competitor species with finer roots, greater height extension, and higher photosynthetic efficiency would be more likely to resist competition against 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>.
