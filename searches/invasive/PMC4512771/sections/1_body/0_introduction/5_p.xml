<p>Despite the potential for 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> to modify the soil environment in a way that enhances its own competitive ability, resident species may still be able to resist invasion. Such resistance could depend on the morphological and physiological traits that influence acquisition of soil nutrients and light, which most often limit plant growth (

 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Funk et al., 2008</xref>). The potential for depletion of soil nutrients and the suppression of mycorrhizal fungi by 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> suggests that resident species which resist competitive suppression should have thin roots that maximize absorptive root surface area for resource uptake (

 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> could also be effective at acquiring light (
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Stinson &amp; Seidler, 2014</xref>), particularly by accelerated height growth, which would allow them to overtop neighbors, and by having high photosynthetic light use efficiency (

 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> against other species has been tested in pairwise competition trials (
