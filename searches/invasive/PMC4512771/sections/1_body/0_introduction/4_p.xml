<p>The successful establishment and persistence of 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> may also be influenced by the joint effects of novel biochemical weapons and the ability to acquire soil resources more effectively than potential competitors (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Blossey &amp; Notzold, 1995</xref>). Resource competition theory predicts that the strong competitors deplete limiting resources to levels lower than weaker competitors (

 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Tilman &amp; Wedin, 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Bever et al., 2010</xref>). If 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> is a strong resource competitor, it should deplete soil nutrients below tolerable limits for other species, suppressing other species more than itself. The ability to efficiently take up nutrients as well as survive and reproduce under limited soil nutrients could explain 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic>â€™s ability to colonize habitats that vary widely in nutrient availability (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al., 2008</xref>) as well its ability to suppress native vegetation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Stinson et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers, Stinson &amp; Finzi, 2008</xref>). Moreover, if 
 <italic>A. petiolata</italic> can suppress mycorrhizal fungi while simultaneously depleting soil nutrients, this should result in even stronger suppression of mycorrhizal competitors. This is because the negative effect of losing the fungal symbiont is greatest when mycorrhizal plants are grown in low soil nutrients (
