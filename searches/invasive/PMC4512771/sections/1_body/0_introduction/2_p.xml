<p>Recent reviews suggest that successful invasions rarely occur because of a single mechanism (

 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Gurevitch et al., 2011</xref>). At least three explanations for weak effects of any one mechanism have been proposed (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Gurevitch et al., 2011</xref>). First, the efficacy of a particular mechanism may depend on ecological context, where differences in resource availability and the functional attributes of resident species can either facilitate or increase resistance to invasion (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Funk et al., 2008</xref>). Second, the importance of a particular mechanism could differ between phases of an invasion (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Dietz &amp; Edwards, 2006</xref>). For example, allelopathy may effectively suppress resident species in the initial phases of invasion (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Callaway &amp; Ridenour, 2004</xref>), but its effects can diminish as resident species acclimate or evolve resistance to the novel biochemicals (

 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Lankau, 2011</xref>). Third, multiple mechanisms could act synergistically, as observed in situations where invasion is facilitated by both competitive suppression of resident species and reduced palatability to herbivores (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Lau &amp; Schultheis, 2015</xref>). Simultaneous empirical assessments of multiple causes of invasion, however, are infrequent (
