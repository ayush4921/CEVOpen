<p>The most intuitive and straightforward remote sensing approach for alien plant detection is to use high spatial resolution images to visually inspect the spatial distribution of non-native species. The idea in this approach is to pinpoint these species based on their unique spatial patterns or phenological characteristics. Everitt and his colleagues conducted monitoring studies in the USA using aerial photographs taken during the flowering seasons of Eurasian 
 <italic>Euphorbia esula</italic> and Asian 
 <italic>Tamarix chinensis</italic> [

They found that the visible-wavelength (400-700 nm) reflectance of infested settings was significantly higher due to the bright-colored inflorescence. Color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs are also commonly employed, with resolutions ranging from a few centimeters (aerial videography) to ∼2 m (US National Agriculture Imagery Program; URL:

 <italic>Heracleum mantegazzianum</italic> invasion (the largest central European forb native to the western Caucasus) in Czech Republic. The brightness of 
 <italic>H. mantegazzianum</italic> was much higher than neighboring vegetation, not only during the flowering, but in the early fruiting season (June-August) due to its distinct structure of fruiting umbels. Distinct fruiting colors afforded an even wider window of opportunity for invasive plant detection, and increased the possibility of monitoring the invasion through time using multiple photographs.
