<p>We first introduce studies that delineate the presence of alien plant habitats using moderate spatial/spectral and high spatial resolution remote sensing. We then describe techniques to investigate the phenology (life cycle) of invasive alien plants and/or studies that estimate the presence and abundance of invasive plants via high temporal resolution remote sensing. Hyperspectral remote sensing studies are presented to highlight how they derive chemical properties of non-native plants, followed by active remote sensing that reveals the vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure, and multi-dimensional analysis that combines the strengths of different types of remotely sensed data via image fusion. Finally, we discuss the limitations of remote sensing for the regional-scale monitoring, and highlight current research needs and future directions to decipher the complexity of alien plant invasions.</p>
