<p>Invasions by alien species (also known as non-native species or non-indigenous species) are among the most formidable of threats to ecosystems and human well-being. Biological invasions have been identified as a major non-climatic driver of global change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-sensors-09-04869">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-sensors-09-04869">2</xref>]. In the USA, the estimated cost of environmental damages and associated management and control of alien invaders is about $137 billion per year; the total amount could be several times more if monetary values of native species extinctions, biodiversity reduction, ecosystem services and aesthetics can be assessed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-sensors-09-04869">4</xref>]. The ecological effects of alien grass infestation include enhancement of fire frequency and severity, depletion of nutrients, changes in microclimate and alterations in vegetation succession [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-sensors-09-04869">7</xref>]. Invasions may even have significant feedbacks with regional and global climate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-sensors-09-04869">8</xref>]; the rate and spatial pattern of biological invasions (mainly alien plants) may be mediated by other environmental changes such as increased nitrogen (N) deposition and atmospheric CO
