Sensors can be installed on the ground for detailed, local-scale observations, but in most cases, they are mounted on an airborne or orbital platform to view regions of the Earth's surface. Two of the most important characteristics describing the functionality of a sensor are resolution and energy source. For the purpose of this article, we limit our discussion to sensors having one viewing angle, and with either passive (solar illuminated) or active (e.g., laser pulses, radar) energy sources.
