<p>Imaging spectrometers (also called hyperspectral imagers) collect a continuous spectrum across a wide region of the visible and/or shortwave region, often using hundreds of spectral bands with a narrow spectral interval (≤ 10 nm). Some of the most commonly used sensors for scientific and management purposes include the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) [
