<p>Hyperspectral images from the spaceborne Hyperion sensor are less commonly used for alien species mapping, probably due to the coarse GSI (30 m) and low signal-to-noise ratio compared to airborne imaging spectrometer data [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-sensors-09-04869">64</xref>]. Nevertheless, Hyperion provides an opportunity for systematic data collection over a remote region on a stable platform (EO-1 satellite) and at much lower cost than many airborne mapping efforts. The data have been utilized to map coastal alien plants, with demonstrably satisfactory accuracies (overall accuracy â‰¥ 81%) [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-sensors-09-04869">11</xref>] compiled a time-series of Hyperion hyperspectral metrics computed and combined them with field measurements, to measure and compare the structural, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of the highly invasive 
 <italic>M. faya</italic> and common native 
 <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> tree canopies in Hawaiian montane rainforests. They found that the maximum biochemical and physiological differences were measured during hotter and drier periods, with the invader growing faster during these bioclimatically stressful times of the year.
