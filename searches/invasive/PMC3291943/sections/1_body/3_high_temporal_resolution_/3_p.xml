<p>Studies have demonstrated that it may be possible to monitor vegetation dynamics by using vegetation index time-series data derived from inexpensive, large footprint and high temporal resolution satellite data [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-sensors-09-04869">37</xref>]. A vegetation index, such as the commonly used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-sensors-09-04869">38</xref>], enhances the signal of photosynthetically active vegetation with a combination of visible and near-infrared spectral bands. Several phenological metrics such as vegetation onset time, end time, duration of growth, and rate of vegetation green-up and senescence can be derived from NDVI time-series data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-sensors-09-04869">39</xref>]. Using the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Bradley and Mustard [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-sensors-09-04869">40</xref>] showed that the greenness of the highly invasive grass 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> was amplified by rainfall, and thus it is possible to locate grass infestations areas in the Great Basin based on its unique phenological response to precipitation. Morisette 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-sensors-09-04869">41</xref>] applied a logistic regression to integrate the MODIS (the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-sensors-09-04869">42</xref>]), MODIS derived land cover [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-sensors-09-04869">43</xref>], and thousands of field points to predict the habitat suitability for non-native 
 <italic>Tamarix</italic> spp. in the conterminous USA. The model prediction indicated that, in general, the Southwest (the five most suitable states in order were Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah) was the most suitable region for these Asian trees/shrubs. Anderson 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-sensors-09-04869">44</xref>] implemented a similar approach to integrate MODIS NDVI into a niche-based model to predict the regional colonization potential of 
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic>, an Eurasia herbaceous, perennial wetland plant in Kansas, USA.
