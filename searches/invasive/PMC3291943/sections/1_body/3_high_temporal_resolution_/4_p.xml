<p>Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-sensors-09-04869">45</xref>] investigated the phenologies of semi-desert grasslands in southern Arizona across a gradient of invasions by a non-native perennial grass 
 <italic>E. lehmanniana</italic> using MODIS NDVI and its brightness bands (red and near-infrared reflectance). They found that 
 <italic>E. lehmanniana</italic> invasion altered ecosystem-level phenology in the semi-arid grasslands, which can be clearly delineated in MODIS NDVI and/or brightness time-series data using statistical analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-sensors-09-04869">Figure 1</xref>). Huang and Geiger [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-sensors-09-04869">46</xref>] also found that 
 <italic>E. lehmanniana</italic>-invaded vegetation can produce substantial amount of new tissues during the wet, cool non-growing seasons in semi-desert grasslands as long as there is a sufficient amount of solar radiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-sensors-09-04869">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, additional green vegetation signals measured by MODIS EVI during that period may indicate not only the presence but abundance (aboveground biomass) of 
 <italic>E. lehmanniana</italic>. Results indicated that there was a significantly positive relationship between remote sensing predictions and field observations, which may allow us to map 
 <italic>E. lehmanniana</italic> abundance regionally in the semi-desert grasslands.
