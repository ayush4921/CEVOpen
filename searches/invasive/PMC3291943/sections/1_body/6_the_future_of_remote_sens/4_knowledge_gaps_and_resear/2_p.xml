<p>One type of passive optical sensor is not reviewed in this article was not found in literature with respect to alien invasive species: Multi-angle remote sensing systems that can observe the Earth surface from different angles. Several sensors such as ASTER, AVHRR, MODIS and POLDER (POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) have more than one viewing angle. A sensor specifically designed for observing land surfaces and the atmosphere from different angles is NASA's Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), which can provide nine view angles in four optical channels for a targeted area, and GSIs ranging from 275 m (nadir) to 1,100 m (± 70.5°) [

This multi-angle viewing function provides a unique opportunity to study the dependence of observed reflectance on solar and sensor geometry relative to the vegetation surface (known as Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function [BRDF]). Because the reflectance distribution of vegetation is highly anisotropic, BRDF samples taken from a multi-angular sensor can be used to characterize canopy structure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87-sensors-09-04869">87</xref>]. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding whether the BRDF of canopies changes with biological invasions. For example, vine species

 <italic>Pueraria lobata</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89-sensors-09-04869">89</xref>] have had severe impacts on native forests in Pacific-Asia and in the southeastern USA, respectively. These epiphytic plants climb to the top of native trees, impeding their photosynthetic activity and further “suffocating” the trees. In the invaded ecosystems, the top layer viewed by the sensor might be transformed from tree canopies to these vine species, and thus could be measurable change in the bidirectional reflectance profile of the canopy. Further investigation is required to understand and characterize the ramifications of invasive plants on the BRDF of vegetation.
