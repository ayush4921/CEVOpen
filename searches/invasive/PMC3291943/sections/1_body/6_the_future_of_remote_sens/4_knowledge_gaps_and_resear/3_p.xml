<p>To date, the CAO system (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cao.ciw.edu" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cao.ciw.edu</ext-link>) stretches the limits of modern day optical and active remote sensing techniques. This technology allows us to “CAT scan” terrestrial environments and to diagnose the physiology of terrestrial ecosystems [

One important direction for future research would be upscaling these detailed but relatively small scale observations to larger regions via satellite data. Scaling is a method of investigating the ecological patterns and processes at different organizational levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91-sensors-09-04869">91</xref>]. An upscaling (or the bottom-up) procedure usually involves data convolution that degrades the spatial/spectral/dimensional resolutions to match coarse resolution 2-D satellite images [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92-sensors-09-04869">92</xref>]. Inevitably, a certain amount of information will be lost through the scaling process. One should know the spatial dependences of data points by computing the influential ranges [
