<p>Recent efforts attempted to forecast the future distribution of invasive plants by using modeling techniques to predict the suitable (or unsuitable) bioclimatic conditions of invaded regions that are similar (dissimilar) to their origins [

There could be signs of environmental vulnerability for invasions that are discernible in the spectral/spatial/temporal spaces of remotely sensed data, and these conditions may be utilized for early detection. Results can be validated by comparing with conditions derived from modeling approaches and/or long-term field monitoring records. Remote sensing can also facilitate improved invasive species management. Based on studies reviewed in this article, it appears that differences in the optical characteristics of native and invasive vegetation can be determined. This information may be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of control techniques to alien invasive plants over large areas. We propose the ideas here; hopefully more research can be conducted in these directions.
