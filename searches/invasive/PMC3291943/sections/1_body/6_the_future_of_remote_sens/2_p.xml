<p>Non-native plant invasions are among of the most disruptive forms of ecological change. Unlike pollution, the proliferation of alien species may not stop even after the source is controlled; unlike the effects of wildfire or logging, invaded vegetation may remain dominated by a single species for a long period of time. Our review suggests that alien plant invasions can be studied using remote sensing when the invader presents a novel structure, phenology or biochemistry relative to neighboring native vegetation. A specific set of remotely sensed data and techniques can be utilized to study each type of invasion characteristic. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-sensors-09-04869">Table 1</xref> summarizes aspects of biological invasions and the corresponding remote sensing detection strategies. This section focuses on limitations and future directions of remote sensing for alien plant invasion studies.
