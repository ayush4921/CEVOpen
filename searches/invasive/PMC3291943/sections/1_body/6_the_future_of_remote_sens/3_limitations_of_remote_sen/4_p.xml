<p>Large swath width and pixel size are unique characteristics of high temporal resolution images (e.g., AVHRR, MODIS). These sensors can frequently monitor the spread of alien plants over a broad region. However, images would capture not only the species but other components such as untargeted plants, surface soils and senescent vegetation, which would limit the ability of images for invasive plant monitoring unless one species dominates an entire system [
