<p>Although remote sensing data fusion pushes the limits of several aspects of instruments (spatial, spectral and dimensional resolutions) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74-sensors-09-04869">74</xref>], there are still a few inevitable limitations. One major issue is that, due to the nature of data collection expenses (sensors and aircraft rental, labor etc.) and the requirement of high performance computing power [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84-sensors-09-04869">84</xref>], the overall cost of this type of research is high and may not affordable for institutions. Also, the sensor integration still does not resolve some of the aforementioned issues in the hyperspectral approaches such as the narrow spatial coverage. Limitations of different types of sensors for non-native plants studies are also summarized in
