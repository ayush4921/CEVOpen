<p>Drake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-sensors-09-04869">78</xref>] found that even with the finest spatial resolution aerial videography (GSI &lt; 10 cm), it was still a challenge to discern plants at the species level. In addition, phenological changes of vegetation due to the presence of non-native species might not be recognizable if there is no distinct flowering pattern because of the coarse spectral resolution of high spatial resolution images. Visual inspection and photo-interpretation are labor and time intensive, and the quality of the results may be highly dependent upon the skills and experience of the interpreter [
