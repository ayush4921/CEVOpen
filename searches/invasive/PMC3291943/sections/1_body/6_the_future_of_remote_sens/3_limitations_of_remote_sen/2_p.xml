<p>As we mentioned earlier, spatial and spectral information provided by moderate spatial and spectral resolution satellite images is insufficient to decipher the complexity of natural environment and further delineate the distribution of alien plants. Although high spatial resolution remote sensing has been proven to be a valid method to map these plants, there are still several drawbacks to these approaches. Aerial photography is one of the most commonly used techniques to map the spatial distribution of alien plants, which involves aircraft scheduling. This would limit the flexibility of data collection. Although this issue can be resolved by utilizing spaceborne high spatial remote sensing, the presence of many non-native species (mainly herbaceous plants) is not discernable even using the newest high spatial resolution sensor GeoEye-1 (GeoEye, Dulles, Virginia, USA), which provides the finest images (panchromatic sensor GSI = 0.41 m; multi-spectral sensor GSI = 1.65 m) from space.</p>
