<p>Data patterns in hyperspectral images can be quite complicated and hard to unravel. In many cases, data reduction techniques are required for generalization and usually involve sophisticated algorithms that “mine” for invasive species signals in the high-dimensional spectral space [e.g., 58]. However, positive empirical results do not necessarily link to clearly identifiable chemical or physiological properties of the plants, which can restrict the use of the techniques to other regions and ecosystems. A spectrometer is usually flown onboard aircraft. Therefore, the swath width of a hyperspectral image is usually narrow, which limits its ability for large-scale invasive plant mapping. Also, scheduling of aircraft and related regulations for different countries could make the data acquisition inflexible. In addition, the robustness of utilizing hyperspectral data to distinguish species types is still uncertain due to the high similarity and variation of spectral signatures among them [82, but see 83].</p>
