<p>LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is an optical remote sensing technology (900-1,064 nm for terrestrial applications) measuring the distance between the sensor and a target surface, obtained by determining the elapsed time between the emission of a short duration laser pulse and the arrival of the reflection of that pulse at the LiDAR receiver [

LiDAR itself is not an efficient method for detecting alien plants because there may not be discernible differences in structure between alien and native canopies; however, LiDAR can be used to monitor the progress of invasion if it is a nearly pure stand [
