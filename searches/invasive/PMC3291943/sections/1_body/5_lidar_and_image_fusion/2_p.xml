<p>Researchers increasingly acquire land surface information by fusing remotely sensed data obtained from two or more sensors, each with different strengths. For example, Walsh 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-sensors-09-04869">67</xref>] combined information derived from spaceborne high spatial resolution QuickBird and hyperspectral Hyperion using image classification, object-based image analysis (for QuickBird) or SMA (for Hyperion) to map tropical American guava (
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>; also called common guava) on Isabela Island in the Galapagos archipelago.
