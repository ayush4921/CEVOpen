<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer that our graphs do not properly show the differences we claim in our text. Thus, we changed our Fig 1: panel A has been moved to the text (L167-168), panel B is now the main figure, and panel C has been moved to S5 table. Furthermore, we integrated our discussion to reflect your comments (L200-203 and L217-218).</p>
