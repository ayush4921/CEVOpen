<p>Although this study’s methodology was well thought-out and executed rigorously, I am not sure that all of the authors’ claims are robustly supported. In the Discussion, the authors explain the limitations and caveats of this study very well. For example, the five studies are mostly about plants, and mostly concern soil microbiomes. Therefore, although I am not refuting the results themselves, I think that some of the conclusions that the authors draw are overly broad. In some places, their claims are well-qualified (line 23: “Our findings suggest that non-native species are responsible…”; line 232: “Without sufficient diversity of sample environments, it is impossible to tell…”), but others seem to overreach. The first line of the Discussion (line 117: “We show biological invasions decrease the diversity of environmental microbiomes.”) feels too broad to me. Although the results did indeed show a decrease in diversity, I think this sentence would benefit from a clause acknowledging that the environmental sampling is limited and biased. The rest of the Discussion does exactly this—pointing out all the ways this sample is biased (soils, invasive plants, northern hemisphere, summer)—so it seems odd to me that this claim is so broad. Alongside these caveats, the Discussion also excellently highlights the overall knowledge gap revealed by this meta-analysis.</p>
