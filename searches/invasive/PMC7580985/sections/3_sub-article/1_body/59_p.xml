<p>This study is a meta-analysis of previously published metabarcoding data that compares environmental microbiomes in invaded and uninvaded sites in order to investigate the impacts of invasive species on microbiome diversity and community composition. Individual studies have had inconsistent results, and this is the first study that attempts to quantitatively draw broad patterns in this way. After filtering to control for quality and methodology, the authors were left with only five studies in their analysis. Their data showed an overall significant effect of invasive species on microbiomes: Shannon diversity decreased, and community composition shifted in taxa-specific ways at the family level.</p>
