<p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript with a compelling question. However, given the dearth of compatible studies in the final meta-analysis, I think that this manuscript raises many more questions than it answers—this manuscript’s strength is in its ‘call to arms’ for more research rather than in the results themselves.</p>
