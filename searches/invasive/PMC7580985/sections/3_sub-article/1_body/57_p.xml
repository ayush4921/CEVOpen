<p>Reviewer #2: This paper is not a meta-analysis. It is an analysis of combined data from five studies, but meta-analysis procedures were not used. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the microbial data methods and analysis in this paper because it is beyond my area of expertise, but for reasons outlined below, I do feel the paper would be better framed as a review + additional analysis, rather than a meta-analysis (which it is not). And the conclusions need to be tempered and put in a greater context. The paper makes broad statements such as, “We show biological invasions decrease the diversity of environmental microbiomes,” which I do not feel are at all justified by the analyses. First, the study includes data from only five papers, three on plants (affecting soil), one on a mammal (affecting soil), and one on an aquatic snail (affecting water). This data set is far too small and disparate to use for sweeping generalizations. Second, it is not at all clear that the results support the statements. For example, a quick look at Figures 2A and 2C would indicate that there are absolutely no differences in either diversity or abundance between control and invaded sites, yet statistical analyses report differences. This makes me question the statistical models used. For example, the mixed model assessing diversity using environment as a random effect is inappropriate because you need more levels (at least 5) for an effect to be random. The unbalanced groups (3 plant, 1 mammal and 1 aquatic snail) could also cause model problems. At the very least, the model diagnostics need to be discussed to show that the model was appropriate. Finally, I think more needs to be known about individual studies to make any firm conclusions. For example, in study [28] natives were planted in polycultures of up to 7 species and non-natives were planted in monocultures. Does the difference in microbial diversity in such a study represent a realistic shift caused by an invader, or is it a reflection of the experimental design? I think more generalizations could be made if each of the five studies were discussed in some detail and the results put in first a specific context, and then if patters support it, into a more general context.</p>
