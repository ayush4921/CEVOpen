<p>Comment #1 - This paper is not a meta-analysis. It is an analysis of combined data from five studies, but meta-analysis procedures were not used. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the microbial data methods and analysis in this paper because it is beyond my area of expertise, but for reasons outlined below, I do feel the paper would be better framed as a review + additional analysis, rather than a meta-analysis (which it is not). </p>
