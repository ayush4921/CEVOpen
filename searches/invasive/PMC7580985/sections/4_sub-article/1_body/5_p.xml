<p>Answer: Thank you! Yes, we agree that our analysis would benefit from a higher number of studies. In principle, a meta-analysis is defined as “the statistical combination of results from two or more separate studies” . Also, looking at the published literature (references 37-49 in our study), previous meta-analyses focused on a wide range of studies spanning from 2 (Bisanz et al.) to 30 (Duvallet et al.), with several of them in the range between 2 and 9 (Bisanz et al, Walters et al, Krych et al., Jiao et al., Wirbel et al., Rocca et al.). In addition, we took several steps to guarantee that data analysis would consider the heterogeneity between studies into account. Therefore, we believe that the number of studies and the approach we took guarantee a low bias in our results. We acknowledge these limitations in our discussions (L199-201, clean copy).</p>
