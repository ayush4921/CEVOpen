<p>Comment #5 - Second, it is not at all clear that the results support the statements. For example, a quick look at Figures 2A and 2C would indicate that there are absolutely no differences in either diversity or abundance between control and invaded sites, yet statistical analyses report differences. This makes me question the statistical models used. For example, the mixed model assessing diversity using environment as a random effect is inappropriate because you need more levels (at least 5) for an effect to be random. The unbalanced groups (3 plant, 1 mammal and 1 aquatic snail) could also cause model problems. At the very least, the model diagnostics need to be discussed to show that the model was appropriate. </p>
