<p>Comment #1 - I believe this manuscript addresses an important question, and that the authors have done what they can with very limited numbers of studies available for analysis. I am left wondering if 5 published studies is an adequate sample number, particularly considering that 2 are from very different systems to the other three, to draw broad conclusions. The work seems very preliminary based on such a small sample size.</p>
