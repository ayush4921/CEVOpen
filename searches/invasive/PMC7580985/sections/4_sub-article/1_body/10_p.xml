<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for this comment; however, we respectfully disagree with their point of view. A meta-analysis is defined as “the statistical combination of results from two or more separate studies”1. The NIH NCI defines the meta-analysis as “A process that analyzes data from different studies done about the same subject …” . Most of the published literature that used our approach define their analysis as “meta-analysis” (refs 37-49 in our paper). We acknowledge that using data for single points , rather than aggregated data, is quite unusual. Literature is rich of examples where a meta-analytical approach has been used on individual “samples” . Therefore, we believe that meta-analysis is the most appropriate term to use in our case.</p>
