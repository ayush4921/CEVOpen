<p>Comment #6 - Finally, I think more needs to be known about individual studies to make any firm conclusions. For example, in study [28] natives were planted in polycultures of up to 7 species and non-natives were planted in monocultures. Does the difference in microbial diversity in such a study represent a realistic shift caused by an invader, or is it a reflection of the experimental design? I think more generalizations could be made if each of the five studies were discussed in some detail and the results put in first a specific context, and then if patters support it, into a more general context.</p>
