<p>Our search yielded 5 studies with an appropriate experimental design and available data, for a total of 356 samples. A few samples failed quality checks and we further considered 335 samples for downstream analyses. Sequences clustered into 22831 OTUs, after quality checks, removal of singletons and “chloroplast” reads, with an average of 61776.92 reads per sample. This high OTU count is likely a result of increased richness from analyzing samples across multiple environments (soil and water) and from different geographical regions.</p>
