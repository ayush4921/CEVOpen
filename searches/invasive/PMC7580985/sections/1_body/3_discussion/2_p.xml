<p>Indeed, our report of changes in community composition was relatively consistent with the published literature and the individual results of the studies we analyzed. Most studies of the influence of biological invasions on environmental microbiomes found that biological invasions alter environmental microbial community composition. However, some previous reports did not report changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], including the study by Gibbons et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] considered in our analysis. This variation may be due to individual effects of organisms on the environment. For example, invasive plants may alter soil microbiome composition through root exudates [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and invasive mussels may alter water microbiome composition via bacterial removal through their feeding activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, reported influences on community composition are more consistent. Alternatively, changes in community composition might be due to the response of some bacterial groups to environmental disturbance. The bacterial families that we found to be differentially abundant between the invaded and control environments have diverse ecological functions ranging from nitrogen fixation and carbohydrate metabolism to antimicrobial properties. Although the differences in relative abundance we found might be relatively small, they can have an important impact on the functions of the environmental microbiome [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Many of the families that showed a significant difference in abundance between invaded and control environments include taxa that play important roles at various points during nitrogen and carbon cycling (i.e. Nitrosomonadaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Chitinophagaceae, Micromonosporaceae, Gemmataceae, Beijerinckiaceae, Pirellulaceae) [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, nitrogen-fixing and carbohydrate-degrading bacteria did not have a unified response to invaded environments as some increased and others decreased in abundance in invaded environments. Many nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been shown to respond to environmental disturbance, such as Acidobacteria abundances during forest to pasture conversions or Pirellulaceae’s response to the presence of microplastics [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Thus, changes in environmental microbiome community composition appear to be linked to changes in ecosystem functions, although this pattern is not yet predictable across functions and taxa.
