<p>Meta-analyses are also useful to highlight gaps in the literature, and here we highlight some aspects that warrant further investigation. First, we identified a large gap in the availability of sequencing data from multiple types of environments and types of invasive species. For our analysis almost all available data came from two environments: four sets of data came from soil and one came from freshwater. Greater effort is needed for sample collection from invasions in both freshwater and marine environments. Without sufficient diversity of sample environments, it is impossible to tell whether microbial shifts following an invasion are unique to an invaded environment. Second, in our analysis the majority of data came from one type of invasive species: plants. Noticeably absent from our dataset were invasions by insects, fish, and amphibians. Sequencing data is needed from a larger number of invasive species to allow us to broadly assess shifts in microbial community structure. A third gap we identified was the lack of spatial and temporal resolution. Almost all of the initially identified 22 studies we assessed were also restricted to one season of sampling and were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, it is infeasible with existing datasets to validate the influence of latitude or explore how seasonality and biological invasions interact to modulate microbial communities. Thus, there are a number of opportunities for future research on how biological invasions alter environmental microbial communities.</p>
