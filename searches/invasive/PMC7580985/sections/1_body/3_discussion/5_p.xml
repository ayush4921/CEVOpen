<p>Here we analyzed 16S amplicon sequencing data from five studies and show that biological invasions influence both the diversity and the structure of environmental microbiomes. Understanding the impact of biological invasions on environmental microbiomes is of high priority to preserve ecosystem functions [

We identified a number of gaps in our knowledge, including the need to assess a wider range of environments, invasive species, temporal variation, and latitudinal variation. We also demonstrate the power of re-analysis of publicly available datasets using a common pipeline which benefited from open-data initiatives.
